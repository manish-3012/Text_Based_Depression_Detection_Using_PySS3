I donâ€™t even know what to sayFor about 2/3 years Iâ€™ve been training to try to get into the marines because I thought if I died as a soldier at least Iâ€™d have an honorable death and people wouldnâ€™t turn me into some sob story and Iâ€™d have some integrity even after death but over the past months I canâ€™t even look my girlfriend in the eyes or give her a real hug even though my feelings are the same as they where years ago and I feel less and less like myself every day to the point I ignore mirrors and my camera just so I donâ€™t have to see how different I am I have lost all my friends and my girlfriends the only one I can talk to because my parents and I have a horrible relationship and me and my sisters relationship have gotten worse and worse but the point of all this is I donâ€™t think I can Weight till I ship out and Iâ€™m not sure what to do and the loneliness get worse and worse every day and I feel like Iâ€™m running out of time I donâ€™t know what to say or who to talk to please anything any advice anything please
