what is safe to say to a therapist while avoiding any kind of 5150iâ€™m in california and i have been in and out of therapy my whole life. over the past year iâ€™ve gotten more depressed and within the last few months i cut myself a few times. then on sunday i had a real fit and put several gashes in my hip. iâ€™m becoming very unstable and i canâ€™t stop thinking about how much i hate myself and my life. i have no motivation to do or complete anything because i feel like a failure at my core. i also have a complicated relationship with my partner whom i live with. i want to be better for our relationship and for me to be able to survive in general. 

i guess i just want to know what things i should avoid out right saying to a therapist so i can avoid any kind of hospitalization. i have never been 100% honest in therapy because of this very fear. but i need some professional help. i just honestly donâ€™t know what to ever say. i canâ€™t say i think about dying or iâ€™ve cut myself right? that makes me a danger to myself iâ€™m fairly sure. 

any guidance would mean a lot. i do want to get better. i just need to want to do what it takes.
