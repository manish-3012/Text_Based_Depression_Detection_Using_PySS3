I just want the thoughts to end.I have had sucidal thoughts since I was about nine and I'm 32 now. I have been in the hospital twice in my life for attempts. I have taken medication that has never seemed to help. It has been awhile since I have taken any meds. Since i have stopped with the meds I have been able to hold the thoughts at bay for the last five years or so. All the meds did was cloud my entire head. I couldn't think straight and the stuff I should know would take me forever to recall.  The suicidal thought were still around even on the  meds. I have so much anger and hatred built up. I have no idea were it all comes from. I feel lost and alone. I have no pride or dignity. I don't know what to do. I always think of what my actions would be like on my mom and that helped, but now I just don't care. If i had to pick a way it would be carbon monoxide poisoning. This is how far my thoughts have been getting as of late. The first time was with a gun. My moms boyfriend at the time caught me before I fired and put a stop to it. the second time was with pills. I just don't know what to do. I am not sure if I am crying for help or if I want to finish what I started years ago. Please someone, could you help me figure out what is wrong with me? I'm tired from the battle. I just want to get these thought to stop. Sorry if this is too jumbled to understand. Please I need help.
