How to help a long-distance suicidal friend?I have a friend who lives about 1000 miles away from me. I don't have her exact address, but she has talked about suicide for about a year now but it seems as if she has a plan and is getting ready to actually do it. 

She has seen therapists with no results and gets angry when I tell her to call the suicide prevention hotline. I don't know her exact timeline but she has told me that she has been saying her goodbyes so it seems as if it's going to be soon. 

We communicate over text and email, so I don't really have a way to get her location but I need to help, or at least know that I did everything I could. 

Any advice? I know things have been difficult for her lately and I've always done my best to give her my support. But I'm out of ideas on what to do now.
