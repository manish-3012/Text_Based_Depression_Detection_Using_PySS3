I'm going to commit suicide on my 24th birthdayI'm 23 and already wasted my youth. I never had any friends, I never was able to get a girlfriend, I never enjoyed my highschool career. I always look back at my past in regret. I never had a chance from the beginning. I am ugly as shit, I have a receding chin, no jawline, asymmetrical eyes,Â skinnyfat, I'm failing all my classes, and I have a very small penis. Any time I would get extremely lucky and pick up a girl at the club/bar for sex, it has immediately stopped after I show them my dick. Maybe if I was attractive it wouldn't be a problem.Â I've alwaysÂ beenÂ lookedÂ down upon.Â Nobody has ever shown me any type of love or even compassion. And any time I open up, I always get the same "cheer up, it'll get better!" Even though it never has.


I've been thinking about all the things I will never get a chance to see. All the movies, games, events, and books I'll never see.

And well, romance, sex, relationships? I guess it just wasn't ment to be for me. I will die an "incel" as reddit likes to call people like me.Â
