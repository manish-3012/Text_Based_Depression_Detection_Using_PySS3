How should I talk to someone who is suicidal?I was just thinking about if I had a friend that was suicidal how would I talk to them? Should I try to relate my experiences and try to convince them that I know how they feel? I feel like a negative side of this would be "watering down" the situation and their emotions. The other approach I can think of is telling them how "I can't even imagine the pain you are in" to let them let it all out and for me to comfort them, but I feel that a negative side of this would be that they get even more emotional and dramatic and  the situation gets worse. Can anyone explain to me what my role is when trying to assist someone in this predicament?
