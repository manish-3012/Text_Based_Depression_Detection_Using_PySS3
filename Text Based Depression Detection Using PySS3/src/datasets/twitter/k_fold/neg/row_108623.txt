So done Iâ€™m only 20. I have read many of the posts on this site. So many people describe struggling for years and humiliation.
I canâ€™t do it. I will end it early. I know I have nothing ahead but decades of horror and sadness, not a life at all. I keep a facade on. I donâ€™t have the strength to go through years of what people her describe, I just donâ€™t have it in me. The thought of the future gives me a pit of anxiety in my stomach. Horrible. I canâ€™t do it. Itâ€™s too hard. I have nothing good in front of me.
   I know my solution is permanent. But it makes me relieved that all the things that cause me so much pain and anxiety will be over. I will get the peace I need. 
  I know my family will hurt. Theyâ€™ll get over it. I know God will help them.  I rather they donâ€™t see me in pain for years. Itâ€™s okay. I have loved and been loved, thatâ€™s more than a lot of people here had. Iâ€™m at peace. I had a good run but it didnâ€™t work out
