I feel like I wasnâ€™t built/made for life if that makes sense.I was born into so so many disadvantages (unstable family, born w mental illness, body likes to not function, poor, etc.) and I feel like if we were in the wild I wouldâ€™ve died long ago. My birth was a mistake and I feel anyone in my position would want to die. I feel like I was born to die because of how terrible my genetics are. Anyone else relate lol
