My usefulness has ended.I'm doing nothing to benefit the human race or the planet earth, not even close friends of mine. I'm the one that is easily forgotten. When people do talk to me I just act like an asshole to keep them from getting too close. I don't care anymore what the future will bring; I just want to end this existence now. I can't make a positive impact on anyone else's life at this point.
