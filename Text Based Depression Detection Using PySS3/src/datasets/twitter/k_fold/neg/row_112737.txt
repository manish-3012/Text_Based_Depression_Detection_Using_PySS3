If I die my parents donâ€™t have to pay my student loansI know it will bother them but I think they are more worried about the financial burden. Iâ€™m on medical leave from university because of depression getting to that point so I have a shit ton of loans and no degree and I donâ€™t even want to have a life itâ€™s all so exhausting I will never have a family or a normal life Iâ€™m a fucking burden. I donâ€™t want any of this I tried to hold out for things getting better or somehow feeling better Iâ€™ve switched medications so many times idk what to do. When I think of how hard it might be on them I think It would be more like ripping off a bandaid.
