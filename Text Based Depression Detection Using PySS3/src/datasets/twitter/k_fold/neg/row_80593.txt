I think i'm going to off myself. I have been going through a rough patch for a while.I am 25 years old, live with my parents (Legal guardians [both mom and dad are dead] - they don't want me anymore), have a GED, a job that pays very little, all my social bridges have burned down for one reason or another, I've been constantly rejected when trying to find a roommate for the past 3 years (all mind you by good friends which we had prior plans), I'm over weight, I have an onslaught of embarrassing health issues, I'm becoming bitter, I have no money, I have no pride, my car is fucked up because some guy backed into it. I failed college, I failed high school, I was in ESE classes during middle school, I can't function without my vyvance medication, and I constantly have panic attacks.  To top all that off, I think my job is about to fire me. 

I am an utterly useless grown adult man who on the verge of crying. None of this is cool, every time I try to fix it, something snaps back in my face. Its always one step forward 1 mile back. I just want to alleviate this feeling.
