?I feel trapped. 
I'm almost 15 and I've been suicidal ever since I remember. I was recently diagnosed with sensoneural hearing loss ( not sure if it's spelt right) and my parents have since bought me hearing aids. Insurance doesn't cover them, so they had to pay at least 5k out of pocket. 
They aren't rich so this was a huge expense for them.     If I kill myself, all of that money would be basically thrown down the drain, but I don't want to suffer in silence anymore.
