I want to die, please dont read if you feel sucidal.I hate myself and I have since as long as I can remember. I've never been truly happy. I've tried to kill myself so many times, but apparently I'm not even good at that. I'm only here for my family, I don't want to hurt them. Yet I crave death so badly, at some point I know I will give up and die. Atleast in death I wont have to feel guilt for causing so much pain in my life. Then I can finally be in peace.
