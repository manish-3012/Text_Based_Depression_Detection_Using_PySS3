If today were my last day, I couldn't make something happen that would *make* me want to go onIf I were planning to CTB tomorrow (I'm not, don't worry) and had an entire day, or even week, to do something incredibly risky to make my life worth living, it wouldn't happen.  

&amp;nbsp;

Examples:

&amp;nbsp;

- On my last day, I could take my remaining savings and sink it as a huge trade on a penny stock. Nope, wouldn't work. (Dabbled in day trading before and had to quit b/c i was always losing)

&amp;nbsp;

- Could attempt to speak to every single person I've known in my life to ignite friendship, or say something that would hopefully have a touching impact.  This wouldn't work either, because I've never been able to make friends, and the times I did try to reach out to a few select people in my past, they either ignored my attempt or their interest was extremely muted.  I've also been unable to ever tell anyone how I really feel even if it is extremely positive because I get the sense that people are scared of me and don't want to get involved in any way. 

&amp;nbsp;

- Could give to the homeless.  Sure, I could (and do on occasion).  They can always use a stranger's help.  But I can be assured that nothing would come out of it that'd make me want to continue living, even though I'd be glad I helped a little.  

&amp;nbsp;

- Could call some media outlet and speak for a certain cause or simply to vent how I feel about certain things that are going on in this world (suppression of information from some big businesses who don't care about the health of their consumers) and hope that it gets published.  Fat chance of that happening. Money is more important than health nowadays. And I've noticed that the only health risks that get certain media attention are **after** there has been a slew of deaths in which use of the product can directly be proven as the cause. 

&amp;nbsp;

- Could stand in the middle of a busy downtown park and scream about certain injustices that are happening in this world. No, I'd just get locked up in a mental ward.  Greed and corruption to continue unsilenced, with any one person lacking the clout to stop it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Nothing I do on my last day here on this earth would help me feel connected to another human being. I'd be the laughingstock, the circus freak, or at best mildly understood and then forgotten.

&amp;nbsp;

It may seem like I'm naysaying any positive impact I could have on this world, but my efforts have been largely unsuccessful due to my inability to connect with others and people consequently misreading my motives. (It sucks to be Autistic)

&amp;nbsp;

There is one person left on this planet who cares, so that is why I'm still here. Can't speak for anyone else...
