I'm tired of living, I'm all alone in this and I'm just sick of it! No one is listening!I'm 22 years old and I'm tired of living, I'm tired of seeing people all around me being happy and successful while I'm just sitting around waiting to die. I'm just a sad, shy and awkward man who deserves no one's respect, I'm not the talented person people made me out to me, I just a wreck who deserves to die and no one will remember me. 

I've suffered from depression for too long now, I've just a shy and awkward asshole since I was 12 and my friendships have been nothing special and I've never had a girlfriend because nobody loves me, only my family has shown love to me, but they are told too. 

I'm just tired of trying! I've always wanted to live longer just so I can live my dreams, but now it's hopeless and they are never going to happen, if I don't get to my dreams, I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do with my life, all I do is laze about at home and do nothing but cry.

I'm just useless waste of space and I just wish I could die right now, by hanging, getting shot, getting run over by a car or truck, I don't care, I just want to die! 

If you want to talk, be my guest, I don't know how much you are going to convince me that I'm worth it.
