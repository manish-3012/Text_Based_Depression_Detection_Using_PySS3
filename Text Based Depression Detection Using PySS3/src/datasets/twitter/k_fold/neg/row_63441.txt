I have nothing, no metric of my life is worth staying for except my stupid catAnything I can compartmentalize as a 'area' of my life is terrible. I have no partner, no interests, no friends. I hate my job and I'm terrible at it and I don't even know if I'll have a job to go back to so I'm broke and can't find a new job in my field. My car needs work and I have no money my apartment feels like a prison and I might lose it soon anyway. I have no one I care about and no one cares about me. I spend every minute in crushing loneliness and failure and I don't see any way out. I don't even have anyone to give me a hug or a text message when I'm at my worst. I haven't spoken to another person face to face in two weeks. 

I literally have nothing and it's only getting worse. Day by day.

I keep thinking about where I could find some heroin or fentanyl. A lot of it. I've never done either, I guess that means it would take less.

But I love my fucking cat and I don't have anyone I could trust to take him so I have to wake up every fucking day to a life I hate so that I know he's happy.
