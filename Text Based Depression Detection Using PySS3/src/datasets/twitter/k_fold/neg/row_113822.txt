This started off as a suicide note.Today I all but told a room full of people that I am suicidal and deeply depressed. I didnâ€™t directly say those words, of course, but I came so close to it that I know without the shadow of a doubt that everyone in there heard exactly what I really meant. Afterwards, no one approached me. No one reached out. No one said a single kind thing to me. I can honestly say that I wasnâ€™t seeking attention or crying out for help, as unlikely as Iâ€™m sure that sounds. I really just needed to talk about the ideas on my mind, and Iâ€™m happy to say that I did get that. Itâ€™s justâ€¦ even though I would have rejected any help offered to me, and brushed off any small kindnesses I knew were offered out of guilt or pity, I would have appreciated it in a way. They might have kept me afloat a little longer by showing that I was cared about. Maybe Iâ€™d still be unloved, and maybe Iâ€™d still be alone, but I maybe wouldnâ€™t have felt that I was unworthy of even a minimal effort like smiling. It hurt, even if it wasnâ€™t my intention. I donâ€™t know. It shouldnâ€™t have mattered, but it cut deep. 

Iâ€™d like to think that, had I been in their situation, I would have acted differently. I might not have offered to save them -- though I might have, depending on the person -- but I would have done something to make their lives a tiny bit better. I try to smile a lot at people who I know are hurting, to give them books and cookies and kindness. I hate my smile, but I smile anyway, just in case it means as much to them as it would to me. 

I donâ€™t want anyone to play savior or therapist or whatever. Thatâ€™s not how the world works, and I know it. Iâ€™m not the kind of person who wants to depend on others. What I do want is empathy, and Iâ€™m not getting it. Thatâ€™s not new to me, but I havenâ€™t quite become numbed to it yet. Iâ€™m secretly full of hope, and thatâ€™s what really kills me more than anything else. 

I sometimes want to run away from my entire life. It feels like a compromise between suicide and remaining in this cage -- leaving my life, but not leaving life altogether, you know? Iâ€™ve seriously considered it, at times. What do I have holding me here? Realistically speaking, itâ€™s housing, stability, money, transportation, and school, but itâ€™s hard to care about those kinds of things where youâ€™re as desperate for an escape as I am. I constantly think of going away somewhere beautiful, quiet, and cold, usually either Norway or Iceland. I want to live a peaceful existence independent from the outside world. I want to watch the aurora borealis before I die. I want to find contentment somewhere far away from here. Of course, I canâ€™t speak Norwegian or Icelandic, and even if I did, I donâ€™t know that I could really take care of myself -- I mean, look how sick and young I am. Itâ€™s a nice fantasy, though. When you donâ€™t have any real aspirations or things to look forward to, itâ€™s easier to let yourself look towards unattainable dreams than to not have any at all. 

At the end of the day, though, I canâ€™t get by on pretending alone. I feel like Iâ€™m slowly breaking. I have been since I was seven years old. I can barely remember anything else. My life is intensely painful. I donâ€™t see why I should continue living it, when the vast majority of my life has been full of sadness and hurt. It isnâ€™t worthwhile, at this point. I love my sister more than anything, and I love my best friend, and my cat, but that can only carry me along so far. I canâ€™t live my life entirely for the sake of a small number of people who will never care quite as much as I do. Their pain at my death breaks my heart to think about, but I donâ€™t believe that itâ€™s anywhere near equal to the way I am feeling right now. My hatred for myself outweighs any love they feel for me. Iâ€™m drowning in my depression and anxiety, and nothing is helping. My DBT skills arenâ€™t making me at all happier; theyâ€™re just helping me function slightly better, which is meaningless if Iâ€™m just as sad. Therapy is a bandaid solution. I feel a little better while Iâ€™m there, and I really like my therapist a lot, but I need more help than she can give me. I canâ€™t go to my family, who hate me for who I am, or my friends, who arenâ€™t that close to me, or my teachers, who simply donâ€™t care. I canâ€™t go outpatient again, because my parents wonâ€™t let me. I canâ€™t go inpatient, because Iâ€™m transgender. Either way, I canâ€™t afford to miss school this close to graduation. I canâ€™t do this much longer. Iâ€™m lost, and I donâ€™t know where else I can go or what else I can do before the only other solution is death. 

I feel that my life is pointless. I feel that life in general is pointless. Everything that we do is fundamentally meaningless and repetitive. I suppose that is an existential crisis. Thatâ€™s the last thing I need. on top of my depression, but thatâ€™s kind of how my life tends to go. Whatever it is, itâ€™s taking a toll on me. Iâ€™m tired of living. Nothing is exciting. Nothing is new. Nothing is fun. Nothing takes my mind off of my depression anymore. I can hardly get up and make myself presentable every day, but when I do, the difference between crying in bed, going to school, and going out with friends feels nonexistent. It hardly makes a difference to me at all. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever felt that way before in nearly eleven years of depression. 

I'm not going to kill myself tonight, even though this started off as a suicide note. I'm just so afraid of irreparably hurting my little sister that I can't so it. I can't promise that I won't ever kill myself, though, or that it won't be soon. I've been seriously thinking of overdosing on a combination of anxiety medication, migraine medicines, and an antidepressant. I feel like I'm nearing a breaking point. I'm six days clean of self harm, but I feel like I might relapse again tonight. I'm considering getting high on gabapentin so that I won't be a danger to myself. I just don't know what to do. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow, but I can't even be honest with my therapist about exactly how bad I am because I'm scared of forced hospitalization (which, again, is a huge problem because of my gender).
