Not in control of my bodyI couldnâ€™t motivate myself to drink something for maybe 1 or 2 days now. My hands are shaking so much, I canâ€™t hold things properly anymore. Maybe I will just dehydrate myself until I die. I canâ€™t think straight anymore. Iâ€™m actually really close to killing myself rn. Didnâ€™t think the day would come Iâ€™m actually not a coward and would pull through. I have my pocket knife laying next to me. There are so many possible choices
