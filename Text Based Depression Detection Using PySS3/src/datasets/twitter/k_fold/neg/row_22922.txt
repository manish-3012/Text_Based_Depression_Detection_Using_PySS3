It's overI was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease around a year ago (if my faulty memory is serving me right). At the grand old age of 30. I lost my job because I kept forgetting everything. I lost my car, my insurance and everything of value because I couldn't support myself. I keep wandering aimlessly and forgetting what I need to do or have to do. They had to call the police to find me a couple of times. Instead of being a source of income to my family I became a huge burden. Doctors said I have around 7-8 more good years with my family. There is no cure. And eventually, I'm still going to die a slow and painful death. What's the point of living at all? Why be a burden to everyone I care about? I've decided to end it today. Nobody deserves to suffer because of me and as my condition worsens, they are about to suffer even more. I think it's inevitable. I knew what I had to do a year ago when I was diagnosed and I'm finally going to do it. I remember being active on reddit once upon a time and reading posts on this sub. I don't know why but I just thought of coming over here and bidding the community a farewell. See ya on the other side and thanks for making reddit awesome.
