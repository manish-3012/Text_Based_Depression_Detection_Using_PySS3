I almost die in a car accidentI ran... I don't know why but I ran like if my live mattered to me. I barely escaped but I wasn't happy for it I don't consider myself lucky for not dying at that day. It was my eternal misfortune who saved me  just to keep me suffering I heard a police officer say that if I would've hit by that car I'd be dead by now. My dad hates me, but that day he cried like if I was somethig for him but now he's just ignoring me like always. Everyone acts so differently when you almost die, but after a day or two they forget about it and starts again. Of all of my regrets the fact that I ran that day is the most painful of all.
