I did this all for what? To feel like my life is not worth living?Fuck everything. Got rejected by another medical school. What did I spend all those years studying and getting a good GPA for? Spending thousands of dollars on applications? Countless hours dedicated to extra curriculars? It has all amounted to failure. What's the fucking point. Turn me into top soil so I can be of some use to this world. 


I have an unemployable skill set. Me and my mom are doing horribly financially and were forced to move into social housing. I can't handle all of this change and failure. I am letting those around me down too. What is the point. WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT?
