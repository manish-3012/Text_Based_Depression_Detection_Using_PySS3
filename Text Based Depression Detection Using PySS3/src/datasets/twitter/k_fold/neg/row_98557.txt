my entire life has been a liei was just talking to my mom about taking a dna test because i was curious about my racial background. i was born in russian and immigrated to the u.s when i was 6. i only know much from my momâ€™s side but none from my dadâ€™s, so i was curious. she tends to get kind of defensive about those sort of things when i ask and i know why now :(

she pulled me aside to talk to me in private. she started crying and told me that before she got pregnant with me, she took a trip to japan with some of her old classmates. she went to a karaoke bar, got really drunk and had an affair with a guy there. she came back home, and when she got pregnant with me she denied that she was for MONTHS even when she had a baby bump. 

i literally have no idea who my dad is, where he is, or if he even knows about me. does he even know i exist?

my mom showed me a picture and god i really do look like him :( i donâ€™t really have his eyes or anything so it never even came to me that there was a possibility of me being biracial. he was about 5â€™9 or 5â€™10 (i couldnâ€™t really tell he was hunched over a little bit) he had pretty strong features. we have the exact same fucking head and nostril shape itâ€™s scary. my mom showed me a picture and told me he was a pilot at an airport. my dad and older sister have always made remarks that i look nothing like anybody in my family. my sister is tall, blonde with blue eyes. iâ€™m on the shorter side, and have dark eyes and black hair.

ironically i used to always joke that my mom had an affair because i donâ€™t look like anybody in my family. knowing iâ€™m a bastard child now makes me feel really fucking weird. i was so shocked that i couldnâ€™t even cry. the reality hasnâ€™t even hit me yet. i donâ€™t know what to do. i canâ€™t tell anybody.
