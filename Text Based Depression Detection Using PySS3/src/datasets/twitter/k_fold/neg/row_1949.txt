idk m8not exactly the discouraging things commonly on this subreddit but i just wanna vent a bit lol. earlier today i felt an episode coming on as i began to struggle not dissacociating. i then started playing minecraft and felt my motivation and enjoyment decrease until i just left in the middle if the game. suddenly nothing feels appealing. i really hate how quick these kind of things come on, for example, i was just walking until i suddenly lost all motivation to much, so i just stood there.
