I'm a burden to everyone, even everyone on this sub.I'm just a burden on everyone else. My dad lost his job and now I'm just one more person to take care of, my kind of boyfriend could do so much better than me, my friends deserve someone happier and more social. I just don't understand why I'm still holding on to nothing. Everyone would be better off without me. They'd be sad at first, but in the long run they'd be so much better off. Even this sub would be better without me, because then yall wouldn't have to deal with me constantly posting and deleting my posts every few weeks.
