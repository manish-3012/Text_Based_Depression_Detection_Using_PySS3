Life gets better but the pain never doesLife is improving , slowly but it is . I thought that the pain would maybe also get better but it doesnâ€™t , itâ€™s always there .

I can go to the gym and exercise , go out with friends have a good time and laugh , study etc but right after I leave or stop what Iâ€™m doing itâ€™s back to pain and the thoughts come back , sometimes even during these events but I can hide it pretty well .

I guess In a way it gets better because when life gets better youâ€™re distracted from it . But itâ€™s not like it actually gets better or ever disappears.

The pain and thoughts are always there.
