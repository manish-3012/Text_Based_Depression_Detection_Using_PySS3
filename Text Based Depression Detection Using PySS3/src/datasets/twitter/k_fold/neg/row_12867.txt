Help pleaseSo I haven't told more than like one person. But when I was little a relative would bathe me and touch me during it or shove my head under the faucet and water and I still feel it daily. It drags me down so badly and I can't really explain what happened in detail cause it's hard for me. But I have been contemplating killing myself for a few years now and its getting worse to the point where I go days or weeks without happiness and I just feel trapped. I still feel what they did to me to this day and they frequently do it again in my dreams. I am really getting sick of it.
