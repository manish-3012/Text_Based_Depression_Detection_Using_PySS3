Nurses making everything worseI snuck razors into the psych ward because cutting is a source of relief for me. One of the nurses talked to me last night to â€œsee how I was goingâ€ but she hardly listened and just kept talking over me like she knew better. I felt so alone, like no one was going to understand. 

So I cut my legs up in the shower, there was so much blood I nearly passed out. I wanted to keep going and going. I scare myself like that. I raced out of the shower and put my clothes on wet and shakily went to the nice night nurse that was on and asked him if I could see him. I handed in all my razors and scissors and he was so kind. He told me he wish he could take all my pain away if he could. 

Then in the morning asshole nurse was on, she gave me a pen and paper to fill out food tomorrow and said â€œI need that pen back after your little drama last nightâ€

Little drama....wow....I wish I still had those razors
