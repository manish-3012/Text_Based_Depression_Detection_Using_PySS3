I can't do this anymore..I feel terrible this morning. I had a super stressful week. I haven't been able to relax any. 

It was draining on me physically and emotionally. 

The week started out with working on my bosses paperwork. I had to organize everything. It took almost all day long. Then put in the middle of all of this, my boss is my mom and dad. My father walks in and he just stressed everyone out more, cause he looked at me and said the floor was dirty. So I had to stop in the  middle of the paperwork and clean the floor. Then when I go back to the paperwork, he has moved things around in it. 

Then my mom and dad start fighting, like they always do. I tried to talk to my dad some, but every time I did he would just walk away from me. He seems to just be focused on one thing, work. He is always waiting for that next job. I don't think I have had a single conversation with my dad in my entire life time. I'm so stressed out right now. 

I can't unwind and I can't relax. 
I just don't wanna be..
