Todayâ€™s the day!I canâ€™t take living anymore. I was suicidal, told my parents and went to a psychiatrist only for eveything to get worse. Now my dad screams at me if I donâ€™t follow his ways of making me feel better. I feel betrayed. By everyone. I have no one and I canâ€™t stand this anymore. Donâ€™t know what to do but end my life. People told me it would get better. What a lie.
