how to get euthanized at a young age?i know it's impractical and nigh impossible, especially for someone who lives in america and isn't even 20 years old, but i sometimes wish i could get euthanized, rather than leaping off a bridge or taking some pills, which aren't guaranteed to work. it just sounds nicer to do it calmly with the people you love.
