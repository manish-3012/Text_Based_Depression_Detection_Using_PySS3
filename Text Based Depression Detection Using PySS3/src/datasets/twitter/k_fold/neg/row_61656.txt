Canâ€™t find a good reason not to anymoreIâ€™m 23. Graduated college in December with a degree thatâ€™ll never get me a good job. Just started a new relationship a few weeks ago, already feel like I bore the hell out of her and sheâ€˜s often too busy to even have phone calls with me anymore. I never see anybody I consider friends because they live far away, and even when I do see them Iâ€™m too socially awkward to engage much, itâ€™s awful. I just canâ€™t find anything to keep me going at this point.
The way I see it is: my family would get over it, after time. Theyâ€™d be more concerned about the financial burden of dealing with my body than actually missing me. My friends I barely see, and I never contribute anything to conversation anyway, so itâ€™s already like Iâ€™m not there. And my girlfriend canâ€™t even have time to call me once a week, so if I die itâ€™ll be like nothing changed anyway.

The literal only reason I havenâ€™t gone through with it so far is because Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll mess up and end up in a vegetative state, or paralyzed, or permanently maimed. Even that isnâ€™t as scary as it used to be. I just canâ€™t find one legitimate reason not to anymore. My family is out of town for the weekend and if there were ever a time for it, itâ€™s now. Iâ€™m just broken and defeated. 

Even me posting this I feel like a selfish asshole because there are people in much more dire need of help and attention than me here.
