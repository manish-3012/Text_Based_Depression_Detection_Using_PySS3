when i'm gone, i wish there was someone else who looked and acted exactly me who could continuing living my lifei have a freaking privileged life in a first world country. sometimes i imagine after i've killed myself watching another person just like me, a clone, carrying on living my life so that people around me wouldn't notice that i was gone and they can get the life opportunities that i threw away.
