I was told that I should probably come here and vent about my suicidal thoughtsI hope I donâ€™t break any sub rules. 

I have attempted before because I felt like a waste of space and that nobody cared about me.  I have nobody in my life that cares.  Nobody in my life that notices me.  Sees me.  Knows me.  The last friend I had was 10 months ago and they didnâ€™t even care.  My family doesnâ€™t care and think Iâ€™m faking it, even tho Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with several mental disorders and have attempted before.  Iâ€™ve been to therapists and psychiatrists and group therapies but I still feel like Iâ€™m worthless.  I struggle with finding the will to stay.  I donâ€™t want to die rn, but Iâ€™m just watching the days go by, of me feeling empty and worthless.  I try to help others with their thoughts but my advice falls flat now because my own thoughts have taken a permanent toll on me.  Most of my attempts happened because I was scared of my abusive ex and nobody would take my concerns about him seriously.  I felt alone in my pain so I just did it.  I havenâ€™t had contact with him in months but Iâ€™m afraid if he reaches out to me or somehow talks to me again, that Iâ€™ll relapse.
