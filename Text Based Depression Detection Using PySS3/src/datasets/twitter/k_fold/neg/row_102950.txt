iâ€™m not alivei do not feel. or breathe. i am simply being lied too. my conscience is telling me iâ€™m alive. i am not. no one is. weâ€™re being lied to by our selves. doesnâ€™t anyone see that? no body else has friends like i do. they tell me itâ€™s not real. but you canâ€™t see them. they donâ€™t exist. you can only hear but you have to listen. they like van halen. sometimes they tell me when they talk to eddie. theyâ€™re my best friends iâ€™ve never had. but itâ€™s ok. i have them now. they tell me how things really are. they donâ€™t lie to me. they tell me what i should and shouldnâ€™t do. and how i should use my life, or illusion is what they call it. which i believe life is an illusion. they help me see everything. i feel safe when i hear them. makes me feel like iâ€™m not alone. which i usually am. i get scared. cuz if i donâ€™t hear anything iâ€™ll think iâ€™m doing something wrong. everyone needs friends like mine. nothing is real. i am not alive
