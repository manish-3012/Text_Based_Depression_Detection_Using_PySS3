I wanna dieI'm so shitty, I feel shitty all the time, I constantly make other people feel shitty because they somehow can't fix my fucked up mentality. All I do is take and take and take and never give back, I'm impossible and yet people still have to put up with me all the fucking time. The one unselfish thing I can do is make sure they never have to deal with my stupid ugly horrid toxic ass ever again but even now at my worst point I can't bring myself to go through the process of ending it all. I'm a bitch to pain, I wish there was just a button I could push that would make me go poof and I didn't have to be here anymore in this shitty fucking world that only seems to hurt. AAAAAAAAaaaaaa, God I don't wanna feel like this but I know the only true way out is to stop breathing. Medication, time, therapy, they all only work for so long until I'm back to this horrid mindset where my brain craves seratonin so bad because it cannot fucking function on it's own. I'm a broken fucked up mess that no one deserves to put up with, and I've resorted to yelling at the internet in hopes of what?? Who knows. Fuck. I hate this. I hate myself.
