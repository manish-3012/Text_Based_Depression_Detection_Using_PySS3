I hate feeling like this!Donâ€™t know where else to turn. Every day for weeks Iâ€™ve been contemplating ending my life. Havenâ€™t felt this way since high school. The past 18 months have been the worst time of my life. Hereâ€™s the laundry list:

â€¢ wife told me she wanted a divorce out of the blue one morning. 
â€¢ as a result my finances have been spinning out of control and Iâ€™m currently being sued by at least one creditor. The majority of my debt (~$300K) is educational debt and filing bankruptcy wouldnâ€™t even get rid of it. 
â€¢ I had to move back in with my parents. My mom is bi-polar and my dad is a recovering alcoholic who is prone to relapses. 
â€¢ in the past month, Iâ€™ve had to put down my dog Iâ€™ve had for 16 years without getting to say goodbye because I lost him in the divorce, my cousin passed away from cancer, and my favorite uncle died unexpectedly. 
â€¢ I have a gf and when itâ€™s good itâ€™s great but sheâ€™s super moody and I find myself wondering if sheâ€™s gaslighting me a lot of the time. Whenever I complain about how sheâ€™s treating me she turns it around or tells me Iâ€™m being too sensitive. Her family is AMAZING but I just never know what will set her off. At this point Iâ€™m more afraid to lose them than her. 
â€¢ I should point out that my mom hates my gf and makes my life a living hell for dating her. 

The only thing keeping me alive is my children. Otherwise I would have checked out. Iâ€™m sitting here watching them sleep as I write this and Iâ€™m just crying. They are literally all I have in this world. Iâ€™m living in constant dread that Iâ€™m suddenly going to be homeless and have even less access to my children.   

I donâ€™t do drugs (other than occasional pot) and I have a steady job, but more than half my take home pay goes to my ex. I literally cannot get ahead. Iâ€™m on 75 Mg of sertraline and ativan as needed.  Therapy didnâ€™t do anything for me. I work out 6 days a week and have a pretty robust social circle. Sometimes I just feel like all those great comedians who died too soon. I joke around a lot to cover for my own pain.
