lonely....im not thinking of offing myself at the moment (although ive thought of it in the past)  im just so sad and lonely that it has gone beyond emotional pain and has gotten to the point where my heart physically aches.  being with friends helps a little and video games distract me from it but the second im alone i just feel like absolute shit
