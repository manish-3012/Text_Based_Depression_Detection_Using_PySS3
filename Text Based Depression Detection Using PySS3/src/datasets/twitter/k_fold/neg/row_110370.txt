Solipsism obssesion completely ruined my lifeI know that may seem strange to neurotipicals but you have to understand i have been diagnozed with ocd which means that if an upseting idea gets in my head it NEVER goes away NEVER! Unfortunately i got the worst fucking idea get in my head, that im the only mind that exists and other living things do not have an inner experience like me. This shit makes my life shit, i feel alone, a sense of nilihism and depression and trapped as i cant prove to myself that it isnt true. Has anyone got over this shit? How?
