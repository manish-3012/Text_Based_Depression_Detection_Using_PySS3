Sorry but im done. 2020 wonSorry this might be quite long but I just need to get a few things off my chest... last summer I got an amazing opportunity and I became a Dealer at a casino. Omg it was so much fun. Meeting new people everyday, working and playing a game! Life was going in a great direction. I had major depression before this but this job really started making me feel like me.                                          Fast Forward 2020. My girlfriend broke up with me for working too hard?! I had to support both of us. I lost my job due to Covid. I had a bad knee injury and the medical bills piled up. She took my two dogs from me, I gained 30 lbs. I finally started working again, working at a hospital helping patients where they needed to go. Needed quick work and it was $9 hr. So okay making some money and then they decide to shut down. Lose a 2nd job in a year because of Covid. Find out my last two weeks before they shut down I tested positive for Covid. I donâ€™t get paid miss my last two weeks of work. So what im getting at is this is my last 3 days on this planet. Im losing my apartment because all my funds are gone. Iâ€™ve fought and fought this year and I know itâ€™s happening to everyone but I canâ€™t handle this anymore. I will be homeless and itâ€™s December. I canâ€™t live like this anymore. I just wanted to vent and get this off my chest. I wish the best for everyone reading this and hope things get better for you. Take care everyone
