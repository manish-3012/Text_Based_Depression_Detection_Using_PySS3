My personality is what's breaking meWhen it comes to girls, I have such an obsessive personality but I'm so awkward and self-conscious that I'll never even so as to try talking to them unless spoken to first, and even then it's a challenge.  Pretty much every girl I come across that's attractive or nice to me or that I can connect with on any level, I immediately focus on her and can't stop.  The desire for a girlfriend and the perks that come with it (I don't just mean sexual ones) consume me and I can't handle feeling this lonely so much.  Everything I want conflicts with everything I am, and my life is so empty.  There's a few ways I could kill myself, and a couple I know would not fail, especially since I have little fear as to how I die.  They've been rehearsed over and over in my head so many times that sometimes I'm surprised to wake up in the mornings.  The stress and mental struggles tire me out so much every day that I've found myself, at 17, going to bed around 9 pm every day, even though I barely do anything ever.  I hate myself so muvh
