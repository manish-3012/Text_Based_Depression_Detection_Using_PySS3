Iâ€™m So BehindI genuinely donâ€™t see a point in continuing on. Thereâ€™s no reason to keep going if Iâ€™m never going to catch up with the others. Itâ€™s too late for me to catch up anyways. By the time everyoneâ€™s gone on with their lives, Iâ€™ll still be in the same state working a fast food job or something. Iâ€™m pathetic, my existence is already being debated in my country, and Iâ€™ve already proven to others that Iâ€™m not capable of moving on. 

So I got 12 more days left until I either OD or hang myself. I donâ€™t wanna live anymore.
