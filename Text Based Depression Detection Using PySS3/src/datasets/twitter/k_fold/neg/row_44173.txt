I wish I had the guts.Well here I am. Resorting to a post on an internet forum. For what? Judging by past interactions, I doubt any response to this will help me.

I feel that I have 2 choices: reject God, or Kill myself.
I cannot simply choose God. That hasn't worked over the last several years that I've tried.

I am a 16 year old forever alone guy. I have no self confidence. What friends I have I try to distance myself from because why would they want to spend time with me? I hate me.

I just want to spend this weekend in bed. Never getting up. Not drinking water or eating food. Just sit there and die away. Or maybe I'll join the military when I turn eighteen just so I can get killed off.

I've heard people refer to me as "level-headed". That's not me. I have no future. I doubt I'll even graduate until I'm 20. And then what? I'll probably live in my parents house until they die. Just sapping away.

I realize this is absurdly morbid and nonsensical. I guess I'm just venting cause I've never had any friends to vent to. Or maybe I did and I just turned them all away.


*Edit* Somehow I feel much better than I did this morning. Which leads me to believe I am some form of bipolar.
This doesn't mean I will remove myself from this thread, but I will look at it from a different angle and a clear head.
And thank you all for your posts. I didn't think I would get much recognition if at any.
