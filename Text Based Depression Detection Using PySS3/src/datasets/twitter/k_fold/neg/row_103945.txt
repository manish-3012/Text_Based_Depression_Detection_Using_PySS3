Suicide Outlet Website?Ok so if this is the wrong subreddit please tell me and I'll take this down, but I'm looking for ideas. Ever since I left the Army I wanted to start a website for people considering suicide. Obviously I have shifted gears from just veterans to anyone, because through reddit and other sources I've come to see how large the scope actually is. There are good people trying to help, but more importantly people actually seek help! What would make a dedicated website even worth it. I think having personal testimonies and daily or weekly updates from individuals would be nice. A spot where people can share certain outlets. For example I personally have found a certain physical health routine mix that gives a sense of personal wealth. Idk maybe this is out of place.
