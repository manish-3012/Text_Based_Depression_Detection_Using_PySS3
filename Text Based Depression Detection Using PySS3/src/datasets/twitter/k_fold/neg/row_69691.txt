Ready to end the stressBoy what a year this has been for the US. Other than nobody giving a shit about the virus, there's the nonstop polarizing politics that are gonna send this shithole into a full on civil war. It's fucking stressful and for someone that's already severely depressed it makes me want to point this shotgun in my lap under my chin and end it so I don't have to see the chaos anymore. I just don't see a good outcome in our future in any way, shape or form.
