I've started drafting a final goodbye letterHey y'all hope you're doing alright.

 I relapsed in cutting, so it's back to long sleeves for a bit, but I only have 2 days left of classes which will be really nice. I've been smoking 4-5 times a day now and drinking at night pretty much everyday. I've smoked 6gs in the last 3 days. Everytime I drink I end up cutting and my friends have begun to get really upset at my smoking habits. They've started to separate from me because "I've been fucking up", but I don't think I have. My grades are great, I just like to smoke a lot. I have a beautiful spot to smoke at, and I spend hours there listening to music and smoking and its really nice. It' s a popular spot on campus too, so I run into other people all the time which can be nice.

I usually like to plan out how I kill myself, like the location, what I'll be listening to, etc. I used to want to end my life in a field by my house, but now I've changed to my new smoke spot, because its so fucking gorgeous. I'll probably be listening to [Maggot Brain by Funkadelic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOKn33-q4Ao) when I do it as well. 

I'd be happy to chat with some of you guys for a bit :)
