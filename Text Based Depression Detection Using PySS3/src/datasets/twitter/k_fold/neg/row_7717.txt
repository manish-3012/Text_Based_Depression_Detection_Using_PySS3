I donâ€™t know how to stay aliveIâ€™m in a weird position for me. I am away from home for a month, and have obviously missed therapy because of it. Since we left Iâ€™ve been in a depressive episode, and stayed up countless nights suicidal. I had a knife in my hand at one point. However, iâ€™m trapped. I cant tell my family as I donâ€™t want to ruin their vacation, and I cant kill myself either as Id feel too guilty. Somewhere deep down, I know it would get better if i just hold on, but I donâ€™t know how I can do that. I donâ€™t know how long I can go without killing myself. 
(side note- if anyone needs to talk about their own problems, pms always open. :))
