i'm scaredâš ï¸twâš ï¸i'm not one to have fears, i'm not scared or the dark or snakes or anything like that, but i'm scared of what i might do... not to other people but to myself, i don't like being here knowing some people would hurt less if i wasn't here and others would hurt more. i just want out of the headspace that continuously tells me to do it and by 'it' i mean hurt myself i want to take a knife and watch as my skin opens up and blood pours out of the open wound as my almost lifeless corpse bleeds out of the black marble bathroom floor, but i can't do it, i can't take my life. i want to but i can't i care too much to do that.
