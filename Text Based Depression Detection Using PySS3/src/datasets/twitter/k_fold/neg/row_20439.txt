I feel like I have no other choiceI'm 20 and I just finished my freshman year of collage. I live with my girlfriend in our apartment. My parents pay for my collage and first semester I didn't do anything I barely did any work so that pissed my parents off, well I did it again and I can't face them this time. I've tried to kill my self twice in high school and ended up getting admitted. I hated it and ended up getting my parents to break me out. I'm on medication for my depression and PTSD (I saw my little brother die when I was 6) but I still feel so depressed I have trouble eating and becoming manic. So now I feel like I have no other choice I don't want to leave my girlfriend but she doesn't deserve to have to deal with me and I simply can't face my parents I improved slightly but I've only passed 2 classes in my entire collage career. Feel completely worthless and all I've done is lie and manipulate people. I just can't face the music.
