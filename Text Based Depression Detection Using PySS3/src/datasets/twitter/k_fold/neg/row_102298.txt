I think I really need somebodyI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on but the past few nights I wake up out of a dead sleep and Iâ€™m extremely suicidal. Itâ€™s like reality just keeps hitting me like a fucking wall. Iâ€™m a worthless piece of shot. Iâ€™m 26 years old, Iâ€™m a mom. My son needs me and Iâ€™m fucking failing him. We share a tiny room together at my moms house that I pay rent for, itâ€™s her boyfriends house, I didnâ€™t have much to do with my mom for years and now weâ€™re here. All my siblings, even my younger siblings are doing fine on their own in other states. Iâ€™m a fucking worthless shit show who canâ€™t get her shit together. I was married, had my baby. My husband said heâ€™d never ever leave my baby, I would get worried and heâ€™d tell me no matter what he was never leaving me but even in some freak event if he did, heâ€™d never abandon our son. And he fucking did. I was probably a shit fucking wife, but he beat me. He beat me and cheated on me and screamed and scared me, he hurt me while I was holding my baby. Then heâ€™d be sweet again. I discovered he was having another affair, and he never came home. He told me to get the fuck out of the house weâ€™d shared for the past 4 years. Days before the lease was up. I was alone with my son and no money, he drained the accounts. We were going to go to the shelter but my mother sent us money to drive to her place. My husband.... he fucking abandoned my son like he never existed. My son did not understand he asked me where daddy was all the time, he wouldnâ€™t even talk to him on the phone. He proposed to that girl just a few weeks after we were forced to flee our home. He and that girl went to the house after weâ€™d left and went through and sold and threw away all of our belongings. Iâ€™ve been working since right when we got to my moms. But the virus happened and Iâ€™ve been out of work and every fucking day I just know more and more how much of a shitty fucking adult and parent I am. I canâ€™t provide shit for my son. He should have his own room, he should have a better mom. Iâ€™m not a fucking adult and I donâ€™t know how to get my shit together. Meanwhile my husband is avoiding the divorce, and taking couples photos with that girl. Theyâ€™re posting their wedding registry online and pictures of her dress shopping. I just fucking. I just fucking wish I was enough for my son. I donâ€™t have an education, I have hardly any family in the entire world, literally. I can not afford to move out in this area, it would have to be far away somewhere more affordable. But even then Iâ€™m alone and earning minimum wage. I donâ€™t know. I just know that every night I wake up gripped with absolute dread at my fucking existence. At what a absolute worthless piece of shit I am. And I donâ€™t know what to do about it. I truly donâ€™t know if my son would be better off with me dead or not. I donâ€™t want that for him, I donâ€™t want any pain for him ever at all, but I canâ€™t see myself causing anything good. I donâ€™t want him growing up with a piece of shit mom, a dead one would be better than the one I am now.  I feel so alone. I have no one to talk to, my mom isnâ€™t like that. She doesnâ€™t really wanna talk or show any affection. Iâ€™ve got no friends, literally not a soul. Not a single person talks to me or anything. Iâ€™m so isolated. I wish I had someone I could reach out to to and tell them that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m okay, that Iâ€™m really thinking Iâ€™m doing to get myself killed on purpose, end it all. I need someone and thereâ€™s no one.
