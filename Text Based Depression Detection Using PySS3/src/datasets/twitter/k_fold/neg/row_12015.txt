Is it the end?I feel as if my life is on a spiral down. I have had major depression disorder for 6 years and I canâ€™t afford medication anymore. The love of my life wonâ€™t talk to me any more. Some say forget her. Do they not know Iâ€™ve tried? Iâ€™ve tried to move on. My father drinks to no end and my mother is too focused on my father to even look at me. Dead end job and I can barely my car.  Itâ€™s been like this for years. Is it truly selfish to want to end it? Iâ€™m suffering. Thereâ€™s no other way about it. Suffering every day. Every night. Crying to bed. The voices in your head. I have them. I know others do also. They are there wherever you are and go. At work, they are unbearable. I just hold my head and hope they stop. Thats all we have. Hope. That word doesnâ€™t seem like much anymore. I make others laugh. For I know what rock bottom is like. As I donâ€™t want anyone else to feel like that. Every day. Ending it is that anti depressant that seems like itâ€™d work.
