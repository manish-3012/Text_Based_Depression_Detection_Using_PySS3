I need help, somehowAs dramatic as this title sounds, dear redditors, I guess this time I won't be lucky.
I used to live in a dorm room with rats and cockroaches. My girlfriend got me out of there by finding a loophole in my contract. We moved together and because Stuttgart is incredibly expensive, we had to move together with her ex. Her ex intentionally fucked up to pay the rent so often, that our landlord ended our contract in an unpreventable way. My girlfriend and I wanted to look for a new flat in peace but her exes kamikaze-act killed this option. Since I am an orphant and her family lives far across the country, we cannot simply move to her family for a while.
Problem 2: All payable flats would be too far away from both of our workplaces and for her cat to be moved, since she has a failing heart.
And, because that is just not enough, my work contract is going to end on February 14th. I've started applying two months ago but nobody seems to want to hire a college student.
Problem 4: Without any income of me, neither of us even close to be able to pay any of the offered flats.
But wait, there's more: Losing our home in 15 days, losing my job in 1.5 months and constant failure in college have triggered my suicidal thoughts to come back. I barely can say a word without bursting in tears and still I manage to fake trust and believe to calm her.
I'm 21, she's 27. Neither of us has ever been in a situation as such. I just, I just really don't know what to do anymore. I've even fucking pucked while writing this text in fear. Please, suggest anything. I don't believe in god but I'd even be happy about thoughts and prayers.
