I've been thinking about it a lot lately.I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I don't want to live anymore. But I also can't stand the thought of leaving my loved ones like that.

I will never be happy. I hate myself. No one cares about me. Everyone says it gets better. And it does, for a bit, but then you come crashing back down. I cannot remember a time in my life where I was truly happy, it's been so long.
