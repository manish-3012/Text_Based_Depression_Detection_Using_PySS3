I just want the pain to go awayYou americans got it good.. Just go buy a gun and end it all painlessly, buy a fucking desert eagle and end it with swag lol ...
I dream about my Ex almost everynight waking up to see it was all an illusion why does my mind torture me even more... Im not depressed because of the break up i was before it just sealed the coffin. She was always supporting me now she doesnt want to even respond, she just knew there was no hope left and i understand her.. I made her suffer too much just like im making everyone else suffer. i just drink and cry hoping that one day it will end..
