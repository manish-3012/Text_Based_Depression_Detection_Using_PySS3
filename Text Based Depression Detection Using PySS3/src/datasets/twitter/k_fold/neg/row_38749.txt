Keeping me alive is an act of crueltyI've fucking battled my brain for the past 8 years. I've failed killing myself 3 times. God hates me. I hate me. I have no friends. My life is shit. I'm a fucking wage slave to a system that doesn't actually care if I die. 

"Well can't you stay alive for me?" You're fucking selfish. Why would someone even ask that of me. Let me fucking die and end my suffering. I've been teetering on this precipice of suicide and a miserable life for damn near a decade. Humans are fucking cruel.

God, i wish i were dead.
