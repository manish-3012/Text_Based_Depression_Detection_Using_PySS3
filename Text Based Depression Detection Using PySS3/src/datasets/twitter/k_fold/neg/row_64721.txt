My SO said he believed I will never be happy. I know that heâ€™s right.I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m bothering to write this if Iâ€™m honest. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to family members for years about feeling suicidal. They just tell me I make them sad.

I think anyone on this subreddit has pretty much dealt with depression, anxiety, PTSD or a catch-all for a long time. For me, itâ€™s been years of feeling so high and untouchable for maybe a day or two, so much so that people ask me if Iâ€™m on something. And then for weeks at a time itâ€™s just absolute lows, and I drink myself into some kind of numb stupor. Half the time itâ€™s just complete numbness. But Iâ€™ve been like this for a while itâ€™s so hard to remember a time where I was just content.

Iâ€™ve been seeing a therapist for years, but in the last year havenâ€™t been able to afford one. I hate my job, but I need the pay. I come home in tears half the time or I clock in already in tears, dreading each and every shift. For many years, Iâ€™ve been living for the future. I KNOW one day Iâ€™ll be happy. After college. When I move. Once I at least make one friend. When I publish my book.

You see, Iâ€™ve done many of those things and it hasnâ€™t fixed anything. And Iâ€™m being to find less and less reasons for going through with it. I have no friends at work and people actually leave the room when I enter. It gets uncomfortably silent when I try to make conversation.

I went home one day and told my SO, â€œIâ€™m going to find a new job soon! I will feel so much happier when I get a new job! Maybe I can make some friends there. Maybe I wonâ€™t dread work so much. I canâ€™t wait.â€

Then he says to me, â€œI donâ€™t think that will work. You always talk like this. No matter what happens, I donâ€™t think youâ€™ll ever be happy.â€

And heâ€™s right. Iâ€™m going through the motions and making useless plans. Why even bother wasting the energy when everything would be so much easier with MY way?

Iâ€™m sorry if I made you sad or annoyed reading this. I guess I just wanted to get all my feelings out.
