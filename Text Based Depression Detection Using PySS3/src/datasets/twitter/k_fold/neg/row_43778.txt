Life is pointless and miserableMy home life is fucked.
Not a single friend or acquaintance.
No motivation, goals, etc.
Society in general is full of awful people.

Why does anyone bother living?
People just use each other to feel better.

The only time anyone 'cares' about suicide is after the fact, when they have the opportunity to make a BS post on social media about how they are so upset by someone else taking their own life, and how they would have done a million different things to help. 

The likes roll in and you can guarantee such a person will do sweet fuck all to help out if they ever find themselves in a position to do so.

People just want to continue building up this fake perfect image of themselves. Such people contribute far more to problems rather than solutions, when it comes to the issue of suicide.

And what is up with everyone treating one another like shit? Is it truly so difficult to treat another human being with some kind of decency and respect?

It sure as shit will never happen, but the world would be a far better place with less self-absorbed arseholes wandering around.

I am not a bad person, not entirely. I have just been made to feel this way, based on how others have treated me for extended periods of time.

Deep down I know my value, but that is buried beneath constant negative thoughts and firmly entrenched beliefs.

I only have so much control over my life. It is not as if I asked to be bullied and treated like shit over and over again. If I choose to no longer be here, it is not selfish, as such a decision has occurred for me in large part through the actions of those around me.

These people can continue living their shitty lives, but I won't be there for them to boost their egos through cruel words, personal attacks, or other means.

I don't want advice, help, or any other fake BS. I just wanted to vent a small portion of my views and experiences.
