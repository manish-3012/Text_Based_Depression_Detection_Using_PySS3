The waveWhy did he turn around and wave?  Did he know I was saying goodbye?  Was it the speech I gave him to be brave and kind and good to his mother?  Whatever the catalyst, that is exactly what he did which was different than he done before.  Typically it was a quick goodbye daddy and a run through the doors.  Why was this day different?
I had convinced myself that they would be ok without me eventually, and in the end, stronger.   Resolve was shattered completely by the wave.  
Still believe this of my wife â€“ she is stronger than anyone gives her credit for and will not take the loss lying down for long.  She is a survivor.  This will hopefully force her to work hard to reach her true potential as opposed to lying back and being a victim.  After I am gone, she will no longer be able to lean on me to provide her with what she feels entitled to. 
My parents?  They exist in their own little world where people and objects only exist if they are directly in front of them.  Of course they would be impacted at first, but this will be more culturally instinctive behavior of how parents are supposed to react to the loss of a child.  There will be nothing truly felt due to any kind of actual personal connection.  Like their entire parenting life, they will do just enough, but never add any real value.  Theyâ€™ll be fine in the end and the record will show they were better parents than me â€“ atleast.  Not being deficient is still pretty good - Definitely better than ending yourself and abandoning your child.  
How do I saddle my son with an event that has the potential to define his life - Especially one so early in his life?  How will he process all of this?  What if he is haunted by similar thoughts and my acts give him permission to act? Biographies of great men in history share many examples of tragic loss early in life that instills an atypical drive.  This is my hope for him as potentially misguided and unlikely as it may be.       
So tired of feeling this way where I am barely keeping it together internally and putting on faÃ§ade of happiness and confidence in the future to the world.  I am not happy, ever.  I have zero confidence in the future, my place in it, or in any shred of happiness.  All I want to do is end this painful existence.
Everytime I am at point of putting plan into action, something pops up to break resolve.  I ready myself for that specific something the next time and something else comes up.  Next time, I will not drop him off at school, but will have her do it as those mornings are typically chaotic and upsetting which will assist in resolve to push forward.   Once I can get away from them, I can easily bounce off the rest of the world towards my end goal.
I realize that my reality of life is well ahead of what the majority of the world encounters everyday.  I know that my thoughts are not completely rational or sane.  I am being incredibly self-absorbed and selfish, but canâ€™t go on like this.  I also know that I have no interest in existing in a world of drugs and being some kind of sad sack miserable SOB.  Just existing for the sake of existing is not acceptable even if it is for the good of him.  Need to push this to a point where I can get over the lingering questions on his future and how my death will impact him.  
The resolve will return â€“ I will end this soon.
