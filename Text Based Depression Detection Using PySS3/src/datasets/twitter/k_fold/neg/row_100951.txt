Confession: It's my fault, I ruined it.I posted in r/raisedbynarcissists about finding an uplifting message from a teacher years ago who I saw as a substitute mother (or just an older female crush? No idea what to call it,) and someone suggested I contact her. But the thing is I already have, and it didn't go well. 

Basically I'm addressing rape for the first time (after a LONG time,) and I'm always paranoid and naive and confused and angry and tearful. A few months ago I suspected that there was an email exchange between my mother and this teacher about what happened, so I tried contacting her through the school's email to ask about it. This was back in February and I was still paranoid about a bunch of other things, and I included them in the emails I sent (which makes it worse - \*emails\*. Plural.) About a week later I got a really flat reply and now I think that what I said was stupid and that she now hates me. 

So I could have had a pretty great candle in this pitch-black hell, but I ruined it. I wanted to contact her to thank her, but what I said before was way too crazy and I can't just act like it didn't happen. But I have no idea how to address it without going dark and pushing away this teacher even more.

I really do have no one now. One minute I want to die and the next I want to get revenge at my mother for acting so fucking nice in her emails with this teacher (and with everyone else too I guess) while talking shit about her around me, making me think I had no one on my side.

Why me? What is the point of my life? Clearly all I do is destroy things. Things are going to keep going round and round like they have been for the past 13 wasted years, because I'm always going to be there to say the wrong things and ruin everything for everyone. I'm always going to be desperate, naive, weak, pathetic, arrogant and poisonous.
