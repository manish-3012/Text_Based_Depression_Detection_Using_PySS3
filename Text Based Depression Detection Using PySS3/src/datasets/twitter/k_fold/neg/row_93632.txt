Not sure what to do now...Right to the Point.  I was charged and convicted of posession of Child Porn.  Due to a fluke in the case I never actually served time.  But I was on probation for a few years. I am Off now. I am a registered level 2, and a Felon.  I was told by a "helpfull" person in the state unemployment agency that as a felon I might get a job, but as a sex offender.. It would never happen.. They basically told me I'm screwed.  Im currently living with my family but they make me live in the basement.  They are only putting me up, because the Probabtion office talked them into it.  Im out of ideas. I have no money to start a business (that seemed to be my only option) I cant get a loan cause I have no collateral.  Im forbidden to work with computers outside of this one (its monitered -Hi Guys!)  ..Im at my end.....
