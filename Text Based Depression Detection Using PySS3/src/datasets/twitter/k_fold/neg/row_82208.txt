It's my birthday today...(x-post from r/Depression)...and I still feel like shit. Even though my family provided a lot, I still can't feel happy. What the hell is wrong with me? It's just another boring sunday. I'm not celebrating my birthday with a party because my friends have gone different ways. This depression thing is really holding me back from getting stuff done. I want to move...move away from here and go somewhere like Japan. Start a new life, because I just want to have new experiences and discover things. Forget about all of my problems here. But all my problems are inside me...something I can't escape. The more I type the more I realize what the hell I'm doing. There's the normal people, the outcasts, and then there's me. I don't know anymore, I feel like I'm stuck in a loop. I'm stuck in this house while my friend is out at Lake Tahoe having a crap load of fun. I'm just stuck here...doing the same thing everyday. I need a way to get out of this loop. I want to have an adventure...and happiness.
