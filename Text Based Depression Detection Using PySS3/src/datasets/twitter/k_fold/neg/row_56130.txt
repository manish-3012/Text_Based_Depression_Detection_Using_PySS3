But, Iâ€™m not waiting to feel â€œhopeâ€Iâ€™ve been looking for answers- how do I do this but have it look like an accident, so that my children and husband donâ€™t blame themselves?

And all I find on the internet is â€œcall a crisis line!â€ And â€œkeep living- it gets better!â€

But, it wonâ€™t. Because the problems isnâ€™t really my happiness, itâ€™s that Iâ€™m a piece of shit. Iâ€™m toxic and hurt everyone around me, constantly. Iâ€™m lazy and slovenly and gross and worthless. Thereâ€™s nothing interesting or halfway competent about me.

I cat even enjoy my children, who are seriously really great kids. Most of the time, I eventually call a babysitter or grandparent because the kids deserve to be smiled at by someone.
Iâ€™m just a giant piece of shit. I fail at literally everything I do, and I hurt everyone around me. Iâ€™m a drain on resources and happiness of others. Iâ€™m not all of a sudden going to stop being a useless lump of crap excuse for a human, Iâ€™ve been this way my whole life. Boring, toxic, disappointing.

They will all be fine if I go in some accident. Yeah, it will be sad for a few weeks, but they will quickly adjust and you guys, the world will be so much brighter. Cutting out a toxic person is seriously the best. But if I walk out, or kill myself in a way that is detectable, the gift of me going will be marred by guilt they may feel, or feeling like I left because of them.

I just want to stop hurting everyone and being such an energy and resource sink. Thing will honestly be so much better when Iâ€™m gone. Itâ€™s not about my happiness and it never has been. I canâ€™t fulfill this function without fucking everyone up. I just want to bow out gracefully and let them get on with life.
