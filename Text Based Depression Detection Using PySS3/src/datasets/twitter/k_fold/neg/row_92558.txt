So tired of everything I'm tired of being alive. Its just constant struggle, day after day. I'm so exhausted and there is never any reward. The only thing I get at the end of the day is more rejection and isolation. I'm a native american university student living in Northern Ontario so needless to say I'm a social pariah. I'm just a stereotype in everyone's eyes, compound that with severe social anxiety and being physically ugly and you have a recipe for failure. I want to be a good person, I want to radiate integrity and kindness but everyday I just watch myself get uglier and uglier. I've been told its selfish to consider suicide because of the pain I'd subject my family to, but I think its worse to subject them to a decaying persona. This depression is just corroding my personality and making me more toxic to be around. I want to end it all while I'm still holding onto a bit of my old self.
