I need to die. I just can't be happy.I went to new york last week, i'm accepted at top engineering schools for adter high schools, and yet i don't find any enjoyment in anything and i keep fucking up evzrything

No one can help me. I just need to fucking die. That's just *it*. I can't enjoy life so why should i fucking bother. I'll just fail my finals, like the social garbage i am, and then i'll kill myself out of despair. I am not worthy of anyone's love, attention or whatever. I'm trash. I don't deserve anything of what I'm getting.
