ByeI cut myself two nights ago, I wanted to end myself, I didnâ€™t want to feel anymore... I still donâ€™t... my mom called me â€˜weakâ€™ a â€˜cowardâ€™ and told me to go kill myself somewhere else... itâ€™s not only that, my life has been shit show since the day I was born... Iâ€™m tired of having to â€˜workâ€™ like a god damn sheep. Why do I got to be alive if I didnâ€™t  want too be born? 

Iâ€™m going to buy a huge bottle of vodka and drink until I canâ€™t feel anything anymore or on the verge of blackout and Iâ€™m going to slice my wrists while I listen to my favourite song and watch the sky get dark... when I cut myself it felt numb, like it wasnâ€™t that bad of a way out. So now Iâ€™m going to follow through
