A link to the book I found immensely helpful.https://www.pdfdrive.com/feeling-good-by-david-burns-e33413232.html

The book is called "Feeling Good" by Dr. David Burns. I suffer from OCD and found this immensely helpful. If you are suicidal and can't find any way out, PLEASE read this book this may sound very wrong, but if you're killing yourself, might as well read a book before it. If nothing else, try it out. For a random stranger on the internet, maybe.
