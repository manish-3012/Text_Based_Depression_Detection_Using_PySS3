My mom recently lost her battle with cancer. I wish it was me that died instead.She still had so much grand plans on what she wants to do in her life when she was suddenly diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and died 3 months later.

We were there when the doctors were trying to revive her when her heart failed. 

I can't stop wishing it was me instead. We were not extremely close but I am thankful to everything she have one for us. I'd been suicidal for a decade now. I don't have plans, dreams, or aspirations in life. We're polar opposites. She could have used another couple of decades in her life.
