Just done.Considering suicide in two weeks. 

I want to see my sister and family one last time. I want to make sure my daughter will be okay, and get things in order for her. Spend as much time with her as I can. 

I'll probably write a letter for her to read. My husband, I don't know what to say to him. We've been fighting a lot. He doesn't want me to come home. I can't do it. I know he cares about our daughter, and he misses her. He has to take care of her when I'm gone. 

I'm going to spend the last two weeks trying to be happy. I'm so close to telling my husband, but he'll say I'm bluffing. I've told him before I felt this way, but I can explain it all if I leave him something.
