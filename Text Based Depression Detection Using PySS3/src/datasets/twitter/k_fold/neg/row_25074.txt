I'm planning on killing myself tonight.I don't know what I expect you to do. Something is making me think there's still hope for me, but I can't figure out what. I can't socialize, with anyone. I have no motivation in life, can't pick a major because I'm not interested in anything. I don't have passion for anything. I've tried relationships, but I can't reciprocate the feelings needed, and whenever I'm single I feel lonely.  Everything is bleak right now. I feel like th only thing I need is a companion, and tonight I tried to stir up some emotions within myself for a person. I couldn't do it. I was at a football game with her, she obviously liked me and wanted to have fun with me, but I couldn't do it. All I was thinking was that I hate football games, and I hate social expectations placed on me. I feel like I'm expected to be funny and happy and charming, but I can't do it unless I want to, and that comes at the most inopportune times. I really thought I liked her, but nobody wants to be with someone who just wants to lay down and listen to music all day. I don't know if you can change my mind. I don't want to do it, but I don't want to live my entire life suffering by watching others enjoy it more than I ever could. I can't embrace life, it feels like a repetitive burden to me.
