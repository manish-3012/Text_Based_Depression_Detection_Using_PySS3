Almost got scammed..great.Whats the point? People are awful, liers, scammers, abusers, power hungry, egotistical, and i am tired of their bs. My needs and wants don't matter, and people clearly want the weak link gone. I'm too broken to be mended. I want to leave this place. I'm being tortured for being alone and weird every single day. Even sex cannot fix my sadness. I should go. Soon I hope.
