Yeah i cba anymore, autistic rant timeI dont think ill actually kill myself though I do have a very strong urge to do so, maybe because im a coward. A bit about me. 17, 6"1 135lbs, only child. Not popular at all, but have a few close friends. Taking honors but having an extremely hard time, multiple sleepless nights a week sometimes etc. Don't understand why i do this and devote so much energy to it. I train martial arts and that keeps me going a lot. Clinically depressed would be the term widely used for my mental state. I feel that the material stuff a lot of our lives revolve around (jobs, education, people etc) is idk, insignificant? I guess? Point is I often dont feel fulfilled with my life and cant think of anything that will make me feel fulfilled. I sometimes feel that life as we know it is just feeble and meaningless, we live we die. Why are we even here? Not having an answer to that question is weighimg on me. However, which is the dumb part, i do think having a partner would be pretty cool. I think itd make me feel appreciated and loved more, apparently that matters somehow. But nah, aint nobody interested. Am I weird? Too scrawny? No one around me thinks like me. That kinda sucks. Anyway I feel completely on my own and wish i had someone close to me whom i could speak freely to and would accompany me in my life. Therapy didnt work so well for me. Anyway I doubt anyone will actually read this, I dont blame yall. Have a good weekend.
