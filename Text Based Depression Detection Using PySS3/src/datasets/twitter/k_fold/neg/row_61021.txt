Barely holding on [24M]Today, I came back after work, and I just cannot stop crying. I'm really tired and I don't think I belong in this world. There is just so much wrong with me and I cannot deal with this.  


I'm lonely. My boyfriend left me 5 months ago. I gave him everything I had, I shared everything, how many problems do I have in my family, how I struggle yet reach for greater heights. He left me. I did everything to fix it, but I was called a manipulative monster and a freak. My best friend tried to help me and talk to me to get me out of this situation. But I believe that I'm exhausting him now with my constant whining, clinginess and destructive thoughts.  


My mom and my best friend are the only two people that I'm afraid to hurt. But otherwise, I want to check out. I'm too tired. I indeed feel manipulative, destructive, unlovable, garbage person, who just don't belong in this world. And best of all, I'm just a coward who don't know how to end it all. But I want it to end.
