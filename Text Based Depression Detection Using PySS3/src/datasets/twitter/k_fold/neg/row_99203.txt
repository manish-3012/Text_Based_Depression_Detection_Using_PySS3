not urgent. But somewhat seriousI just have this one math class. And I skip it all the time. But it sucks so bad whenever itâ€™s the night before. And I donâ€™t have anyway in my house of doing it. But Iâ€™ve thought a lot about going to my job, opening my bosses office with my keys and then using his shotgun. Everytime I think about what would happen afterwards I hate myself. And I just spiral. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s just my math class. But I think I just need to handle stress better. And I donâ€™t know where to start with that.
