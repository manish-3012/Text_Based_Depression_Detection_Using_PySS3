Student loan debt makes me want to kill myself.I will have an exorbitant amount of student loan debt after I graduate. It's not even a useful degree that will guarantee me a job. But since I'm so far in, there's no point in leaving now. I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world. I don't even think I can afford to move when I finish school.

My family doesn't support me and never will.

I'm so scared. Absolutely terrified. To the point where I think I should just end it now.

My family won't be burdened by my debt, since I didn't have a cosigner. I already checked with student loans anyway. As long as a death certificate is sent in, the debt will be forgiven.

I'm sick of crying every day. I'm on Wellbutrin and I see a psychiatrist. But it's not enough. I'm only worried that my suicide will make my psychiatrist think he failed. He didn't. I have always been fucked up.

My school has Reading Week (a week-long break) at the end of February. Thinking of booking a plane ticket to my favourite city in Canada and just ending it there. Maybe I will.
