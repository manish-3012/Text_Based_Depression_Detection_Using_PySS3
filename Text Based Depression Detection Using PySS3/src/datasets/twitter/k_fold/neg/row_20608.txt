I don't knowI know I'll probably get told that it gets better, or something, but nothing seems to ever go right for me.
I have been damaged by a vaccine so I am in pain all of the time, I have been through a lot of bullying, and up until recently, I have been in a long term relationship. This person was different from all of the rest, they loved me, and I loved them, I still love them. However they broke up with me a couple of days ago. The days are okay, but the nights are hell. He was my only friend, so now I have nobody, I have NOONE to talk to, to spend time with. They've been there for me for a long time, and there was never any signs that they were going to leave me. I know everyone seems to, but they promised they wouldn't leave, and every single person who has told me that, has left; so it took many months of them persuading me that they wouldn't, and now look what's happened.
I've always considered suicide, but right now I'm considering it more than ever. I know that life isn't easy, but all my life is filled with is pain, and of course there are a lot of people worse off than me, but that still doesn't make my life any better. 
I don't want to go through hours of crying, laying face down on the bath room floor, I don't want to be in pain anymore. The more upset I get, the worse the pain from the vaccine damage gets.
I honestly never post things online when I feel like this, but I guess I'm just desperate for the pain to go, even though I know it won't.
