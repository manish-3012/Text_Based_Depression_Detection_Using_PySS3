Inflicting guiltThe day I finally succeed at ending my life, I hope that all of the people who I've ever met will feel guilt. People don't care unless something happens, and when it does, they literally fuck off a day later.

I've had enough of all this existential shit which everybody has been trying to impose on me. People don't like to accept a point of view on life which isn't their own. 

I can't wait for people to start trusting me being on my own again. I can't wait for the day I will finally leave this world. And I want everybody who I ever came into contact with to feel bad, because that's how much of an asshole I am.
