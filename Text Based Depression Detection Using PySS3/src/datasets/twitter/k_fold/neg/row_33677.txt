Why can't my suffering just end?I am 19 and In eternal mental agony. Nothing Is worth It anymore I've long since lost the concept of joy &amp; happiness. I really don't have any family anymore. I've never had one friend. All people tell me Is "Go to a counselor" I outright refuse to be seen by quacks and used as a Human Test Subject for their drugs. Because at the end of the day counselors, psychologists, and psychiatrists only care about that big fat paycheck nothing more
