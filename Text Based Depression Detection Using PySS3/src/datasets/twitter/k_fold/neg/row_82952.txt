I want it to be over.I want my life to be over that is. Iâ€™m done with being depressed and not being able to do anything about it. Iâ€™m sick of cutting myself deeper and deeper to feel something. My life is crap and itâ€™s not getting better. My social anxiety problem makes things worse. I have no friends and I have to leave my boyfriend of 5 years because we are toxic together. I love him. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Please just let me die. Addiction is the worst thing that happened to me and I donâ€™t wish it on anyone. I can never be â€œnormalâ€ and be able to relax with a glass of wine. I am writing my suicide note tomorrow.
