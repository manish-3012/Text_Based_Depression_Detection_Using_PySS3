Looked for help Day 13? Or 12?Idk anymore i missed a day or so... So yesterday i went to my therapist and i felt... Not good. He said i have a depression. I have to take my meditation for at least a half year now... Well... I don't want it. He said it is my choice if i want to take it. But if i don't my depression will come and get me. So i have no other choice... Or do i have?
