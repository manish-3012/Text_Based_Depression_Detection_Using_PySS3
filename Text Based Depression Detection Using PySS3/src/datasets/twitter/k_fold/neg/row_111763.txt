Can't fall asleep. Need some solutions.I'm suffering from depression, anxiety, trichotillomania and I'm suicidal. I'm always tired, uninterested in going out or doing things. I have barely 3 friends and my mental issues are creating problems in my relationship as well.
I always turn my phone off before I go to bed. Since the last 3 or 4 months I've been having trouble falling asleep. I just lay there staring at the ceiling for hours and hours. And when I do fall asleep early, I wake up again at around 2 am and then I can't fall asleep till 4 or 5 am. I just keep thinking about all the negative things. Sometimes I think of the ways I could kill myself. It's funny that I'm so exhausted throughout the day and as soon as it's time for bed I'm alert! 
I've tried meditation but it just leads to anxiety and panic attacks. I've tried yoga and exercise but I really don't have any strength for that throughout the day. I've tried marijuana cause someone told me it might help and it was the worst experience of my life! It magnified my issues and it was horrible so I'm never doing that again. 
I don't have money for therapy and my family doesn't know about all of this bcz they don't think mental issues are real. I just wanna know if anyone has any suggestions that could be of help. 

TL;DR - Suffering from depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts. Cannot fall asleep and have tried yoga, exercise, meditation, marijuana but no luck. Therapy is not an option. Need any other possible solutions.
