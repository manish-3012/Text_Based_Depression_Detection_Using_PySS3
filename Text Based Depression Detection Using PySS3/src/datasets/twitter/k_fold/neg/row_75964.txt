FHi to anyone who is reading this
..My name is JT and im going to be relocating to Sacramento, CA in early July.   Im looking for someone who could use a fresh start.   Im willing to help you with transportation, food, and housing until you get on your feet.   Id prefer someone 18-35 male as my girlfriend would not like me to bring another girl along(sorry). If youre a single dad and have a kid thats fine too.  Ive been given alot of great opportunities in life and i want to help someone else try and claim a better life.  Call or email me if youre serious with a picture and a little bit of your story.  Thanks and best wishes to everyone regardless!Message me for my number.
