I tried and failed last nightLast night I attempted to finally end it all. I went into the bathroom, used a piece of rope to make a noose, and put one end around my neck and the other over a door frame. Much to my surprise it actually worked. I was able to move into a sitting position and everything tightened and started to choke me. I sat there for what I estimate one minute and could feel myself starting to fade. Then I lost my nerve. 

I managed to push myself up to a standing position and take the noose off. I looked at myself in the mirror and broke down, bawling like a two year old. Then I went to bed and the last thing I remember is sitting up, thinking. Then it was morning, so I must have fallen asleep at some point. I have a thin bruise in the shape of the rope around my neck this morning.

I did it because I'm a failure at life. I literally have no friends. None. I do not interact with anybody in person in real life at all throughout the day. It's been this way for four years now. I never have a friend to talk to, do things with, I am alone. If it weren't for my parents (I'm in my 30's and live alone) I wouldn't have a single person who gives a damn if I fell off the planet today. 

I also lost my job at the end of November. This was the fourth time in the last three years I've been fired from my employment. My parents will say it's because I took bad jobs with horrible employers who screwed me at the end. Well, that's true to an extent. But at the end of the day it's me. Why do I keep fucking things up? Why can't I get my act together and be an adult? At some point I have to own up to things. 

I'm not uneducated. I have a master's degree in my field and previously worked at a university. Now I can't even get a job as a night janitor. Seriously, last week I interviewed to be the night time cleanup guy at a company and they rejected me. I'm too good for menial labor jobs, but not good enough for the white collar jobs. I'm in this limbo. 

So, no friends, no social life, no job, two college degrees which seemingly aren't worth the paper they're printed on, and it's me. I ruin everything. I literally feel like I could walk out of my house today and disappear and nobody would notice or care I was gone. 

Hanging didn't work because the pain of it scared me. I don't know what the next attempt will be. I'm so sorry guys.
