I'm trying really hard and I have been persistent but I am so ready to give upI'm trying not to be lazy and lay in bed and sleep all day every day this summer. I am making myself work and get some college hours and draw. It feels like routine. It isn't getting any easier to force myself out of bed. It is actually getting harder. I hate being so lazy I am a hard worker so I can't figure out why I am doing this?
It's not like I enjoy sleep a whole bunch. I just don't like being awake. I'm wondering if I should just take a lot of pills next time so I don't have to wake up and I won't have to feel like this
