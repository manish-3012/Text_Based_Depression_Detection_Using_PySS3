nothingI decided a while ago that my life was going down hill. I don't know what caused me to decide this but I couldn't get it out of my head. Worthless. That's what I am. I haven't contributed anything in my time being here. I've tried putting my best foot forward, and getting out of my comfort zone, making new friends, telling people how I feel...but I'm just tired. Tired of trying when things don't work out. I want to help other people climb out of their own holes, tell them how amazing they are, how much I enjoy being around them. I'm seeking compliments myself. I want to be good enough for other people, my friends, my family. I mostly want to find confidence in myself. so I tell people the wonderful things I see in them so hopefully they'll see me too. I'm drowning. I feel so alone. Sometimes I gather the courage to tell my friends, and even call my mom to tell her how lonely I feel, but words can't describe. Why can't I be happy? Why can't I be happy with myself, and the life I've had. It could be worse. People worse off then me are stronger. I'm spoiled I guess. I'm not grateful for what I've been given, so I think I will begin my end. I don't know how. Maybe I just won't wake up tomorrow.
