societal expectationsI am a teacher. My doctors want me to work at the most 50% because of OCD (severe cronic etc...... loads of letters, ADHD and other factors that affect. I have refused for a while but have realized that I cannot function at 100% like "other" people can. So I agreed to 75%, I have now been refused sick pay for 6 months (from the state agency, they have their "own" doctors). What am I supposed to do? My doctors say if  work more, they definitely think I will hit a wall and become really sick, but they are also afraid I will commit suicide. What am I supposed to do? So tired of fighting just want to lay down and sleep. BTW I live in Sweden.
