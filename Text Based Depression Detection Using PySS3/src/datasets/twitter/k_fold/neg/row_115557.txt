Iâ€™m thinking of walking...Walking to a high place and just jumping. No one would notice me even walk out. No one would notice my stupid ass walking to the bridge. No one would even care. Itâ€™s kinda funny in a way. 

I never had an impact on a single person. 

I hate when people say think of your friends or family. I dont have friends and thatâ€™s not me being dramatic or anything I just donâ€™t. 
Iâ€™m a high school dropout who was only ever bullied.... and my family hates me. 

My father was abusive and so his side of the family hates me for speaking out against him. 
They hate me so much theyâ€™ve tried killing me. Vehicular manslaughter baby

Being forced to talk to a therapist made me realize the my mom was lowkey abusive. Now I donâ€™t know who to trust. My moms side has just never really been there. 

My older sister abandoned my younger sister and I during the divorce, sheâ€™s not the greatest. Last time I saw her she slapped me for being suicidal. I got my revenge in the form of smoking all her weed lol

Maybe Iâ€™m just being stupid. Itâ€™s just so hard to breathe when I want to stop. I donâ€™t want to exist. I donâ€™t want to be here staring at these four walls anymore 

Maybe It would just be funny to prove everyone wrong, that I can take their advice for once and kill myself.
