Too sane for this mad mad worldRecent trauma triggered social anxiety and depression that I have suppressed for years and years, it all snowballed and crushed me completely.

My life is the epitome of pathetic. No prospects, little education, no job, leeching off of parents financially. See my social anxiety is a hindrance, it mainly reaches its max when I experience criticism, whether cronstructive or not. People tell me I take things too personally, or Im just being too arrogant thinking I am perfect and anyone that judges me is a sinner, or I need to reduce the size of my ego. Basically, I am too weak, not being able to handle such a miniscule problem given my age. 

I am convinced that people in general are all rotten to the core (incl.me) and selfishness runs through their veins. Friendships were a joke to me, was I that unlucky, being backstabbed, betrayed, used whenever I try to convince myself that there are still good guys out there. Maybe I'm just decieving myself. 

Living in a society that relies largely on social communications and interactions to thrive, I am an outcast living in the shadows. Hope like all of the people who abandoned me, cast me aside when I was at my weakest, picked me up only to push me furhter down into fear, desolation and a spiral of anxiety. 

What intrigues me is that I live everyday like its my last now, for I dont know when I could end my life; it is hanging on a thin thread, sick of all the torture, pain, humiliation thrown her way.

Seeing all these posts on Reddit makes me feel understood, like Im not hallucinating or a delusional individual always gravitating to wards negativity. In fact they confirm that I was not blinded from the truth, and the truth always disappoints. 

The world is full of madness, and I sure as hell am losing my sanity slowly but surely.
