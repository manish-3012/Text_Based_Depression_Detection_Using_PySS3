I don't knowI really don't know what to think anymore. I've been depressed for over a year, I've been consumed by self hatred and wanted nothing more than to die. But about three weeks ago, a girl from one of my classes, from out of the blue, messaged me, asking to hang out. We did, and it was fantastic. Things got better, I have never experienced such happiness as watching a movie with her as she rests her head on my chest. But now I don't know. 

She noticed something was wrong with me, and I went ahead and told her about my depression and how much I hated myself. She seemed surprised. From then on, she started answering my texts slowly, or not at all. We used to talk for hours, and now she barely acknowledges me. Last night i had an episode, one that nearly pushed me over the edge, so I messaged her, out of desperation, hoping for just a little bit of happiness to come from our conversation. 

But nothing came. She was snide and sarcastic, completely different from usual. I was devastated. I thought about taking that Beretta out from under my bed and putting it in my mouth then and there. The only thing that stopped me was the thought of how sad that would make her. 

But now I don't know. I really care for her, and I want the relationship to continue, but not if she's unhappy. But at the same time, im completely devoid of anything attractive or beautiful, she doesn't deserve to have to deal with me. I want her to happy.

I have a list, titled Ways to Die. Three dozen varied ways I have devised to end my own life, detailed and planned out throughly. I may just pick one, and see how that goes.
