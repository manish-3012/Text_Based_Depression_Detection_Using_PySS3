Iâ€™m so fucking uselessBeing a 19 year old in college should be amazing right? Youâ€˜re supposed to meet all kinds of friends and come into contact with all kinds of opportunities and overall â€œenjoy life nowâ€.

The reality is I canâ€™t socialize outside of making jokes. I make all of my friends feel like shit with my jokes half the time and if Iâ€™m not doing that Iâ€™m just the guy whoâ€™s quiet and boring and nobody wants to interact with. Most people who approach me do it out of pity because I look like the guy whoâ€™s ready to kill himself. (Theyâ€™re not wrong)

As for opportunities, thereâ€™s nothing left for me. Everybody knows somebody except for me. Every small business seems to have every position filled or they donâ€™t check their correspondance at all. It doesnâ€™t matter how applications I fill or places I email or dm, nobody needs a photographer for their products or a web developer.

My first year of college was the worst Iâ€™ve ever experienced and honestly I donâ€™t expect this coming year to be any different.

It feels like my whole life is a waste. I spend so much time and money getting better at my hobbies just to get completely denied. 

So what part of life am I supposed toâ€enjoyâ€ when I sit in my room alone all day getting zero invitations to hang out and I canâ€™t do the things that make me happiest?
