Failure at lifeAll ive done in life is fail. I have bad anxiety so I have no friends and have a panic attack everytime I have to leave the house. Which then led me to stop going to school so now  I have to do online school.

Surprise surprise im on the verge of getting kicked out of that as well. My family is abotu 1inch from homelessness and of course, I cant do anything to help.

I just feel so worthless all the time. I am literally nothing to the world. Hopefully death wont fail me
