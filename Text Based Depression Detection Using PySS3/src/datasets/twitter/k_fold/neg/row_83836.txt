There is no light at the end of the tunnel.Every single day for me is a battle. A battle to get out of bed, to go to school, let alone do any work.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but no amount of therapy has amounted to any improvement. Nothing so far has helped my situation and honestly taking my own life seems like the best course of action, because I would rather be dead than have to go through this shit every fucking day. There is no point in putting myself through this any more, even in the off times things have started to look up without fail something has happened to send me down an even deeper spiral.

Just felt like saying this to someone, cause anyone else I have tried dosent seem to give a shit. 

Edit: Ykow what, fuck it. Writing that out cemented the decision, it will be done now. Maybe one day someone will look at this and realise how fucked the mental health care system is.
