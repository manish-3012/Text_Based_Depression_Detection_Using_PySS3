People don't get it, do they? I want to live a decent fucking life, not cope with therapy and mind-altering pills.Sure, depression can and does cause delusional thoughts that are unjustifiably negative. But in my case the reasons I feel like a pile of horse manure every day are being a genetic pile of trash in every sense of the word, (appearance, physical health, mental strength) the fact that I live in a family (or rather, a country) where a missed paycheck could mean financial ruin, and that these priviliged motherfuckers around me act like they're superior to me for the 'virtue' of nothing more than simply being born that way and in those circumstances.

It is the absolute cruelty, exploitation and humiliating despisal that my relations with almost everyone entail, as well as the fact that I can change just about nothing that drives me to my suicidal thoughts. How will paying a person to listen to my shit help me at all? How are pills supposed to change my hellscape of a real life?

Genetics are important. Money is important. Our monkey brains decided so. Should humanity want to ease some of the suffering, these two problems need to be rectified. I'm talking radical measures. Eugenics. Socialism. Let's do away with this 'mental health' charade once and for all and get down to the root of the problem.
