I am just done, I have fucked up for the last time.I couldn't give you what you wanted, my friends have told me that I have fucked up and that I have pushed you completely away with my last text message, and the worst thing is that I sent it in good faith, and now I am all done. Nothing helps right now, not friends, not reading blogs, forums, stories or anything. I just wanna die, even when with my sister's family and her kids, all so loving I can only think of how I have fucked it all up by not being strong enough to leave you alone when you said you needed time. Just end it with me, so I can end it with myself.
