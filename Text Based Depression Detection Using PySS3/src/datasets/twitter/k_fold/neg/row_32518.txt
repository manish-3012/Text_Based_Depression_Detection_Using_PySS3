Everyone would benefit from me dyingThe few people in my life would all benefit from me dying. Currently in a 2 year relationship that's been dead since the 4th month in, no clue why were still together besides I love him and he's been waiting for me to leave on my own even though I've tried having numerous conversations about whether we would still like to be together or not where he claims "of course how dare you ask"..with no improvement to our relationship. My brother and cousin hardly talk to me at all, unless they really know I've been low so they feel bad. It would help both their egos to have a story of a sister who killed herself to gain sympathy. My father is a disgusting person. I love my mom but I would leave her behind all of my money in cash, not much but at least a month's rent. Hopefully someone would set up a go fund me and she would get a lot of sympathy donations. She cashiers at a local restaurant where the everyone in the town knows and adores her, so I'm sure everyone would be very kind to her. I currently have 2 cats that would be better off in another home, me and bf are too scared to leave them alone with dog (he's not mean to them just is old and grouchy and it makes him nervous) so we set them up in a spare bedroom and they come out while were home and during the night when the dog sleeps with us. They deserve a much better situation and I know my bf would get rid of them when I pass.
I'm just fucking ready. Going to put all money aside and after my tax return, I'm just fucking ready to go.
I hate this empty and painful feeling in my chest and in the pit of my stomach every fucking day for the past 10 years. Fuck this shit
