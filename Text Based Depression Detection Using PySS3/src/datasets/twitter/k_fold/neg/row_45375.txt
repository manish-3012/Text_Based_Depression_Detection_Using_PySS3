My will to live is teetering on the edgeThere is not a day of my life that goes by that I didn't wish I was dead. I don't want things to get better; there is no better anymore. I don't want anything fixed and I'm sure as hell not waiting for anything to improve. Every single day is as high as it will ever get. Every single day is worse than the last, and this is the reality for everyone now. Politically, environmentally, socially - It doesn't matter. EVERYTHING is in freefall. Absolutely everything. 

I just don't know how I'll do it yet but I know for certain it will happen. Not now. But it's the only certainty in this life for me. I think I've entered the phase where it's time to start doing some research into the best way to do it. 

I am not asking for help. I don't want help. Just venting and wondering how many people feel like I do.
