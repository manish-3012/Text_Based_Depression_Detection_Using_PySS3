Broke up with my gf and I'm really scaredSo today I broke up with my gf of almost a year, who was my best friend and one of the few friends I had. We had a lot of unnecessary fights, but she also took care of me when the world got a bit too much for me (I sometimes have short periods of depression and suicidal feelings and a pretty serious social anxiety, so I don't have many friends).

We've been on and off about breaking up for a few months now and I finally did it. Can't say I'm relieved, to be honest. I know it's better, but I feel so empty and I don't feel like doing anything. I told her I don't want to remain friends, I don't want to keep in touch, really, because it'll hurt too much. She says she'll be there for me, but I don't want that. I want someone to be there for me, but at the same time I don't want anyone to be there for me, if that makes sense. It doesn't to me. 

I feel like it's all my fault, because of who I am as a person and the way I handle things like fights or insecurities. I don't know. I just feel so lonely
