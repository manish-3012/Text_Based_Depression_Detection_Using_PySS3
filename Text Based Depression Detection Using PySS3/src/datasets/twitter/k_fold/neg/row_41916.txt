If it was easy, I wouldn't be here anymore.I struggle with myself so much. Sometimes I wonder how things got so bad. How things could go so wrong. I didn't want to be me. I'm not saying I'm not at fault with my own decisions, but, god, I it's tough to deal with things and be okay, and it's even harder to be someone else just to be able to make it through the next day. The mind fuck I've had to push myself into, knowing it could only make things worse, I gladly accepted, because I believe there's no other way. Why can't I just be okay? Why does it have to be so difficult for some of us? I go through my daily life watching everyone around me, and they seem okay. They might have struggles, and I don't know what they deal with, but they seem to cope. Why do I have to be this way? Why do I have to force every single atom of my being to be okay, when I know I'm not? Why don't people love me the way they love others? Am I that bad a person? All I ever wanted was to be, and I can't even do that. Every day I have to struggle with me, and as exhausting as that is, that's only the start of my day. I'm envious of the people that walk by and they live normal lives. I want to die, but I can't afford to just yet. I have to accept this existence until I can't. I could work through the pain. I know I'll be here tomorrow. I remind myself of that each day, but every second from now until then is as painful as the horrors of my past, the disappointments of my present, and the uncertainties of tomorrow. I've accepted that maybe some people just don't get the chance to be okay. Maybe this is all I get. Maybe this is all I deserve. Each car speeding by connects. Each edge an invite i long for.  Anything could give me peace. I laugh at the thought. I laugh at myself. I laugh to seem okay, and I die inside each and every time. Just not in the ways I long for.
