Every single person I met in the hospital has moved on from the rough time in their life.I have been in the hospital 6 times. Most of these times, I met one or two people and became friends with them. I've kept in touch through social media and every single one of them seems to have moved on from their illness. Of course, I don't know if they still suffer from the symptoms, but it certainly isn't disabling them. They go to school, they have relationships, they have jobs.

I am housebound and have been for almost a year now. I'm only 17. When people ask me what i'm up to these days, I lie and say "Just school and chilling with friends and stuff". But really, I lay in bed all day everyday. I don't see things getting better. My anxiety paralyzes me every single day and I am exhausted. All I can think about is what to panic about next. Its pathetic, really. I can't even leave the house to see a doctor or therapist because i'm too scared. 


I don't think theres a way out.
