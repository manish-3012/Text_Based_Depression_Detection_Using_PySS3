I will careI am new to reddit this is my first post I have been looking at posts and trying to help those in need and I wish to help everyone so I thought I would make this post so people could find what they are looking for... Long story short I have suffered depression and i have made it to a point where I can help using my experience the experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies nobody deserves to feel the void of depression yet so many are sucked in and very few ever make it out I am lucky I have made it out and I'm here to help those who seek that which they don't feel like they can obtain I hope you can reach out to me thank you for your time...
