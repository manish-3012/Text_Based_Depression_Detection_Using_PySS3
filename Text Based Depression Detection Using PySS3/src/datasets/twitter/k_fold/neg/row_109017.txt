Here again.The world would be much better off if I were not. I am so exhausted from trying to stay alive for everyone but me. I'm worthless, ugly, drained, and numb. Don't I deserve the compassion of an end? Probably not; I don't feel like I deserve the relief suicide would bring - it's selfish, right? So I stay here for everyone else while slowly wasting away internally. Day four of no food. At least that's something I can control.
