Fuck.I just want to cut. All of me wants to. I just want to hurt. I want to cry. I want to punish myself. My boyfriend will be disappointed in me and make me throw away my razors if he finds out I did it. My therapist will be disappointed. I just want to. It's not even a matter of not wanting to but needing to anyway, I WANT to. My body is craving it. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why is pain a fucking safety net? This isn't even suicide talk I guess so I don't know if it's against the rules bit I needed to get it off my chest. I think I'll do it and take a shower. This sucks. They're going to be so sad. I don't know whats wrong with me. Even the smallest fuckin things set me off.
