Need some help pleaseHey, I'm not actively suicidal but the thoughts are getting more comforting and its starting to scare me.

I really need to talk about some of this stuff:
-I just started ritalin and I haven't been able to eat for 2 days, but I'm afraid if I stop I wont be able to do well on exams I have this friday.
-My girlfriend is acting weird and even thought I'm 99% sure it's just me being paranoid, I can't stop being jealous of everything she does.
-Between last semester and this one my grades have dropped from A's to D's and I can't get motivated to do anything

please help I'm literally in pain
