All I need now is a method.I have been depressed for over four years now and I am currently on antidepressants. I have wanted to die for a long time now and the only reason I haven't is because I couldn't bare to hurt my mum and brother so deeply. My mum has said to me before, that if I died, she would die too. I can't stand it when she says that.

But since last summer, I have realised that I just can't hang on anymore. There is nothing for me left in life, no matter what people say. I feel such incredibly guilt for what I am going to bring to my family, but I feel I have no other option.

All I think about is how I'm going to do it. Pills? That's painful. Rope? Can go wrong and I'll break my neck. Jumping from a bridge/building? What if I regret it halfway down?

I know people won't want to, but what other methods are there? I'm not going to do it anytime soon...it will be months yet.

I don't belong here anyway.
