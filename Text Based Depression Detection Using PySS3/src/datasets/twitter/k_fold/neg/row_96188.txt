I need someone to talk to...Iâ€™m only keeping this as NSFW because of the topics. Iâ€™m also on mobile, if that changes anything. Sorry.
My mother does not care for my mental health concerns. She got mad and called me ridiculous for saying I wanted to die. Iâ€™ve plead for help, because Iâ€™ve felt this depression for nearly three years now. My dad who I feel safest around is away (military). Iâ€™m afraid my older sister would tell my mom. I feel so lost. My own mother doesnâ€™t care that I want to die. And that I fear for my mental stability. I get violent visions when Iâ€™m angry. At seven years old I recreated torture scenes, even though I never saw anything prior to make me come up with these. And Iâ€™ve gotten worse. Can someone please talk with me?
