I want to kill myself after losing my boyfriend. Has anyone else been here?I miss him so much and he made me infinitely happier than I ever knew I could be. Its been 3 months and I still feel suicidal every day and don't want to live without him. 

Is there anyone whos felt/feeling like this, reassurance would be nice.
