Worried about my boyfriend Had a family party to go to last night and spent the night. The next morning I get a call from my boyfriend, crying. We have been very low on money since he left his job and he decided to post on craigslist that he would do sexual favors for money. Someone responded and some things happened. My boyfriend said right after he kicked them out he tried to hang himself but just couldn't do it. I'm so worried to leave him alone. I took tomorrow off work to spend the day with him but I can't be around 24/7. I think getting tested for HIV/STDs will help but all of the clinics are closed tomorrow. This whole thing doesn't feel real. What can I do to make sure he will be ok?
