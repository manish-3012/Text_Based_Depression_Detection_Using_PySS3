I'm so miserable I can't even find a way of ending my lifeI do not want to try any method that is not fail-proof, and the only ways I see are dropping from a high place or shooting myself in the head. Unfortunately I'm far from having access to a gun and don't have the money to buy one. The only high place to jump I can think of is a bridge around 50 km from here (~30 miles) and I don't how I would get there. I thought of hanging myself in the woods but I could survive doing this. I don't want to live, I feel trapped in here because I don't want to be here and don't want my parents to feel bad, life is a fucking mental prison, I wish i had a shotgun to blast my head off.
