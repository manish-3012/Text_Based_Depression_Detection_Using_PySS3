Why?I have no friends. I have never had a girlfriend. I don't have prospects. I have applied to every type of job, gotten interviews, put on a fake smile and persona, but I never get the job. I've been unemployed for almost one year. 

I am unemployable and can't fit into society, why shouldn't I kill myself? Even if conditions were favorable, what is the point?
No really, what is the point? 

"You have to find your own meaning"
I've tried immersing myself in friends, working, dating, drugs, antidepressants, adapting a positive and new mindset. 
nothing ever works. ITS ALWAYS THE FUCKING SAME

Before you say you care, reflect upon it. Do you really care about some internet stranger, or are you just doing this for a sense of self-righteousness or altruism. 

Would you give up a day to help me? A week? Nobody can help me and its nobody elses fault. I am broken.
