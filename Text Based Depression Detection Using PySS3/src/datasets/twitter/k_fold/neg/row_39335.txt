I guess that is itI'm tired, no aspirations or goals, no one to talk to, I guess I'm an useful person to have around, but I'm tired of being just useful, I'm there when someone needs help, but no one is here for me. I expected more from college, even the passion I had for learning is gone now, I'm just living in a constant state of apathy, depression and sadness.
