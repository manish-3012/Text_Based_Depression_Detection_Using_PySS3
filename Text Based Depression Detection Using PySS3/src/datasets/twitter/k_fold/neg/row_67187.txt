In A Bit of a Jam-What do you do when someone tells you to just leave them alone?One of my internet friends has been talking about doing it, and I've been trying to talk with them the best I can. 

But today they said they want to actually go through with it. They then told me to just leave them alone and "let them die".

 Obviously, I would never ever want to see them do it. I've never been in this type of scenario, so I need to know: what are the best steps to take right now?
