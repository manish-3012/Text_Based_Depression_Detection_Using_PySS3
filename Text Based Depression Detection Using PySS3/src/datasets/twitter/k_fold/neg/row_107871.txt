Just venting I guessThings havenâ€™t been going well for me lately. It all may sound like no big deal. But my mind takes things and makes them bigger than they need to be. Anyways. I graduated high school in May and was actually very excited to study music in College and to begin my long journey in being a music performance major. Now for 7 years my passion was music. Iâ€™ve dreamed of playing in the greatest orchestras and bands and even the presidents own marine band. The summer went by surprisingly fast and I found myself slacking on practicing my instrument and lacking the motivation to do so. It made me very stressed and confused as to why I canâ€™t make myself do all these things. Anyways, I started University and things were going great until I got very very overwhelmed a good ways in. I didnâ€™t know what I was doing and if it was right for me and honestly going to school made me VERY depressed and so did graduating high school. The transition was dreadful and it didnâ€™t seem to go away. Everything I thought I knew about music was wrong and I couldnâ€™t get myself to learn any of it at all. I felt very stupid. I dropped out of college. That did make me very relieved and somewhat happy for a while. And then I started to lose all of my friends. I had no one except for my boyfriend. I didnâ€™t want to face my family and tell them that I wasnâ€™t going to school anymore. And the thought of disappointing literally everyone in my life made me fall back and I was worse than I was to begin with. Blah blah blah this goes on for a few months and I just decide to join the Air Force. Now I was actually very excited when the recruiter shook my hand and congratulated me on joining. Until I knew I would be disqualified for having self harm scars on my legs due to middle school me being dumb and dramatic. So now Iâ€™m here. With a mindset that nothing ever will go my way and everything gets worse. Thanks to whoever read this. I just canâ€™t deal with this any longer.
