I shouldnâ€™t be sad.My family loves me. They are doing better than they have ever done financially and emotionally. My boyfriend loves me. He has never stopped supporting me even when Iâ€™m unreasonable. He tells me and shows me how much he loves me everyday; I still canâ€™t believe heâ€™s mine. I recently graduated as the valedictorian of my class, and I am now heading to a prestigious university that I thought I always wanted to go to. I lost 45lbs through diet and exercise and now have the body I always wanted. I started a skincare routine and have the skin Iâ€™ve always dreamed of. I finally think I am pretty after years of only feeling like an ugly monster. I have friends who care about me. They never let me down and support even my boldest decisions. I have almost-endless freedom to explore what I want hobby-wise and interest-wise. I fully believe I can be successful in most anything I pursue as long as I work hard at it. 

My car is beautiful, and I cherish driving everyday. My bed is cozily warm every morning; I love the feeling. 
I love the taste of food and how excited I get over new items I get to try and eat. I love the chicken noodle soup my mother makes for me spontaneously. I love when my boyfriend hugs me from behind. I love his giddy smile and how excited he gets with his friends. I love him. I love my family, my friends, and everything I have in my life. 

Despite all this, I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I waste hours upon hours sobbing to myself in my car and in my bed. I love everything and everybody in my life, but Iâ€™m stupidly not happy. As delusional and immature as it sounds, I think Iâ€™m meant to kill myself. I cant shake the feeling. I havent been able to shake the feeling. Ive cried for years. Itâ€™s only gotten worse. Iâ€™ve desperately tried everything to improve myself and my life. Achievements and happy memories and meaningful relationships just seem to fuel the fire. Iâ€™m tired of this. Iâ€™m tired of crying.

I think life is beautiful, but I donâ€™t want to cry anymore. 

I am sincerely sorry to my friends, my family, my boyfriend, and to myself for being an ungrateful person. Iâ€™ve broken my own heart. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry.
