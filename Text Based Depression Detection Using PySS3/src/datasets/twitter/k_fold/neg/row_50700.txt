Posting here because the mods over at /r/relationships said it might fit better and removed my post there. I hope this is allowed, if not, no problem.

  


She told me this afternoon, and I just tried to be as supportive as possible. She said she hasn't had suicidal thoughts in a couple of years, but that she realises that doesn't mean they won't ever come back.

  


She's been to a bunch of psychologists in the past few years and it seems to have helped a lot.

  


The main reason she did this, was that her parents divorced and just were both really complicated, kind of fucked up people. She told me in the beginning that she never wanted to have kids (apparently because of this), but a while back she told me that, with me, she'd see a future with kids.

  


I come from a very stable, chill family, so I have no experience with this.

  


Basically I'm looking for some advice from people who've been in similar situations. Stuff that I need to keep in mind, avoid,...

  


Thanks in advance.
