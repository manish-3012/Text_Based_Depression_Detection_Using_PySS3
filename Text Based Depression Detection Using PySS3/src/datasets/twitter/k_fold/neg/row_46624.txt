Making it manageable for family.As you may know I have put a few posts up here before.

The main thing that has stopped me killing myself in the past is the pain it would cause my family.

By family  I mean my parents and my siblings. I have no kids.

This is driving me more fucking crazy and I hate them everyday for it.

I just want to die. Any suggestions of how I could make it more manageable or easier for them.

Thanks
