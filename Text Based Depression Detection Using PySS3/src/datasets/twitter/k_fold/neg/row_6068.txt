GoneI want to be gone. I see it coming soon. Hopefully within the next 6 months, I just need to follow thru with it. My biggest fear is living after and facing the shame and disappointment of everyone around me. I simply want to not live anymore idk why there has to be a stigma about it. Others are being selfish by saying somebody shouldnâ€™t end their life, but what do you know. What do you know about them, what if they just want to. Itâ€™s ultimately everyoneâ€™s free will I just want to be gone and thatâ€™s it.
