i really want to diethereâ€™s so many small things that have been building up inside me for the past few months. iâ€™m so unhappy with my body and i canâ€™t seem to lose weight, iâ€™m either eating everything in sight or not eating at all. i donâ€™t understand why i am here, i donâ€™t a future for me and wouldnâ€™t be surprised if i killed myself before i finish university. i always feel like im alone and unwanted no matter the situation. i just canâ€™t wait for this to be over
