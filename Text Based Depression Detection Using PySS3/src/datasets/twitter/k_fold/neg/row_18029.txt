It's that time of the year, I smoke now.Just relapsed on cigarettes after 8 months of quitting. It's that time of the year again. Today's my mother's birthday. 7 days from now on, on December 5 2017, my brother who was 29 committed suicide. I don't know what's going on anymore. Last 8 months I've been feeling psychotic, paranoid. There's no one left with me. No one cares. I texted some friends. Some are busy, some... don't care it seems. It resonates so much with me, you can check my post history... I don't know what. I feel peace for last days. It feels good to finally be smoking again. I haven't done drugs since last winter. But it doesn't get better. Can I just get some words maybe? That it gets better. Or it doesn't ever. I'm not exactly sure I will kill myself soon but.. I don't know. Just felt like leaving some piece. My mother is abusive and I literally have no one and no hope left. All this stuff. Confused guy, just 19 years old. But yeah, thanks for reading.
