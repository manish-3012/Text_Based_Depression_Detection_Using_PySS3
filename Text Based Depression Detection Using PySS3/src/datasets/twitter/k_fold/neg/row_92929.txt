His suicide changed my lifeHi all, I didn't know where else to post this and I've been putting the words together in my mind for a while now.

I come from a smallish town in Ohio, just big enough to always find new faces. While in high school I struggled with anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicidal thoughts and attempts. At one point in my life, I really thought it was all over. I truly believed that I had nothing left to live for. In November and January of 2016, I attempted to take my own life. The last time I harmed was in February of 2017, and during that month, something happened in my small town that would forever change my life.

I woke up on Sunday to messages from my fellow band students alerting me to multiple news articles. A freshman in our band, a 15 year old boy, had committed suicide. In the aftermath I was left speechless. That Monday at school, we had a moment of silence for him. I walked past people in the halls who knew him - friends and teachers, who were crying. I don't think I talked much that day. All I could think about was how he was gone, and I couldn't even believe it. The only thoughts in my mind were scrambled memories of his face in the band room and on the marching field. I remembered a joke he had once told me and my friends. I never even suspected that he was being bullied or felt so alone. I never would have thought he was capable of something like this. The first week after his death was so hard for me. I couldn't believe how life just carried on despite his absence. We still went to class, did our homework, took our tests, went to band practice, and lunch, and everything in between. He just wasn't there for any of it. That Friday, what seemed like the entire school plus faculty had gathered for his memorial. I stood in line with my friends as we waited to pay our respects at his casket. My band director from middle school came to hug us, and told us to be mentally prepared for what we were about to see. In all honesty, nothing could have prepared me for what was in that room. 

I shook hands with his family, they thanked us for coming, and I said what is typical in this situation. There was nothing left to do but look into the casket. My heart was racing and I finally looked up from the floor, only to see his pale, powdery, lifeless body. His skin was so white it easily could have blended into the fabric lining the inside of his casket. His lips were so faded they blended in with the rest of his face, his eyes were closed, and his face was heavily powdered. I looked for any sign of life, a breath, a tremor, but there was no movement, no nothing. Stillness. Absolute stillness. I couldn't process any of it before I started crying. All I could think to myself is, "Where is he? Where did he go?" to which I told myself "He's gone." No amount of words I type can even begin to explain the emotion I was feeling. I was so overcome with grief and confusion. I just didn't understand. I still don't understand. That was the first time I had seen a dead body as a more matured person. I had been to my grandparents' funerals when I was younger, but I didn't even try to understand. This time, I knew exactly what I was looking at: someone who was dead. Someone who I remembered so vividly as being full of life, now devoid of it. To this day, I can still remember exactly how he looked in that casket, and it's made me so grateful for the fact that I survived. Seeing him go gave me a new appreciation for my life, and I have never even thought about harming myself or dying since he passed. I make it a priority to think of him often, and to remember him the way I think he would want to be remembered: doing what he loved, making music and making sure everyone around him was either laughing or smiling. 

Death still confuses me, that hasn't changed I'm afraid to say. What haunts me still today is how lifeless he was, and how life always finds a way to carry on. Life stops for nothing, and I wish that was comforting. It's actually terrifying.
