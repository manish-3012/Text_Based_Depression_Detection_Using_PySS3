I'm tired of being told everyone is entitled their opinion about my very existenceI hate that opinions come at my from every angle. I have to deal with racism because it's just some people's opinions. Then the people who understand what I'm going through race wise are the same people who turn their backs and tell me why homosexuality is wrong. It's like whereever I go unless I'm with the few people who fall into my "box" people just don't get it. I'm tired of making long analogies so that people can try to understand what I'm going through just for them to say "well I'm just not comfortable with seeing gay people. I just don't like being around too many black people or latinos because they don't have anything." I'm just tired knowing that this will always last. Even the people closest to me will always just tolerant these things about me but will never accept me. Will never agree that my humanity deserves the same as them and in the back of their minds are wishing people like me would go back to being quiet and invisible. Even just being a woman and seeing how much backlash the MeToo movement is getting is horrifying. No matter how much changes I'll always have to watch out for people who feel this way while smiling in my face. People who believe in things that directly hurt me and people like me. I'm just so tired because everyone has opinions about other people but at the end of the day my opinion, the people who hold similar opinions to me are the minority and will always be shouted over by the majority. They'll always be unaffected by what I say or do meanwhile all it takes is one person in a higher social position than me to knock me down. I'm just so tired. It's going to get better sure but I won't be here to see it. There's always going to be something. The goal post of when it's going to get better is always going to move. It was supposed to be better now and because it's not ridiculously horrible people think everything is good. But it's not. One day one day one day. Who knows when that day will come? If everyone is entitled to their opinions then it never will. As long as people view homophobia, racism and everything in between as just opinions it'll never get better. Opinions can be harmful. Opinions mean things.
