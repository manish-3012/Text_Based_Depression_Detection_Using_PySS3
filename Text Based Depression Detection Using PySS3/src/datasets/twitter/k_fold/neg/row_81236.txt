Feeling overwhelmed and suicidalMy dad's been abusing drugs for two years, and it's getting to me. Im depressed. I'm 22, about to graduate college, but i'm so overwhelmed I honestly want it to end. I know im close. Im hanging on as much as i can, but it's so hard to focus. He's overdosed a number of times this past semester, all on my watch. Ive had to leave class and take on responsibilities i never imagined. My mother's complacent. Im supposed to be moving away for a job soon, but i feel like if i'm not here to watch him he'll die. Im so anxious all the time, I feel like i'm breathing in sulfur. I had to leave my place because it was hard to study with him around. And now im living with my friend and her parents and I feel like such a burden.

 I know reddit isn't the place for sob stories, but i'm looking for a reason. I feel hopeless. Is he ever going to get better. Will this pain end?
