my anxiety and depression is killing mei dont know how much longer i can hold out. i feel sick and worried and nervous and sad all the time and its emotionally draining everyone i love and care about. i want therapy so badly but i cant afford it. i feel trapped. i feel like the best out i can take is tie a noose and end it
