Small things make me feel so depressed2 small things happened today. In the morning I walked into the elevator in my company's building, then another employee that I don't know walked in after me. I smiled at him and asked "what floor?" but that guy just started looking at me like I have some kind of contagious disease. After few seconds he pressed the bottom for himself.

Later today, I got off work and walked towards the elevator. The door was open and there's a lady in it. I wanted to catch the elevator so I walked faster and said to her "sorry can you hold...", but that lady was just looking at me without any expression on her face. The door closed just the time I reached it. Last thing I saw was she starring at me. Not only did I miss the elevator, but I looked very awkward and embarrassing in front of my coworkers.

I've already been in a very very bad mood recently because some terrible things happened to me. And what happened today just dragged me into a deeper level of depression. The part that hurts me most is realizing the fact that I am so weak and fragile, and that I am having a hard time because of small things that other people would laugh about and forget in the next second. I always tried to be a nice person, but sometimes when you are treated like shit in return for being nice, you just don't wanna live anymore.
