My mind is brokenIt just feels like I'm broken, my mind is split between what I believe and what I know is right  


Most of my family dislikes me  
I'm closet Christian to my family and friends  
They don't know my true views on life  
They don't know I'm suicidal  


Even if I can't kill myself because of my mother's disappointment, I know something isn't right
