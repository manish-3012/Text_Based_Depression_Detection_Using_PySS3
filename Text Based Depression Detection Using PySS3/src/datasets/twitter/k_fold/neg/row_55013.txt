Feeling the Tiredness ReturningAbout 4 years ago I tried to CTB, I had been dumped 5 months prior and didn't really speak to anyone about anything for those 5 months. I already had no self esteem/confidence, and I just became so mentally tired. It was like my mind was in a cage, I was so alone wanting to scream but felt I didn't deserve any help.  

I write this because I feel the mental exhaustion returning, I have tried but these 4 years of little social interaction have made it so hard for me to connect with anyone on any level (basically I missed some of the biggest socially developmental years of my life). I have been trying lately but I can't seem to get there. I don't have a relationship ending to attach it to either. I guess I just feel entirely alone.  

I also feel like I have broken the sanctity of my life, so getting to the point of CTB would not be as difficult as it was before.
