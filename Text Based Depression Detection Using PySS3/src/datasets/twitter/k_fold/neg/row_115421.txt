Just waiting now I just found this subreddit today, but I wanted to say I have seen compassion from the people here in far larger quantities than I ever saw it in life. 

As I'm sitting here, waiting for it to end, I was struck by a fear that everyone would forget me and I would eventually just fade from memory. I never made much of an impact on the lives of the students at my school (I guess some of them will have to find someone else to copy off of) but I hope the teachers will remember me.

I was the child my parents never wanted, I never lived up to their perfectionist standards and even now I wonder if they will look down on me for swallowing pills instead of shooting myself as I tried once before.

Its too late for me, I died inside sophomore year and I've just been faking it ever since. I just wanted someone, anyone, to hear my story before I pass from this life, as pathetic as it may be.
