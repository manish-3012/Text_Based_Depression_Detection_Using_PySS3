I can't go on.I'm writing this with the door locked. I feel like screaming. I can barely see through my teary eyes. Where do I even begin? I'm a victim of the gene pool in every regard. I'm shorter than most, I have a lesser than average dick, I have depression, and I have a degree of social anxiety. I feel like I'm done puberty, and I can't even grow a beard. It's a patchy disgusting mess. My senior year of high school is about to begin, and I can't do it. I can't go on. It's not the school I don't mind, it's the fact that everyday I feel like I'm walking towards a gaping empty hole of loneliness. I have a few friends, but my feelings of worthlessness prevents me from maintaining healthy relationships with them. I push them away. I feel like I'm living a lie because I put on a mask of happiness at school, pretending to be okay for the people I love, but it's so tiring. These feelings have been building up for as long as I can remember. I don't know anything other than emptiness. I'm working towards a meaningless life. How can I live knowing I will never be tall enough or sexually adequate enough? I'm not ugly by any means, but my height and my dick make me feel like a disgusting abomination. Why would I ever want to pass on these cursed genes? I'm too scared to tell anybody. My parents and brother aren't keen on mental health. My social anxiety makes me terrified to see a professional. But my own existence is hurting me. I feel like a disappointment. It's never been this bad before. On top of that, University applications are coming up and that scares the shit out of me. I'm crying now because I can't handle it. I'm too scared to commit suicide.
