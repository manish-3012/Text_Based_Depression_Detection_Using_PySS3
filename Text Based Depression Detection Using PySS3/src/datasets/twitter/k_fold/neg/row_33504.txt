What a shitshow.â€œOne must imagine sisyphus happyâ€ Camus said. 

And well, Iâ€™ve tried to do that Albert. Sometimes when I watch the sunset a tear forms in my eye, and I donâ€™t know what to call that feeling or what it means but, I havenâ€™t been able to find someone that cries when they look at the sun too. And I havenâ€™t been really having the time of my life clocking in. People are dying and starving across the street from a Michelin star restaurant. And community! I belong to none. I canâ€™t go anywhere I want because Iâ€™ll be jailed for trying. Iâ€™m supposed to maintain my health, and thatâ€™s been going pretty well. I stretch, I read my books, I learn, I exercise, I prepare nourishing meals, and I do all of these things for what? 

For the future, for tomorrow, for â€œone dayâ€. 

Iâ€™m not even old enough to buy myself a beer, and maybe thatâ€™s a good thing, I would probably buy a lot of it. 

10 years seems like a long time. I havenâ€™t existed as this â€œmeâ€ for even 5, and I already feel as if Iâ€™ve lived a thousand lives. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m exhausted. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. Iâ€™m not looking for anyoneâ€™s words of encouragement. Itâ€™s a shit show this life thing. Youâ€™re supposed to pick, daily - to light a cigarette or eat a fruit. To indulge, to restrain. To love, to hate. It all seems like too much investment for too little of a return. I donâ€™t see any of this panning out to something grand, I just want to have a good time. Not to suffer. Sisyphus isnâ€™t smiling.
