Online friend threatened to commit suicideSo I have a person I recently befriended online, my friends and I have played with him quite a bit together. He was telling us about his situation and how crappy it is (I won't go into detail unless requested) before, but randomly out of the blue tonight he posted in our group chat a suicide note saying that we would hear about him in the news or something and that it was too late. We were able to talk him down from it after about an hour thankfully. After we talked him down I was able to narrow down the town he lived in; in case I had to call the police to check in on him. 

Part of me really wants to just wants to think he's trolling or looking for attention, but I take suicide very seriously after having some close people to me commit it. I told him to seek professional help ASAP and next time something like this happened to go to the ER. The whole ordeal was really draining. 

I'm kind of torn. Part of me wants to wash my hands on the whole ordeal and block him on everything and disappear so I don't have to stress myself out over every time he feels suicidal. That or have me be communicating with him at the time if he actually does it; something I could not live with. I worry that this may even just be a ploy to get attention as I have known people who have done that before too. The other part of me can't bring myself to do something like that to someone who is potentially in need. 

I'm not sure where to go from here. 

TLDR; have an online friend who threatened to commit suicide and not sure how to handle it next time.
