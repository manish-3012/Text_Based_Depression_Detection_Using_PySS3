pathetici feel like everything i do is wrong... i've felt like this my whole life but its worse in quarantine. i feel like i don't belong. like nothing i do or say really matters (dont pity me and say it does) and that i'm doing everyone a disservice by being here. i can't do anything right at all, my own existence is trivial to me even... like it's laughable and pathetic. i want a do over. i feel like i'm trapped in this life and i just really want to leave. its suffocating, like i'm drowning and i just keep sinking deeper and deeper and the pressure of it all hurts so much. the older i get the deeper i sink and there's this constant weight on me that is merely my own existence. i want nothing to do with myself and i really wish there was a way out. i need to escape but i have no idea how because i'd have to be escaping myself. i don't really think i'm going to kill myself because there's no painless way out... but idk i don't think these thoughts will ever go away
