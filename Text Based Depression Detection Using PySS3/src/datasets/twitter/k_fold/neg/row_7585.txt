Every day I try to work up the courage to go get somewhere new to live so that I can finally end this. Every day I fail and am too much of a coward to go do it and end this.Every day I know I should have killed myself back a long time ago. I know I shouldn't have put off my suicide, because now I'm too scared and it's hard.

But every day I try harder to go get my place so I can just do it. I wish I had done it all those months ago.

And at the end of the day, if I just sucked it up, I could live. **But I'm too weak or lazy. Other people decide to work hard and try and live. And because I don't, it's not depression, it's not mental illnesss, I'm just a weak pathetic lazy loser.**

I'm sorry to all my loved ones, even though you don't see this. 

I'm not in any danger now. But I have to go soon. I have to eventually. I love you B.
