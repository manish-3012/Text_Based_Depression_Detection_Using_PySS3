I'm done.I've decided I'm going to starve myself, but going to disguise it as a healthy diet at first so the few people around me don't get suspicious. I'm going to act "normal" with the knowledge of what I'm doing. I'll fade away that way. I can't think of what else to do that's guaranteed and I've looked at assisted suicide, but that entails giving someone else control over me again. Subconsciously started cutting my intake down to almost nothing in January but ended up getting hospitalised for an illness and they pumped me full of fluids, so all my progress was lost. I was secretly hoping for a worst case scenario where it was lethal and I wasn't going to make it, but that wasn't the case. Realised that I stop eating when I'm suicidal, so my body's telling me that's the way it should go. Also realised that no one came to see me at hospital. No one cares about me. I should have died in the accident last year. I should not be here. I'm a useless sack of bones and flesh. No one will ever love me. The one person I care about the most disappears frequently and doesn't answer me. I'm looking at all the stuff around me and wondering why a piece of nothing like me is allowed to even own anything. My brain is telling me to end itself and the body it's in. Because its "files" are mostly corrupted.

I can't deal with how my life has gone. I've tried to have relationships with people but no one will ever love or care about me. I decorated the flat I had with my ex-boyfriend in 2013 but he said I was "Just such a bitch," in the end and that he was sick of all my problems when I tried to talk to him about my feelings. He said he didn't even want to live with me in the first place and called me names every day. He sexually assaulted me. He shoved me. Everyone always finds someone better than me. I tried to start over, but the person I started to care about disappeared for a long time and I think it's happening again. During his disappearance I ended up in a relationship where I was told to get out of the person's flat in the middle of the night, hundreds of miles away from my home, because of how awful I was. Because of how much of a problem I am. I've lost so many people. I'm always second choice. No one wants me for me. I'm at the point where I can't talk to anyone about it anymore because they'll think I'm attention-seeking. Even my friend who was in the same hospital as me for the same reason; I can't talk to him about it. I just can't. I don't know what to say. It's not like he can do anything anyway. I've been like this since I was at least 15 and periods below that age, and I'm nearly 28 now. It did not get better. It doesn't fucking get better. This is just bullshit. Suicide prevention "help" is bullshit. I've been through the crisis team again, and was kept on for three months because I couldn't stop making attempts. When they go away, the thoughts remain.

I was never supposed to be here for any other purpose than to be a punching bag. I don't want that anymore, so when I die, no one will get to humiliate me like I've been humiliated.
