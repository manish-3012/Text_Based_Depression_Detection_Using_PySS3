Logical??I've been through reddit randomly, but never commented or posted and have been meaning to open a discussion about feelings I have.
Ill try to simplify this, but itll probably be long still.

Depression started maybe when I was 12-13 and started cutting. Im 26 now. Growing up, parents would just smoke weed, which nothing wrong with that, but I never had a bond with them. In fact, I (out of my brother and sister) am the one who didnt get along with my parents at all. Dad would fight me and mum would cuss at me pretty often. 
When I was 14-15 we moved to Guatemala. Great place, but horrible memories. Saw someone get burned alive, first time seeing someone get shot and die in front of me, felt dread over possibly having no good future/education in a third world country. First pitiful suicide attempt, I tried to hang myself, but the pipe I hung the cord on broke. Parented ended up cheating and lying to each other so after a year, my mum brought me, my sister, and brother back to the states. 
At this point im 15-16. Mum worked all the time to afford our shit apartment and wanted us to stay inside after school, but I was the one to go out and do what I wanted. Only have a handful of friends so would hang out with them, be at the library, or just walking around downtown. My depression started getting worse and I ended up talking to a counsellor who referred me to a therapist and I started meds. Mum and I are arguing one day and I try to exit the apartment to cool off (cause I was insanely furious, more so than ever) she grabs me and tries to wrestle me back into the apartment, but I resist and try to leave while shes hitting me. The cops get called and Im the one who gets arrested. 
Spent my 17th birthday in juvi. During court she tells the judge that she doesnt feel comfortable/safe (cant remember exactly which word she used) with me in the  house. So I was to be sent into state custody. My uncle eventually comes and says he will take responsibility for me to prevent that happening. So I go to live with him at my grandpa's about an hour away from my mums. 
17 living with family I hardly know with no friends and no cell phone to even consider messaging old friends. My depression gets worse. My uncle ends up skipping town and I find a girlfriend at school (S). I fall in love, blah blah blah. She cheats on me like 7 times and constantly breaks up with me, but im an idiot and keep taking her back.
Now 18, I graduate highschool and S breaks up again and leaves for the Navy. Meet another girl (J) a few months later that I like, but didn't love like S. We live together and spend the next 4ish years together. We fought, id say it was 50/50 with who would start the fights.  During this time I had one or two more suicide attempts.
Skip to being 22ish and I'm talking to S again. She got married, had a kid, the dad stopped caring after the kid was born. I leave J to fly to the other side of the country to be with S until she leaves the military. Were together for a few months before I come back home to find a job and build up money so we could get a place. That doesn't happen. She breaks up with me and fucks like 2-3 guys before she hits me up and tells me shes in town. Of course my dumbass invites her back with open arms. We end up getting a place and living together with her son for about 2 years. 
She wouldn't work a job for more than a few weeks before quitting and my depression started getting unbearable. I started cutting a lot more during this time. I try therapy again and get diagnosed with Bipolar 1 (not sure if its accurate but symptoms suggest it is). I end up losing my job because i cannot bring myself to go to work. We end up getting rear ended near the house and the car is totalled. So now no job, no money, we lose the apartment. I move in with a friend from highschool who I was not very fond of and she moved in with her dad. About a month into this she breaks up with me again and cuts off all contact. I spend the next year crying constantly, barely able to leave bed, doing tons of lsd and I began making plans to kill myself using a handgun.
One day about a month after I turned 25, something clicked. Idk how or why, but I wasn't so depressed and didn't want to die. I started working, I started eating healthy and even put on 60lbs of mainly muscle. 
I turned 26 and i was still extremely happy with being alone and working out.
Until recently. I met a girl (V). And I think she is incredible. She doesn't seem like a piece of shit like S and I feel more for her than I did with J. But my anxieties and depression or bipolar whatever the fack are getting in the way. I was perfectly happy being alone and now it's miserable unless I'm talking to or around V. She seems interested but im not entirely sure. Weve been on two dates and weve kissed, but that could mean anything. 
The whole point is that it makes me feel weak to want someone else. I think its bs that Im not currently happy not giving a damn what anyone thinks. And my mood has been flipping hard and fast for weeks now. I honestly want to kill myself. I dont have many people at all here for me. I havent done much with my life because I was too busy chasing after girls or being broken. To me it just makes sense to end it now. The way i see if is I wish I wouldve died when I was 15-16. If I wouldve i couldve avoided these unpleasentries. And if i wait, theres only going to be more.
I just want to know if this also makes sense to anyone else?
