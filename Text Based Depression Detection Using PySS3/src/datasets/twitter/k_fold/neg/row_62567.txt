What do you think?I can barely muster the will to write this, I don't  want to live, I figgured that I never did. I don't find my life bad, not really, it's actually pretty good and I could keep on living if I wanted to, but I just don't, I have no reasons of my own to live and every time I try to think about the good things in the world I end up remembering all the bad things in it, most of which are not happening to me, despite that I can't seem to enjoy life nor can I see myself enjoying it in the future, living has become nothing more than routine to me, something I do without any reason, every day is the same and when I try to change things a bit by going to a friend's house or doing some exercises I feel like I'm not doing it for myself, I'm doing it for the people that care about me, to sum it up I'm just alive right now because I think that I would be a headache to the people around me if I died, which you may find weird since most, if not all, suicidal people want to die because they think they are useless and/or a burden to those around them which is why I can never find people in the same situation as me whenever I go online to try and find some help. I've read stories of I don't know how many people who wanted to die or who tried to kill themselves, but I couldn't find help in any of them because their reasons to want to kill themselves are based on how much they think of themselves as a problem or a failiure, I on the other hand think that I'm capable of pretty much anything if I just put effort into it and think that I'm more useful and less of a burden to those around me if I'm alive, but I've never wanted something in my life so badly as I want death, there's nothing in this world that I want as much as the embrace of nothingness (or whatever afterlife there may be). When people asked me what I wanted to be when I grow (grew?) up, I'd either say I wanted to be a teacher or not say anything at all, it's just that that's my plan B, it's probably the second best option after suicide, but ironically, death is the only thing I truly want in life. My only "dream" is to die and that's it, I wouldn't trade death even for an easy life, like, think of the easiest life you could imagine, I would still prefer death to that, so no, I don't just want an easy way out or anything like that, I just want death, nothing more nothing less. I think that maybe by putting my thoughts here I can find someone with whom I can relate to or maybe someone who ralates to me finds this, either way at this point I'm not sure if I'm asking for help or if I've accepted that I just want a thing most people don't but I think I wanted and needed to try and express how I feel to someone.
