I can't do anything rightI'm so tired. Everything in my life keeps falling apart at the seams, and I keep hanging on and telling myself to keep going, and all the while it's like my brain keeps getting ground down--sandpapered down--and nobody gives a shit. 

I can't do it anymore. I don't want to keep crying every single day. I don't want to try and muster up emotions. I don't want to do this anymore. I just want it to end.
