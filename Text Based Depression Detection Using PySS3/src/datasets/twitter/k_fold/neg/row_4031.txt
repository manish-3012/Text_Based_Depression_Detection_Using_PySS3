HonestStraight up like it or not people don't give a shit about you. We're all useless and irrelevent in this world. If I die no one will care. That's how life is, will always be. People that say "your life is valuable". No! It's not. The way I view life is what I call. LSID (Live, Suffer, Influence, Die) That's all we do in this planet. I wonder why we were put here just for that? I see so many posts here. I wish I can help you all but I can't even help myself. This life is not for people like me. I tried changing and was slingshoted back to sadness. This legit sucks. The problem with many of us is the lack of love. We feel lonely and alone.
