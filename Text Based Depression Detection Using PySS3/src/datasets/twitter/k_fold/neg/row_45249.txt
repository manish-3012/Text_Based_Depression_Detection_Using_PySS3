Feeling helplessHi, I'm writing because my feelings of hopelessness and suicidal ideation are pretty high and I am having a hard time keeping myself together. For context, it's my finals week and I just missed a deadline for a large assignment. This event has been the straw that broke my back and I feel like I'm spiraling. I have a meeting I need to be at in 20 minutes, and hopefully I will go to check myself in to the ER, but right now I'm hurting and desperately want it to end. I don't have a plan, but if I did pursue this, I'd probably overdose on meds I have at home. I can't call the hotline or textline because I left my phone in someone else's car.

I want so badly to not feel this way, and despite therapy and meds these feelings have persisted and continue to bubble. I don't want to die, I want help and I want to survive but my anxieties and depression as a result of the anxieties are making me sink
