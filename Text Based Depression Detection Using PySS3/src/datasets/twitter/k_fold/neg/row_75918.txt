I'm not suicidal but I want to dieBefore I begin, I'd like to say that I really hope that I'm posting to the right place. I'm so confused as to what to call my condition. I don't put myself in dangerous situations intentionally or attempt suicide. I've thought about it numerous times but I don't think I'd ever do it. What I want is more or less to fall asleep and never wake up. I take drugs and the I'm not very concerned about overdose. I usually just smoke pot and drink occasionally. I like dxm too, but less frequently. I have so many abstract thoughts about life and the universe, and all the possibilities and shit. Like a 16 year old Rick. TINY RICK BITCHES! But on a more serious note I'm really looking for help from people who have been where I am now. I've been trying to think more positively in general to stop being such a cynic. I always seem to find the negative side of everything, but just like yin and yang there's always good hidden in the bad. Please help me find this good because it's only a matter of time before I end up like the rest of my family, brain dead with a needle in their arm. My father already had to pull the life support plug on his own brother and he's lost his mom as well. I abhor the thought of hurting my family any more than I already have, I don't need to be happy but I want to lift people up instead of being such an emotional anchor. 

TL;DR: I don't want to die but I wouldn't mind dying. i.e. If a guy was mugging me with a gun I'd tell him to put his money where his mouth is. I'm an emotional anchor dragging people down and all I want is to lift them up.
