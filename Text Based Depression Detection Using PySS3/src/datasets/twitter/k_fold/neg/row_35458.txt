I hate my life...Last night my girlfriend the love of my life just packed up her shit and left to her mom's out of nowhere. I feel so lonely and like I have no friends. She was all I had. I feel like a massive piece of shit who deserves everything bad that happens to me. I tried to OD on my heart meds this morning, but couldn't bring myself to do it because my dog was giving me puppy dog eyes about thinking they were treats. If it wasn't for him I'd be dead by now. I feel like that's the only way to stop being unhappy. I honestly feel like nobody cares what happens to me. I don't know what to do anymore. I just wish I had friends or someone to talk to..
