I am addicted to my girlfriendIt's my first time in a relationship like this. We've been dating for 7 months. I really love her, but I think I became very dependent on her. I can't stand to think about she leaving me. I already had suicidal thoughts before meeting her, but now I feel like It would be much more easier to kill myself If she left me. Don't get me wrong, I would never use this as threat to make her stay, I love her more than anything and I want to see her happy, even if that means  she has to stay away from me. Well, just wanna know if there's anything I can do to feel less dependent, idk.
