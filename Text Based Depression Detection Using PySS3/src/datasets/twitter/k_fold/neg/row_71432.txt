I (22, F) Really Need HelpI've never been one to seek attention or anything like this. I was an IV Heroin user since I just turned 18 until I was a little over 21. I moved away (from AK to CA) from everyone and everything to get clean.  I'm almost 23 and haven't touched it since. I'm at the end of my rope. I've tried so hard, but I'm still so lost and still have nothing.. My mom told everyone about my addiction, and they completely turned away from me. I lost all family and most of my friends. I was always a decent person though. Never stole or did anything shiesty. Now, I'm about to leave an extremely physically and mentally abusive relationship. I'm about to be homeless and literally on the streets. I'm so scared. It almost seems easier to end everything than to fall into addiction and such hopelessness again. . I don't know what to do. I'm so scared. Please.. I want to keep fighting. I just don't know how..
