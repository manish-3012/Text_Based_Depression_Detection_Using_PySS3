How the fuck would I not want to die.Everything I do is terrible. I tried writing and my 100th fucking attempt was somehow worse than the first. I'm trying to draw now and after a year and a half a 13 year old could do better. I'm terrible at making friends, I even question my goddamn sexuality 90% of the time, I can't stand my own toxic behaviour and no matter how much I've tried, anxiety and trauma are still stuck to my heart and brain like a C4, waiting to make me go mad at any second now. Death seems like even the most harm-reduction I could possibly do to avoid dissapointing the tiny handful of people that still somehow believe in me. I'm a fucking embarassement, I can't even write in proper english, and I some motherfucking how fuck up even more in my mother language. I just can't take this shit anymore. And guns aren't even legal here so I can't even kill myself properly. Just end me.
