I deserve thisI deserve this. I was so clinging. Afraid of losing them but I just ended up losing them. Friends of many so years don't mean shit. They all leave and abandon you in the end. I was manipulated and emotionally abusive to her. I deserve every bad thing, every horrible thing coming towards me. I didn't deserve to be with her. I don't deserve living. I'm honeslty just a waste of space. Better people could take my place and make a much better impact. I'm counting the days when I complete it. The thoughts bring me confront. I don't want to go back to the hospital again. It needs to go through properly this time. Don't chicken out.
