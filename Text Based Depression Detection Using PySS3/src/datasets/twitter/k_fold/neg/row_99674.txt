Unbreakable ties. (tl;dr at end, kinda?)It's really the only reason I'm actually living currently.

I live an absolutely hopeless life.  I'm young, yes, only 17.  I haven't really been through any physical shit, though, just really mental.

It all felt really mellow, calm, and weak.  Those are the words I can think of to describe it right now.  Years have blended together, and I don't remember many parts of my life, even though it's so short.

I don't remember anything in detail before February 27th.  A few days after my birthday.  If you ask me to remember my birthday, I just remember the cake my brother got the image on it for.  It was some ironic meme I really liked and I couldn't stop laughing, and I think that was the best laugh I had ever had in my life.  Then my dad left us "for good", only to return 3 months later, without warning.

I don't share things with friends.  I've never really had a real friend.  The closest I've had to this day is someone who's arguably more mentally fucked up than I am.  I haven't gone to the beach with some friends, or had a campfire with toasted marshmallows.  The closest thing I've had to that is going on a small camping trip where, while we did do those things, there was infighting before the trip, so it wasn't easy talking and whatnot.  As usual, I played as the guy who would start conversations, act like the idiot I've always been to cheer people up, make jokes, play along, you get the idea.

I've only really been useful as a tool.  My life, beginning from when I got an injury, has been this way.  A condition fucked up my leg (It's considered a "disease" but it really isn't, it's just an internal physical fuck up) and I couldn't continue my martial arts.  I was 3 belts away from a black belt, and the injury worsened dramatically on the day of my graduation to the next one, to the point where I had to cancel my part on the very day.  I felt so ashamed, even though it wasn't anything I could control.

From then on, the doctors told me I couldn't do physical activity.  I was skinnier than a string bean so I saw this as a positive thing at first, but no man, no.  It ruined my life.  The worst part of it was that it was so insignificant; nobody could really realize it was there.  I could feel the disappointment seeping through my P.E teachers' eyes.  I would just sit out every damn time because I had no fucking choice.

Ever since then.  I became a tool.  I couldn't walk home, I couldn't walk with my friends home.  I couldn't walk to McDonalds at lunch time, I couldn't walk to my school.  I spent time alone.  So, so much time alone.  I read shitty books, I started playing video games more, I was so close to becoming a shut in, but then this girl came into our school when I was in Grade 7.  (G6 was when I was injured)

Lots of details cut, I got a crush on her.  Skip to Grade 10, after lots happened in between, she one day comes to our normal classmate lunch spot on the verge of crying.  I, self-proclaimed genius, end up saying the EXACT wrong words; not exaggeration or anything, either, I basically explained the problem, said why it's bad, then said "but it's fine!!!", to sum it up.  Shunned by the mass over there, and so, so fucking rightfully so, I walk back to the corner, with the thought "holy shit, did I deserve that!", the feeling of a despicable human being, eating my lunch, and get this; she comes over to me and gives me pity.

Yep, about right at that point, I realized something.  Two things, actually.  

1.  I don't deserve this.

2.  Why?

Why did she have to do it?  I don't know.  I'll never know.  I could ask, but I won't get a right answer, let's be honest.

I have ties, now.  I think now that if that had never happened, my exit from this shitty existence would just be a detriment to my parents and brother, but no.  Now I've got someone else I owe it to.

I'm just a tool.  I didn't explain earlier, but when my parents were in constant quarrels, I was the tiebreaker.  My brother is the literal definition of an asshole and an airhead, my dad is an idiot to such an extent that he ends up just being an ass, and my mom is the definition of pity.

My brother, two years younger than me, smokes weed frequently, does really fucking stupid shit ever since he started, acts like an asshole, and forces me to listen to rap, convinced that I am supposed to like it.  Spoilers: I despise rap, but nothing goes through his head.  This mess of a human is the direct result of my parents being too late.  My dad leaving was the ignition to his engine of wrongdoings.

My mom being the definition of pity, is a fucking airhead.  After all the time; from 2015 to early 2017, that I spent trying to help her with my dad, she takes it all for granted, focuses on herself once he left, and completely forgets that she has another son; my brother.

My dad, Sir. Fuckington the Idiot, III, leaves for 3 months, only a few days after my birthday, and when he comes back, completely without warning, he acts as if he never left, and as if he's a better person.  I was introduced to another mask.  It looks just like the ones all the people in my school wear, except it's much lighter, since you can actually see the absolute asshat peeking through time to time.  The eyeholes are too big, in my opinion.

I helped my mom with her emotional struggle with my dad, I helped my dad become a better person, which he always tries to act like he is one, except he's a pretty big idiot, so there's that, and then there's my brother.  I can't do anything about him, so I urge my parents to take some sort of fucking action, but they're both FUCKERS who don't have any brains as far as I'm fucking aware.

And, of course, there's her.  This girl who just drops into my life like I owe her something, makes me love her, and then, she's leaving after Grade 12.  All the while, she's harboring more pain than I could imagine of.

[tl;dr?]

Man, how the fuck am I supposed to live with this?  This is bullshit.  I'm good at this, but I never get a fucking chance to show it to anyone but family.  They barely deserve it, they just took it for granted, and now they too wear masks.  I'm sick of this, and I want to just fucking scream.  Maybe this is all I should've said.  Everyone around me is hiding.  I've gone so far to just hide my depression to bring out people's true emotions, but they hide.  I talk to them with my mental state in mind, and they just brush it off.  "I'm fine".  You're becoming adults, for fucks sake, TALK like adults.

No, everyone hides everything.  I'm living in a world where everyone's playing hide and seek, except when I find them, they just say "No, but I'm actually invisible!" as if we were 6, making up bullshit about how we're invincible, invisible, angels and demons, gods and demigods.

I fucking hate it.  What am I supposed to do?  I've wanted to kill myself for a couple years now but I keep holding on for these people.  Some guy last year decided to kill himself because his girlfriend broke up with him after he cheated on her.  I know the girl a bit, she was a very kind girl a few years back but after her family problems, she became just another mask.  After the incident, she disappeared.  She still goes to my school, but her emotions, her feelings, they don't even feel like they exist.

It's gross.  It's so god damn disgusting.  I want to go to my school and yell at everyone from the top of my lungs to stop living this sick lie.  But it's far too late.  Everything's too late.

I don't want to live in this world anymore, where nothing moves, and nothing has colour.  Where emotions are meaningless unless it's this sickeningly fake happiness everyone pretends to have.  Where friends are numbers, and love is a funny joke.

God, I just want to die.  I so, so badly just want to fucking end it all.

I'm really sorry this is so long.  It's just that I've written this too many times and I don't know how to make it smaller, so if anyone really reads all of this, leave some type of comment.  Some sign of life.  Thank you.
