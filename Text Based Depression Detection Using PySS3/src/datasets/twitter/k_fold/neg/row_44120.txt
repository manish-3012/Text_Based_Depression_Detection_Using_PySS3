honestly feel like i'm worthless and losing hope that my situation will changehello

I have had enough of how i'm getting treated

I have been getting bullied since 2nd grade when I moved to a new school, I got bullied for being different then everybody else, when I was in 3rd grade I got kicked to the ground until I was bleeding.

i'm now in middle school, my situation hasn't really changed much and my parents are slowly starting to lose hope in me. I have only a few friends who are upperclassmen but pretty much everyone else hates me. I'm starting to lose hope in my self and feel like this is the only way out. I have tried moving schools but my parents wont let me, they think i'll get the same thing at all schools.

im planning on doing it at the end of the week, because I feel like its still possible that my situation might change.

thank you for taking a small part of your day to read this.
