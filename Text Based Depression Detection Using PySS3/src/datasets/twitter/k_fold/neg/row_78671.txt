It never gets better.What I hate the most about life is the constant loss. Today is just a day where I have less than yesterday. It's not about greed, it's about love ones. It's always someone just leaving or dying. Can't even keep a family without everyone dying. Where does that leave me? If it's not that then the things you want to go do or have are always out of reach. There just isn't a way to overcome the price to live to ever have anything. Want to go somewhere neat? Too bad! Can't afford it. What about getting help? Nope! That takes money too. Not just regular money, it takes money you can't ever make. It's just hard work to maintain. 

I'm breaking the cycle of poverty and loneness. I'm tired of talking to people too. I don't even like being around people anymore. I just can't stand this world anymore. Everything interesting is out of reach. Everyone I ever loved is dead. It's a constant pain. A triangular wound. 

The only thing worse than living this life is living this life for one more day. So fuck it. I'm killing myself.
