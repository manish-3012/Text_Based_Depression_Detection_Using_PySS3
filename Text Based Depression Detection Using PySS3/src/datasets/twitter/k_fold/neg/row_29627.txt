I need helpI need help. Iâ€™m a student and semi-dependent on my father who is emotionally abusive and one of the main reasons I donâ€™t want to be alive most days. Iâ€™m paying my way through college with loans and buy my own food and whatnot, he pays for my car/car insurance and health insurance. He uses those things against me anytime I try to talk to him about anything (he has several mental issues and canâ€™t communicate without yelling and being horrible). Todayâ€™s fight feels like the last straw. We got in a fight and he basically said he wishes he didnâ€™t have me as a kid. He has sons and has always loved them more than me, itâ€™s clear to me and my mom and others that this is true so Im not just saying this to play â€œwoe is meâ€ so to speak. Itâ€™s just true. My mom is the only reason Iâ€™m still at this house because I know if I left for Christmas sheâ€™d be so upset and I have a good relationship with her. But I feel trapped here. I bought my dad Christmas gifts because I *want* to have a good relationship with him but the thought of watching him open them now makes me sick. But the thought of taking them back makes me feel worse. I donâ€™t want to deal with any of this let alone the other stuff I have going on in my life. And I know other people have it way worse and I probably sound spoiled or something and that makes me feel worse. I just wanna not be alive. I wonâ€™t actually do it because Iâ€™m too scared, but every day I think about what it would like to just not be alive. I wouldnâ€™t have to feel any of this. I know I should talk to someone but my dad controls the health insurance
