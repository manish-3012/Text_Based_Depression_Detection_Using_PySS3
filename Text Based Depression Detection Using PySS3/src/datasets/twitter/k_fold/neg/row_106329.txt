For the first time nothing is holding me back, perhaps it's time- Parents died last year: so no one will be sad or devastated by my actions
- My cat, who was everything to me, died earlier this year (this was my breaking point): so I dont have to worry about what would happen to him
- I've tried so many chat rooms, forums, help lines, counselor and nothing has helped
- I am now completely alone with no hope of anything improving
