I canâ€™t do it anymore29F. Single for years because I canâ€™t manage relationships. Lonely. Been depressed my whole adult life. Have bipolar and tend to fuck up my life in the brief periods of mania - scars, risky sex, and now a broken heel.

Non stop health problems. Endometriosis, a gut parasite leading to severe abdominal bloating non stop for the past 5 months, PCOS, acne. Have been unable to work and am just a place where money goes to die. 100% financially reliant on my dad, who uses that to control me. The only acceptable job for me in his eyes is as a lawyer. Been chipping away at the degree for 5 years and am still only halfway through.

There is no hope for me. My body is fighting against me. In some ways it is permanently broken. I donâ€™t want children or a partner, and yet without these I canâ€™t see the point of life. I have no career aspirations because I hate everything. I am in constant existential or physical pain. I canâ€™t do it anymore. My life has not been like most of my peersâ€™ lives, and I canâ€™t connect with them because of it. I want to sink back into the earth, and float around as insouciant dust. That sounds like the only peace for me.
