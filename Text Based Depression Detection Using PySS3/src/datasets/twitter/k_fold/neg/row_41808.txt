I get the feeling that the world wants me to leave.Hah, for a minute there I was actually getting better. Then it all started to go south. Everything that was helping me through everything has one by one, slowly disappeared. And where technology has failed me, humans have as well. How much of a loser do you have to be for your parents to be too busy to talk to you? My stepmom said we could hang out today, but hours and hours later I find out sheâ€™s gone to party with my family without me! Even getting to this reddit was a long and hard process because my computer broke along with my WiFi, and I have no data.... my dads been working 16 hour days everyday and I havenâ€™t seen him for like a week because of theses fucking fires. I canâ€™t take this anymore! I just canâ€™t!
