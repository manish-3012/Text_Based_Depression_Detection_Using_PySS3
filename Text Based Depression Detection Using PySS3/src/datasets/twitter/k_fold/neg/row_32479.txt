Over itFor starters maybe i should state that iâ€™m on a drug called accutane. Used to treat stubborn acne. Had acne my whole life. Been super insecure about it for years which has been very hard especially because of the constant bullying. Side effect of accutane is depression and many people have committed suicide on this drug. 

Where am i at in life?
-Had the same depressing ass job for 5 years getting paid less than what i deserve and canâ€™t find a new one because of covid. 
-My â€œboyfriendâ€ of 3 years wants to break up with me because i got upset that he keeps neglecting me and treating me like shit. Iâ€™ve been lied to for years and cheated on several times which has really knocked me down and lately itâ€™s getting harder to get back up. 
-I seriously have no fucking friends.
-My entire family treats me like literal shit. 
-Someone hit my car and now i have to pay to fix it
-I work by myself all day everyday so iâ€™m constantly in my head thinking about how shitty my life is. 

Thereâ€™s more i can add to the list but anyways i have never been suicidal but today it crossed my mind. Not sure if itâ€™s the medication thatâ€™s making me feel like this or maybe my boyfriend (the only support system i had) breaking up with me pushed me over the edge. I feel so alone. Donâ€™t really see things changing anytime soon. I donâ€™t know.
