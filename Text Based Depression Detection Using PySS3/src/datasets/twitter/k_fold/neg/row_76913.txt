I'm here.I don't know if this type of post is allowed here but...

If you have come to this subreddit, you're probably contemplating suicide, but more than that, you are here to find others. These others may be like you, also suicidal, or they just may be someone who is here to listen.

With acknowledging these two people here on this subreddit, it is safe to say; you are not alone.

I know it sounds clichÃ© (and even saying that sounds clichÃ©) but I am not shitting you when I say it.

If I feel alone and isolated, and come to a place like this to write what I believe to be my last words or a call for help, I subconsciously, even if not consciously, know I must not be alone.

I have a therapist, friends, family, a lot of people who like and do tell me these same words.

It's hard to believe them in knowing that they've never been through what _I've_ been through, so how could they know?

They might not know. They might not even know what to do after you tell them. But here is a fact;

They do not want you dead.

Tell them what you need. Forget about feeling like a "burden," _tell them what you need._

Live on, and do whatever you can to live on, no matter how painful it is, no matter the amount of depression you may suffer, and then tell your story of survival, because let me tell you, even if they cannot relate to the extent you are suffering,

Someone does. 

And that someone needs to know that they too, are not alone.

And when they know they are not alone anymore, and that you've helped them realize that, all of that pain, all of that suffering, it doesn't compare to the amount of comfort you are able to bring that person, even if it is just one person. 

If you are feeling suicidal tonight, please remember the amount of power you have to impact someone else's life, and please remember that there are people, including people you might've not even met yet, that want you to live on.
