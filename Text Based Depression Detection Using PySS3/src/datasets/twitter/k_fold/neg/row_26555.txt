The only reason Iâ€™m still here...Iâ€™m so tired of the pain, tired of feeling alone, tired of living. Therapy isnâ€™t helping. The meds arenâ€™t helping. I feel like I will never find happiness, never find peace. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. But as I sit on the floor of my living room, frustrated because of the stupid Christmas tree lights that wonâ€™t work and the idea of spending another holiday alone, my dog (the sweetest yellow lab) comes and lays down in my lap. Heâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m still around. My family would move on. My friends would forget me in a heartbeat. But I canâ€™t explain to him where Iâ€™d be going. And that breaks my heart. 

We donâ€™t deserve animals. I certainly donâ€™t deserve his unconditional love. Once heâ€™s gone, I have a feeling I wonâ€™t be long for this world and Iâ€™m ok with that.
