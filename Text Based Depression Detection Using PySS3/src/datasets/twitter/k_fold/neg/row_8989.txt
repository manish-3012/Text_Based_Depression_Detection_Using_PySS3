Losing hope. Don't know what to do.Before I get any grief, I am well aware that I have it better than a lot of people. Ok hereâ€™s the story. 

I am a fresh college graduate and am currently looking for work. I am the sort of person that absolutely abhors having free time to themselves. It doesnâ€™t help that I donâ€™t have much of a family (only child to a single mother, with no extended family). The holidays are harder for me, I usually try to spend them passed out.
I have only maybe 1 friend, and even then, theyâ€™re an ex-boyfriend who is 15 years older than I am (Iâ€™m 22). We dated 3 years ago but things went sour fast. We still chat almost every day, but heâ€™s got other things going on in his life, of course. Acquaintances who know the both of us say that Iâ€™ve become addicted to his presence in my life, and Iâ€™d have to agree. Itâ€™s become almost toxic at this point. I wish I had something better going on in my life, just so I wouldnâ€™t feel so emotionally dependent on him. 

Anyway, Iâ€™m trying my best to reach out to people, but since I live in a relatively small city most people are busy with work almost always, that or they blow me off. I donâ€™t feel as if Iâ€™m a very easy people to get along with (why else would I have 0 friends?). Iâ€™m trying to work on that though. 

I feel hopeless. I need friends but I donâ€™t know how to go about that. I feel like I need money to go out, but seeing as Iâ€™m not-yet-employed. I hope I find a job soon, otherwise Iâ€™m going to do something harmful to myself, just so I donâ€™t have to put up with this sort of loneliness.
