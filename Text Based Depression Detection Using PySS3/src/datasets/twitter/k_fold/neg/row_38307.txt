My drunk/honest opinionYou know how when someone dies like this, people put on the show and parade about mental health awareness/anti-bullying/some kind of kindness campaign? Yeah, that's bullshit. It's all about their egos. 

Where were you when I was starving myself? Being bullied? Being called retarded and weird?  Were you just joining in, or turning a blind eye because I was too embarrassing to be seen with? Probably. Kids do that - actually, family members and teachers too. 

I guess my family will carry on staying in touch with their/my rapist when I die, using me to stay in denial by saying they "tried to help" (a huge lie, they wanted to idealise me as their 'helpless nutcase' - see the drama triangle), lying about me etc. while refusing to admit what they did along the way. But just... whatever now. It went too far. I was always a huge joke to everyone and they will clearly refuse to see things any differently. Even if they changed their minds, the message has already been marble-engraved into me. There's literally nothing that could be said. I am so angry that honestly, if I don't kill myself then I will probably just kill someone else.

I have seen enough to conclude that it is overwhelmingly nurture over nature. Some aren't surrounded by cunts, and others are.
