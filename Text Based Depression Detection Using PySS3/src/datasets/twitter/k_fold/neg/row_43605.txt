I need help.I want to die. I'm miserable. My parents know this but they choose to ignore it instead of taking me to see a psychiatrist. I think I'm too young to legally get a prescription by myself. I think about suicide every day, imagining how I'd do it. The thing that kept me alive last week was the fact that I promised my therapist not to do it until my parents can get me a psychiatrist. Now they're just pretending there is no issue. Please help me
