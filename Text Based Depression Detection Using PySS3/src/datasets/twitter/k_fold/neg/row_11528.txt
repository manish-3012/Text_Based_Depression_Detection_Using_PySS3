What is wrong with me?I am 24. I have been obsessing to myself about being in a relationship with a friend for about 8 years. I hate the idea of living without them. They're the only person I've ever felt any sort of attraction to, emotionally or sexually. I've never felt anything for anyone else. I think about them constantly. Definitely to an unhealthy degree. I don't know what to do. I can't keep living like this. I feel like I'm losing my mind. How can I stop constantly thinking about them? What's wrong with me? Life without them is something I'm not interested in experiencing. I want to express the way I feel but I don't want to ruin what we already have.
