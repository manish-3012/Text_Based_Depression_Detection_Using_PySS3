This may be my end.After a technical glitch resulted in not being able to properly communicate with my 1 newly met friend I have decided to try again at ending my life. Possibly - unless this gets resolved (in which case this will be deleted). If not, then this was the straw that broke the camel's back because I *cannot take this anymore.* It may also be fate/god/whatever blasphemy you believe in way of saying I don't deserve to have friends.

The sole purpose of this post is to give the handful of people I have met via reddit and exchange a sentence with every once in a great while a reason why I may have 'disappeared.'

Other subreddits I may have rather posted this under have either been banned or just simply cannot be found by someone as stupid as me anymore.
