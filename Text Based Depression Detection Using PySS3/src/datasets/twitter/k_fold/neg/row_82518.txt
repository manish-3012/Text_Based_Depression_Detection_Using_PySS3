Uselessmy mind feels blocked... how can I filter out all these suicidal thoughts when they clog up all parts of my brain. Donâ€™t want to live the same everyday, and who really goes through this like me anyway. Afraid Iâ€™ll never know how Iâ€™m supposed to live this life. Constantly questioning whether my existence is really worth it or not. Trying to express myself is more complicated than not expressing anything at all. No one cares if I continue to fall. Feels like Iâ€™ve written it all, Iâ€™ve given up on trying to make anyone understand. Maybe itâ€™s not supposed to get better for me, am I fucking up gods plan? Should I have killed myself already? Could that be why things just keep getting progressively worse for me? Praying wonâ€™t get me anywhere, itâ€™s useless to make wishes now. Religion is also a waste of time.
