I can't deal with life anymore.Throwaway, for very, very obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I (15M) ((you can get the whole "incel lol!!!! go excercise fatass" shit out of your system in the comments first.)) have attempted suicide around 7 times this year on top of self harm. I have multiple parts of my body which I enjoy cutting more than others, such as my thighs and calves. \[Self harm is not about attempting suicide for me, it's about punishing myself for being a worthless human being\]

A couple of things you should know about me:

* I have scoliosis from sitting down too much and being unable to move due to the syndrome.
* I have severe  **psoriasis** from not really doing much.
* I have around a few months to live due to my liver currently failing.
* I have type 2 diabetes.
* I can't walk due to a severe syndrome in my nervous system called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome \[Abbreviated as CRPS\] 
* I can't lose weight because I can't walk.
* I am 130 kilograms \[roughly 286 pounds\] at 15.
* I have the highest level of autism there is.
* I have many other disabilities: OCD, ADHD, PTSD, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, and I will update as soon as I remember more.
* I have PTSD from being in school and being constantly beaten by teachers and students alike.
* I don't go to school anymore and have frequent mental breakdowns when near young schoolchildren.

I am extremely deep into depression because I will never amount to anything. I will never be able to move off of my bed.

I am harassed online for being different and having these problems. I have once been tracked down through my I.P address by multiple people in my city and beaten half to death and put on life support.

My wheelchair is constantly broken because of the same people. Whenever I go out I'm dumped head first onto concrete and knocked out with a rock while they take my wheelchair miles away and destroy it into pieces. The police absolutely refuse to do anything about it due to bribes from the kids' parents.

I'm a rape baby, my father killed himself as soon as he raped my mother and we were on the streets most of my life due to never receiving funding. 

&amp;#x200B;

Onto the post.

I am so utterly desperate to find a friend. I am absolutely incapable of going outside due to the street gangs and those people I talked about earlier. I have never experienced a single person that has given a shit about me outside of family and people who have "befriended" me only to try to kill me later on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never even talked to a cis / straight woman before other than my mother. The entirety of my city is dominated by the lgbtq+. I've tried forcing myself to be gay / pansexual but to no avail. I'm not even sure there are any straight people in my city. I tried online dating over the entire globe but not even anyone wanted me. I just want to be able to feel loved by someone for the first fucking time in my life. Just to hear the words "I love you" is my fucking life goal.

&amp;#x200B;

But most goals are unrealistic, same with this one. I'm not worth wasting people's time. I'm never going to find someone who gives more than 2 shits about me. 

It's not worth denying the fate that is predetermined for you. You cannot change fate. I was given this fate as soon as I was born. I am simply fulfilling my destiny. To die alone and worthless.
