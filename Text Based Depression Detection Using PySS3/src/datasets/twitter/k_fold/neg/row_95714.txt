I am tired of livingIâ€™m at the point where things just arenâ€™t going right and itâ€™s not a one thing a year itâ€™s a compounding problem.

I thought life gave us moments of happiness and love and trust, honesty and compassion.

All I feel is this isolation and great fear that itâ€™s not going to get better. 

I just donâ€™t want to feel any pain anymore. Iâ€™m tired of the heartbreak I continue to endure because I love too strongly. Iâ€™m tired of being kept on a leash by my abusive ex. And the catalyst is now someone who is out to portray me as a vindictive individual who would betray someone that I love. And that person will not believe me no matter how much proof I have that I didnâ€™t do what Iâ€™m accused of.

I feel so alone and I want it to end. I just want the pain and hurt to go away
