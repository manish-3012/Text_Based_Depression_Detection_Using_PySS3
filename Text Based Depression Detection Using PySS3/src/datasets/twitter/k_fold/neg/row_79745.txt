StrugglingI hate the holidays so much. An unexpected crisis means I wont have enough for groceries and cat food this month, barring a miracle.

Anxiety is so high I have been nauseous. Not sleeping and don't want to get out of bed. Keep thinking about suicide, but I don't want to do that to my Mom at Christmas.

But I don't know what I am going to do.

In general, this time of year is always hard for me. My birthday is in a week, and that always leaves me contemplating what a failure my life has been. And Christmas is never without family problems.

I feel so lost and alone.

But trying to take things one day at a time, because what else is there to do?
