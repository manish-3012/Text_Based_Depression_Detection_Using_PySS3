Finally freeing myselfImagine a world where, no one can harm you, no one can yell, and you don't feel a thing. No more guilt, no more crying. I'm so tired of being a phony, tired of being who I am, because I truly hate myself. There's a part of me that wants to wake up tomorrow and be someone else, but I know that probably won't happen.
