How to get rid of suicide thoughts?I really don't want to, but it feels like my mind has another face, making me go for it

Perhaps the title makes me seem like a strong person, but I am not, altho I want to. At least my mind is not yet 100% dark...so I wanna save it until it's too late :v

If someone can save me here, I may use their ways to save my suicidal friends...

Damn suicide sucks. The fact that I will give up sooner or later is just ugly...
