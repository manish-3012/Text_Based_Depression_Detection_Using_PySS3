My dad called me just to yell at me the first time I tried to kill myself.Iâ€™ve tried 17 times to end my life. But I will never forget the first time I tried. I went to the pill cabinet and took 15 pills. Not a very good attempt but I was 13 and had no clue what I was doing wouldnâ€™t be successful. Anyway long story short I told my best friend at the time what I had done for some stupid fucking reason and she told me I had to tell my mom or she would call her herself. So yeah I told my mom blah blah blah and I end up going to the hospital. They didnâ€™t send me to a psych ward because I promised it was a one time thing and Iâ€™d never do it again... oh how I was wrong. Anyway, my mom called my dad (who at the time was still with my mom and I still talked to him) and told him what I had done. She looked scared when he picked up and told him what happened. She handed the phone to me and told me â€œhe wants to talk to you.â€ He started yelling. â€œWhat the hell is wrong with you ? Why the fuck would you do that ? Do you know how that makes me feel ?â€ And I know it sounds like heâ€™s just being a caring concerned father. Keep in mind this is the man who (my mom didnâ€™t know yet) had molested me for a year when I was 9 and had recently did it again a few months prior to my attempt. Those words are forever stuck in my head. As fucked up as it is I still want to make him happy. And I canâ€™t help but thinking heâ€™d be happy if I killed myself. 


Tl;dr: the first time I tried to kill myself my abusive dad called me just to yell at me and as fucked as it may sound I still want to make him happy and canâ€™t help but feeling heâ€™d be happy if I died.
