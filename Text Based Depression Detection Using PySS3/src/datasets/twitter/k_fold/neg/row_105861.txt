Feel hollow. Can't see myself being happy again.I get better sometimes but my mind always comes back to this.

It's stupid, but this was mostly spurred by a break up. I guess I'm over him, and I hoped that would make things better but it hasn't. And for some reason it still hurts seeing he's moved on. I've been improving myself, exponentially, but still I can't see myself feeling happy again.

While I can't imagine feeling that way for another person, I can get over that. But I can't see myself feeling passionate or happy or love towards anything. 

I just don't see the point.
