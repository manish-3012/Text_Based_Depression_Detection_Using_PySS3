Anyone else have a specific moment that triggered you wanting to die? Or did it develop gradually.For me I had a sweet innocent cat named Ivy who I accidentally let outside one night, I came home and saw her dead on the side of the road cause someone ran her over. Iâ€™ve never cried so hard.

I decided this was a sick world that I hate living in. Just trying to muster the strength to end it.
