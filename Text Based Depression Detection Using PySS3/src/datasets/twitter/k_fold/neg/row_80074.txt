My mind is a mess. I'm tired of thinking about everything I've done wrong all the timeHow does anyone do it? How does anyone live past the age of 30 without offing themselves?

I can't handle even minor setbacks, there's no way I could handle losing my loved ones. My brain hurts I'm thinking of everything at once and I can't stop
