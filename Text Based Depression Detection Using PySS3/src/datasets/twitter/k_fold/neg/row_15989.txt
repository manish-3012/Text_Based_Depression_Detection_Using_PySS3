Itâ€™s badBefore the whole coronavirus thing, I rarely saw my boyfriend. Maybe once every week and a half at most. Weâ€™ve been together so long that our phone conversations arenâ€™t conversations. (6yrs.) Itâ€™s hard to find things to talk about if itâ€™s not about our days. 

Havenâ€™t seen him in a month because of this quarantine, we try to talk every day, some days we donâ€™t. I was lonely before, Iâ€™ve been lonely all my life, but now itâ€™s deafening. I rely on him so much, I have no friends. 

Iâ€™m jealous of him. Itâ€™s bad. Heâ€™s got lots of relationships with people he works with, and some friends and family members he can talk to and hang out with. We donâ€™t really ever hang out together when heâ€™s with his friends, itâ€™s too complicated when we live in different towns. 

Iâ€™m having a tough time, Iâ€™m sure you guys are too. But fuck Iâ€™m lonely.
