I just canâ€™t anymore. Iâ€™m so tired.Iâ€™m 45 and failing out of nursing school after one month. I was trying to better my failure of a life but thatâ€™s a failure too. I will now be more in debt with no job or job prospects. I am crying and shakey. I called the suicide hotline for the first time tonight and I felt a bit better until I tried to sleep. Now Iâ€™m crying again and  thinking about how death is the only solution. Iâ€™m so tired. So freakin tired.
