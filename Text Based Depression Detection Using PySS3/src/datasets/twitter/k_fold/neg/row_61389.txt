Suicide ideation/thoughts (without methods).Hi there. I have had suicide ideation throughout Sunday. I have never went through that like this before. The feelings came and rushed in and were overwhelming, then I cried and they went away. This cycle repeated itself many times the whole day. 

Then on Monday morning, I was cheerful and happy and all seemed ok all over again.

I am currently seeing a therapist. I have an appointment with her on Thursday. She hasn't given me a formal diagnosis but we were talking about a diagnosis in early sessions and she suspects BPD but thinks it's too early to tell.

Personally, I have decided not to share those ideation thoughts with anyone in real life for many reasons. 

I am not sure what I am looking for after this post, just sharing and maybe some advice on what to do next? Should I mention those thoughts to my therapist? What will be the likely outcome?

Thank you.
