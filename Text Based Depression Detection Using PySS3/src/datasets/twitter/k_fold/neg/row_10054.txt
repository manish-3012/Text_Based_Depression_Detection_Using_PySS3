Why are we taught to discard our thoughts of suicide?We're essentially taught that having suicidal thoughts is a bad thing. If we mention our suicidal thoughts to others, we're told to go see a counselor, take medication, or call the suicide hotline (all of which will try to steer us away from such thoughts). Or, we're advised to make some changes to our daily life to make ourselves "feel better": exercise, eat better, sleep more, join a club, etc. Despite doing these things, if the suicidal thoughts are still there, doesn't that mean something? Why are people trying to have us essentially discard such thoughts?

Speaking for myself now, maybe despite all the positive changes we're making, we just can't find a place for ourselves in the world. Maybe we are just tired of mental suffering. Maybe we feel fundamentally incompatible with society. I understand that committing suicide negatively impacts others, but maybe, at the very least, society should be taught to stop fearing suicidal ideation. Then at least we don't have to go through this alone.
