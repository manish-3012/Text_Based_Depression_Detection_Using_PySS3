I feel inadequate in this forumAfter reading some posts I feel as though I shouldn't even be depressed. A lot of you have real life problems yet here i am wanting to kill myself because my girlfriend of 3 months dumped me over a year ago and I can't cope. I really should have nothing to complain about because nothing else in my life is wrong except her... Really puts things in perspective but I can't shake the feeling of wanting to be done with feeling like nothing.
