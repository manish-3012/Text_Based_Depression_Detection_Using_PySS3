I thought I was moving past my sexual/romantic frustration but now itâ€™s coming back.20M

Yeah I thought I was moving past spending hours thinking and crying about how Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship or done anything sexual. And now itâ€™s coming back hard. Even writing that out...it felt like a bad memory. 

I keep thinking of lost youth and missing out on young love. It bothers me so much, I can only think of suicide stopping it. I canâ€™t fucking believe the average age to start having sex is 16/17 and I havenâ€™t even been in a fucking relationship. How does everyone do that? How can they manage to participate in being a sexual being, and I canâ€™t? Everything I do feels worthless because I havenâ€™t reached that milestone. I donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s possible. Iâ€™m constantly fantasizing about it. r/wholesomememes is so damn depressing. All of those cute memes are made by teens in relationships and I canâ€™t fucking stand it. Iâ€™m a bitter loser. I missed the age where everyone learns about it with each other and now Iâ€™m fucked. Fuck Iâ€™m gonna fucking off myself tonight this is fucking unbearable.
