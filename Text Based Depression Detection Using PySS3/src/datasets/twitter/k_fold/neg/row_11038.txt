I'm not afraid of death...I'm afraid of becoming a vegetable if I don't succeed. I have a macguyvered gallows done with a ladder and a cable (well, not really a gallows, since it works by strangulation instead of a drop). I want to be dead. Or, to be more specific, I want to not be alive.

I am 25 years old. I've never had a girlfriend, or so much as a kiss. University is killing me, especially now that I have to take exams that I'm consistently failing because of crippling depression and excessive drinking. I'm sick of being guilted into staying alive because it would suck for my family if I weren't.

And I know that it would. They love me, and I love them. Which makes me hate myself even more for how much I just want to leave them forever. But I just can't take it anymore.

I have tried therapy. My therapist wasn't bad, in fact I really liked talking to her. But it wasn't any different from talking to friends about it. All the advice you get just seems so... shallow.

I have tried medication. It just made me lose my appetite, which made me even more depressed.

I feel like I'm finally at a point where ending it seems reasonable. I've though about it for 10 years or so, but for the last couple of years, I've considered killing myself pretty much daily. I'm at a point where I don't even understand people who enjoy life. The whole concept seems alien to me. The whole daily grind will never appeal to me. I *know* it won't get better once I finish uni and have a daily job. Everything in my life has only ever gotten worse with time. And I can barely imagine feeling any worse than I have in the past few years.

Sorry for the wall of text rant.
