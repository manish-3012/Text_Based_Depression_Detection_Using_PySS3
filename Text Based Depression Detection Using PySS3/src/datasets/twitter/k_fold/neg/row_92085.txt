The 3 smaller siblings stops me from doing it, but thinking about it makes feel guilty like hell. I am 19 year old girl, my coping methods adds fuel to the fire.Im depressed, i hide it from my family but they know i have a past with self harm. Its been 3 years since, the urge is coming again. My best friend who has attempted suicide once and self harmed, and who i love is the very good thlught and protective thought, keeps me from acting upon my shitty awful episodes. 
But i still cope in an unhealthy way i would say. Im not the only one i know. I watch gore videos, and ive heard a 911 call in which a sister explains to the operator that her brother has killed himself, horrific audio. Am i taken aback by myself? Scared? I dont know. Nothing is real anymore.
