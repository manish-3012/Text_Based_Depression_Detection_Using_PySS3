I cant take it anymoreI have been experiencing suicidal thoughts ever since my dad died when I was 7. Then I got into middle school and everyone I talked to made me feel like I was just a piece of shit who deserved to die. Then I met some girl online and we had so much in common, and after months of talking I found out I loved her. My parents then found out I was talking to a random stranger. They made me cut of all contact with her. She told me where she lived before we lost contact. So the next day I ditched school and ran. A couple days later I got caught by the police. They brought me back home and my parents shamed me. I went back to school the following Monday and everyone new about me running away. I would get called names nonstop. The girl who I talked to also happened to be suicidal and being made fun of in school. I just thought how she could be dead right now. Now I'm in high school and I still get treated like absolute shit. I have decided that as soon as my dog dies I an going to end it all since I know no one will even give two shits.
