My dad decided to lock me in my room after my suicide attempt. My mom's gonna come see me at 6.30 am. (with breakfast), 11.30 am. (Lunch), and 6.30 pm. (Dinner * with some stupid medicines) I freaking hate it! I want to die. Help!I hate being here! I hate this place. They really care about me OR they just punish me for being suicidal? I need a knife, razor, rope and everything!! Why did they take it away from me ? I feel like I'm dying inside. I wanna kill myself soooo bad! By the way, I have my phone with me. In my room, there are just a pillow, book, blanket, bottle of water, and stuffs.. which I can't use to kill myself. If I could die from biting my tounge, I'd do it right now!! Any other ways to die? Thanksss
