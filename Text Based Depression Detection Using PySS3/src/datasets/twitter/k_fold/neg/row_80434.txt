Fueled by pain as I choose my own fate...Theres been so much shit going on in my life i don't know what to do anymore. I cut, both of my parents are in prison, mom for 10, dad for 30, my grandmother and caretaker is in the hospital, my best friend stole my girlfriend, my grades suck horribly because of all this and I feel like i should just end all of my pain.
