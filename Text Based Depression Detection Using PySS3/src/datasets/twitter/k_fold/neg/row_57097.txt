I want this to be overI want to eat my Zoloft. I want to hang myself. I want to be hit by a car. I want to sleep and sleep and never wake up again. I want to die. 

This is chronic and endless. Anything less than my imminent suicide is stalling. Life is pain and embarassment. I'm so fucking tired. I don't want to care anymore.
