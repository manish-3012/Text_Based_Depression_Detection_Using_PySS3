The Pacing Loop. An autobiography about my maddness that will never make it to the shelves.Believe me it wouldn't be a best seller since it would be based on me it would be pretty fucking bleak..........................................................
..................................................................................
 All day long I pace and think until my legs grow weak...............................................................
..................................................................................
Sometimes I will think of the most whimsical and happy shit........................................................
 Like picturing an alternative life where I have a beautiful garden filled with scrumptious veggies, a loving family surrounding me, and an assortment of pets...........................................
 Like how maybe in the past there could have been a colony of evolved ants on mars having some form of ancient power struggle with an ancient spider kingdom then they nuked each other..........................................................................................................................................................
...etc.etfuckingcetera...............................................................................................................................
 ...And then there's the bad ones..........................
 Like how I'm so disgusted with myself that it makes me want to hurt myself. I have bitten and scratched at myself in a rage before. I have literally hated myself so badly that it makes me want to peel off my own flesh........................
.. could've.. should've...would've...thoughts.. I really wish I could dig those out of my head and bury them somewhere but they are here to stay as a constant reminder of what I could've done probably should've done and realistically wouldn't have fucking done..................................
Then as I'm mid pace I see a leather jacket sitting on a chair and picture my granny sitting there. She loved leather. She also loved to hurt me and little things remind me of it daily...........
Like a needle pricking and pulling at my head until all the strings come loose............................. My bad memories haunt me and I've never known how to properly talk about it without shutting down.........................................................
...thenithinkofallthetimesishutdownandbecameicyortriedtalkingabouttheshitanditcameoutwrongbecauseistumbledovermywordsbecausehowcaniactuallytalkaboutthisstuffreally....
 Like how I'm literally a waste of space and an actual burden to the people around me..............
....................................................................................................................................................................
I've had friends, family, and loving exes, try to talk to me while I'm pacing and it only pisses me off because it breaks me from my escape of this bullshit reality I've made for myself.........
..................................................................................
I am just exhausted of this fucking ever lasting loop that I will never seem to be able to break.
 I want my mother to stop having to watch her daughter slip away.  She shouldn't have to babysit her twenty three year old daughters fragile mentality anymore.
..................................................................................
I feel there's more I could say but I don't see the point in going any further with my words. I'm just done.
