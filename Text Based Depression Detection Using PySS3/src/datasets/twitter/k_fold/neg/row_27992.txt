Desperate for solutionMe 19M  My love is 21F  [both arab and living in arabian country]  the problem is not with tradition or culture or any of that   

Notes before explaining: 
-the girl is  truthful-innocent-childish-extremely emotional-speaks her mind and  i love her so much for just who she is 
-in arabian culture love relationships are different  never having sex or similar stuff /her and your father especially  and sometimes mother never know about the relationship /
-when she loves she truly loves from all of her heart and she loves her dad so so so much
-everthing i wrote is literally meant and happend

The story is
The girl went through her first relationship  from august 2017  and  with time he loved her and she loved him and went on and then they wanted an  official engagement  his father refused this girl  cause she is one year younger than his son and for no specific reason  And insisted on his refusal that maybe he didnâ€™t want his son to marry from a relationship  what matter is that he insisted on his  opinion and his son couldnâ€™t  change his mind and his son told the girl to wait  and it will all work in the end this was in about october-September 2019  and since then their relationship started to crumble cause of his dad   And he kept telling her to wait he can change his father mind about her   then in January-February 2020 she ended the relationship and  told him farewell  and that she wishes him the best   He kept on trying to talk to her  after a while but she blocked him and  one time  in may 2020 he sent her  a dress and some gifts the girl contacted his uncles daughter and gave back the gift  to her  and  from then there was nothing.


As for me  i know this girl from November 2019  btw she was still talking with the guy  and how we knew each other  It was the best coincidence to happen in my life  on a facebook group for apple related problems she posted a problem with icloud in her sisterâ€™s phone and i commented with some solutions on the post and she replied  and asked if i can help her step by step on messenger and i did  and we clicked and after a while  we talk sometimes and ask her how she is and  in December 2019 she told me she was talking with a guy and explained more about the story through time and  after a while she told the guy about me in January and that i was a friend after a while  i started to like her and she liked me   And when i knew her more and more she sometimes  talks abd tells me she donâ€™t want any new love relationships in the beginning I thought she only said that cause sheâ€™s still broken cause she loved and  in the end it didnâ€™t work And  in April 2020 i told her that i love her and she  took it great and I understood that she with time will improve and btw she tells me that she doesnâ€™t hate the first guy and she never want him back and i know and im sure that  she doesnâ€™t want the first guy back  and will never accept him back even if he was the last man alive cause she said so and only wishes him well  and the girl at first i noticed that she thought itâ€™s hard to forget about him and that she canâ€™t and now i noticed that she almost forgot about him  and i noticea big improvement from the beginning but the problem is that she still donâ€™t want a relationship  she knows i love her to death and i showed her not just talk  and she tells me im  precious and wants me in her life  and honestly sheâ€™s been nothing but lovely to me she  listens and do as i tell and never i asked her  for  anything and she rejected it except when i tell her i want relationship she tells me she canâ€™t And  recently some other guy without any relationship with her have contacted her family and wanted to  bring his family to see her and to be engaged but she refused him without even seeing them cause she  says that she doesnâ€™t want any relationship or engagement or marriage currently 
I always ask her if thereâ€™s anthing i can do  to help change her mind she tells me that she doesnâ€™t know otherwise she wouldâ€™ve done it herself 
I also  asked her if i can bring my family to meet her family and plan for our engagement she tells me no please i donâ€™t want any type of relationship right now 
And starts crying
She knows i love her to death but sometimes she tells  me youâ€™ll change your mind after a while i tell her no Iâ€™ll always love her to death  and i know so
I asked her if she would change her mind on relationships in future she  says  to be honest not with this mindset I canâ€™t 

I want to help her pass through but I donâ€™t know how or what to do   We flirt we talk all day everyday she even kisses me  
Couple days ago i was in the kitchen with a blade to my hand  one second away from cutting myself
About a week ago  i was on sitting on a building edge 30 feet tall thinking about leaning over and falling 
 I want to assure her that Iâ€™ll always love her no matter what and i was thinking about tattooing her name on my wrist and im doing it  next week  even though it goes against our tradition and culture and religion  
I want her so bad i know im willing to die any moment for her  and she knows it

Is she going through a psychological something or through fear of doing it again i dont know what exactly im so confused and overthinking everything about her  im sure if sheâ€™s not pushed to change she will remain like this for a long time  
I push her sometimes and want her to change her mindset so we could start a relationship but she doesnâ€™t want to 

I really need some opinions and advice on this  both from the heart and the brain  

Just to cut doubt im sure she doesnâ€™t want the guy back  i just told his story so you guys can know why it reached to what it reached 

What can i do to help her anything  would be better than nothing 

Im sorry if my words are mixed up i wrote with a confused mind and im sorry i wrote too long  I didnâ€™t  want to but i had to just to maje sure i get the right advice and opinion on this
Thanks in advance for anyone who reads this and leave his opinion/advice if he was in the same situation and thanks for anyone who prays for us to  be together 
Thank you all.
