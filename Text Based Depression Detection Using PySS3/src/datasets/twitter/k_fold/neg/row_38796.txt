I'm not exactly suicidal, but a lot of people would be in my situation. My life is terrible.My mom died two years ago.
My dad has parkinsons and alzheimers, which is killing him.
I took way too much caffeine for months and developed psychosis.
I ended up in a mental hospital.
When I was nuts, I hacked my college, and they expelled me.
I got arrested and charged with it.
My lawyer says I've got no chance of an acquittal and the prosecutor will only let me plead to a felony.
My roommates kicked me out because of my mental issues, so I'm now living in a hotel waiting for my court date.

FML. Seriously, FML.

How is this going to get better? Oh and on top of that, my psychiatrist denied me any anti-anxiety meds other than klonopin last visit.
