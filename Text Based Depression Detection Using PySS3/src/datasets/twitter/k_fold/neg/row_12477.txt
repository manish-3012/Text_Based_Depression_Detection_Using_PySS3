I can't see a way outI know everybody has their ups and downs in life, I've made it my purpose to help others through plenty of theirs. But this time I just can't see how it could possibly improve. 

I fucked up. I hurt my husband. Now he's trying to "help me" but really just subconsciously taking out all his anger on me. 

I lost him. I lost the love of my life. Now I'm just here, a warm body nearby. He's moved on. He doesn't care, but is afraid of what I'll do if I realize that. 

I've hurt too many people and I have nothing now. The only thought that brings me any relief is thinking of ending my life. 

I just can't do it anymore.
