i donâ€™t know what to do.iâ€™m 18, graduated high school in may. before i graduated, i had a tight knit group of friends. we began to have issues and eventually i had a really bad episode and attempted suicide. shortly after, they all ditched me- including my girlfriend (now ex). they all blamed it on me. i was too needy and too dramatic and just too much for them to handle. i have aspergers and i didnâ€™t realize how much i was bothering them. j should probably mention that when i was in 4th grade i witnessed my dad shoot himself in the head. i miss him a lot. but anyways, after my friends left i was supposed to be institutionalized but i ended up moving to atlanta by myself. i have a job but i hate it. i barely get any hours and iâ€™m going broke. i live my life on repeat. i wake up, lay in bed all day, watch youtube, go to sleep. every single fucking day. iâ€™m so sick of this. i donâ€™t think iâ€™m going to be on this planet much longer and posting on this thread is a final shot at life. i have a boyfriend whom i love to death but since i moved, i canâ€™t see him due to the distance. 700 miles is a lot. i donâ€™t want to burden him anymore. i donâ€™t want to burden anyone anymore. i know how i would go out, and i intend on following through if things get bad enough- and things are starting to get very bad. i relapsed last night and self harmed after two or three months. i donâ€™t want to do this anymore guys. i have no friends, my family thinks iâ€™m a disappointment, and i hate myself. i canâ€™t do this. iâ€™m desperate for help but i donâ€™t know if i can hold on any longer.
