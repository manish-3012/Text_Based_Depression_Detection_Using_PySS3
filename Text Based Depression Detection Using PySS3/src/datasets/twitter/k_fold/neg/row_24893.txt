What should I know?Frankly, Iâ€™m just waiting for my brother to return to college so I have plenty of time at night toâ€¦ do my thing. At best, that's a month. So, I have far too much time to second-guess myself. I would invite you to help fill me with doubt. Iâ€™d like to be able to say, honestly, that I considered everything I could, should I (in all likelihood) continue with my plans when the time is right. Obviously, by even submitting this post, I am open to having my mind changed.

Tell me somethingâ€¦ unusual. After outing myself to friends and family, suffice it to say Iâ€™ve heard all the common replies and advice. Obviously, Iâ€™ve found these common responses to be highly unpersuasive. Basically, **help me see if I haven't considered everything I should before resolving to kill myself.**

*Thanks in advance.*

**Facts:** College-age male, dropout, social drinker, virgin, reads news more than plays games, below-average height, above-average weight, introvert, and recently started medication for depression.

**Less-than-facts:** Devout nihilist, awful dancer, no significant or attainable long- or medium-term goals, unrealistic expectations and standards, inability to â€˜be at peaceâ€™, and sees no reason to change or get better as of yet. The void beckons to me, almost irresistibly so.
