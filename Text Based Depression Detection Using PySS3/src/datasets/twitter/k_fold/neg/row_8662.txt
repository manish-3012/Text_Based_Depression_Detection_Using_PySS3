Should I be worried?   So I have intense bouts of overwhelming suicidal thoughts daily now. I have the means, I have a plan, I'm close to writing a note, but one thing makes me think I shouldn't actually be worried about hurting myself. I'm not sure if I could actually cut my wrists as planned. I've been toying around with a knife just now, and I'm to scared to even break the skin. So should I be worried or not?
