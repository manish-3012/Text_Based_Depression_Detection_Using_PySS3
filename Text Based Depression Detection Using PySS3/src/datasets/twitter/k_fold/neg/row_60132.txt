OverdoseI know and I've read overdose isn't a good method to use, but I have over 20 Tramacet pills and I need it for post op pain but I'm constantly fighting the thought of bearing the pain and saving them for when I want to overdose ( whether that will even kill me anyway but hurting me I still wouldnt mind ) in the future or fighting that urge and using them as directed and needed for current pain. For over the past 4 years suicide has felt like the only option when things start to go south and things are really starting to feel bad so I'm considering saving them as I said but I don't know for sure.
