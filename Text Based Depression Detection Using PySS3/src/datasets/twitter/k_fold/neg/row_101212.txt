please give me a reason to liveThats too much for me i dont have any reason to live like this anymore. i always feel inferior to anyone and if not i'll search for a reason as why i should feel inferior to them. i am from a third world country, come from a poor broken home family and always depressed as child, never have any friend in my life.  i cant talk to anyone in my country about my problem because they always give me shitty advice or religious bullshit, thinking it will make me feel better.
Why i shouldnt kill myself? it will never get better i dont have contribution in society, my future is horrible nobody love me i am poor stupid asocial ugly. if i kill myself at least it will lessen my mom suffering and the nature to fed a failure parasite like me.

sorry about my grammar as english isnt my first language and all in my head now is just death.
