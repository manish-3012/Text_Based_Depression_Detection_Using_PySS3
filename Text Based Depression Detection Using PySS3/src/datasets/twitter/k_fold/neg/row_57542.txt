Nobody understands how I feelI have self-esteem lower than the pits of hell. Have 0 friends, no partner and live with 3 major abusive narcissists who hate me and target me everyday.  I'm so suicidal that I'm just fantasizing and visualising the ways I can escape. Of course I can't admit this to the majority of people especially a therapist/doctor but it's how I feel everyday.  I feel so alone and outcasted and I'm also very paranoid when I go outside, thinking everyone around me is out to get me. I feel like prey and everyone's the predator..ugh I hate this.
