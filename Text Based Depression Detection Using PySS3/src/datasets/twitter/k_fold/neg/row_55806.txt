I donâ€™t want to do it anymoreA series of really frustrating things happened to me today and I lashed out on my loving boyfriend. He physically left our apartment and hasnt come back in a few hours. I'm so ashamed and I just wanna disappear. I guess I'm further away from self acceptance than I thought, because all I keep thinking is â€œWhy can't I just have normal reactions?â€ Here's the stupid honest thing, I know he still loves me, I know that I can do what I did today a thousand times over and he'd still love me. I'm trying so hard to get a grip because he deserves better. But I'm also so tired of fucking up. I know what I'm striving for is perfection and I know it's not healthy. And I'm trying really hard to forgive myself and love myself, but itâ€™s so hard. I don't wanna do it anymore. :(
