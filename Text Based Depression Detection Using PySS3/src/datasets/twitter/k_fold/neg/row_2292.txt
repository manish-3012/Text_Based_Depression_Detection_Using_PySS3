Would you want to dieIf youâ€™re mother took away everything and you woke up at 28 no friends barely had lived life. at 17 she convinced you not to apply to ivy leagues but your friends with less accomplishments got in. Yelled you into a fucking business degree at 23 when you come from a family of engineers and weâ€™re a year ahead in math. Couldâ€™ve gone to Ivy League and made tons of money but now teeth rotting out of mouth and no one in life. Teeth rotting cuz lack of self care comes with how she treats me, she let my baby teeth all rot so it was unintentionally for me but self abuse Iâ€™m used to. Business degree that pays nothing (literally they offer me 9-11 dollars hr) would you kill yourself?
