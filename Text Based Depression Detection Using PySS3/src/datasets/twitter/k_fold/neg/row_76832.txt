I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m feeling this wayI recently turned 17, and Iâ€™ve been dealing with Seasonal Affective Disorder for the past 3 years, so now is not a mentally happy time for me. I usually go through the worst of it in January/February, so Iâ€™m not looking forward to that. 

Anyway, Iâ€™ve been feeling extremely shit for the last little bit and even moreso feeling suicidal. Iâ€™ve thought about my own death for years now, but have never attempted or come close to anything like that. In reality, I likely donâ€™t even have a good reason to. I live a comfortable life, Iâ€™ve never had to worry about money, I donâ€™t have any kind of past trauma, my friends claim that they like me, but why do I feel like the world would be better off without me in it? 

Iâ€™m sorry if thatâ€™s too much, but if anyone has any ideas as to why I feel like this or what Iâ€™m going through, please help.
