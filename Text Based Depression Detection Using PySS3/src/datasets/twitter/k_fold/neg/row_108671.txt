[URGENT] My girl is depressed possibly suicidaltldr i met some girl about 3-4 months ago. she lives next to my country which is 2h of car travel to meet. everything was fine. we chat on snapchat. we talked (voice call) on snapchat about 6 days ago since now and she was normal, i made her laugh and she felt happy. all of a sudden since we ended that call the next day she didnt text me at all. i asked her questions and constructed long sentences and she replied with just 1 word. i realized something was horribly wrong. i asked her whats wrong, she said everything. just a 1 word reply. i asked can you be more specific etc. she just kept writing nonsense with 1 word per chat. she wrote 3 words yesterday and i asked her over 10 questions how can i help her and to tell me whats wrong. now i finally made her answer the voice call and her voice was extremely different. she was crying for the whole call, i kept asking her whats wrong and she kept replying "nothing" while crying. what??? i asked her: does something hurt you, did someone hurt you, did someone make you mad, did your sister make u mad (tried to be a little funny to cheer her up), etc and so many more questions and she replied to all of them "no". she does not want to tell me whats wrong and now she no longer wants to answer my text or call or sms. i said i care for you so please tell me whats wrong, im listening. she kept repeating "nothing". im worried she might be suicidal for whatever happened 5 days ago. can someone tell me what to do??
