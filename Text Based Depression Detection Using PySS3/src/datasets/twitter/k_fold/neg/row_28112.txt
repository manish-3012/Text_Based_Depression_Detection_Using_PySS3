My family doesn't care for me which is distracting me and made me suicidalMy dad is a raging alcoholic(he works) and fights with people and sometimes abuses in public. He also mentally harasses my mom and sometimes even me. I threatened him with suicide and different ways but he doesn't care, he replies he will suicide. Mom filed FIR at police station for harassment. But the police were reluctant because he got contacts there.

My mom from some months has bloody sputum/some blood in vomit, she used to get it in cold sometimes, or after eating something oily, or after some arguments/intense stress. She checked with doctor months back the X-ray report was normal and she took antibiotics for some time but later she didn't take more nor did doctor call her. She visited another ayurvedic doc and she then relied on some leaves and was fine for 2-3 months. She got brainwashed by YouTube quacks, started believing their conspiracy theories. and she's not willing to listen and starts aggressively shouting when I try to convince her to use antibiotics. Some days back she got cold and yesterday night she vomited some blood. She doesn't care about testing further and said she doenst care if she dies. She is still stressing about her mom who died 2 years back and sometimes cries about her and regretting she couldn't help her much in the end.

My grandma is evil narc and she has been pitting my dad against mom. Once we heard her telling him that my mom doesn't let her talk to me. 

My mom and me wanted to leave before January but we don't have a place right now to go to. We were planning to take on rent but transporting stuff is difficult and there's also issues of other necessities at new place. 

I fear something will happen to mom and I will be alone. My dad got his braincells killed with alcohol and I don't know what to do. I am 19 and just started college. I don't have the skills not means to get a job. No one is bothered about me, either self-absorbed or suicidal.
