yeaputting a knife to my wrist didn't give me any hesitation like how it used to, i am free from that, free to finally die

i hate seeing people having fun, it's just so depressing for me.

my sister goes out every night with her friend, it's nice to see her get out of her depression but at the same time

it hurts really bad

i have nothing now, it makes me realize that haha
