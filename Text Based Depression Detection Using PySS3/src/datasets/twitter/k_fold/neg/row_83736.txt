RelapseMy girlfriend left me recently, out of nowhere, just blocked me. I started self harming again, and I keep thinking about just going under, the peacefulness. How people would find out, how they would react. I've even subtly put it in conversation but in reality I just want to go. I want to feel something of peace, fuck I want to feel anything. I don't care anymore, about anything. My grades are slipping, my friends are leaving. I know I wouldn't be missed, that's not me rationalizing. I can't.
