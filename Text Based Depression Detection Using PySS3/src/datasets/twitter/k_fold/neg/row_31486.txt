May 25, 2022this is when I'm fucking ending it all. I don't care who I hurt, I don't care who I leave behind. I'm fucking done. the only things I'm living for are my little pony and steven universe. my little pony is done, and steven universe is about to enter its final season. they should be done my the end of my sophomore year, so that should give me enough time to finish them and then die. but I'm also, scared? I don't really want to die, but I have no choice. I'm never going to make it through adulthood, never. I'm too immature and the world asks too much of it's people. maybe I'll just go off the grid. I don't fucking care, I'm not even living right now. whatever.
