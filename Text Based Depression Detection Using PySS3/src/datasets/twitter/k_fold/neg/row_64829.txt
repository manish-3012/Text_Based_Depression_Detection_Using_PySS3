13 Reasons Why &amp; Why Not#  THE STORY

**(because people are not reasons, it is not their fault, never has been and never will be, that's my and only my plan)**

**1.M**

He said that I'm worth the difficulties. He said "let's be friends forever", "no matter what". He was one of my favourite "things" to be alive. Once real difficulties occured he got sick of me so much. He said that he'd tell me if he wanted me to be gone from his life. He even didn't do this. If even he started to hate me, then I must be really horrible. It is so surreal that he actually doesn't care about me anymore. I lost faith in friendship.  
***I understand that I had troubles with giving space.*** I didn't want to feel like an unwanted ghost. But yup, my bad.  
I didn't want him to have a girlfriend with vaginismus.

**2.L**

He said all these cool things about me. He was such a great friend. But he also changed his mind about me. At the end because of my suicidial talking he showed how much he hates me. He has been through a lot. He lost 4 people to suicide. I thought that he shouldn't be calling people who are suicidial as "manipulative". He said that I lack understanding and empathy. It's actually the opposite. I understand both sides. And I don't want him to lose anyone else to this. I just thought that he shouldn't be approaching suicidial people like that. At the end he told me to fuck right off and to leave him alone. To be honest, this makes me wanna kill myself more. I still respect him. I should have been selfish, like he said I was.  
***I know that he's been very patient with me.*** I still respect him and I still think that he's a great person.

**3.Vaginismus**

I die inside little by little everyday because of this.  
When I saw physical therapist, for the 1st time, we tried something. It was slightly embarassing but I was okay with this. Everything in clothes and not a big deal. And yet I was shaking and I wasn't able to control it. She also told me that I need therapy 1st.  
Well, therapist was able to SEE how I "handle" vaginismus  
When I saw the gynecologist for the 2nd time with my blood test results, she didn't want to try to examine me because I was already freaking out before going to her office.

I was actually diagnosed with this because I went to gynecologist for the 1st time in my life. M wants to have kids. Me? That's messy. I was told that he'd change his mind about being with me and I believed in this. So I went to the gynecologist to also check if I can actually have kids as my period has always been messy but I was too afraid to do anything about this.  
If I wanted to force him into anything, I wouldn't go to this terrifying place. It was also supposed to be something good for me.

Now I know that I am terrified of giving birth and I have a problem with calling myself a mother. That's after talking to a therapist about it too. I have a problem with being a woman. Maybe because I feel hated and useless?

This diagnosis has affected me deeply. I don't think about it much but I can feel its presence everyday.

***It's like living in a haunted house.***

I wish I didn't go there.

**4.Understanding**

Well, okay. L was quite right with saying that I lack understanding. I have some troubles with understanding social stuff. I think that I lack experience. Or it is just because of anxiety and the fact that my mind is really messed up. Or ***I*** ***ask too many questions, to understand BETTER***. OR all of this. They take it as my total lack of understanding.

I was also looking for some understanding from them. Found none. I didn't want to force anyone into anything. I wanted to be understood. At least a little.

**5.Empathy**

L is wrong. I actually have too much empathy. Once they accused me of something and even if my reaction to this was "wtf?", I think about these accusations and probably subconsciously agree with them. ***Because If I made them feel this way, I must have done something wrong.***  
I lack communication skills. I was trying to find some advices on how to communicate better.  
Then they started to call me manipulative. I just ruin everything.

**6.Jealousy over M's colleague**

Did I act stupid few times over jealousy. Indeed I had. Did A called it "blatantly jealous"? She had. M unfrotunately has spoken to her about it.

We met again. 1st evening I left my phone away. He was on his phone all the time. I must say I was a little hurt. I went to the balcony, he joined me too. But he was on his phone all the time. I was thinking about going on a walk. Just the two of us. But he was just staring at his phone. We slept in the same bed, it wasn't just this once. Nothing happened but to me that's already very intimate. I wanted to hold his hand but I was a coward.  
Next day he gave me his phone HIMSELF, to check something. Soon after, he very defensively asked me to give it back. There were more similiar situations.  
One evening we watched the big bang theory and young sheldon. It was just me and him, finally. I wanted to hug him but I was thinking about the girl he keeps talking to.  
At the end I hugged him. Twice. It was the best feeling in the world. I wanted to do it for the 3rd time but I thought that this is the end.  
When we got back home, he wanted more hugs. Really MORE HUGS.  
But then he just started cutting me out. I was actually thinking that I am probably wrong about this. I finally told him about my feelings. I was trying to find out 1st if I should. But M didn't want to be honest with me. ***I was so confused.***  
All of that obviously didn't happen over just 1 week.

Took me a while to realise that it wasn't really jealousy. I was angry that he played with my feelings. But I don't know how to get angry at people.

**7.A**

Oh my. I cannot believe that I dislike somebody this much.

I did act bad towards her ONCE at the beginning and then 2-3 times more. Yes. MY BAD. But one day, I did tell her that I am sorry. I promised to myself to be nice to her. And I have done it. I have been nothing but nice to her. Even when she was bullying me: "It's all your fault!". ***It wasn't easy to be nice to her, to be honest.***

**8.Jealousy over A**

I have never in my life felt so replaced. I used to feel worse than her because of my vaginismus. It is obviously only my fault. It hurt as fuck seeing him becoming closer and closer with her and pushing me away more and more.

This might be the main reason of lost friendships. ***It doesn't suprise me that vaginismus is directly involved with this.***

**9.The conflict: I love you and you don't want me, M. What do we do?**

I started to feel so alone in this conflict very fast. I just need too much. I know. I can't chill. I talk too much under stress. I vent too much (seen reddit?)  
M was saying NOTHING most of the time.  
Once I even scared myself when I did something: I joined a group voice call and started asking M if he still wants to be friends with me. I know. I am horrible.  
I wasn't supposed to talk to him. But I was thinking that if I cannot handle being his friend when he gets a girlfriend, then I just HAVE TO talk to him about this. For his own good. Maybe he'd want to finish this friendship right away. Why should I stay around and then leave him? ***I couldn't have done it to him.***  
I really didn't want to be that kind of friend.

**10.Stalking**

For some time, not all the time but it happened many times, I was checking if they were playing stupid league of legends and staying in private calls. I was looking for proof of them wanting me to be gone. ***I felt this unwanted.*** But I knew that my anxiety has been telling me many things. I stopped when M told me that he feels being stalked.

**11.Anxiety**

***Is so high that I can feel it, constantly.***  
Even endocrynologist told me that I am a very nervous person

**12**.**Hate**

***I HATE MYSELF***

**13**.**Asking if M has a girlfriend yet**

I have done it so many times. I was afraid that that was the reason why he constantly felt so distant or that's why he isn't being friends with me anymore. My bad, I know. It was very stupid of me. But remember that time (kinda more than once) when he didn't want to be honest with me, to not to hurt me? ***I was constantly afraid that it was happening over and over again.*** I was stupid, I know.

# WHY NOT

* **My family** \- that's easy to understand
* **My dog** \- He's already 11. He doesn't have much life left. I could find him a better home but I could also stay with him until his last day and then end myself.
