My life is falling apartWell, the title says pretty much everything.

I have always been a depressive person; it runs in the family: my father was depressive, just like one of my sisters. I've be to therapy and on SSRIs (Citalopram), but after years of treatment with no progress, I just gave up.

There is literally nothing I can hold on to. I have no friends (not a single one); I have no GF; I hate my job (I used to be recognized as a good professional, but my productivity is really low, lately - I might be fired soon); I'm going to lose my driver's license soon (need it to go to work); I have crippling insomnia (must've slept, in total, about six hours in the last three days). 

The only reason I haven't done it yet is because of my mother and my sister (they would be devastated), but I'm reaching my limit. I've already been looking for cliffs in the area I live (I live near the sea) - I know this sounds ridiculous, but I've never been so close of crossing to the other side.
