I realy dont want to go on living anymoreHi,
Im 19.
I have absolutely nothing.
I lost the girl i loved.
Im addicted to weed and a dozen other substances (whatever i have and makes me sleep a night).
Im in huge debt.
I donâ€™t have a job.
I donâ€™t have any degrees and no future.
Im the black sheep of the family and theyâ€™d rather wish i wasnâ€™t born.
I live in my own cuz my mom and dad kick me out. They are divorced so yes i was kick out twice. 
I try to be a nice guy but every one hates me and so do i. 

I donâ€™t want to go on but i just cant get myself to do it.

Anyone feel the same?
