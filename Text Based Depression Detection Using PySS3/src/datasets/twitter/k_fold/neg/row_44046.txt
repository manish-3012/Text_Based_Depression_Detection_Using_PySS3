Life feels pointlessEveryday feels worse than the day before. I'm losing the will to get up in the morning, I may not have had much to begin with but it was enough to keep me moving. Now the only question that runs through my head is "what's the point?"

What's the point of living, breathing, eating, working, going to my classes? What's the point of doing all those things when at the end of the day I still don't have the will to live and just want to die?
