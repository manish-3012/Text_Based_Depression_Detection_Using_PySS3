Suicide sounds so excitingI'm in a mood where it sounds fun and interesting. It feels like when my parents would say that we are going to an amusement park or traveling. I get an anxious, excited, uncontrollable happiness whenever I think about it. It makes it so difficult because I dont really know what happens when I die. But at the same time, it sounds like a fun experience and a good way to leave this life.
