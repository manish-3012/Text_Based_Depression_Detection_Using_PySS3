EverydayEveryday is a chore, love is a foreign concept. Iâ€™ve stopped caring about myself for so long I donâ€™t know who I am when I look in the mirror. The last person I thought I loved just told me they found someone else. Iâ€™m lost I donâ€™t know what to do all I can think about is just dying and I want it to be painful, I wanna burn myself and give it meaning Iâ€™m just waiting.
