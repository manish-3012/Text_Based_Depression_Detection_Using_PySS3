Tired of waitingBeen waiting for a friend to get back to me for almost a week. I can't keep waiting to get my affairs in order before I go. Its starting to not matter at all what is left when I go. Why get shit worked out before I finish the job when I won't be here to deal with it anyway. I've attempted before and was revived on scene. Ever since then I have felt as if I don't belong. Been trying to find somewhere I belong for too long now. It's time to just go.
