Not suicidal but have a questionI accidentally liked a suicidal comment on YouTube. It was a suicide causesâ€™ comment but her other comments were suicidal. If I delete my account as I want to start a new channel. To clarify I didnâ€™t like her other comments btw. Would it harm her mental health if delete my account which removes the like from that suicide causesâ€™ comment. You get notified when someone likes your comment so sheâ€™ll know if I removed the like.
