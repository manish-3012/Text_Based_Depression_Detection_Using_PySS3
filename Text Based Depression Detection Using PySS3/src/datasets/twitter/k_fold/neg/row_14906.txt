I have nothing going for me.I failed at everything. I spend my entire day on the internet getting drunk. no education/job, no social life, virgin, depression/anxiety killing me. my parents are so disappointed in me, they lie to our relatives in europe about what I'm up to. I am a walking L. never thought suicide would be a real option for me but now I'm starting to see it may be the only one I have left.
