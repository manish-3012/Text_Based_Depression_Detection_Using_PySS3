sad and in a lot of physical discomfortok, wasn't planning on typing this out, but may as well


So I goto an AA meeting tuesday nights, and there was a woman, whom i liked and we would always hug each other when we were both there, but she hasnt shown up in a few weeks, now while I am aware she may have chosen another meeting these past few weeks or been out of town, for the holidays, I feel like she just up and left and I missed a chance to ask her out,  She got a year in november and now I am really sad and missing her hugs, but on top of that, my upper back near my right shoulder blade is giving me problems, and is super tight and wont relax. plus I have been getting a rash from god knows what on my hips (starting to think my continuous glucose monitor or insulin pump may be causing this)  I feel really sad and down right now and just feel like I missed my chance to have a decent relationship with someone, who like me, is sober and wants to remain that way.  annoying part is, i could have gotten her number numerous times, but didn't either due to fear of being found out that I had it and called either creepy or stalker (last things I need right now), so even though I could have copied her number into my phone and not have anyone notice right away, I chose not to and wait for the right time.  Maybe there never was a right time with this one.  Damn my anxiety may it rot in hell along with whatever is causing this rash.  Now I feel like I will never be loved by another or have a chance at happiness.  I just want to give up so badly if I can't be happy, then why keep going?  I know I have some rope somewhere, just need to find it
