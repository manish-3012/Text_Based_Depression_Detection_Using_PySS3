My life feels meaninglessI don't even know what to do with my life. I'm such a failure, and I have pretty close to zero friends smh. I'm grateful for the good times in life, but the bad out weighs the good on so many levels, and sometimes I just don't even know if it's worth continuing. I wish I was able to have that constant strain of happiness like some people can hold, but I'm just... me.
