Iâ€™m consumed of my suicidal thoughtsA year ago my ex and I split (8 years together...middle school sweethearts) it was the worst thing I ever went through and I still look at myself in the mirror wondering how I endured the heartbreak and mental abuse. Iâ€™m 23 and have no desire to live. Heâ€™s moved on and found someone a lot better than me, and Iâ€™m ok with admitting that. We were toxic. But I havenâ€™t found anyone and have had no interest in looking for Mr. Right anymore. I had my chance and I fucked it up plain and simple. I donâ€™t miss what I had, however I see no point in tomorrow, next year or ten years from now. My life is an entire regret, and who wants that? Not me. This world is so fucked, and so am I. I struggle at work with my suicidal thoughts but manage to fight through it just because of the work. I go home and even when Iâ€™m with my family I still feel this way. One trigger and I have tunnel vision. Iâ€™m alone and itâ€™s even worse. Iâ€™m scared of what Iâ€™m going to do tonight. I live with my sister and she just went on vacation. I was so excited to come home and have some self care time, and I just had a trigger to my ex and now my body is numb. I keep thinking of ways to die. I donâ€™t know what else to do. I want to run away. But even when Iâ€™m alone Iâ€™m still in danger. I truly have no one to call or no one to run to to seek comfort. I donâ€™t think I ever have and honestly I just donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore. I would pay someone to shove all my pills down my throat.  I want people to know Iâ€™m gone honestly. Itâ€™s sick to say that but I truly donâ€™t have anyone and when people find out Iâ€™m gone least they will think about me. I just wish I had someone to sit by my side in silence even. I dont know how Iâ€™ve made it this far. I would love to never feel again
