Having trouble with disturbing thoughts about suicide.Not to alarm anyone as this is not an impulsive thing, nor is it emotional. At least at the moment... 

I have been thinking greatly over time... with all the suffering in this world... the hardship it takes just to SURVIVE let alone have a nice life, how everything is destructive and manipulative in nature, how everything wants to EAT you physically and metaphorically.... 

It feels as though this universe is almost "evil" in a way... so I had a thought that what if this universe or planet IS hell? What if the best thing to do to go elsewhere in a place of less suffering is suicide? 

I know there are good people yes, but are they really good or only being good because that gives them good feelings (gaining dopamine in the brain speaking simply), but what about all the non-people evil things like animals virus bacteria.... disease like cancer... so much pain and suffering. All organisms just want to impulsively eat and collect resources to further propagate the suffering. What if this is simply corrupt? The only way out is to die and not come back? Not reincarnate (if thats what happens at least....)? What if I as a soul (if that exists) was tricked or something to coming into this suffering prison which is this soggy meaty human body?
