It hurts so muchSomeone really important to me, my best friend of 7 or 8 years just told me goodbye. We havent always had a perfect friendship, but she meant the world to me. She was so important to me, like a sister i never had. We have been through so much. And i mesesd up a lot, but i tried to fix my friendship with her as much as i could, and i tried to never do anything to make her mad. I was so scared to make her mad at me. I dont like fighting. But she said bye to me like i was... garbage. That i never meant anything to her. That what she meant to me, was not the same for her EVER. 
This hurt is immense. I already have depression, because i have severe social anxiety disorder, and i have family problems. I dont know what to do. I dont want to let go. I dont want to lose her. I need help. PLease someone out there, what do i do.
please
