fantasizing about being taken awaystarting to realize how reckless im becoming and it scares me... a part of me wishes that someone would overhear me talking about suicide and be concerned, or that someone sends police to my house even though it wouldnt end well. is it worth it? i can only get involuntary help bc my parents are strictly against pretty much any form of help (anti vax children, wya??) but idk if its even worth my time anymore or if i should just kind of sit and marinate until im a legal adult.
