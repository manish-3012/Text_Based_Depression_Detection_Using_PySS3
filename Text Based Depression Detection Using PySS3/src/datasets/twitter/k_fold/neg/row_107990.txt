How do you put off killing yourself?Iâ€™ve been pretty suicidal for a long time and I know for sure that itâ€™s going to be the way I die, barring some freak accident. But for the next couple years Iâ€™m going to have too many people around me that I donâ€™t want to hurt, I made the mistake of making friends. Ideally Iâ€™d like to wait until my dad dies, but that could be a long time, and I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep at this. If I need to make it a few more years, what can I do? I already use most easily attainable drugs which makes it a little easier, and I keep volunteering and donating blood so thereâ€™s some actual purpose to my time here. Any other recommendations? What keeps you here in spite of all this suffering?
