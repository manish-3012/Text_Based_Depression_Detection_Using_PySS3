I just had my first suicidal thought in quite some time and have no one to talk to.I dont want to concern my parents, my therapist is on holiday and hotlines are shit in my country. I just dont want to be here anympre. All i hear all day long is everything on this planet going to shit and I just dont want to be here anymore when everything goes down. I wont do anything  but I just dont know how to deal with this. Also my depression is getting worse and reminding me on everything I ve ever did remotely wrong.
