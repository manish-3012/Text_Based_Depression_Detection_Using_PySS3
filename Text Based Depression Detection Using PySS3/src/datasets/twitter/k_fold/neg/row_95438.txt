i feel trapped and like death is the only escapeiâ€™m fucking sick of this shit, iâ€™ve been fine all quarantine and iâ€™d probably be even more chill if I just was anywhere but this home. Iâ€™m (16M) sick of my parents getting drunk every fucking night for the past few months and then verbally fighting between each other even though theyâ€™re drunk and literally donâ€™t mean/wonâ€™t remember any of the shit theyâ€™re saying or arguing about. They started only doing it socially and rarely getting drunk but now itâ€™s a fucking routine of every night and tbh iâ€™ve pondered ending it just so iâ€™m not stuck in this hellhole i call life anymore. Itâ€™s even worse when my dad doesnâ€™t believe heâ€™s as bad as he is and my mom just tells me to â€œshut upâ€ when i talk about her drinking. i might as well kill myself maybe then theyâ€™ll get the fucking message that they should quit. Iâ€™ve intervened and stopped about 5 fights now and I literally am at the point where itâ€™s taking a toll on me to intervene. On top of this Im 16 in the middle of a pandemic so itâ€™s not like I can move out and be financially comfortable either. Iâ€™m literally trapped living with two pieces of shit who make me want to put a bullet in my fucking skull every night. Iâ€™m trying to distract myself but itâ€™s so hard to at this point. Itâ€™s so bad i literally flinch and start tearing up/getting anxietyat any loud noise (PTSD???). I donâ€™t know man I just need someone to talk to because it feels so hopeless right now.
