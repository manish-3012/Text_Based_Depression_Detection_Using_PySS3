Feel like a failureAlmost flunked out of high school despite being "gifted" and yet everyone still thinks I'm smart and have so much potential despite lots of evidence pointing to the contrary. I didn't go to college because I know I can't handle it. I can't hold down a job. Tried coming out as trans, but my family didn't like that and I rely on them, so I'm basically stuck until I'm self-reliant, which feels next to impossible at this point. I fucked up all my friendships because either they were terrible people or I don't have anything in common with them anymore. I know fixing this stuff isn't impossible for most people, but with someone with as little motivation and drive as me it probably is. I think I'm just happy to let everything fester until I'm too unhappy to keep living.
