Apathy for LivingI don't know how to properly begin. I've struggled with depression for years, and there are times when I feel at my worst. As I write this, it feels like I'm stuck in a tar pit.

Full disclosure: I'm gay, autistic, and I look overly youthful for someone my age. In addition, I've recently learned that I come across as robotic. Everyone else in my life is an eloquent social butterfly, while I struggle to maintain the illusion that I have the social maturity of a college student. I also suspect my high introversion contributes to sabotaging any chance I have for even a platonic friendship. Overall, I have good reason to believe that none of my peers actively want to be with me, and that they all tolerate my existence at best.

I've had suicidal thoughts, even plans, but I wouldn't (or couldn't) act on them; I have too many obligations in my life to carry them out. Even still, I don't care about being alive anymore; I'm just apathetic to the possibility of dying tomorrow for all anyone cares.
