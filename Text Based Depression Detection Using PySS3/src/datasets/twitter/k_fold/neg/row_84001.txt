Death in a forestI went on a nature walk today, and all I could think about was being consumed by the wilderness. 

Essentially Iâ€™m at my end with life. I feel I reached my peak about 5 years ago, and should have died then. 

Now Iâ€™m just a walking mess. No job, no gf, living w parents and leeching off everyone to survive.

The thing is, I donâ€™t want love or a happy life or anything like that. All I want is a good way for this story to wrap up before I disgrace myself any further. Iâ€™m done. 

It will most likely happen p soon, and when it does, I hope I am in that forest. Dust to dust, ya know?
