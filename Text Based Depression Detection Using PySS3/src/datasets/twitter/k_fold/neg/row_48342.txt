Some people love to guilt trip people with real depression and IT SUCKS!I don't really have any mental illness but I have two friends who had anxiety attacks and depression and it really grinds me that whenever I see social posts or people constructing words for mental illness and then indirectly implying that it's their fault if they suicide or have mental illness.

They would say to me that it doesn't really make them feel any better and they would actually think of themselves worse and I'm really hurt whenever I see them like that and I don't know what to do.
