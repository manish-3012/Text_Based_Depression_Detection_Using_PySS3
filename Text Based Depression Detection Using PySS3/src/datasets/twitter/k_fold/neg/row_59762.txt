Small things that make feel bad enough to consider suicideA list of some small things that make me suicidal, or experience great distress in general:

Note: These things really are small. Almost too small to be a sensible cause for suicidal ideation

\-Cringing at things that I did, the general concept of cringy people, and the sensation that people are cringing at me, since I don't know how to cope with it, and lack the emotional maturity to handle any sensation of shame, guilt, or frustration in a healthy way, but also feel like people would cringe at me/ I would cringe at myself for exactly that, so I fear doing anything at all or putting myself out there, since there is a chance that I might up ending cringeworthy to others, and moreso, to myself

\-Feeling good about myself, because I know that feeling happy only comes to be when I work for it, and I dread having to work hard consistently to be happy

\-Realsing that I change for the better, because that means that I wasn't as good before, which makes me doubt my current self, which makes me feel like I will never be self aware enough to know if I'm good the way I am, or not

\-Relationships of any kind, as I don't like the responsibility of comittment, and because I prefer to spend my time alone more than with people

\-My own bad habits, again, because of the amount of hard work that I would have to put with to change, yet being self aware enough to see my bad habits also makes me feel bad

\-Being called out for being rude, which basically ties in with all the things above, even though I don't enjoy being rude, but I'm currently not self aware enough to know how rude I am exactly at any given time

\-The concept of change, since I need consistent stability and control of at least some aspects of my life, and I don't know which of those things are at danger of being taken away by change

\-Being late to events, since it makes me realise how much procrastination takes over my life, and it makes me fear a loss of my control over myself and my life

\-Not getting to do what I want, at least related to things that are important to me, since I need them to stay alive

\-The concept of mindfulness as a coping mechanism related to anxiety, since it feels like a loss of control, but only in certain aspects, for example related to my disability or social phobia, even though I don't disagree with it in a general sense, as it can be beneficial, but sometimes when people advise it to me, it feels like people don't see my problems as big enough of a deal as they are to me, which makes me feel invalidated, and makes me also question the severity of my struggles, and if my struggles are no big deal, and I only feel burdened of them due to my own incompetence, I feel uncertain about my own self awareness again

\-This list, since complaining about small things and being suicidal because of them shows a lack of maturity, and makes me feel like a disposable member of society that people look down upon in general, and it also makes me look down on myself, also it looks pretty much irrational and hyperbolic when your read through it a second time, but the suicidal ideation is there whenever I actually experience it related to the things that I have written

\-Using suicidal ideation as a coping mechanism, since it makes me feel inferior

\-Happy and stable people, since they make me feel inferior and like a waste of life

\-People interpreting my words and emotions, instead of asking me about them, since they basically take control of me in that way

\-The sentence "there's a lot to unpack here", as I wasn't aware that it was a derogatory sentence, and now whenever I hear it, I know that it's going to be related to something negative (related to putting me in my place) directed towards me, and the fact that I wasn't aware enough to be enough of a jerk that it would warrant this sentence to be directed towards me makes me feel bad

\-Me rushing into things out of fear of losing time, which in turn just makes me lose time while I'm being too anxious to actually enjoy/ be aware of the process that is supposed to lead me to my goal

\-My capacity of ending up having the worse aspects of my parents inside of me, and I want to die whenever I recognise it
