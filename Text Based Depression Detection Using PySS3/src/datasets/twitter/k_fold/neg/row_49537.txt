Just looking up ways to kill myself...I`ve tried overdosing, i`ve cut myself, fallen asleep with a bag on my head, but yet I still can`t get to were I wamt to go so badly... i`m loosing sight, no, ive completly lost sight of happiness and what it means to live as a productive member of society... so again I lah in bed and research past suicides to hopefully come across something I can handle myself...
