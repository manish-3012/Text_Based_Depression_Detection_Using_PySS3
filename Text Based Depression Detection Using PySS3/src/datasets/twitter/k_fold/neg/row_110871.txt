If my suicide attempt fails how will it effect my life?Recently I just canâ€™t get suicide off my mind, Iâ€™ve been a dark place and these past few days have been really tough. My plan before was to get a certification to work in a pharmacy and eventually go to school to study anesthesiology. My question is, if my suicide attempt fails will those no longer be options for me because of it? Will I not be allowed to work around prescriptions or medications? And if anyone knows, how many mg of propranolol does it take to OD?
