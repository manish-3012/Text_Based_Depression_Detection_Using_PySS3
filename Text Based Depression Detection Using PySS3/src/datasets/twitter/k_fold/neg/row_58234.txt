Had enoughMy marriage has fallen apart. We love each other but we can't seem to work out how to be together. I don't want to go on anymore. 

She can't afford to move out and support herself. She gave up everything to come here for this. I can't afford to pay for both of us to live separately. I have really good death in service benefits from my employer. If it was an accident, she would have enough money to keep the house and look after herself and the animals. It seems like the best way to make everyone happy. 

Right now, the only thing keeping me going is my dog. But she'd look after him.

I don't really want anything, just needed to get this out. I have no one else.
