No motivation.I feel as if theres no point to get out of bed anymore. Im online schooled and a shut in. I have 0 irl friends and when I even try to go out in public I feel sick to my stomach and just think about how I can end it all. I dont think my mother really cares anymore. I have broken down in front of her multiple times and all she says is that she will help but never does. I feel like my life started so short ago but now I just feel like it will never end. I dont want to die, But im starting to think its my only choice.
