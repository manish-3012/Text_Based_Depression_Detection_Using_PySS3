Iâ€™m drowning in my own failuresI donâ€™t even know what to say really. Looking back, everything is really my fault. I sit in my room and cry and wish and wish and wish that my life was different, but I realize Iâ€™m the one who made it this way. 

I could blame my extremely traumatic childhood, abusive father, narcissistic mother, or anything else, but to be honest I donâ€™t know how much that all really affects me. Iâ€™m just fucking lazy. And every decision Iâ€™ve made in 2017 was terrible, and itâ€™s led me to where I am now. 

Last October I was looking at engagement rings. Living with the man I intended to marry and planning our return trip to Italy for this year. February, it turns out that I actually donâ€™t make him happy. Our home, our life that we had built together was over. Instead of staying in my city, I ran. 

I ran to my â€œhometownâ€ where the closest thing Iâ€™ve got to family are. I stayed with them. Nursed myself back to happiness with them. Created a plan. And then fucked it all up. 

Last year I was saving for a house and planning an engagement, this year Iâ€™m $10k in debt, no way to pay my rent, and I just heard back from my dream job that theyâ€™re looking at an internal candidate. My ticket out of this mess is now gone... because of me.

Now I have to face those amazing people who believe in me and tell them that Iâ€™ve failed again. That thatâ€™s all I do. All I do is fail. I can barely work up enough energy to walk to the bathroom. I want to die but Iâ€™m too lazy to do it. Iâ€™m too much of a pussy. I just donâ€™t want to continue living this life. Iâ€™ve fucked it up so badly and have no energy or motivation to find positivity. To even begin to fix it. Itâ€™s just fucked and Iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m exhausted from having to look in the mirror and see the disgusting piece of shit staring back at me. 

No one gets it. And thatâ€™s understandable. Iâ€™d rather die than continue to take freebies from people who care about me. Itâ€™s impossible to explain but I feel like Iâ€™m being physically held down. Like â€œlazyâ€ isnâ€™t a powerful enough word for how immobile I feel. None of this probably makes any fucking sense. I donâ€™t know. Maybe Iâ€™m dead already. 

I watched my life fall apart and then saw a glimmer of hope. This job. A job I could truly be happy with and make enough money to pay my debts and take care of the people who have taken care of me. And itâ€™s as good as gone now. Iâ€™m back to nothing. 

I donâ€™t think I have the energy to wait for another glimmer of hope. I think Iâ€™m done now.
