I'm dying Saturday and I feel really calm about it.I'm honestly cool with dying. I feel complete. Done a lot for my family that they didn't even ask for. Done a lot for my job, let them take advantage of me because I figured I'm dying anyway. I've just gotta organize my belongings and decide what's getting tossed or donated. Doing that Thursday. Still settling on a method for sure, but I've got two options. Think I'm gonna plan for both and just decide on Saturday. I'm leaving on a good note I think.
