I've done the same thing again. No more.I've spent all my money. This isn't the first time I've done this. I'll go on long kicks without looking at my bank account, and then I don't realize what's happened until it's too late. My card was declined when I tried to buy my lunch. The cashier was nice enough to let me take it and eat because I go there a lot and she sees me and said I could pay for it later. So instead of going to my next class, I went back to my room and cried and fell asleep.

I have a lease with the student housing I live in and bills for a motorcycle and car- all horrible decisions, by the way. I'm at a loss for what to do. This isn't the first time I've done this to myself, but this is probably the worst situation I've gotten myself into. I have some ideas of how to get out of it- sell some electronics and things of mine, find a job, perhaps. But I don't care. I keep doing this to myself and I'm not going to change. If I fix this I'm just going to fuck things up again. I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't even go to the store because one of my tires is flat. I may call the counselor that I've seen here (but no longer, it was short term) because I only see one option out of this. I don't know why I'm writing this, but than you for reading it.
