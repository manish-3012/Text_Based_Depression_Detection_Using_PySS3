Yikesfound out my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend a year ago. It only lasted a week or two but im so hurt they hid it from me for this long :/ Im falling back into some really bad habits and i really really really need some encouragement. Im at my breaking point, i really dont trust myself anymore
