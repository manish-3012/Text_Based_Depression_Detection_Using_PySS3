Another night alone :/Iâ€™m really tired of feeling this pain and feeling so alone and lonely every night. I just want to be loved and Iâ€™m really sad that I may not ever experience this because of this pain Iâ€™m feeling constantly. I want it all to end tomorrow. Why do i have to wait to be loved? An in it worthy now? :/
