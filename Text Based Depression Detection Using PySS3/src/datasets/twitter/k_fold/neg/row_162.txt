I'll never do anything meaningful with my lifeI have no skills, no motivation, no talent, nothing really. The thought of not doing something meaningful with my life makes me just want to give up, which I realize is totally counterintuitive, but it just makes me hopeless. I just quit my job as a dishwasher(again) last night, and I just feel like I'll never do something I'll feel is good enough in my life. I'll be a fucking dishwasher or some shit my whole life, serving people that actually have their shit together. Fuck that, I'd rather just die now, and I just might.
