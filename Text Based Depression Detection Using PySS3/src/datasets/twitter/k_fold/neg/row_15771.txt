Waiting for deathI just want to die most days the days like now. 
I try best to be positive but my thoughts always find me.
The quietest places are the loudest for me.
I have no one to be there for me and it's always been lonely .
My pain is physically , emotionally and forever.
I want to sleep for eternity ....
