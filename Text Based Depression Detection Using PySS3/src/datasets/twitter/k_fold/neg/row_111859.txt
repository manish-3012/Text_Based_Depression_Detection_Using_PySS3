F*ck it! I give up!Lately, I've just been getting ignored (whether it is in person, e-mail, text, facebook, etc.) and I just can't take it anymore! I try to make conversation with someone and then, it just stops abruptly (for no reason at all). And this is with a different person every time.

Am I saying or doing something wrong? Why does everyone pretend that I don't exist? Why must I do some stupid shit to make my presence known instead of naturally being noticed?

Everyone is like, "Oh, I'm too busy and blah blah blah", but the truth is is that you're never TOO busy; I'm just low on your priority list. When it comes to other people, I am there for them, but it's unrequited for me. Why is that? I can't even have a decent, genuine friend these days without them just thinking about themselves.

Do I have to f*ckin' cut myself or mutilate myself just to get some attention? Apparently so, because the news seems to depict negative information quite often and it does get attention, so why not? Bet they'll miss me when I'm gone. I guess that's when I become more valuable. But guess what? I have no value to offer once I'm gone.

NOTE: I'm NOT desperate for attention; I'm just tired of being ignored (as if I don't matter). It just seems like the only attention I get is when I do something bad or wrong, but everything else (all other good deeds) go unnoticed.
