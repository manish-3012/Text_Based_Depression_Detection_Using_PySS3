It's happeningI reached out all winter break, family didn't care on my birthday or Christmas, so after I hit post on this tonight I'm going to give them the present they all wanted. I'll be gone. They better not say they care no one did. They still don't. Honestly I don't even know why I'm typing this. But maybe one day they'll realize all I wanted was to be treatedc like a person it's been good reddit.
