let down by the one person i could talk tobasically, if you've read my last post, you'll know that i feel like my life is in the shitter, so yesterday i let slip by accident for the first time ever (9 years and 8 months since the start of my depression) that i'm depressed to my mum; literally the only person i can somewhat trust to tell about it (i don't really talk with anyone else). her reaction surprised the hopeful side in my brain but did not surprise the negative side. knowing of my depressive state at school; but not my suicidal state, she said 'really?', and not in a pity or caring way; like a 'you have got to be kidding me' kinda way. the one person i trusted to tell didn't believe me despitye the fact that the first time i had depression i had to DROP OUT OF SCHOOL 2 weeks before my exams because it was so bad.
we had a brief back and forth (no less than two minutes) and i explained that this shit doesn't just die off like a cold; i got this look from her that just screamed 'man up buttercup' and with as little emotion as possible she said' well, you should just go and see your GP then', completely shirking any consideration about my well-being to a person i've only seen 6 times at max. said GP has a waiting list of around a month and in my head i scream at her 'CHRIST ON A BIKE... I MIGHT BE DEAD BY THEN GODDAMMIT'. 
so here i sit, at work trying not to tell myself how much of a waste i am and forcing myself not to think about how fast 'that train' was moving this morning (way too slow to actually kill me, the cars on the road move faster) or to begin writing a fucking suicide note. 
Fuck, i hate life. i hate waking up at 3 in the morning and then going through a 2 and a half hour depression attack from the voices in my head while hugging a stuffed fucking animal i got when i was 9!
sorry to rant, need to vent to something other than a fictional imaginary confidante (i talk to her more than i talk to anything else, seriously)
