My friend needs help and I'm scaredI have known her for years and I have known her to battle with depression. Currently she's unemployed and not in school with no health insurance. She just keeps moving around to try and make the depression go away and it's not working. I just found out how serious it is when she told me twice that she was planning on doing it, I told her to come over immediately and she seemed fine even though I know she's not. She had with her the means to kill herself when  she came over and I let her stay obviously. I want her to get better but she doesn't think therapy will work, having tried it many time. I told her I'm not equipped for this and I can't give good advice. I'm there to listen and calm her down but it doesn't fix the depression. I don't want to refer her to a suicide hotline. That's a last ditch effort for emergencies, which this could turn into. I want to put her on the road to recovery and help her say there with my friendship and support but I can't do this alone.  I don't know where I can find this help for free. The kind of help needed to get over a long term depression after multiple therapists. I'm going to try everything I can within my reason but I need advice. I'm so scared I'm going to walk in and find her dead on my bedroom floor.
