I've missed out on my life and I don't see it getting any better.The immense, terrifying, unfathomable fear that it's already over is becoming too much to bear.  Mistakes cost you dearly.  All of them add up.  At a certain point, you can only look over your shoulder, and see how badly you have fucked up.    

I lost out on my youth.  I was never young.  I never kissed, had relationships, went to parties, had adventures.  I never had a crush on a girl from across the room.  I never made friends, made memories.  I never went to college, learned, became disciplined, or found a passion.  I have not spoken to a peer in 6 years, nor have I left my room to socialize for about 10.  I am completely and utterly unsalvageable.  And even if I were, I missed some of the most crucial formative, experimental, and carefree periods of my life.  

I have chronic nerve and back pain from spending 20 hours a day on the computer.  I'm severely underweight because I can't find the energy to eat.  I'm ugly as shit.  I have a sub-average IQ.  I've been working minimum wage shit jobs and have gotten fired from all of them.

Worst of all, I might be transgender.  I've been researching it for some time, and I think I have light or fleeting gender dysphoria.  But now I'm an old ass man, I'd look disgusting if I transitioned, and I'll never get to be a girl so why fucking bother?     

There's nothing left for me.  I've set a hard deadline for 30 years old, which will give me a few years to see if it's worth sticking out.  

Most of all, what hurts is the regret.  I could've changed things.  *I* could've turned things around when it mattered.  But I didn't, and now the effects are permanent, and are going to haunt me for the rest of my short, miserable life.
