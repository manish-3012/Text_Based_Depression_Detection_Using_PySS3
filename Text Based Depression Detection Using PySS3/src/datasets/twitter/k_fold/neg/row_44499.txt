I donâ€™t want to live.Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where I feel like I donâ€™t have any friends and have no where to turn I know itâ€™s inevitable that Iâ€™m gonna kill myself considering Iâ€™m on the young side and my mom is in her mid 60â€™s Iâ€™ve already attempted suicide multiple times in my life and at this point the only thing keeping me alive is my mom because I know it would break her if she found me dead in my room. I canâ€™t even turn to entertainment like YouTube or any social media considering how everyoneâ€™s always getting upset at nothing.
