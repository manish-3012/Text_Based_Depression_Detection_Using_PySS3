The only person I have ever cared about made me promise not to kill myself.I donâ€™t know why I did it but after I attempted suicide I told the only person who I have cared about what I did. She gave me the usual â€œoh we all care about you and life is a presentâ€ crap and made me promise not to try again. I donâ€™t know what to do or how I feel. God I hate morals so fucking much
