would be dead if it weren't for guiltthis is my first and probably only post, i just need to be heard right now. i'm 19. i've been depressed and suicidal for about 7 years now, suffer from complex ptsd, and the ONLY reason i haven't killed myself is that i feel too guilty about what it would do to my friends and family. it is so miserable living for other people. i want someone to tell me that they would all be okay and able to move on so that i could justify doing it. i'm a terrible person, and the pain i feel every day far outweighs any possible joy i could ever feel. i've been through so many treatments for so long that i know i will never fully recover at this point. life is not worth it for me, and i'm just so tired. i feel like i need to turn off my ability to feel guilt for just a few hours so that i could stop forcing myself to stay alive.
