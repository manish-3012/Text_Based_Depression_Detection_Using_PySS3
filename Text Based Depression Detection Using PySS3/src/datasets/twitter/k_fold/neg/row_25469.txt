my son says he wants to dieIâ€™ve watched my well adjusted happy son withdraw so much in the past year.  He is a freshman in college in a large city about an hour away.  He hates his dorm, his school, and is not making friends., losing confidence. Talks constantly of escaping, dropping out and â€œending it allâ€.  The past few nights have been awful worry-filled insomnia...when do I call 911?  Iâ€™m afraid of starting a chain of events that will end with him in a psychiatric facility...his father (weâ€™re divorced) is in denial...
