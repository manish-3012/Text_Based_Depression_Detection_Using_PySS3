I'm sitting here Crying, Not sure if I will make it through the NightI have been staying up every night till till endless hours for the past 2 months. my thoughts swirling in my head. I think about suicide during most of this time and how unimportant I am to everything around me. I don't want to talk about my life and its ups and downs. I don't have any specific reason to kill myself. I just feel like i should and I can't explain it. I'm reaching out for hope because I see none.
