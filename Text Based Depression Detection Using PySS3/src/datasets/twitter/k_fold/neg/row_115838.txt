I want to break up with my girlfriend but I am afraid she will kill herself..When we first started, our relationship was amazing... We both have depression, (although mine has been reduced greatly) and low self esteem. I still love her... but not in the same way anymore. I don't feel content in our relationship. I am very artistic and while she is very artistically talented, she doesnt care much for art or making things in general. (I know, minor thing but creativity is a huge part of my life). She will get upset anytime i pick up a guitar to sing her a song (she didnt use to, but for the past few months she has), or just to play in general... I need someone who is creative with me or at least supportive of me in a relationship. We used to laugh and have fun all the time, and be able to talk about nothing for hours on end and never get bored with each other... Now when we are in a call for more than an hour some kind of drama happens, and she gets really sad and starts crying... and I understand its not her fault and i honestly feel like such duchebag for wanting to break up with her for something she cant control but its really taxing on me mentally... I feel so stressed, so much more that when we started dating. We have been dating for 8. almost 9 months now... For 2 months it's gotten miserable for both of us, after my mom walked in on me fingering her, we have had to had a camera on us at all times. We can't kiss, we can't hug too much, we can't cuddle for hours on end like we used too... and i feel like thats a huge factor for why our relationship isn't working anymore... when we had physical touch taken away to comfort each other (not sexual im referring to by the way, mainly just cuddling) everything fell down hill.
We get in a fight almost every day now over different things, and its gotten to the point where i actually try to avoid hanging out with her as much as possible instead of the other way around...
She has anorexia, and has really bad body image issues and after becoming severely underweight she is now slightly overweight and feels worse about herself now than she ever has.. I still think she is beautiful and obviously i cant cure that about her but her constant negativity and self loathing brings me down with her...
She is the best relationship i've ever had. The only one i felt was genuine, real, and great (for a while) but Its gone downhill and is no longer what i want or need in a relationship... I feel like i have to constantly walk on eggshells or she will cry or have a mental breakdown and its so stressfull... I love her but i cant do it anymore. I cant do it for much longer.
She has told me many times that i am the only good thing in her life and that if i broke up with her she wouldn't know what she would do and she has had suicidal thoughts more and more often... She has been to a mental hospital before (as have I) and i feel like as soon as i breakup with her she will have to go again.... she is already unstable enough as is and if i break p with he rright now she will do something irreversable...
I was thinking i would wait until school started to break up with her... either the day before or day of so that she would have friends to support her and be around other people... We are both going to different schools next year (both starting high
