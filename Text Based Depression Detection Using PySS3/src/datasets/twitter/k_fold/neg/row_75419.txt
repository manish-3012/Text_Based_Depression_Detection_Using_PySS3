So thinking on suicide, and it seems like itâ€™d be harder to peacefully kill myself than Iâ€™d like.  Maybe it is because I know people whoâ€™ve tried and failed._x000D_

My sister tried drinking everything under the sink and eating a bunch of pills (we didnâ€™t have any fatal pills), all she managed to do was damage her liver and kidneys; she apparently would have needed to eat a lot more before she reached fatal liver damage.  She ended up vomiting a lot which countered her efforts as well._x000D_

A family friend tried shooting himself, and now his head is very very messed up and he has quite a bit of brain damage.  Blew off a chunk of his face too.  Other friends found him.  They said they could still see him looking around immediately afterwards, it was quite horrific._x000D_

Another friend tried cutting his wrists and while he bled to the point where he passed out, he didnâ€™t die._x000D_

I was trying to think about how Iâ€™d do it, and there arenâ€™t a lot of good ways for me.  Ideally, I guess Iâ€™d like to take a couple bottles of sleeping pills and top it off with a bunch of alcohol, but I donâ€™t know where to score prescription strength sleeping pills, I donâ€™t have a doctor to lie to right now.  You can take boxes of over the counter sleeping pills without even approaching lethality.  Hell most of the stuff you can get over the counter even if you take a ton of it, it wonâ€™t kill you.  Same with most rat poisons.  _And_ even if you reach a lethal dose what you have to look forward to is liver failure, a week long and painful death.  So I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™d go about doing that._x000D_

Iâ€™ve gone to a gun store before, but felons canâ€™t purchase guns.  They had all these signs up â€˜purchase a gun for someone who canâ€™t buy it themselves and you get 10 years in prison.â€™_x000D_

So without access to a doctor for sleeping pills or guns, what do I have left?_x000D_

I could run a hose from the car exhaust to the inside, but I donâ€™t have a garage so Iâ€™d have to find someplace secluded enough that I could be alone while the CO does itâ€™s thing.  I think CO would be an OK way to go, fall asleep and donâ€™t wake up, which is what Iâ€™d want.  I donâ€™t really want an overly messy death that someone else would have to clean up.  I think I remember hearing anti-freeze is a strong poison, but I donâ€™t remember how it kills you._x000D_

Not a big fan of jumping either, because it seems like itâ€™d be messy and if you failed you might not be in good enough condition afterwards to ever try again._x000D_
