Just a heads upHello, I am new to the reddit community and this is my first post. However, that's not why I am here. The other day, I saw a user commenting on someone's post saying to kill themselves and being mean-spirited. I can't recall their username at the moment, but I sent a message to the moderators and reported him. I just want people to know that if you are a depressed or suicidal member of this subreddit, and someone responds to your post in a negative fashion, don't listen to them. About 99% of the people here are great people, and we are trying to put a halt to people doing things like this. Also, if you see someone like this, please report them to the moderator immediately. I hope I gave you the heads up.
