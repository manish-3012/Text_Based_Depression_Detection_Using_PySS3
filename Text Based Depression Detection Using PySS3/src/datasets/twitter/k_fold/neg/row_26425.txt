I'm 30, without an education (not even a school grafuation) and the only reason I'm here is because I know I'd make my family sad if I wasn't, but every day, I think about how easy it would be to just quit rather than keep fightingI'm sick of everything. I recently got out of an alcohol abuse and made this account to help me stay on track. I almost killed myself at the beginning of last year and now those feelings are starting to resurface. Not only will it be a year since the darkest place of my life in less than a month, but I fail to see a future for myself.

Everyone keeps congratulating me on reaching this point of my life and it makes me sick. It reminds me of the things I haven't done yet and all the things I could've achieved. I just turned 30 a month ago and I have no education, not even papers on having finished basic school. I started school this summer but I feel so stupid. Everyone keeps telling me how well I'm doing, but I fucking suck at understanding math and other essentials topics. I can't help but think to myself that the teachers are rating my assignments with high grades because they feel sorry for me because of my history. I'm convinced that when it comes to an exam, I'll fail and fuck it all up anyways. 

Yesterday, on Christmas eve, I kept inwardly thinking to myself that it would be a beautiful day to die. I don't want to be 40 before I've finished my education and can get a job. What's even the point in trying when nearly halfway through life anyways?
