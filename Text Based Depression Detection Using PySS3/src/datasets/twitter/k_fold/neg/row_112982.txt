I'm doneIn the past years I've been abused and molested and ruined my life

A friend took advantage of me and I came to 2x they said get a rape kit. It wasn't pretty. Guy would not admit what he did is wrong. Brother just beat the shit out of him and my friends. Everyone is yelling at me and saying mean things.

I would press charges but there is no solid evidence to say I didn't agrree and witnesses say I did.


I'm done, drinking a few beers. Then ending it.


I can't continue to fuck up my life and hurt everyone around me.

I see no other way.   


Goodbye


My ex came and talked me down earlier but i am feelin it again.  Everyone has been texting me and threatening to jump me.  Noone is on my side and eventually the only one who is will start to believe them.

I want to call him again but I fear I will just repeat that until I finally do it, causing him greif the whole time.


I literally hate myself and life
