I don't know what to say/how to express what I am feeling.I'm finding it harder every day to find a reason why I shouldn't just say "fuck it" and be done with it.

I don't know if I have any good reasons to feel this way. I'm so god damn lonely, and even when I am with people (including family) I feel so alone. I feel so trapped inside my own head. I hate it, and I don't know how to get out of it. I'm too afraid to tell anyone.

The thought of just ending it creeps into my mind pretty much daily, passively in the background as I go about my day.

I don't know... I'm scared of dying, but right now it feels like a good option.

Can someone... I don't know... Just give me some kind of reassurance... or whatever. I'm not entirely sure how to word what I want.

Throwaway(ish) for obvious reasons. Some people I know are aware of my main account.
