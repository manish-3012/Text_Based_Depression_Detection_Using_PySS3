I need someone to talk to.Ok so im single now and my ex fiancÃ¨ left me saying "I need a break" but instead she was in love with my best friend and ended up dating my other friend Kenneth and I did nothing I tried to be the best boyfriend I could and I literally put her before EVERYTHING and apparently its not good enough but she says she still loves me more than a frie.d and she says she wants us to hang out but shes always making out with him in front of me and everyday it makes my self esteem get lower and lower. I have never felt this way about anyone but to her im not just a friend, apparently im her "best friend" and she "wants me to be happy" but she draws me closer and closer to suicide and I just dont know what to do anymore and I need someone to talk to because I dont care if I sound like an emo faggot but im in tears right now and my best friend Jake always refers to me as "Man of all Men" and "Badass" im 16 now and I have known him since I was 8 and today was the first day hes ever seen me cry and I told him how much I hate myself and how I want to just die because I gave my all to her but she just wants her happiness and I cant just walk away without her crying which makes me cry and she ends up cheating on him. I try to take the words of the Offspring "The more you suffer the more it shows you really care." But I dont know anymore. I also feel as if im going insane but I will save that for another post. Just please someone talk to me and please dont judge me for reacting like this over just some girl becase this is nowhere near how strong I feel but to be completely honest I am atheist but when I am with her I wish there is an afterlife just so I can be with her even longer, shes my soul and I love her more than anyone and anything but at the same time shes the source of all my depression and I cant just cut her out of my life and I dont know what to do so please  someone just talk to me. I know im a little young to think about marriage but I really really do live her THAT much.
