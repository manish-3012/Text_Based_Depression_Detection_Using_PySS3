ThoughtsI feel like such a failure and burden. Iâ€™m lazy and failing out of school and I have no back up plan. An actual waste of space and money and if I could give away my life to someone more deserving then Iâ€™d do it in a heartbeat. Thereâ€™s so much pressure and I know there are others that have it worse but I donâ€™t want this life anymore.
