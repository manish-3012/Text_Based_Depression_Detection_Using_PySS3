I just want to skip to the endI've never wanted to watch a movie or read a book if I already know how it ends, I don't really want to live life since I know how it ends. I'm 19 and still living with my parents, I really don't want to get a job. I don't have any desires, I just want it to all end. I haven't attempted suicide and I'm probably too scared too, but I often think of how I would do it and how great it would be to not have to worry about how I'm going financially support myself.
