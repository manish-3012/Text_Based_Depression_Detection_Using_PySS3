Gonna do it tonight. Or you know..in the next two hours.Been struggling with this thought over the last two weeks because of finances. Incredibly behind on bills. About to default on my car tomorrow unless I can post up 240 dollars tonight to knock a payment off the delinquency. 700 dollars in the hole trying to keep a roof over our head. No one can help me. I tried posting a gofundme on my facebook, and only two people donated. No one even asked me what was going on. My parents can't help, snapped at me when I suggested I needed help with my car--despite the fact I told them when we signed the lease that I couldn't pay it on my own once insurance money ran out. And despite the fact they said they'd pitch in. My girlfriend's mom can't help, despite the fact it's me, her daughter, and her two year old granddaughter living together.

Can't get a loan. Local charities are tapped out. I don't even have money to make it home from work. My gas will run out before I get there. Life is..pretty much telling me I'm not good enough. Even if we figure out a way to survive with no car, we have nothing. Once we lose that car, I'm pretty sure they'll bail on me and go back with their abusive mother and I can't. I can't believe I've failed so badly as a father, boyfriend, and provider. If they go I have nothing. No friends, no family anymore.. Why should I keep struggling?
