Please help me make sense of my reality...I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this post except thatIâ€™m really really really in pain and on the verge of giving up. Iâ€™m 21 years old. I miss being myself - being kind, positive and bubbly. I feel like the best parts of me are dead. I also feel weak and fragile.



I grew up in a picture perfect family, my dad was my best friend. My biggest problem was losing weight and having a critical mom.My parents had a great marriage, my grandparents (2 from my dadâ€™s side) and 1 from my momâ€™s side were my biggest supporters. I moved to a new country because my younger sister had autism spectrum disorderâ€¦there was nothing in our country to support her so when I was 14, my brother 7 and my sister 4â€¦my mom left her job, family and home to move to a developed country for my sister. Apparently with therapy she could get better. My dad remained back to work and support us abroad.

* Financials: this was when dad suddenly made it very big. Also, dad has a brother, his wife my aunt and two children - cousin 1 is older than me and cousin 2 is younger than my brother. 

 In the past year and a half these things have happened to me and these are the mistakes I made:



* Dad started becoming distant. Right after we left, his mother conspired to get uncle to join my fatherâ€™s businessâ€¦uncle wasnâ€™t doing so well. Mother was unhappy, said she should just give him money. Not have to work together. As predicted by my mother and her mother - fast forward 5 years and:

* Father is bankrupt with tonnes (in the millions) in debt that his brother took in his name. Dad started a whole new business had everything on paper and handed it to uncle. Slowly uncle got in more and more of his friends.
Father cannot and will not stand up to brother. Every time he tries, uncle calls his mother who calls my dad and psychologically abuses him SO much that my father gives in.

       * Father had to go to jail for a day for all this debt.
       * At one point dad was paying tuition for uncleâ€™s son while I was taking loans.
       * Extended family I grew up with as a result all hate dad now because heâ€™s not rich:
                  * isnâ€™t giving them all free money.
                  * owes them money.


* Dad cheated on my mom - this is ultimately what broke me.
         * in the 4 years he had been away, I watched their perfect beautiful marriage disintegrate. Uncle and grandma probably really contributed to this.


* I listened to mother cry on Skype for 4 months like every other day straight. What I would give to never have heard the stuff she said. 
           * She read his text messages to other woman.
           * she also talked about her sexual life. OMG. She doesnâ€™t have many friends, therapy is frowned upon in our culture so she cried to me. And I listened.


* Found out my grandfather (dadâ€™s dad) was a rapist. He apparently approached my uncleâ€™s wife, who then disconnected from my family. As a result of which my grandma was so desperate for the two brothers to be working together. 


* Momâ€™s mom is alone and struggling because she only had my mom and dad. My dad hates her even though she tried to help him - due to brainwashing from his own mother. And my mother is incapable of being supportive so they have a conflict and I am stuck in between. 

* My momâ€™s kidneys are not working - like only 10 percent so Iâ€™ve been trying to convince her to take one of mine. The constant implication is if she dies, her two kids are my responsibility - not her husbands.

* My best friend who I was in love with broke up with his girlfriend. And I took care of him. We were pseudo dating - everyone thought we were together. I didnâ€™t want to push him because he just broke up. RIGHT when my family fell apart - he decides he met a girl in the library and loves her and they are dating. He loves me but he loves her more because with me - he does not feel â€œcarnal feelingsâ€. 

* I came to terms with the fact that I had been sexually assaulted as a child in my grandfatherâ€™s house by a guy who worked there. For years I kept thinking I wasnâ€™t â€œpureâ€ and would never be enough for a guy. A few days after this happened ( I think I was 8), my grandmother (momâ€™s mom) asked me if anyone had been near my vagina. I said yes. I donâ€™t know what she did after.


* with this realization and the rejection, I felt a lot of need to prove something to sex so I hooked up with 6 guys and had sex with one off the internet. He was nice and consensual, made me feel good about myself but just dumped me as he got back with his girlfriend. 

* I started supporting myself more and more financially and itâ€™s been hard. But I recognize itâ€™s worse for so many people.



TODAY: havenâ€™t talked to dad properly in months. I think he has PTSD. cannot reconcile him and grandparents and uncleâ€™s family who loved me and supported me as a child. Mom is dependant on me in some ways and its nice and suffocating. I feel this weight on my shoulder - of responsibility - which I plan to take. 

This is all that comes to mind. Iâ€™ve kept going because of good friends and this belief that if I keep working hardâ€¦Iâ€™ll get somewhere. But recently my sister has been diagnosed with epilepsy and that made me so depressed. As a child of immigrants, I feel no identity. Couldnâ€™t hold on to my religion, lost all family back home, donâ€™t fit in there when I go back home now, the sexism painsâ€¦.and I feel like an outsider in my country where I ambling now - which I feel will never accept me as me. 

Please give me some perspective, articles or tangible advice. Iâ€™m struggling so much. SO MUCH.

TLDR: Bankruptcy, familial estrangement, sexual assault, sick mother, infidelity in family, heartbreak. Identity crisis as an immigrant and a lot of pressure to take responsibility of siblings. Iâ€™m finding it difficult to keep going.
