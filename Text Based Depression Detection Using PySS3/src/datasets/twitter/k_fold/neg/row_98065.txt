Have a chronic, disabling illness which keeps getting worseI have schizophrenia, and because of this illness, I ended up being completely disabled. Even though I take treatment which works as intended, the treatment for schizophrenia is only made to target a small part of the symptoms of this disabling condition, without addressing most symptoms.

I've experienced a severe cognitive decline, lost my social ability, and my ability to function. I also can't experience any pleasure anymore - life seems dull and monotone, and it has lost all of its color. My emotions are gone. And to make things worse, I have a hard time speaking and making sentences (although it's not as visible when typing).

There's no treatment for these symptoms - medication only treats symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. It doesn't treat progressive decline associated with this illness.

The illness is getting worse and worse. My mental state keeps deteriorating. 

Also, I recently demanded for my medical records to be handed out to me. I read them, and it said that when I went back to a new school after being hospitalized and treated, the school contacted the hospital saying that the students were "disturbed" when I joined their class, and that some even feared me.

Are there any alternatives to killing myself? Not only did I lose everything, but chances are, it will only get worse with time.

I have everything planned out already, and I'm not afraid of going through with it anymore. I chose highly fatal methods, because if I will survive, my life will be even worse - I will get hospitalized against my will for indefinite amounts of time.
