No transportation and nobody is willing to help me. Imprisoned for all time?I can't drive, can't get my license (please trust me about that!), can't afford uber, nobody's willing to drive me, there's no public transporation where I live, and I need to go places that are beyond walking and biking distance. I've asked everyone and their mother for help, but no one has been helpful. Instead, they make fun of me and call me a loser. I can't get anything done in life because there's always a transportation issue. Is there anything I can do or am I imprisoned for all time?
