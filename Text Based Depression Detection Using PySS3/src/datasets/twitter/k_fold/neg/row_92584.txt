Feeling like I donâ€™t want to live but also so scared to dieI am not sure how to express this so please excuse my disorganised post. 

I am so tired. I been of work for nearly a year now with anxiety and ptsd. 

Today I realised that I donâ€™t actually think anything will ever be better and that I donâ€™t think I want to live anymore. I have struggled mostly with anxiety and flashbacks but I think I am also depressed. 

I feel like such a looser because I am not getting any better and the thought of just getting thought the day is horrible. I struggle with so many things of the past and I have realised that they are all my own fault, I am the one that is to blame for everything bad in my life. I feel like such a fraud, such a bad person and I feel guilty that I am here crying over my own problems when there is so many worse things in the world. But I donâ€™t actually have the strength to deal with life. I feel so incredibly alone.

I disacosiate all the time and anything that brings me joy in the world is not actually real. I feel scared and the world feels scary. I am wearing on the patience of everyone around me including those that I have seeked help of. I feel like the scum of the world and like I shouldnâ€™t be here but I am so so so scared to die. 

I donâ€™t want to be like this. I literally donâ€™t know where to turn or who to tell and I am worried what will happen if I do. I want so badly to get help and get better but I know that at the end of the day no one but me can and I have realised I donâ€™t have that strength.

I donâ€™t know what to do and I just had to get this out somewhere. Does anyone have any words of advice?
