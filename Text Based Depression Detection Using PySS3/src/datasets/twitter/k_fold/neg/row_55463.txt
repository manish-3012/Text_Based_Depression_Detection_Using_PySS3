Something I wrote during my tough time....It was another night
It was another episode
The burdens I had in my mind
Even my thoughts couldnâ€™t control
It was the same tub 
The songs were the same
I just felt so numb 
While I acted sane 
The water was hot 
Yet the chills made it cold
I had a razor on my right
About which I felt bold
Everything felt depressed
While nothing could be expressed 
The razor went deep 
And so did the blood 
The water turned cold
While I witnessed a flood
The water turned red
And so did my face 
The walls turned darker
On which laid an apology 
Written with a marker
I carried no regrets 
And so do I now 
As I woke up in the hospital
Witnessing my life frown


(PS. All of it made me stronger and Iâ€™m now glad that nothing worked back then....
Whatever youâ€™re going through will pass,
And if u ever need anyone to talk to, Iâ€™m right here :) )
