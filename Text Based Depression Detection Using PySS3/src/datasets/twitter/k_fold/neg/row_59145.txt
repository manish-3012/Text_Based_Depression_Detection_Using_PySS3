The urgeThe urge to cut myself deeper is unbearable and will never go away, I wish it will at least I'll get forever sleep. I'm at a new low right now I really just want to end it. No one loves or even likes me as a person, I hate myself and have for years, all in life I want is either someone who loves me or someone to kill me, maybe I'll take matters into my own hands. This is most likely my last cry out. I'm going to end it soon. I'll post a follow up in a day or two when I get everything figured out.
