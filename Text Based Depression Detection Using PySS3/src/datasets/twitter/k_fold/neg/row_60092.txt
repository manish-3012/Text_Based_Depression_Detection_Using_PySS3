BridgeSo, I am trying my best to better myself.  I won't be returning to my job after July.  I have applied for a Masters degree in something I really want to pursue.  I figured that doing something I actually want to do every day would be a positive move and that would go some way to "fixing" me.

I haven't really set up a back up plan for not getting accepted onto any of the Masters degrees I have applied for.  I've always thought that I would have a back up if times got really hard though.  I would take myself to the local bridge where lots of people have successfully ended their lives.  Today, I was a shop and saw the front story of the local paper about a woman who possibly jumped off but has been saved.  Not dead that I know of.  It made me feel sad for her and like I have lost a potential way out if things get tough again. Does this even make any sense?
