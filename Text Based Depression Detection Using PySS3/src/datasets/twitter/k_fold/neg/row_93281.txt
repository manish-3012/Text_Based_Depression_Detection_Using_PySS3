idk i just need to get this off my chesti am only still here because i don't want to hurt my grandma as she's been the only person to really care about me. i really don't want to be here anymore and part of me hates the fact that i actually know people/people know me and that they'll be impacted by my death. i just wish i could disappear and everyone forget that i ever existed. i literally just want to cease to exist.  and honestly even though i have people i do care about i'm just so tired of this constant battle with myself to find happiness that i've given up. i don't think this is a fight i can ever win and i don't know how i've made it 19 years. it doesn't get better. it may seem like it is, and right when you think it's going to get better.. it all goes to shit and is worse than it was before. i'm throwing up the goddamn white flag. i'm going to my favorite restaurant and i'm going sightseeing and then i'm done. i am truly exhausted. i can't do this anymore.
