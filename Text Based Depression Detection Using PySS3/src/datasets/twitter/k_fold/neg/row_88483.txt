i need helpiâ€™m losing it, yâ€™all. iâ€™m pregnant and my boyfriend hates me for not being strong enough for an abortion and i hate my shitty job and i hate my roommate for being a disgusting slob and i hate my mom for telling me how terrible being a mother is 

all of my friends have stopped inviting me out because i canâ€™t go to bars so i sit at home alone and cry. none of my hobbies are fun anymore, i throw up daily from the pregnancy hormones, and i have no one to reach out to to make any of this even slightly better. i want to die but iâ€™m 5 months pregnant with a little girl and i love her and want to keep her safe and happy but i canâ€™t do this i canâ€™t keep being alive like this
