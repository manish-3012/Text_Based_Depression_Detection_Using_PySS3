I am going to live a long, joyful life, and suicide is not going to prevent that from happening.There are just too many people whose lives I've touched. In my anguish I never considered them, but they exist and they care, even if I don't always see them.

I just can't hurt them. I also don't want to throw away everything after having worked so much for it all. 

I know I'll be gone someday, but it's not going to be anytime soon. :)
