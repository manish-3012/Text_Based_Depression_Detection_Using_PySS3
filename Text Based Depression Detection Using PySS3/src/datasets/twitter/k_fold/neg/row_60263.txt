Stopping MyselfI am trying to live through this pandemic. All this effort just to try is making life so much worse. I am trying to work on my own personal efforts like working on my scripts for my future. Life feels so limited with suicide on my mind every day. I woke up to a very bad day today. Just trying to breathe. All I can think about is slitting my wrists now. Is anyone else having a bad day? Iâ€™m scared to take drugs that might get me addicted. I want this pain to be over. I have suffered ever since I was a child. When do I ever find peace?
