Everything hurts. Toying with pills for almost a year.40's happily married 23 years 3 amazing children.... I love them. They love me. Life from outside my brain is great... 

I hurt all the time. Like I'm shriveling up inside. I don't have enough of me left. I'm tired. I'm tired of getting in bed every night and making a decision of how many pills to take just to be able to sleep. 

I've read enough to know that suicide by pills is not easy. When it's time I'll spend the money and order what I need. 

I'm trying to get everything in order before. I can't burden my family with what to do because I know this will alter their lives forever. 

I know where my body is going. I need to get my medical paperwork in order. I need my end of life plan finished. 

I want to write to my family, more than just a its not your fault letter. Where can you find common things that families of suicide wonder what they could have done? How to let them know I love them. How to let them know it's me.
