Strange Thoughts This Morning...After watching a video someone posted about their dying words (the one on the front page...the guy who has leukemia) I suddenly started feeling very selfish. Here I am with this "condition" known as "depression" that I find myself using sometimes almost like a crutch. I went from hating it and being embarrassed about it to fully embracing it and talking openly about it. But comparing myself to someone who has cancer makes me feel like an utter douche. 

I signed the back of my license a few weeks ago to make myself an organ donor...just in case something were ever to happen to me. It made me feel good about myself. This morning, however, after watching that video, I was washed with this overwhelming feeling. Am I being selfish by living when these people, who need these organs, are dying? Should I just go ahead and die so that someone else can live? Am I just taking up space by whining about my own problems when someone else has a lot more potential?

It's never been this overwhelming before and it's actually scaring me a lot. I'm kind of freaking out at the moment...
