The other day I was at walmart and I stopped to look at rope.. I don't have anything to tie up, if you get what I mean.I guess my depression started six months ago when my girlfriend of three years broke up with me. Even now, six months later, I can't help but to think of her every day. But that isn't why I am suicidal, I could handle this if only it was the only problem I am facing.

I also, after many months of research, believe that I have ADHD. I finally, after several months of trying to schedule one, had an appointment with a psychiatrist for two hours of testing. The tests themselves were, in my opinion, shitty tests for ever diagnosing me. They're outlined in a post I made in /r/adhd last week if you care to read about it. For crying out loud, I was scheduled to have two hours of her time and the entirety of the session lasted less than one hour. As I suspected the moment I left her office, the tests came back saying I do not have ADHD.

That is pretty devastating to me. I am quite sure that I do have ADHD. I see the symptoms every day. I do not feel as though I can move forward in any meaningful direction until I get myself figured out. As such, I quit my job like two months ago and have been living off of savings ever since.

I was really hoping that seeing this psychiatrist would be the start of some new hope for me.

In all honesty, I probably would have killed myself by now if I didn't have the best cat in the world.
