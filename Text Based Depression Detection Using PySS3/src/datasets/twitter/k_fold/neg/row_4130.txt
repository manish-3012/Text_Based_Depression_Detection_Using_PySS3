A Hair Away From Breaking DownI'm a 20 year old sophomore in university, extremely stressed, have lived with Major Depressive Disorder my entire life, been on medication but it hasnt been working lately, Its hard to want to live anymore, I find myself thinking I'd be better off dead most of the time, I had an anxiety attack in class when i was supposed to be presenting inclass this past week and have avoided going back out of fear, we had a active shooter on campus kill someone this week and thats not helping my nerves, I dont know what to do anymore, im trying to hold it together till saturday atleast when im house sitting for friends and try not to outwardly look like im not ok, i feel like i could fall apart at any second maybe not in the dieing sense but in the i feel like id be scared that id be admitted to a mental ward fall apart i just dont know what to do when i feel like screaming my lungs out about how much i dont want to exist anymore.
