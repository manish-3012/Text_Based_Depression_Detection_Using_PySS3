I want to die because Iâ€™m boredI was depressed for a long time, due to the nature of depression I dreaded life in general, hated everything around me, and the few things I loved I could never quite reach. 

For a short period of time I was happy again. It mustâ€™ve been 2 or so years since I felt so real and in my body, of course not exactly like it used to be, but almost. 

Now I sit at a point where that freshness of New hope has faded, the reality has struck again, and although I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m as depressed as I was before, Iâ€™m even more dissociated from life and my body. 

Plenty of you will say the generic, â€œgo out and find new hobbies!â€ Or â€œmake plans with people!â€ But there are issues. I work out daily, I think Iâ€™m generally attractive, and have decent social skills, I have several hobbies, some of which Iâ€™m above average at, yet I donâ€™t have many friends or close ones at least, Iâ€™m thankful for the few I do have. None of this seems to fix the fact that Iâ€™m bored, I canâ€™t find enjoyment with my life. That every day cycle we all know so well seems to be recurring at speeds I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever have to endure. It feels like my life is a whirlwind of the same shit spinning in circles, faster than ever. 

Anxiety to loneliness to content throughout each day without any so to say â€œbig event.â€ 
I understand not everyoneâ€™s life is a shit load of fun but for fucks sake could I have some? 

I donâ€™t enjoy anything around me, sometimes Iâ€™m given the opportunity, I mean maybe I have plenty of opportunities that Iâ€™ve just become bored with. But I know this feeling all too well. 

Last time it led to addiction.

This time that isnâ€™t possible. 

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do, what I do know is that I feel alone and isolated no matter what Iâ€™m doing. No matter how much it seems like I should be hurting or yearning to find some motivation or happiness, my depersonalized mind doesnâ€™t seem to... give a single fuck. 

I feel hollow, thatâ€™s the best way to put it.
