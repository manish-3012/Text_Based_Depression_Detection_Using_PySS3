I don't know what to doIt's been a year since i thought about suicide for the first time. I often joked about it when I was with my friends and i still do it sometimes. When I was lonely I took it seriously and thought about why I have these thoughts. I often dreamt of suicide at night and I always dreamt of a different method. I ignored it since it were nightmares and nothing like this will ever happen to me. However I recently started thinking about doing it seriously. I informed myself about the most efficient and least painful ways to die and kind of wrote suicide notes in my head. I was thinking about whom I would send one and what I would write. I really don't want to talk about it neither with a psychiatrist nor with my close ones. I want no one in my family or friends to know how I really feel. That's why I'm here. I hope you can help me out of my misery
