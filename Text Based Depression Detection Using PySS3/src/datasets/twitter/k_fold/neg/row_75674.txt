Online counseling rejected me! I'm done!I can't do it anymore! It felt like I had only enough strength to reach out one more time for help, and fucking BetterHelp said I needed face-to-face counseling, which I can't afford enough of! I'm fucking done with mental healthcare in this country! Who the fuck REJECTS someone who is begging for help? I hate my life and job and I just want to feel nothing!
