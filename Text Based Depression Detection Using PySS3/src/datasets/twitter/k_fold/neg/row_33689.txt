Please help meI am not thinking straight, my mind is in some kind of labyrint, I question every action I take ten times even simple action as shutting door and breathing. My mind is oppresed and I do not know the cause, I am maybe little bit stressed because of work, but I do not know why it affects me so much. I have no clue why and what is happening.

I thought I have removed myself from everything to have open mind, I do not have any requirements for myself, suddenly I feel chained by invinsible ropes.

Why am I unable to take any step in a life - get a car/house/gf/different job/new things or just simple haircut.

I feel like I am not ready for them, or I simply wish to go for something different but I am completely undecided, even though I feel if I go for one of these things it will support and help me to decide.
