Im more afraid of not dying.Hey, after the event two days ago i couldnt think straight and have been planning all the time. My therapist doesnt seem to know im suicidal or something and doesnt even ask (probably should tell her but only been talking for maybe a month and dont really trust her yet.) 

The thing thats keeping me planning is the prevention of an aftermath like when i tried for the first time. It was awful, lying in the hospital, bound to the bed and cramping (couldnt even eat properly) from the overdose. I just want it to be over with. Ive been telling my parents its all good again and they probably believe that. 

Im scared of being put somewhere where everyone is in their 50s while im 19. Last time in the Mental Hospital my laptop and shoes got stolen and didnt have anyone to talk to...
Right now im honestly just finishing off and looking for the least obvious method. Its like a spark that ignited again, burning my head and i cant think straight anymore. Feels like i have to do it, "you tought about it so many times, when are you finally doing it"

Im thinking to myself how cool the afterlife could be, been asking that since if was 13 or so, maybe ill end up in a second paralel universe or whatever.

Anways i think i covered my title pretty well for some talk to happen, i really want to right now. I cant really talk much without my family noticing and that would be the most afwul.

TLDR: im more afraid of the aftermath of failing my suicide attempt than actually sucseeding.
