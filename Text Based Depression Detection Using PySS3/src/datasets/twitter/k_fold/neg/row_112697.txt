Im done....i just dont belong here anymoreI want to die. For 45 years Ive been a scapegoat for my narcissistic mother. Since I was little she's called me names, manipulated me and anyone I go to for help, she belittles me, uses passive aggressive ways to torture me and physically abuses/neglects  me as punishment for standing up for myself or my children.
Im disabled and depend on her for care.
She humiliates me based on my condition.
Do you know how hard it is to be dependent on someone who hates you ? Especially for personal care.
She does not ever apologize or hold herself accountable and she denies everything she does that's abusive.
She's convinced my son that im a liar and just being dramatic.
So now he has begun to humiliate me and belittle me as well....not as severely but still..she's changed his perspective of me.
My youngest daughter is forced to listen helplessly. 
My heart breaks for her.
I know she wouldn't have to deal with this if I were gone.
Im terminal anyway so it just seems like I should get on with it.
I can't think of one person that is better off with me here.
I think im incapable of feeling joy at this powere and I guess I  can't bring joy to others either.
So what would the quickest, cleanest and most effective way be to induce death in my sleep or painlessly and quietly?
