Just confronted a friend about suicideI and my sister have a friend who threatened to kill himself earlier this week. He's done it before and checked himself in to get help. My sister sat on this for a few days and called me today. About 40 mins ago, she talked to him. Right now, I'm here for moral support. Strong and silent type, I'm just crying inside.

We live in Florida, so we have the Baker Act available to us, where he can either check himself in or we can do it for him involuntarily. Both my sister and I have either contemplated or attempted, rather poorly, suicide before. I wish someone would have committed us at those times, but thankfully we're still alive.

He's called his mom to come and talk, commit him, whatever, etc. I get it, but don't agree. I've seen his signs of depression, which he's admitted to. My sis has said one way or another, he's going. It's just his choice how. I agree, after having lost a litany of friends and co-workers this way. I'd rather him be pissed and alive, than dead.

I guess I'm just looking for assurances that we've done the right thing tonight. Idk, I just had to get it off my chest.
