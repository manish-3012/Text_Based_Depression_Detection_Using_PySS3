I should've been dead alreadyOne day in July I was going to off myself, take a bunch of pills and just have that be the end of it.

But I didn't for a very pathetic and stupid reason, the thought of a girl I care about a lot popped into my head and got me thinking about what could be and I kinda just    stopped.

Since then I've felt numb all the time and I don't even feel like I'm the same person anymore, I'm failing all my classes with little hope of pulling it back together. I've started cutting. I don't even have literally anyone to talk about this with.

I'm a terrible person, a burden, and ugly as can be, no one should have to care it's not right that anyone should.
I'm getting closer to offing myself again, soon enough I'll be gone. No one will have to be bothered and made uncomfortable by my just existing ever again.
