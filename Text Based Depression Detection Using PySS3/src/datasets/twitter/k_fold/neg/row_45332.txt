Fought to get it all and no don't want it.Divorced - that destroyed everything - kids, house, friends, neighbors.   All gone. Had to move.  I don't exist for most anymore.  Work is ready to fire me because of missed time due to the divorce.  Should that happen I'll last a few months and then be flat broke.  At 50.

I reckon I've been alive enough and I'm not going to see much more of anything in my lifetime so should my employment, the last "real" thing I do that qualifies me as a person let's me go it's time I let go.

I'm at peace with it.  It will be odd for the kids until they are younger but eventually they will understand.  They don't live here anyway.

Live and die alone as they say.  I don't want any more mornings when I wake terrorized, which has now become everyday.  I see no point in existence any more.  I have joy in nothing.  There isn't a person on earth that truly cares about me and I'm just exhausted from trying.  I can't even "phone a friend" at this point.  If my life depended on it.  I'm ready now.
