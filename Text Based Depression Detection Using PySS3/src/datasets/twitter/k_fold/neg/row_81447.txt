What is the most pleasant way to go out?* 21, never been employed, no one wants to employ a 21 year old with no experience  

* No degree, sub-par qualifications   

* Somehow managed to rack a 4 figure student debt   

* Hardly any friends, no social life, is becoming sick of certain friends and their constant bragging   

* Sits at home all day on the computer, gym is a chore, don't enjoy it anymore  

* Lives away from a major city  

* Severely depressed &amp; anxious but can't afford certain drugs from the deepweb, not willing to try another prescription antidepressant or talk with a therapist  

* Already September 2018 and has done nothing with life since March 2017  

* No life goals or ambitions   

* Gambling whatever is left on online casino, lottery games and sports betting
