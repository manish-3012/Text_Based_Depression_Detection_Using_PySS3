It has now been over four years, amd I still just feel dead inside.Met a girl when I was 17. We were together for almost three years when we had a kid. I loved the little guy and momma too. Two years later she left me for a guy she had met two weeks prior at her new job with Walmart. I was left homeless, and reduced to a mere visitor with my son two year old son. A year later the hostility from her had grown so powerful that it was made clear I was no longer welcome in the child's life. I got a lawyer, but her rich parents got her one too. I realized I would never win a case at court(U.S. courts are very classist, and family court is anti-father).

I gave up. It has been four years. I keep them out of my mind, as much as I can anyways. Yet, it always comes back to haunt me. And my family has the audacity to ask when I will start dating again, like they want to see me start a new life so I can experience the pain of losing a second one all over again. Even if I was willing to date again, I've become a miserly bitter person. Everyday I pray for cancer (I know no Diety hears them), and I never go to the doctor with the hopes I might die someday. 

Well fuck I could write a book, but I know this shit won't get read anyways. It should probably just get deleted, and maybe someone worth saving can be talked to instead. I just want to ride my motorcycle into a concrete wall at 120 mph. The good news is I've started to have siezures recently. Maybe my health will finally fucking fail, but it is probably just some bullshit not fatal fuckery.
