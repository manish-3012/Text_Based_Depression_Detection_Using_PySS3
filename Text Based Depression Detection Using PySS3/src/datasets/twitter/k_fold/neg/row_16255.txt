I need some help, pleaseI'm so incredibly sad all the time. For at least 11 years now. And I'm doing well for myself. Good job, good work ethic, and I take care of myself physically.

But if I could have made it stop 11 years ago without hurting my family, I would have without hesitation. They are the only reason I go through each day with a smile on my face. Some better. Some much much worse.

I refuse to date seriously and will never have kids because honestly, once my parents are gone, and once my siblings are happy with their own families, I'm taking the plunge. This is misery.   


I'm sorry, today is a bad day. I can't really vent to anyone else.
