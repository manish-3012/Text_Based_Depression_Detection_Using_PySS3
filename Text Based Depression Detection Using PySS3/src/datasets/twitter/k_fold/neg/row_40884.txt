Witnessed a suicide attempt todayToday I was walking to college in a miserable mood as usual and i usually walk past a motorway. Then I saw a few people up on the walkway above the motoway and i kept look to see what was going on. As I got closer i could hear someone crying and half their body was hanging off the fencing. Usually suicide is on my mind everday but actually seeing someone already worse than me makes me feel confused? As i walked into college it felt like all my problems had magically vanised and I was just stuck thinking that thats what i was so desperate to do a month ago. The worst part is thinking i would have been the first person there if i stayed on the bus for one more stop. I felt like crying but i dont feel sad because i understand the pain you have to be in to want to end it all. It just felt weird seeing another teenager in that position. I have about 1 person who cares about me and i guess for now thats enough to keep me alive. I can't imagine her having that same sick feeling i had this morning when staring at the face of death but it being me. I just needed to get that off my chest sry if this upsets anyone
