I just successfully tied a nooseI've tried many times before and just couldn't get the hang of it (no pun intended). Finally I've gotten it. And I've never felt better! It's weird like that. I guess it's because I'm one step closer to not feeling like shit anymore. Yay..?

Is there anything anyone has to say to change my mind?? I'll be honest, I probably won't do anything drastic tonight, but the knot is staying tied and I'm saving it for another time.
