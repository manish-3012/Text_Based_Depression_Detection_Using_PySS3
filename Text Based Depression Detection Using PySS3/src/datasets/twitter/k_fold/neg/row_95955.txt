I'm doneI only ever wanted to be happy. As a kid I was stavered of emotional and physical affection and as the middle child I basically ignored and neglected. My girlfriend of 3 years and I split and I lost the only thing that made me happy other than my dog. My family barely cares about me and actually talks shit about me all the time. My college studies are going to shit. I have no friends. I have nothing. My now ex girlfriend loved my dog so I'll probably give him to her because I know he'll be in a good place. I just want a hug but I'm probably going to find a bridge somewhere and just hurl myself off
