Guess What?! Debreather!!!So, A few months ago I was reading about the deBreather that was coming out soon. I continually checked the site until it was posted, but they were almost immediately sold out. Then, they moved their inventory apparently, and the right2die site has been showing that message for over a month. I wrote the people 2 times asking them to please tell me right away when one was available. They answered me the second time very quickly and sent me the new link to order one!

I immediately ordered the debreather! The shipping was horrid, but it's ordered and I will have it soon. 
This has been the happiest day I've had so far this year. 
I hope you all get the help you need or obtain your preferred exit.
