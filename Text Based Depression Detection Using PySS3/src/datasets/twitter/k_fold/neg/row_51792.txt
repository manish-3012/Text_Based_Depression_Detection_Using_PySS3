I think I'm goint to kill myselfI donÂ´t know how to begin. I'm not a native speaker, so excuse my writting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to kill myself, and I already plan it, and it's ok, but, why I'm going to do it? Don't know. I used to have a "perfect life", a good job, a loving girlfriend, not so many but good old friends, a kinda alcoholic but funny social life, all the deal,  but I've never been "ok", "complete" or whatever you wanna call it.

So in january I began to plan my departure. I quit my job, I moved from my work town to my hometown in order to put distance (about 2 flight hours) between my friends, my gf, all my life and me. The deadline is february 19.

My girlfriend still says she loves me, and she's always trying to reach me, but I quit her out. My best friend is always calling to check me out, but she doesn't know the real internal struggle, I only say a few things about how i feel and often change the subject and I believe she thinks I'm getting better ('cuz I say so) but it's not true.

So, this is my cry for help. I don't wanna live but neither want to suicide.
