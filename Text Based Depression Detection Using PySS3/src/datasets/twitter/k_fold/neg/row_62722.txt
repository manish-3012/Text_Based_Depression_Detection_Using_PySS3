I can't do it anymore.Hi.  I'd rather not say my name, but I'm 14 and I've been like this since I was 11.  I don't want to do anything anymore.  Everything just seems... boring.  I'm quite sick of everyday repetition.  Wake up, eat, go to school, come home, eat again, then sleep.  I've lost interest in all the games I thought were interesting before.  Now it's just as dull as a pencil that hasn't been sharpened in a couple years.  I don't want to do it anymore.  My grades are dropping like the downwards part of a roller coaster.  I hate everyone and everything.  I hate them because they are disgusting.  I hate them because they are annoying.  I hate them because they do nothing to help.  Everyone doesn't like me.  They only tolerate me.  They like to pick on me since I'm like this.  They think it's funny if someone is a failure.  Failures like me are disgraceful to everyone.  I can't do anything right.  I get yelled at by my mother for the smallest of things.  I have religious propaganda pushed on to me everyday and it doesn't stop.  I just need space.  I want to feel the same spark of interest I felt when I was a little kid.  Everyone thinks that I'm doing okay when they can clearly see that I'm internally suffering.  I don't want to live anymore.  Life was okay.  Life was great.  Hell, I'd even say that life was the best thing that happened to me.  But life just started going downhill and it's still going lower and lower than it was before.  If I killed myself all of my problems would go away.  Everyone couldn't bother me anymore.  Everything would be peaceful.  I'd all be okay.  I can't do it anymore.  Everything is too stressful to deal with.  I don't want to put up with this life anymore.  It already sucks enough as it is.  So why not just end it.  I guess I'll just finish the things I had planned first.  I just want things to be okay but they aren't going to be.  If anyone wants to help me go ahead.  I just want to be better.
