pls kill me nowi feel like every day is another day until i want to die... i hate my body it is very small and i have a small penis, my classmates make fun of me for being short and having a high voice and looking so young, i don't even know where i am in puberty but it won't fix it when i do finish it... i can barely eat so i won't get tall anyways... and my index finger is longer than my ring finger (not by a whole nail but by a noticeable amount) so i won't have a normal or large penis anyway... i did not ask to be like this, why did my parents make me like this, why did they not make sure i had the right amount of testosterone in the womb, i hate being in this body every day... unfortunately suicide is hard to plan, the methods i am considering require assembly which could go wrong, or drugs which would be very difficult to attain... i just want to stop looking like this and to have it all end... i wish i had someone to talk to about this, someoen to just shake and pour this out but at worst that means there would be someone to tell my parents i want to kill myself and land me in the hospital, i cannot have that... and i only have one friend at school, but her boyfriend is crazy and is angry when i talk to her and she likes him too much and will ditch me when she sees him because she knows that he will be angry if he sees us together... i am gay and both of them know that but he is still jealous... and all the fake bitches in this world, i just want to be peaceful and destroy this body
