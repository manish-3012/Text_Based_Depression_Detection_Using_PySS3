I'm tiredI'm just so tired of going through the same motions everyday. I get life is hard and I give it my all. I try to be a good person hoping I can be a positive impact of people around me. But everyone is suffering and so am I. I'm just tired of it I'm tired of breathing I just want one now. I know there's people rooting for me and there's people that care but to be honest I don't believe them. If they cared they would really be here when I'm tired but there's no one. I'm ready.
