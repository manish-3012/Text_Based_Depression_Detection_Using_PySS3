Horrible incestuous abuse from my childhood has me wanting to die. Can you help me?When I was younger I did something bad. When I was 13-14 I had a cousin who would do things like sit on my lap a lot, in a seemingly sexual way. She would sit directly in the center of my lap, not lounging but sitting there just to sit on that spot. She would also grab my face and stick it into her butt and tell me to sniff.

One night I acted on everything and pent up urges and I placed her hand on my genitals. I stopped, and I never did this again.

About a year later while trying to sleep she was attempting to get inside of my pants, aggressively. I held my pants back but she kept going. She knew I was awake, but she persisted anyway. I stopped her and we just tried to act normal and went to sleep. One night I remember catching her staring into my pants while I slept, and her diary at one point read that "she touched me".

She told on me later, she never admitted to doing anything. Our families didn't sit us down and talk about it, they didn't even prod for details. They just separated us.
 
A year later we were visiting again like normal, like it had never happened. This continued for 5 or so years.

Nowadays we can talk normally and there doesn't seem to be any hostility.

* Do you think I'm an absolute monster?

* Should I ever be able to live happily?
* How bad was this? Or does it sound like childhood exploration

I don't know how to live anymore, I'm losing my will to fight.
