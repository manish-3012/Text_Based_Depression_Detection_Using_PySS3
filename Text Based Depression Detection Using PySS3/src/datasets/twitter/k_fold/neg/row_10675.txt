Just a rantI (m19) really want to kill myself, i have a note written and a plan and a back up plan but every time i go to do it I think about myself being buried in a dress with the wrong name. I'm trans and I have two people that care about me, my mum who still thinks i'm a girl and my best friend who i'm out to. I wonder if he'd tell my mum for me, it'd be weird to come out after i was dead like that. It just all sucks because if I wasn't trans I wouldn't have to worry about that, i could've killed myself weeks maybe months ago and I wouldn't have to keep putting up with living.
