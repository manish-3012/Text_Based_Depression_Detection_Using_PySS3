Do I actually have a mental illness or am I just lying to myself?I remember being a kid and wanting to die. I experienced rejection in lots of ways and I was overall an angsty child. Then I grew up and became an angsty pre-teen, and I remember thinking that feeling down was "cool", and that it suited me. The thing is, I never really felt okay, so its not like I was forcing negativity...
Today I'm 17 and I feel the worst I've ever felt. I practice self harm, I can't do something like drawing or singing or whatever without thinking "you're not good enough, stop." Overall i just dont let myself experience things and evolve in things. 

The thing is: am I making this up? Still to this day I dont desire to be happy. I'd rather relate to depressing songs than to happy songs. Its like I still have that kid in my head telling me its cool and okay to want to die, and I get confused! Am I forcing depression in my way? do I actually need help? is it worth it? And at my worst times I doubt myself, and I dont believe in my own misery.

I dont know why I think the way I do. I get frustrated all the time cause of it.

I dont know if this made any sense, but i just needed to write a bit and put it into the universe
