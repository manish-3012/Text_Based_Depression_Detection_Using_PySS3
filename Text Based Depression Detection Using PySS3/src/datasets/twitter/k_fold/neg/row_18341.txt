no one caresi am insignificant. i am nothing. i am just another result of two people fucking and i will die as nothing more than a common occurrence. i need to find a gun. thereâ€™s no telling whoâ€™s feelings are genuine - i used to care about becoming a statistic, being someone forgotten, but thatâ€™s my destiny and i will fulfill it. i am not worthy of a long nor enjoyable life. i donâ€™t deserve to be remembered.
