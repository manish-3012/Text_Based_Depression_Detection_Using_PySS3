I am a monster. Therefore, I'm putting myself down.I have borderline personality disorder and I am really, really struggling lately. With everything. And it all came to a head tonight. I threatened to call the police on my partner and to tell everyone in their life all the different ways they have hurt me. All because their internet was down and they fell out of contact with me while I'm struggling. So they blocked my number and blocked everything else.  
So I've made a choice. I'm a monster. No one deserves to put up with this. I've already done DBT. It clearly didn't help. I lost my medicaid and can't get it back so I've been without therapy for almost a year.  
I'm unsalvageable and so I'm just going to kill myself when I get home from work, which is in two hours.
