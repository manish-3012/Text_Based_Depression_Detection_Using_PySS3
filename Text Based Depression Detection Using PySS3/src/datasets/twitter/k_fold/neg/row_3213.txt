Please.. Help. I spent my whole weekend absolutely chopping myself up with a steak knive and i just want to end it.Ive never been so depressed in my life and it only gets worse. Ive tried so many things (anti depressants, therapy, talking to people about it) but it never helps. My life in the past year and a half has been nothing but a constant series of things to make it worse. My parents divorce, the end of a 1 year breakup, losing 4 of the closest people to me, i could go on. Ive recently within a month gone back to cutting and i really wish i could end it. At this point happiness seems like an idea, a stupid one. And the only way to achieve it is having nothingness. Death. If someone here can help me, please.. Please give it a shot. There are people in my life i need to be with and take care of, but in the depressive, suidal state im in i cant do that.
