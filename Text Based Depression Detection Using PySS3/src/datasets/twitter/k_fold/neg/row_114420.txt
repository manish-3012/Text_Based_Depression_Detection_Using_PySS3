What if?I love rolling around what if scenarios in my head. Multiple universes is probably my favorite. Recently, what happens after you die has been popular. 

What if after we die, we get to go back to a previous point in our life, and essentially have a redo? I would love it. I would choose either August 2011, or August 2013. Both months ended with me either starting the best thing that's ever happened to me (college) or meeting the best person who has ever existed. 

So I'm gonna go find out what happens tonight. Here's to getting that reset everyone wishes they had.
