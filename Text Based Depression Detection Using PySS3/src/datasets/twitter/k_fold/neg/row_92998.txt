Suicide or AWOL &amp; SuicideIâ€™m currently in the Army and I hate it. My unit is toxic as fuck, we get micromanaged, we do useless shit, and we never actually get to do the job we signed up for. I knew the Army was going to suck, but I canâ€™t find any purpose or motivation for my job and thatâ€™s where I spend more than half my time. I have friends, I have a family, and I have a girlfriend... I even have money. But I canâ€™t be happy. Iâ€™m so depressed at home that Iâ€™ve pretty much cut them all off and condemned myself to gaming all day as a distraction to get through each day. Drinking hasnâ€™t worked for me in a very long time, I canâ€™t do drugs without it causing more problems (being in the military and all), and I canâ€™t up and leave this place to find a better home. I feel trapped. I am always thinking about going AWOL &amp; just carrying a gun on me at all times so that if I ever get caught I can kill myself before anything happens to me. But recently Iâ€™ve been thinking I should just kill myself now because going AWOL would be too dramatic, stressful, and Iâ€™ll run out of happiness or freedom eventually and just off myself later. I have Borderline Personality Disorder &amp; Iâ€™m a very impulsive person so I can see myself doing it easily if I commit to it. I would feel guilty about leaving everyone behind by dying, but at the same time I canâ€™t feel guilt once Iâ€™m dead. I may seem selfish for thinking this way, but I never asked to live, I never really liked living anyways. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this, maybe just looking for some outside perspective since my head is pretty fucked up right now.
