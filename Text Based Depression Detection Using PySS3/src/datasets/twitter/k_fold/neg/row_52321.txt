At the end of the ropeI was living in Brazil for the past few years with my now ex-wife. She cheated on me so I called my dad and asked if he could help me out til I can get back on my feet.

My dad lives at my grandma's so that's where I ended up. My little sister and her disgusting weirdo husband live there too.

One night he got wasted and started accusing me of stealing shit and all kinds of crazy person shit. He then attacked me and when I locked myself in a room he broke the lock and attacked me further.

I was then somehow blamed for all of this and have now been essentially couch surfing with nowhere stable to go.

I was supposed to be getting help with a car but that seems to be falling through as a result.

I should've known better than to trust my family, sad to say but true.

I want nothing more than to work and provide for myself but with no car and no stable home, little clothing, no way to shave or afford a haircut, I feel absolutely screwed.

I've asked all my friends and family other than my dad's side and they either don't get the dire nature of the situation or just don't care.

I'm not asking for a free ride and don't want to mooch or anything.

I've looked around a bit for help from the government but that seems to be in short supply.

Suicidal ideation has been crossing my mind with more and more frequency. If I end up sleeping outside then I'm just going to end it.

I'm really just at the end of my rope and terrified of becoming a homeless bum sleeping on sidewalks and going to jail for not having a home.

I'd be happy to hear if anyone has some advice.
