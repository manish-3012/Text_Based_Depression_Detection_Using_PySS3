Iâ€™m not sure what to do anymorehi everyone just found this sub last night and i feel like i need to make a post. 

on mobile so iâ€™m very sorry if this is formatted badly this might be a bit long and iâ€™m sure no ones going to actually read it. 

iâ€™ve never felt like this before, i never thought i would make it to 23 and iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide since the ripe age of 5. i actually found one of my â€œsuicide notesâ€ from when i was much younger the other week when i was cleaning out my room. 

but iâ€™ve never felt as terrible as i do now. back in october one of my cats died a very tragic death. he climbed into my dresser and got stuck and tried to chew through a sweater to get out. i had a strange feeling not to go to work that day but i did anyways. around 1 pm i got the worst pit in my stomach and apparently my mom heard him yelling before she went to work (around 1) but didnâ€™t check on him. i canâ€™t stop blaming myself and i resent my parents so bad for leaving him in my room all day and not checking on him. my cats are like my actual children iâ€™m certain iâ€™m more attached to them than i am to any human. 

progressively everythingâ€™s just gotten worse after that day. i was with the same person for almost 6 years. weâ€™ve have our ups and downs of course but nothing too crazy. one night something happens and i get upset and break up with him but i never really thought it was over. we still spoke every day went out to dinner a few times since then. always figured we would get back together. and just two days ago i found out i was lied to every single day all those years. if anyoneâ€™s interested in what happened i will go into more detail but iâ€™m just so broken up about this. 

i donâ€™t want to live anymore. i think i figured out a good trick to be able to swallow pills. iâ€™m going to write everyone i care about a letter telling them how much they mean to me, but i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll give them out. i just want to get all my thoughts together. 

all i can think about is my other cat, the one whoâ€™s still alive. he lost his brother a few months ago and now heâ€™s going to lose me. i donâ€™t know how heâ€™s going to react to me not coming home at 6 to give him a big hug and kiss before dinner. but i just canâ€™t do this anymore. i have no motivation. i havenâ€™t eaten or drank anything in days. all i do is cry and pinch myself until iâ€™m bleeding because iâ€™m too lazy to even try and find my razors. i donâ€™t know what to do anymore. i feel like i just have to pick a day and get it over with.
