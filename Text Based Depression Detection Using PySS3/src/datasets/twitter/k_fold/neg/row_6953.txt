I will end the sufferingFirst of all, sry for my bad english. I canâ€˜t even speak right... Iâ€˜m suffering from depression since 8 years. I went through different ,,phasesâ€œ where I was either sad or, like right now, donâ€˜t even feel pain anymore. I tried to kill myself 2 times already, the string I used to hang myself broke both times. On the 25 December I will start my next and hopefully last attempt. I want to thank reddit for the times when I was close to laughing, sadly I was never happy though...
This is my first and last post on reddit and I want to say goodbye.
