I just run everyone away with my depressive attitude.Why do people say they want to help and want to be there but you know, after weeks or months of hearing me bitch and moan, they are just tired of it.  
  
Am I really that shitty? I always thought I hold a lot back to keep from running people off too. I can't help but think, if you're tired. "Hello tired, I'm fucking sick of my life and this shit."  
  
But seriously, I am really tired of being the cause of pain in many people's lives. I just want to be content or not like this more than anyone. I would like to just exist around people at a wedding or a get-together and not have some mental breakdown about how I just want to die and don't deserve to live and just want to put myself in more financial pain and emotional turmoil.   
  
But really, I just want it all to lead to an ultimate end, because there was never really any point in it.
