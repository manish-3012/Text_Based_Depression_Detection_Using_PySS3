I don't want to live any more.I don't feel safe talking to anyone in real life about this. I'm not using a throwaway, I don't know why. 
I'm a suicide survivor. I've been in and out of the mental recovery ward throughout my life. Recently, my depression has manifested as as blind rage. I've pushed away so many people, and I was too ignorant to realize it until now.

I don't want to go on living. I feel so empty and guilty. I hate myself so much that I can't even look at myself in the mirror any more. I don't know what to do.
