Itâ€™s my 20th birthday today, and I want to die more than ever.Iâ€™ve been struggling for awhile.. like for the past year. Iâ€™ve always had a little depression, but ever since last year iâ€™ve been spiraling downwards, and things just keep getting worse and worse. I feel alone and worthless a lot of the time, and thereâ€™s not a day that goes by where I donâ€™t think about suicide at least once. I have no friends after high school they didnâ€™t really talk to me anymore they went off to college, and I took a gap year because I didnâ€™t know what to do with my life and I still donâ€™t. I honestly couldnâ€™t tell you the last day I was genuinely happy, and I feel like with each passing day the weight of all my problems just gets heavier and heavier.
