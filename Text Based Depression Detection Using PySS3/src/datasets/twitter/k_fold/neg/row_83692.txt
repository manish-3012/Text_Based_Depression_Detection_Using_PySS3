I'm no good. I should just kill myself.My mind is useless. My body is weak. Sure I seem healthy. But I'm not. The thought of how my loved one would find out about my death, is the only thing that forces me to stay. But death is the only thing I look forward to, dying. I can't love this life anymore.
