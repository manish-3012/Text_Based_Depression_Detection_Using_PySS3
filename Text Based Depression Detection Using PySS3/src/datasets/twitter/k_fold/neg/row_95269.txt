SpiralingMy job is the #1 source of my depression at this point. My mental illness is my #2. I don't have anyone to talk to about it and even if I did I wouldn't bc I don't want to be a burden. These past few days I have been back to feeling like I just want to die and have been contemplating methods again. I feel really out of control. I'm scared. I feel that no matter what I do my life always hits these low points. I really truly feel like life is pain and will never get better. I want nothing more than to not exist.
