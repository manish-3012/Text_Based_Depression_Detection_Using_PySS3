My kids are the only thing that keeps me from killing myself.No respect or love for myself, and Iâ€™m incredibly disappointed with professional choices Iâ€™ve made in my life.  To know what I could be, and at the same time seeing who I am, is devastating and Iâ€™m ashamed everyday.  The advice people give, to look on the bright side or to not be so hard on myself, only serves to remind me that only by deluding myself and lowering my standards can I be free.  Well, almost the only way.

Iâ€™m in pain and I donâ€™t care for the most part - except when it comes to my kids.  Leaving them fatherless isnâ€™t an option, so I trudge on, wading through mediocrity until at some point Iâ€™m given the freedom to solve this problem once and for all.  

Thanks for listening.
