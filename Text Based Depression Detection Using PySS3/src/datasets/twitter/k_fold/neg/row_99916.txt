Goodbye2 days ago I made a post talking about my problems, about me getting raped, about my family and friends abandoning me, about everything that could go wrong going wrong. I said that I didn't know what to do... I think, for me personally, I should suicide. I think, personally, that the world would be a better place without me. I think, personally, when I die, people will say "Yay! That ugly bitch is gone, I never liked her anyway! No one liked her. No one would have ever liked her." Some people tried to comfort me, people at my school who saw my post. However, I can not trust them... I've been betrayed too much, hurt too often to trust people. 
My life has amounted to nothing. I have done nothing, I have no potential. I am going to die. I am going to kill myself, and at least make my family happy again. And no one will miss me. It'll be better when I'm gone.
