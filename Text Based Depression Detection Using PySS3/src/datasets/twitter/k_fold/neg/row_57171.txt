After a failed attempt a few weeks ago, I thought I'd be more shaken up, but I just feel more hollowMy brother gifted me a magnificent vintage rifle a few years ago. One of the old Russian rounds he had given me misfired when I gave up on life and decided to shoot myself in the head through the mouth. 

I've tried explaining my story to people who have asked before, but I either received silence in return, or generic responses about how life will get better, or "your meant for something greater", or "it wasn't meant to be" (Referring to me living where I Do right now).

A part of me wants to type out the series of events that lead me to where I am right now, but another part of me just keeps repeating how it's just me trying to create a pity party for myself. I just dont know what to do anymore. I don't even have the energy to type out an incredibly long and detailed message here. Hell, I'm not entirely sure I even know why I'm typing *this* out. 

I set another date for myself though, I figure at least this way I'll get to see my family again before I go through with a fullproof method so I can't fuck it up again like before. 

We always read those stories about suicide survivors and how they always say they regretted it. Well the only thing I regret is using old ammunition.
