Compensating for my shortcomingsOkay so first of, I've been having suicidal ideation for the past 2 years but I have been stopped by my mother and a passersby the two times I tried it. I have been feeling this way because I personally see me as a disgusting person. My parents have told me countless times that I'm not becoming responsible as I grow im becoming worse and worse but I can't just tell them that I'm still feeling suicidal because they absolutely hated it when I mentioned it last year.
I was literally beaten by my dad for it. Since that day I learnt my lesson and started bottling everything up and it has proven to me to be better than therapy however, today. I had just bought PokÃ©mon Shield since now that Ive graduated I've been spending more time playing games to distract myself. However my dad came in enraged by the fact that I lied to not go to work yesterday and it pissed him off. Since I always play u til late he just assumed I was tired and said it's not an excuse you should sleep early but in fact. I'm just not motivated by anything. I'm still planning to kill myself next year when I turn 18 because I really don't want to be dealing with this because I feel like shit. I always lie and lie about dumb things and it always backfires and still I keep doing it just to compensate for my shortcomings and it would be so much easier if I was dead so my family wouldn't have to worry about all the dumb things I do
