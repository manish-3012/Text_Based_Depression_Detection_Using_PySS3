I can't change my life at all because I'm not financally independentI wish I could go to a different school, but I can't because I can't have a good future without it. I wish I could have better friends, but I can't since I'm not the one who chose which class I would be a part of. I wish I could change my diet, but 90% of times I can't really choose what I eat. I wish I am smarter, but I am dumb and worthless and always manage to screw everyone and everything up. I wish girls would like me, but since I'm so weak and pathetic I can't have that. I wish I was worthy of someone's love, but if I can't find a good friend, how can I find love? I wish I could talk to my parents without them judging me, or at least I wish I could afford a therapist. Can someone please give me a reason to keep going?
