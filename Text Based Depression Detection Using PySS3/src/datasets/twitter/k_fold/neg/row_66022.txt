everyone i thought was staying is leavingevery time i think things will get better, something happens. i thought i made a friend by being in quarantine, but they just decided they needed a break. and to make matters worse, the other person i trusted seems to be leaving too. 

iâ€™ve attempted once before, and snitched on myself and got the â€œhelpâ€ i needed. but where i live has garbage mental health help, so i got nothing. and now iâ€™m back to where i started.

i know i have support and things will get better but the support never stays consistent and things havenâ€™t gotten better. i donâ€™t want to do this anymore. i keep crying and nothing is changing no matter how hard i try.
