Another dayAnother dayn I was supposed to wake up tomorrow (well today) at 5 am, but here I am with this stupid group of people fucking my life, police never helps, I am lucky I am leaving this shithole in less than 2 months, anyways, whose health is suffering? Do I receive something back? No. And my mother is sick and she hates when I complain, I do not understand why she hates me to complain for our rights, well I kind of understand her, no one is going to do nothing to help us and those stupid individuals will follow doing their shit, well, idk what to do.
