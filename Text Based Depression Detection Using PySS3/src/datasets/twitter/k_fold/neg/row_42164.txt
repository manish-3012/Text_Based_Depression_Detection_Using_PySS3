Ready to goHave two bottles of lorazapem ready to go. Just had to get it off my chest because no one cares. I'm tired of not being able to walk or move properly and doctors who can't tell me what's wrong. I feel like I'll never be better and I'm a burden to everyone. I love my son and I hope he forgets me quickly. Ready.
