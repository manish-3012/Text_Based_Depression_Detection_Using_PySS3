it's getting worseI might do it. I don't know. I'm teetering on the edge. I got sent home from work today because I was shaking and throwing up from being around people.

I haven't felt happy in a long time, even when I'm supposed to.

I texted a hot line. All she said was a thank you for sharing my thoughts and that I'm "strong".
