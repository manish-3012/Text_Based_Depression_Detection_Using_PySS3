Iâ€™m going to breakIâ€™m a 15 year old gay high school kid. My parents are very religious and said to my face that they would rather not have a kid rather than have a gay child. I have less than a 2.0 gpa and I have zero friends. Even in video games I get called a girl and get bullied off of whatever game Iâ€™m playing. The only person thatâ€™s ever been nice to me was some girl who lives in Massachusetts, she was the only one keeping me going. She recently messaged me that she wonâ€™t be able to talk with me anymore for reasons regarding her parents. I really donâ€™t have any reason to keep going, no really wants me here anyway.
