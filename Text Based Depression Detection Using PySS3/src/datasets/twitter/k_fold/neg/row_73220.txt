IdkI already made a post here but I didn't really get good answers, I'll try to summarize.

Months ago I got suicidal thoughts, that made me really emotional.

Now, I don't feel emotional anymore, I feel anger and disgust and I feel like I want to kill whoever is making me mad to a certain point. Not that I would ever kill anyone, I wouldn't bring myself to do such thing. But I'm just asking for help. And I don't think that I'm a sociopath or a psychopath because I have emotions, I can feel.
