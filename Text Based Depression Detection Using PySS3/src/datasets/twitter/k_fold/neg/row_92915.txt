I wish I could get my baby sister to forget about meMy other siblings would be fine. But she's newly 14 and is incredibly stressed and god I know I couldn't have dealt with what I wanna do when I was her age.

I think the only reason I haven't gone out into the woods with a revolver is her and my dad. My other siblings would deal with it. My mom would chalk it up to some bullshit I'm sure. 

I've just finished a glass full of rum, so hopefully I can sleep now. Goddamn I wish I could just not wake up. I almost closed this tab instead of posting but fuck it
