Idk what to do anymoreSometimes I think about the world. I think about my life as well. I think about how much my life is meaningless. I think about how much everything I do and everything anyone does is just pointless. I think about my friends and other people, wondering if they really like me, or if they hate me. Idk if they love me like they say they do. I'm so self conscious about literally every little thing I do. Whether it be the way I walk or the way my chin is positioned, I'm always thinking about the way I look and how ugly I feel. My friends have their lives all planned out while I'm sitting here with no idea wtf I'm doing with my life. I feel so stuck and lonely and I hate myself. I wish I could just go to sleep forever, but I'm afraid to die. So I just chug on and deal with it but it's beginning to overwhelm me. What do I do? I'm so scared of my own thoughts
