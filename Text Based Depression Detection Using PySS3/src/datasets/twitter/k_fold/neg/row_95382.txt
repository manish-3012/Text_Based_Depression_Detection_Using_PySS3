Afraid I'm a real pedo...At first I thought it was just POCD because I have OCD too, even my therapist said so but now I'm not so sure anymore. I have done some age play - role play stuff online and I'm afraid I like it. I'm scared I like the idea of having sex with little kids.

I don't want to be like this, I don't want to harm kids. I'm thinking about taking some pills or something to see if I have less sex drive. I can't deal with this anymore, I'm really depressed and I can't function right anymore because of this.

There are so many fucked people out there, and I don't want to be one of them. I'm alone with all this and I can't tell anyone about it, it sucks. It sucks living with this inside me knowing that no one in the world can help me.

I could tell my therapist but what could she ever do for me? Nothing... It sucks, but if it's true it's really scary since there is no cure or anything. It's just the way I am and it's terrible. :(
