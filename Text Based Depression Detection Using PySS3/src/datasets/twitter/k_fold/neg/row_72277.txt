I just feel like a needed to take all my pills(English is not my first language). Today I forgot my medicine and when I went to take it I just felt like I should take all of them and finally die.
I hate myself, I have a loving family and good friends but I just feel so miserable all the time. I feel even more depressed and I don't know if I can wait until my appointment with a psychiatrist on april 9. South america sucks
I am scared of not being able to stop if a have more sudden impulses
