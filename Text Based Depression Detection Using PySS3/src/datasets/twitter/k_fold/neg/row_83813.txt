Feeling aloneHonestly, I don't know why I feel this way. I'm surrounded by family, they talk with me, I talk with them. I feel like I should be happy. Yet at the same time, I feel I can only ever be myself with myself. I am reminded that everyone has struggled in this world, that my attitude should not be projected outwards for others to see. And honestly, I am starting to believe just that. I tried being open with those close to me, I thought if anything family will be there for me \^\^ What I didn't realize is how much I was hurting those around me. In fact so much so, that I was told by one of my family members that essentially, I should have finalized my actions if I was going to tell them. That me telling them these things was going to cause my own mother pain. And I'll be honest, it hurt. I felt like a failure of a son. Still kind of do if I'm being honest. I just feel like I don't add any value to anyone's life. At this point I just keep telling myself to hang on for one more day, hoping I can find a way to make the pain stop. But I feel whatever decision I come to, it's going to hurt me or someone around me emotionally.
