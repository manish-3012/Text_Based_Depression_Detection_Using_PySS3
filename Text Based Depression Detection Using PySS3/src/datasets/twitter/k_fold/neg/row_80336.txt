I am planning to go to Mexico to commit suicide with PentobarbitalI've looked at a few places for an assisted suicide or euthanasia center overseas. I couldn't find almost any that would accept people with mental illnesses. The ones who do accept people with mental illness will only take citizens of that country. 


So I have to take matters into my own hands. I know I can't just walk into a drug store and get Pentobarbital, but I think I would have a lot easier time finding it somewhere in Mexico than I would someplace else. 


I guess I'm saying this out loud so that it's not just being held inside. I've only told one person so far and they did not care. Couldn't even be bothered to talk to me. Really helped me remember why I want to die so badly. 


I know you guys are anti-suicide, obviously. But I am really glad about this. I feel at peace. Making this decision is the first time in a while where I've felt peaceful and the first time I've felt sure of something. I am ready to die.
