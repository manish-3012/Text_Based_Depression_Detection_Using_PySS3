I'm not feeling anything right nowI'm currently unable to feel any emotion, this the second time that this has happened to me.

I'm a 22 year old "man" currently studying (but starting to hate what I study), I have no job and have never worked before, I still live with my mother, I have a girlfriend but I think I'm losing her, I don't talk with nobody, I don't enjoy anything I do in my daily life.

Last two weeks have been horrible, my sister, my mother and I got covid and my grandfather passed away (not covid related, he lived in a town 7hrs from my home). I haven't seen my father, brother and girlfriend in weeks because of covid. Everything is getting better, but I was getting sadder. Today I talked to my girlfriend about how I feel, I was really sad all day, been crying a lot. I talked to her about how I'm feeling. She's telling me she feels alone, I tell her I also feel alone. We ended up feeling worse, and I got to the point that I can't feel anything.

I should be sad because I made my girlfriend feel like shit, but I'm not sad. I care about her, but I can't feel anything. I just found out a friend got engaged, I should be happy but I don't feel anything. I'm trying to cry but I can't get to feel sad. I have work to do for my classes, but I don't feel the urge or simply I don't feel like doing it.

I've been "feeling" like this for an hour straight and I don't know what to do.
