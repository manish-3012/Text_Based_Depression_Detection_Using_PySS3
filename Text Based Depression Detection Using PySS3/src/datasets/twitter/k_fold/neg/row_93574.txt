does anyone think of suicide like this ?iâ€™m 22, and i believe i am suicidal. I donâ€™t want to kill myself right now, but someday i think i may. iâ€™ve thought like this for a long time. i have ocd and remember starting to have obsessive and obtrusive thoughts as a young kid. it would come in go in waves but it got increasingly worse. In high school i got really depressed because of horrible thoughts, i couldnâ€™t control my head. i felt better once i started college but then it got much worse, i became much more anxious and compulsive so i finally reached out for help and got put on meds, they help. 

I fantasize about suicide, plan, contemplate, research. it so comforting knowing there can be a way out if i ever really need it, which someday i believe i will. 

when someone dies of suicide it is obviously very sad and unfortunately, but sometimes i feel happy for them - they finally got free of what was tormenting them - which to me is very appealing. however whenever i express this thought or the fact that i plan my death, people canâ€™t handle it. they say thatâ€™s fucked up or just shut me down or walk away. when i suggested people look at suicide differently i feel like an outsider (i guess i am).
