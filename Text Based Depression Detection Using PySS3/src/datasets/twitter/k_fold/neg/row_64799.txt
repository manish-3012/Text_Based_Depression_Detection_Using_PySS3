Got Scissors in My HandI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m depressed again. Definitely have ideation. This week I didnâ€™t really have any ideation until now, been pretty busy with school and work... now I want to cut myself pretty bad.. been playing around with a pair of scissors just running down my leg. Sometimes it just feels like fucking useless even though my life is going pretty well. I got my shit together after I left my abusive house, got my drivers license, my first job, my GED. But man sometimes I just think â€œfuck it, why am I still doing thisâ€
