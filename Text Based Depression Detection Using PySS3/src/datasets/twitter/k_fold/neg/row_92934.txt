My experienceI wish I'd read a few things about the suicide hotline before calling, but I was hysterical and frightened by the thoughts running through my head, and it was all I could think to do. The man on the other end sounded bored, but demanded I give him the name and number of a family member or he would call 911. I pleaded with him not to do either...that I just needed to talk things through with someone, but he basically sounded pissed and impatient, and told me it wasn't his job to just chat, and then he called the police.  I've never felt so ashamed and embarrassed, and the panic I felt was overwhelming. I kept thinking (and saying) I shouldn't have called, and...it was just a horrible experience all around.
The police were actually very kind and helped to calm me down, so I guess I should have just called them in the first place.
