Need advice/ a friend... F (19 )I'm battling with depression/ suicidal thoughts and have been since I was younger. I have been thru hell and back but it's mostly relationship wise. I was in a relationship with my ex since I was 16 him and I still talk but he's very verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusive. He had cheated on me, kept secret relationships from me put other girls and their opinions about me before me and blames his actions on "cuz I'm bored and want to try new things" he knows I battle with this and has told me to kill myself nobody will care, why do you post sad things on ur story ur friends are annoyed and if they won't say anything I will, ur a burden u ruin my day/ mood, I didn't hurt u ( he did tbh ) and he thinks I'm joking when I say I don't want to be here anymore. He says "I'm used to it it's nothing new, idk what to tell you, I can't relate so I don't care" he never tries to understand me instead he gets angry at me for being sad over THINGS HE DID. he said a lot of other stuff and did a ton of other shit I can't type in one post but I just need someone to listen, care, etc. My family doesn't care they call me crazy, they've made fun of me and my friends don't seem to care either. Everyday I wake up crying, I go to sleep crying, I don't eat most of them time cuz I'm sleeping all day to not feel anything. I just want to be happy.
