The suicidal thoughts that have been plaguing me have been crazy lately.Over the past few days,I have:

-Thought about stabbing myself/slitting my own throat..

-Wondered if death by North Korean military action(nuke) was/is a valid suicide method..

-And now I'm thinking about buying a gun again to shoot myself with.

And also now I'm literally starting to think that good people don't exist,period.

It's like...if we're all gonna get brutally murdered by the damn government(nuclear war) at some point,then why the hell SHOULDN'T we end it?

Why the hell does suicide have to be such a damned disaster?!

Damn.

Over the past few days:

"Tell me why I shouldn't just slit my own damn throat"

"Give me a good reason why I shouldn't just plunge this damn knife into my chest"(when I was doing the dishes)

One of which,I had to take a drink of vodka to get rid of the thoughts.

And North Korea..those guys are just the stuff of nightmares for me..and I think I'll just be afraid of them for the rest of my natural life.

And Koreans don't like black people at all..yeah.

To think that a sect of humans not ONLY want you dead for political reasons...but because you have a different skin tone.

Shit.

TL;DR:Suicidal thoughts have been driving me crazy..and now on top of that,I think Humans are just fucking trash and North Korea continues to scare the ever-living fuck outta me...and with all this..I still don't understand why suicide is such a damned disaster...nor why death is so damned scary.
