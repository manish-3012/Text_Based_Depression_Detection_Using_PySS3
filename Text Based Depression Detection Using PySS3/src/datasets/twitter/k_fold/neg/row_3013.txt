I wish I had the courage to kill myselfI hate being such a failure and working hard but failing every time. Everyday I walk down the street and secretly wish the person driving on the road is a drunk driver and runs me over or that I will die from an aneurysm in my sleep. I would take matters into my own hands but I am such a failure I am not brave enough to do it. I know most people wont miss me but idk why I cant do it
