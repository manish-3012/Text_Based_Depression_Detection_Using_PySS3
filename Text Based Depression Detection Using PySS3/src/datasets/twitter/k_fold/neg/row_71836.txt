i donâ€™t want to do thisiâ€™m so tired and i donâ€™t want to deal with anything anymore. i really wish i could off myself but i know that would be really selfish and shitty of me bc i would be hurting my friends and family. i tried to kill myself years ago and i still feel v guilty for it. i know iâ€™m a failure for feeling like this, the only thing thatâ€™s stopping me is self control. i know iâ€™m very weak for not wanting to face my problems, and i really hate how pathetic i am. i know i should just snap out of it and pull myself together. iâ€™m v privileged to have people care about me, and to be able to afford college and not worry about finances. and iâ€™m stupid not to appreciate it. iâ€™m actually so useless i canâ€™t bring myself to even do the bare minimum and complete my schoolwork. i hate how ungrateful i am i just want to hurt myself so much. i donâ€™t deserve to have my friends and family, and i wish i could give it to someone else who would appreciate them. i wish i didnâ€™t have an obligation to be alive i hate myself so much iâ€™m so fucking useless i just want to die can i just take the easy way out iâ€™m so so tired please
