Nothings helpingBackground Iâ€™m a person with severe anxiety and depression and suicidal thoughts and Iâ€™ve attempted suicide twice without my parents knowing, the worst part they found out and sent me to a fricking psych ward for a week, it wasnâ€™t as bad as people think it is but the staff was racist to the two black people there, and there was coloring all over the wall and they never cleaned the rooms, all the patients there actually supported each other and I got really close with a couple of people, but then I had to go and Iâ€™m on medication now but I still feel worthless, the sad part is I over heard my dad talking about it and he thinks Iâ€™m just doing it for attention, I just donâ€™t want to live anymore, I support people going through it but Iâ€™m going through it myself, I just need someone to talk to, my one friend that I ever had is just ghosting me and itâ€™s stressful I just feel so alone
