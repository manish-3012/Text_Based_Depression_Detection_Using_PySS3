I wish I were deadI'm not suicidal, but I wish I were dead. I wish I'd never been born.  I tried to get over this feeling: drugs, drinking, religion, romance, friends, family, pets, hobbies, career - anything to change how I feel.  Before you suggest it, I have already been to therapy.  I have talked it over with loved ones and friends, as well as qualified professionals.  I've tried.  I've tried to get better.  I've tried to commit suicide.  I'm too chicken to pull the trigger (both literally and figuratively).  I've tried to get help.  I've tried to do this on my own.  I've tried to do this with others.  Since no matter what I do ends in failure, I guess I live the rest of my life in perpetual misery.
