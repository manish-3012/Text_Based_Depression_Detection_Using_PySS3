Friend committed. I have answers. How to tell her family?Greetings.

A few weeks ago a close friend committed suicide. She was only 20, had so much to live for. I love her so much. So many emotions. However, I am not here for my own problems getting through this. 

I learned about her fears and depression a little more than a month before. Never did I fear it would come to this, but it has. I don't have all the answers, but nobody else to my knowledge heard about she having problems.

Except me.

I want to tell her mother, however I cannot imagine what is going through her head. I am completely devastated right now, so it is unfathomable how she is. She is really open to talk to me and so am I to her.

I haven't told her I have information. In this subreddit's personal advice, would you tell her? If so, how long until it is appropriate and is there a certain way you would go about it?

I miss her so much. I beg any of you that have problems to talk to somebody, anybody. I guarantee you that many love you. Just talk. Please. I beg you.

Thank you.
