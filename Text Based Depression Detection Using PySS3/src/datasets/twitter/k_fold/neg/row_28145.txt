Fucked my life over. Been trying so hard to make it through, but there's no hope left for me. It's time to fold.I've just had enough. People come on here and say that often, I know. But I'm beyond the point where I have a reason to just keep suffering, minute after minute, day after day. There is no one on this planet that loves me anymore and I honestly don't blame them one bit. I am a burden to all I have touched and that's a fact I can't keep living with. 

I've been trying to right all my wrongs these past several months, trying to stand on my own but I can't. My heart is too cold, my body too weak, my inner fortitude has collapsed. I thought I had my boyfriend as the one person by my side, the one shred of hope and light in this blackened existence. But it's become clear in recent days that he is giving up on me, too. And I don't blame him either. But I don't intend to stick around to continue seeing it happen. He deserves someone better than me, anyhow.

I thought about writing letters but fuck it. I could never adequately express the sorrow I feel for how I have hurt people with my existence or the deep longing and anguish that runs through me every second of every day. No one would care to understand anyway. Bye reddit folks. I just wanted to say you are all some of the most compassionate, lovely people in this world. Keep trying to help those that aren't too far gone like me.
