I contacted Dignitas, donâ€™t know how/if to tell my familySome background. â€œSuicidalâ€ for me is a strange term because for healthy people, it implies a sense of urgency and desperation and irrationality. And of course Iâ€™ve experienced times like this, when I donâ€™t think I can take another minute and I start googling things like â€œtallest bridge in (city)â€. But then I remember that it is NOT worth failing, at least not to me. 

My single worst fear is a failed attempt that leaves me crippled somehow, not because I think disability is the worst thing in the world, but because it might keep me from being able to complete another attempt. Or it could render me mentally incompetent to sign a consent to assisted suicide. This brings me to my point.

Iâ€™ve been at least some level of suicidal for ... I honestly canâ€™t say how long. And by â€œsome levelâ€, I mean Iâ€™d rather be dead than alive, Iâ€™d give it all up if I could snap my fingers and end here, etc. Itâ€™s been my entire adult life without a doubt. Most of my childhood for sure. There were a few good teenage years in there, but I donâ€™t know if they were actually good, or just exciting, and hopeful that Iâ€™d finally be happy/healthy soon. So to me, itâ€™s a confusing concept. Iâ€™m safe, in that Iâ€™m not going to attempt rashly or on a momentâ€™s notice. If I did attempt myself, it would be a precise, well considered plan with the deadliest method I could find and a long note explaining everything. But part of a well considered plan is thoroughly exploring your other options, so Iâ€™ve had just about every kind of therapy and medication you can imagine. Intensive, CBT, partial hospitalization, IOP, over a dozen antidepressants and a few other anti-anxiety or anti-psychotic. Things have helped some, but nothing has made it Worth It. 

Dignitas is an organization in Switzerland that believes in Right To Die. Not just for the terminally ill, but for all of those who can prove that their suffering is unbearable. I sent them an email a few months ago, before starting another therapy program, and after ending the program and seeing no results, Iâ€™ve just followed up. 

Itâ€™s expensive. Itâ€™s a long process. But itâ€™s painless and legal and no one can stop you. And most importantly, itâ€™s guaranteed. When they approve you, you know for a fact your end is coming on your own terms. 

Hereâ€™s the problem. Iâ€™m a young adult and Iâ€™m broke. My parents have shitloads of money, including a trust fund for me (which I plan to donate to less privileged individuals after death), but I donâ€™t have access to it yet. Obviously I could work and save up, but without the college degree theyâ€™re funding itâ€™d take years anyway. Theyâ€™re open minded people, and theyâ€™ve known that Iâ€™ve been suffering for a while now, and they know Iâ€™ve tried almost everything.

Theyâ€™re the kind of ultra supportive parents who love to say â€œWe want to support you in any decision you find is right for youâ€,  so clearly this should be a cake walk /s. 

A big part of why I want to die this way is respect for those around me. In the USA where I live, suicide is stigmatized and criminalized to the point that people are institutionalized involuntarily for exercising bodily autonomy. Those who want to complete an attempt without being stopped, shunned, and essentially jailed, have to do so silently and violently, leaving innumerable unanswered questions and robbing their families of a goodbye. 

If I go through Dignitas, I CAN say goodbye. I can include my family and friends in this decision, not have to hide it, and no one will have to find me. No one will have to wonder why I did it. I want my parents to understand that it is NOT their fault, and I want them to be able to say a proper goodbye. 

But theyâ€™re never gonna say yes. Even if I had all the money myself and the organization agreed, I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d ever give their blessing for me to stop suffering. 

Anti suicide culture is a never ending torture, full of catch-22â€™s and paradoxes, all of which are meant to prolong suffering and ensure death is as risky and hurtful to others as possible. To me, this culture feels like a literal dystopia. Stay alive, stay happy! :) But donâ€™t you dare alleviate your pain. 

Neurotypicals LOVE to talk about how painful other peopleâ€™s suicides are for them (boo hoo), but then they do nothing to make it easier on themselves. They make sure weâ€™re shooting our brains out and banging ourselves in closets without a word, because thereâ€™s no other way to do it. And because we canâ€™t even talk out the decision with them first.
