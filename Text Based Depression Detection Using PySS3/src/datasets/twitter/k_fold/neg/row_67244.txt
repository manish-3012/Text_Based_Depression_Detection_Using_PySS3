Suicidal thoughtsI feel like a terrible person. I know that realistically not every thing I do is a bad thing and I know that I should be able to not forgive myself for things I do. But I really canâ€™t shake off the feeling that every action I take is despicable and terrible and I really hate myself for it. I want to forgive myself and just go on with my life but I canâ€™t forgive the things Iâ€™ve done in the past or try to stop doing terrible things in the future. For context, Iâ€™m 19 and I was diagnosed with both depression and anxiety earlier in life but since then Iâ€™ve been put off medication because I was happy for a year. Iâ€™ve recently moved out of the country to study alone at a university. For the last half year at university Iâ€™ve been super alone and Iâ€™ve spent almost every afternoons in my room alone making music that no one will want to hear. Ever since then, plus with the virus, Iâ€™ve had more time to reflect about what Iâ€™ve done with my life and the people that met along the way. I know that all the things Iâ€™ve done arenâ€™t bad, hell, I think half of them arenâ€™t bad but I havenâ€™t been able to shake off massive amounts of guilt for just day to day activities. I feel like a crazy person talking about it. My mind is constantly telling me to end it because it seems like the only way to stop worrying and guilting over things so much when my mind itself wonâ€™t co-operate. I really donâ€™t like to call attention so I havenâ€™t talked about this with anyone. But idk what to do at this point where my mind is being my own worst enemy. What would you guys recommend? I really need help because I really donâ€™t know what to do at this point.
