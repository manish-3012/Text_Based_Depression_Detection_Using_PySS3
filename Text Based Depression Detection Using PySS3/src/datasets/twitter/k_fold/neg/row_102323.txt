After 10 months of unemployment on top of my depression, I am in so much pain. My life is meaningless, I have lost all control, and I want to die.I hurt so bad and it never stops. I can't kill myself because of my friends and family. I hadn't even made it out of this fucking house for more than eight months when a layoff forced me back. This shit DOES NOT HAPPEN TO MOST PEOPLE. I have spent 2 of the 3 years since I graduated unemployed while my friends enjoy success, love, money, independence, and having a career.

Words cannot describe how deep my pain is and how incredibly maddening it is to be applying to jobs and interview every single day without getting anywhere. At some point I'm going to snap and just drive to that parking garage. I already had my 25th birthday here against my will and I think if I don't have a job by my 26th I'm going to drive to that parking garage and jump off it.

I don't want to be me. I didn't ask for this. I never fucked up big time and I always take my meds. I just have horrible luck and am doomed to suffer. I have been suffering since I was a teenager and I just want to die.
