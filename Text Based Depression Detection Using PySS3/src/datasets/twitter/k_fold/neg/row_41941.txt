i can tell everyone around me is tired of me and frankly i'm tired of myself. I just don't want to do this anymoreI'm tired, so fucking tired of living my life. i have nothing going for me, 21, live with my mom, don't go to school, don't have a job. Have been depressed since i was 14, and i honestly don't know how ive made it this far. Today was a horrible day, on top of being sick i don't even have the money to buy cough syrup or Advil. Plain and simple. I just want to die, so i can rest, and stop struggling. My mom is tired of me, the only friends i have are living their own lives, and im just here. Doing nothing. So why be here at all. I self harm, and was just thinking of cutting deep enough and just laying out to feel myself get cold and just going to sleep. i don't know why im writing this, maybe because i have no one else to say goodbye too ;/.
