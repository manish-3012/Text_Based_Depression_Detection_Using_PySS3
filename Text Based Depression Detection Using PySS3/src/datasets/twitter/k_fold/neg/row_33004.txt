Wanting to sleep forever... Maybe it's better that way, for everyoneI'm tired... truly, and utterly just tired.. Emotionally, mentally, physically... 

Plenty of things I have no control over physically that is breaking me over and over (Severe Respiratory issues for over 2 decades + recent surgery for a genetic joint issue, possible more).. 

All that plus some emotional issues where I can't seem to ... get the basic respect in friendships and relationships alike that I output and overcompensate for.. 

Happiness has been a thing that is so foreign to me, IDK how to pinpoint if I'm actually happy or not.... Don't get me wrong, my life on the cover is fine. Good paying job, have assets I own, in my late-20s and doing most of the things I want to do on impulse or planned. 

Just... more and more lately, I can't seem to see a .. permanent light, or *something to hold onto*.

This post is weak... I feel weak .. for a long time now...
