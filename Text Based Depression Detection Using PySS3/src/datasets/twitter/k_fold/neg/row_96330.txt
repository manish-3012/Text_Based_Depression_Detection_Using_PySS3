42m not doing it tonight anyways...I don't so much want to kill myself as much as I just wish I was dead most of the time. Like many of us say, so many others have it worse but damn if life doesn't hurt sometimes no matter who you are. Dealing with stupid midlife shit can be as frustrating as puberty. I'm not going to do it tonight but damn I am so exhausted with it all lately and have been thinking of it a lot. Anyways, here's to hanging on one more day I guess...
