I'm 56 and I've wanted to end all this for a very long timeI know I won't because I have 3 daughters and a granddaughter, and they're just about the only reason I haven't done it. Not that it makes anything any easier, quite the opposite, but I've never said this out loud before, and for some reason I felt like I had to. I'm not sure this is even important.

I think about it (plot it?) at least once every day; in my mind, I've become quite the expert.
