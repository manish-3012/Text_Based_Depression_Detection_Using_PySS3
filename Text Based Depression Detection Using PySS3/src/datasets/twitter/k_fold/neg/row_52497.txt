I can't take it anymore.The only reason I've lasted this long is because I'm yet to find a way to kill myself, yet leave all of my organs intact for donor usage. I don't want to live my life, but other people should be allowed that chance. Someone who can't live their life to the fullest should be given the chance. I feel like I'm ruining their chance just by existing. I need to let go. One way, or another, I'll find a way to preserve my body, but not have to breathe or live this life any longer.
