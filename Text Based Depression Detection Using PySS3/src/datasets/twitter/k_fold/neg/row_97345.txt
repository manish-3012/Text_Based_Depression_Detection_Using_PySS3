The joy of stomach pumping - This sub saved my fucking lifePosted that i'd deliberately overdosed on a cocktail of different types of medication inc paracetamol, sleeping pills and painkillers.

Still got the treat of having my stomach  pumped to remove the meds. Got released after around 12 hours and I have a scheduled meeting with mental health care professionals and some further meetings. No emotional feelings about anything when doing it, was perfectly calm and still don't feel anything now. Friend got me a human sized teddy bear which is already a very good

Ps: If your upset or struggling and thinking about self harming there are plenty of nice people on this thread. If you are struggling to find someone to speak with there are plenty of supportive + caring people to be found here, but i'm not one of them.
