How much longer do I have to try before its okay to kill myself?How much longer do I have to try and think happy thoughts and put on a smile and laugh and learn social cues and take meds and go to therapy and exercise and socialise and eat well and go to work and all the things normal happy people do. How much longer do I have to do all this before I'm allowed to give up and  kill myself. Life obviously isn't for me. Just let me fucking die.
