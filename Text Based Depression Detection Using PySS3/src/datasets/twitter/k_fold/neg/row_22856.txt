Not getting betterI'm probably the closest to suicide that I've ever been right now.

Nothing is helping.  When I sleep or get out outside that helps for a little, but after that the numbness, crying, and panic cycles.  I've talked to crisis chats a couple of times, but they always feel like robots.  I went to my first counseling appointment, but I'm afraid to talk to them about anything, especially suicide, because they might be legally obligated to tell my parents.

I also have mixed feelings.  I go from feeling like nobody really cares more than to keep you alive at a given moment (unless you have money) to it being my fault for not opening up or fixing myself.

i'll probably never try suicide as it seems to messy and painful I guess, but I feel like i'll just get worse and worse
