Just wanted to say goodbyeToday, i decided that i don't want to be here anymore. Right now i'm on a 19 floor building an i'm at the top of it. I always founded myself ugly. I do not like what i see in the mirror. Like i genuinly hate it. I've posted my apperance in other subreddits if you would like to see what makes me so upset about my face. Today my gf's mother called me ugly and i just felt so fucking bad that i can't even describe it. Can't say these words to my mom or dad or anyone in my life. I love you all and i'm so fucking sorry. Take care.
