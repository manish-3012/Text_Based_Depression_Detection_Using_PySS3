Fuck itWas typing a nice long post and Reddit app froze. So here's the tldr. No longer attracted to wife, she just had our first baby who I didn't really want to begin with and was born with a physical defect. I work a dangerous job where suicide would be easy and look accidental. Piling up medical bills, a job I hate, a wife I'm only with because I can't break her heart and a baby I despise.. I think it's time I finally took the cowards way out.
