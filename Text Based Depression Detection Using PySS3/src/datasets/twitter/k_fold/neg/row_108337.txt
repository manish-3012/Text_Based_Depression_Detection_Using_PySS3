I really have run out of reasons to keep goingI have been in mental health units 4-5 times. I've been on every anti-depressant and medication imaginable, tried ECT and therapy. My mother is the only person in my family who will even speak to me, but never shows any concern or even attempts to initiate contact with me. I have no friends whatsoever, my best friend of 15 years cut off all contact with me. I am currently living in a group home, having lost my apartment due to financial troubles. I wake up every day and usually end up crying, spending most of my time trying to think of the best way to kill myself. My father will no longer speak to me, with his last words to me being that he is to ashamed of me to have any sort of contact with me. My sister was the only family who had any concern and a genuine interest in my life, but will no longer speak to me.

Why should I even bother?
