I dunno what's been wrong with me these past few weeks. I probably need help. Am I going to get it? No, probably not.It's like... Instead of going forwards I'm going backwards. I've started cutting again (Not that I necessarily relapsed, it's never been a habit or an addict, I start and stop when I want). I thought about killing myself by slitting my wrists or throat. Which, is never a way I want to not will go... Ever, no matter how depressed I am. Yet for some reason it can't leave my mind. I thought about ODing. Which, I'm against suicide by OD, and once again won't ever do it. I devoted an entire post that was like five paragraphs long on why you shouldn't OD... And yet here I am thinking about it.

I keep asking "what is wrong with me, why is there something wrong with me" to myself, and I've started hating my body again. I haven't done any of that since I was ten years old.

All these things... But I'm not even mad or sad. I'm indifferent about everything. Which certainly wasn't how I felt back then. I was constantly mad and sad.
