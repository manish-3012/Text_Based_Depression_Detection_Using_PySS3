Lifeâ€™s not worth it anymoreHi so today I decided that within the next week I will kill myself. I came to this choice after my best friend slept with the girl I love last night. This is not the only reason but itâ€™s the one that finally broke me. Iâ€™m an unattractive guy. And my biggest fear is never finding someone to actually have a connection with. I had a connection once with a girl in highschool with me but she was very abusive. She like to cut me with knives because it gave her pleasure. I was in a relationship with her for four years until I went to college and that was 3 years ago. I have problems with girls because of this relationship and I never can find an outlet to voice my pain because Iâ€™m a guy and guys just canâ€™t do that shit. At least thatâ€™s how I was raised. So you see with this last straw and everything else I just donâ€™t feel like any of this is at all worth it anymore. Why live when for 3 years all I felt was pain/mistrust to people. So thatâ€™s why I decided to do this. Iâ€™m only typing this because I donâ€™t want to leave behind a letter. That would ruin my parents
