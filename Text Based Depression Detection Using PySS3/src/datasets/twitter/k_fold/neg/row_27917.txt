i cut myself deep and big for the first time today.  never felt betteri've been insanely depressed recently.  no one gives a shit, but it isn't anyone else's responsibly to take care of me.  i've been thinking about suicide so i cut my arm with a razorblade.  it was seriously euphoric, like ecstasy level euphoria.  I could probably keep myself alive doing this.  thanks for the attention, because its all i really want. (i don't kid myself)
