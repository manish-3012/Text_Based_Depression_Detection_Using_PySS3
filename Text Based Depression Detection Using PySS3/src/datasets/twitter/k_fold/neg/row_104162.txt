What is the point of living, if everyday you cry yourself to sleep because you have no hope?I've posted here before. I just don't really know what to do anymore. Even though my academic life is going in the right direction, and a professional future is certain with a decent to very good pay, what's the point? More and more each day, I start to think that people I consider friends only really ever talk to me when they need something from me; be it help, just an ear, whatever.
Maybe that's not true, maybe I'm just feeling so lonely that I start making these wild assumptions. But it's killing me, bit by bit. I used to be an, overall, happy person. I'm not. Not anymore. Sure, I fake it. I put on an happy face so I don't cause pain to my family, and so I don't bother other people with my pain.
But I just can't stop thinking about just ending it. Why should I keep living? I always wanted to have a family, but no one wants to be with me. I dated a girl that put me through hell because of her family, although I wasn't her fault, for 4 years. What were her last words to me? "I can't even stand the idea of being with you. I feel disgust."
That fucking broke me. I've not been the same since. And I just keep getting rejected. "You're such a good friend, but...".
I'm just...tired. I really don't want to live if all I'll ever do is work and spend the rest of my days alone. I'd rather just end it and be done with it.
Maybe I should see a doctor, but if I do that, I'll put my parents through a lot of pain and concern, and I can't do that to them. They always did everything they could, and sometimes more, for me. My dad works 2 jobs so that we could live a nice life without worrying too much about money.
But I just don't know how to get out of this sinking hole. I think I might end it someday. I just don't care anymore if I die...
What can I do?
