Finally told my therapist I am a sociopath and have DID (other people in my head that I share a body with)I told her, tried to get everything out in my 50 minute session but it wasn't long enough. I told her my my DID and ASPD (sociopathy for me, hopefully) 

So I came home and got fucked up drunk and now I'm laying in bed listening to music cuz I tried to get up and tripped and hit my head on the TV haha not good form someone with a traumatic brain injury. 

I just wanted to post something... Cuz I'm kinda in that (I don't fucking care) moments and I am hoping I get so drunk I die. Just feel shitty and evil and like my whole life is a fraud for hiding it this long... 

My ex husband was with, and had sex, with 4 different people... Without knowing. And I am just crumbling, trying to figure out my place in the world of if I should just hit the Easy Button of death. 

Sorry if anything's misspelled, google auto correct is a gawd sent but only works so far for us drunkards haha ask anything,.no limits
