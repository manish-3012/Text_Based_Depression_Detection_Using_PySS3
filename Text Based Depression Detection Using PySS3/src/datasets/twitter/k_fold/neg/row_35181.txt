That's it I give upI'm 16 years old, male. I give up on life, I'm not good enough for anything. I've always been rejected when I've submitted proposals for projects (by every single institution possible no less. Well that just shows something doesn't it.) Meanwhile my friends are getting $7000 as funding for projects. I've never tried for my tests and exams but I've always scored pretty well, but my mom always asks me to work harder. I just want to be told that I'm good enough. I'm tired of this. I've wasted most of my life I guess. The constant lethargy isn't helping with school either. I can't keep convincing everyone else that I'm fine. My national exams are coming up and I'm not doing anything about it.

Oh well. Time to die it is. It's cold and I want it to stop. I have several methods planned out anyway.
