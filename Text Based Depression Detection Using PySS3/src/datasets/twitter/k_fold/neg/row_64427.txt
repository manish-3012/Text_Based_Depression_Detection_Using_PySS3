i cant take this fucking pain,does anyone else have moments of pure intennse gut wrenching pain inside that makes you certain you want to kill yourself. in that moment you break down crying and are 100% sure u want to  die so do reckless things like drink alot or consume harmful stuff.

then moments later you get a bit rational again but you are still depressed.

its either constantly dull or intensely suicidal
