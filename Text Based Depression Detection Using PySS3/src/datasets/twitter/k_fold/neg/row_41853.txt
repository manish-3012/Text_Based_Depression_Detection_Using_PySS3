2021. i already want to give upwoke up today and all i can think about is killing myself. its just yet another reminder of the shit i have to endure in order to fulfill my goals for the year, which im doubtful will get fufilled anyways, because well last year was not successful either.
i wish someone could hear my screams into the darkness but everyone just ignores me because i always sour the mood. dont know what im even saying anymore
