I can't do this for much longerThere's no reason for me to keep fighting. I can't function in the world. Every day I feel humiliated and worthless. And today was one of the worst. My best friend, the only person who knows what I'm going through, stopped disputing me and basically acknowledged I am right about how I won't be able to function. She still cares about me, but I've worn her down. 

There's going to come a point when it won't be manageable anymore. I barely get through the day now when I have no responsibilities, I won't be able to live on my own. None of what people tell me to do works. I can't stop comparing myself to others, which always puts me in a suicidal mood. I'll never be happy with myself because my ceiling is so low.
