Giving into the temptation of ending it more and more each day.I wake up and the first thing on my my mind is 'what's the point'. I have genuinely pondered this every morning for the past 3 months or so (been suicidal for years but it's never been this intense) but it has gotten more severe this last month. I can't focus anymore, i have absolutely zero motivation to do any college work even though i enjoy the course i am on, i don't want to socialise with anybody, and my body dysmorphia makes me literally want to hide away from the world. My therapy hasn't fully started yet despite me attending 4 sessions designed to assess me; they keep sending me the wrong dates or giving me the wrong therapist. I want to travel, see the world, live in a way that is peaceful yet exciting. I want to help others like myself, and learn in abundance. But i can't see this ever happening. I don't believe i will do anything because in my eyes, i am too ugly for life, too depressed to find motivation, and to top it off i can't maintain a job or education due to my body dysmorphia and anxiety. I am a mess, and i don't see that ever changing. 

I don't necessarily expect a response, but i thank whoever has taken the time to read this rant. I needed to get it off of my chest, whether it has helped or not,
