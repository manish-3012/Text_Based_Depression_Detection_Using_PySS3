Everything has gone to shitHonestly everything has really gone to shit. It all started out with my grandpa dying last month. My girlfriend showed no sympathy and when I asked her for some time alone she kept yelling that I was making excuses to fuck other girls. I would never cheat on her. My girlfriend of 4 years who broke up with me and now 2 weeks later is already seeing a bunch of other guys. 5 days after, my dog died. She was my bestfriend since she was born five years ago and is now gone. I took the next day off work to build a casket for her and bury her. I didn't let my boss know and he fired me because of my performance for the last week which I had just been sad over because of my girlfriend which I completely understand. I have been looking for a job this past week and still nothing. I'm not going to be able to pay rent this month and soon I'll be out on the streets. My family is all in Mexico so I have no help plus I don't want to ask them seeing as they sent me to this country to become successful and am now dirt poor. I'm going to have to sell my grandpas motorcycle which he gave me when he died last month. Honestly, I have no reason to keep going. I want to end it all.
