How do you get help?^^fyi ^^throwaway ^^account ^^sorry ^^if ^^i ^^can't ^^comment ^^much ^^due ^^to ^^"you're ^^doing ^^that ^^too ^^much"

Hey there. I'm pretty much a mess. Anxiety disorders about everything. Severe depression. Hate my career path. Hate my college. Hate a lot of people. Downward spiralling thoughts. Suicidal tendencies since I was 11. Depressive tendencies I found all the way back in my little-kid diary from 2nd grade. I wrote how miserable I was in the cutest little handwriting.

I'm really damn good at hiding it. I can socialize if I force myself. I can smile and laugh and lie. And I'm a fantastic liar. I told my parents I was depressed and they were genuinely confused. Started blaming themselves (of course) rather than dealing with the problem.

Pretty much all I can do is prevent myself from thinking. I can't think. I must do things. Non-stop. Or I'm miserable. If they're not attentive enough I have to do something else. I can't do things I once loved because I feel guilty that they're frivolous and not making money.

Trying to get to sleep is the worst. I am alone with my poison thoughts. Sleep is great. If I could I'd just sleep because the waking world isn't worth it.

Ended a relationship of 5 years last year. Still not great. Don't know how to date. Can't even imagine being in love. I feel no desire for other people. I don't even know what I was thinking with that relationship.

Point being: how the fuck do I get help? I went to therapy. I was good for about one day after the sessions. Then I'd go back to how I was. Got on anti-depressants. They worked for about 4 months. Up'ed my dosage. Really not feeling any effects. I didn't think I'd only get a few months out of these stupid pills. Thanks for that brief moment of being "okay", jerks. Now I just have something to compare my shittiness to.

fricking psychiatrists are impossible to get into. They accept almost no insurance. They don't always take new patients. One of the offices I called was only open on Tuesdays. ONE DAY OF THE WEEK? Are you kidding me?! Finally got someone to take me...in a *month.* All their reviews are 1 star horrible. But what else can I do?

Seriously. I'm thinking it would be quicker and easier to just go shoot someone or myself in the leg and start screaming about how the voices told me to do it. That would get me arrested and put in with a psychiatrist, right?
