i will listen to what MC says about this rejection. iwill wait for another 4 months. soooooooo long. i really really hope i things turn out fine. i ohpe. i think i can do it. i tihnk things will get better. why am i being so negative here? i gotta stop. now, becuae my fingers are gieinng tired now. also, why ami starting to lose my american english acceecnt? its weird. i starting to get worse at talking. in the end, being a bad guy or a savage dude is much more fun and morally correct and so much better than being a good/smart/respectful guy. good guys never do well. i need to become a bad/savage/cool dude. its so cool to be one. everything works for you. for years, all i did was work hard and look where i am now. fuck this.
