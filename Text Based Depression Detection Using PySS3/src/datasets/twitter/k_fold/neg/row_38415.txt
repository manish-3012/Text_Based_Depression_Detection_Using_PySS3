"My daughter, was a funny, happy, girl"I can already make out what he will say.

He will cloak the letter with lies. 

Funny, I was funny when I was 7-10.

Happy, I was happy when I was 1 to 6.

"I will never forget you" as he sobs into the mic. 

Yeah, you will never forgot how good of a punching bag I was to you. A dumpster you could let you bad emotions on when the days was hard and unfortunate for you. Your thing. 

Thank you for being a good father.
