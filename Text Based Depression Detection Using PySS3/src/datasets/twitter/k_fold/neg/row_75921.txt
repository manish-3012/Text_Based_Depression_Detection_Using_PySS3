I canâ€™t take it anymore.Half of the people Iâ€™m close to have died from this fucking thing. Everything was cancelled. Everything I worked for. My grandparents and some friends are gone because of this. Iâ€™m too much of a coward to actually kill myself Iâ€™m too weak and fragile minded. If only I could act on my instincts. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Everything is awful. I just wanna feel the nothingness of death. It sounds so peaceful just being nothing. Nothing to be sad about. No way to pity myself. No way to feel anything. Not even existing. If there is a god I wonder if theyâ€™d let me not live eternally. This is it. I need to find a method to kill myself. Maybe dehydration. Maybe I can OD. I donâ€™t know I just want to be free.
