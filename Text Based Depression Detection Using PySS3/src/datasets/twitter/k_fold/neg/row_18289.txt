Is killing myself to spite my dad a fucked up thing to do?I feel like he, my brother, and everyone in my family fucking deserves it. My mom recently died. The person who abused me to no end. So I hope sheâ€™s burning in hell 

Meanwhile my family is crying over her like sheâ€™s a good person. My aunt is a bitch so I donâ€™t talk to her. My dad has his ways but I was always close to him

Till he invalidated me last night 

Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™ve been treated like shit by every family and friend and therapy doesnâ€™t work. So fuck. Iâ€™d like to see my dad see me dead so he can break down and cry. I want him to suffer for how he made me feel.
