Psychiatrist of 4 years had her last session with me last night. "You need more help than I can give you" was her message to me.I think it's finally time for me to check out of this life. 24 years I have struggled through. Not a day went by in my life where I wanted to live. I think I was born without that desire. I fight and I fight for a "future" that I don't even want. These expectations that I have to get a job and make something of myself are just stupid to me. I didn't want to be alive in the first place and now everyone expects that from me and more. I drive therapists mad with my Borderline Personality Disorder. I don't want to get better, so I toy with their minds instead. Eventually the same process repeats itself and they inevitably refer me elsewhere. No one can make me want to live and I'm so damn sick of their attempts to keep me alive. For what? I truly don't see any purpose to me being alive. I haven't accomplished shit in my life. I'm a financial burden to my family and they're tired of it. They can sell what I have to pay for my death if money means that much to them. I just don't care.

I planned my suicide last night in bed. Now all that is left is to cut ties with those who are still in my life to try and reduce the emotional damage. I'm a sucker for not hurting others so I can't see me killing myself without at least making an effort to ease some of the pain. I think if I go where my body won't be found for a long time, less will be thought about me. Hell, I just don't think its possible to not hurt people. What a shitty excuse for keeping me alive. People can't handle their feelings being hurt? THAT'S WHY I SUFFER? It isn't fair. I hurt every day. This is my mind every day. Well I have had enough of it. I'm ready to die. I just needed someone to hear this first because no one in my life seems to comprehend it.
