What do you guys do after talking to a hotline?I just spent about 2 hours on a hotline talking to somebody. She was nice and I felt like she was mostly listening to me and wanted to help but the scope of my issues is just too wide for any one conversation to make a dent. Ive seen this sentiment shared here before so Im hoping someone else might understand.

I contact hotlines when things get rough so I can be physically occupied for a bit and talk about how i feel without bothering the people in my life who are just as burnt out and scared and confused by my problems as I am. So I dont think my expectations are too high or anything. I dont expect to be fixed or helped or understood, just acknowledged. And I usually get that and it usually calms me down. I just feel so awful once it's over! Its a different awful than I start with (loud, active despair vs. low-energy resignation and hopelessness) but the intensity is comparable. Sometimes I feel guilty for taking up so much of the volunteer's time when I know they cant "help" me as much as they could help someone whose issues are less all-encompassing and life-destroying. Other times I feel ashamed when I notice the other person trying to end the conversation and I get clingy and resist because I just dont want to be alone again.

Has anyone else felt like this? Should I stop calling if it's making me feel this way even though I have no other way to reach out and get a live response? What do you do after you hang up if you still feel miserable? Not in a "crisis hotlines are useless and ineffective" kind of way but more like "okay, im alone again and still just as sick and damaged and afraid as before, what now?" Am I being dumb and weak for even thinking about this? Should I even bother trying so hard to stay alive if it's this complicated and there are so few resources out there for people as sick as I am?
