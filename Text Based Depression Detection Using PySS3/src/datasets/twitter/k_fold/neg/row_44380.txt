I'd like to kill myselfI don't really know where to start but I really need to write about this because I got nobody to talk to. 
So I've started going to parties when I turned 16 and I was really enjoying it.
So i had a group of friends that I'd go party with. Boys started taking an interest in me and I thought: Yeah, I'm quite pretty and I like the attention. I can't lie - I liked it when boys saw me and found me pretty. So yeah, i felt good, cause I've never found myself beautiful or worthy of love and even when anyone would touch me inappropriately against my will I would always think: That's how they show you love. You are NOW worthy. But afterwards I feel even more worthless. I have issues and I don't know how to deal with this myself. I get seen as an object and that's how i get this feeling of being worth something. And I know that it is wrong but I don't really know what love even feels like. I don't even know if i want to experience love anyways. My life has really been a shitshow and I have too many problems in my private life with my "family" and I can't even try to be positive about it. I just can't deal with all of this shit anymore.

I just had to get this off my chest. What the fuck is wrong with me?
