Can't accept being too old for children's mental health services. Its not a big deal to most, but I am considering suicide.I just had my 17th birthday 3 days ago and I am now officially too old for children's mental health services in my area. All of the inpatient psychiatric facilities accept children up to 16 years of age and the children's hospitals advise you to stop seeking mental health care at their facilities once you turn 17(although for every other problem *except* mental health, they treat you until you are 18. WHY!?) 

This is not a big deal for most people, but after I turned 14, I have spent a huge part of my time in hospitals due to mental illness. The facilities were always very family oriented and youth friendly. Lots of activities, fun color schemes and lots of outdoor time. We got to help make our own meals and were taught quite a few different life skills. I have stayed in hospital 6 times. 

I am not an adult. In fact, mentally I am not even 17. I am immature and I have  meltdowns and arguments over petty things(Probably due to my mental illness, although to most people it would look like a pathetic teenager) 

I had the "delight" of meeting a couple of adult psychiatrists and social workers a while back and it has scared me for life. They treated me very bluntly and seemed to be in a hurry, they asked me what *I* wanted to do, whereas the child workers always made suggestions and asked me which sounded best. I have been told by a counsellor a lot of children grow up and get lost in the system  because they go from a family oriented togetherness environment, to an independent on your own environment.   

I don't believe I can do this. I don't want to be an adult and I don't want to be treated as one. I am considering suicide because of this.
