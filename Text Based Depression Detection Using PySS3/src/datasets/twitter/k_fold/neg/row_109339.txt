still searching for options and methodsI turned 16 years old this year. I have been fantasizing about suicide ever since I was six years old.

I've been quietly reading almost every text on this subreddit for a while because it makes me feel less alone and diving into the worries of other people makes me forget for a while but lately I have just been extremely angry. I'm extremely close to dropping out of school and the knowledge that my time is limited is excruciating. I know I'm still young but it is probably more optimal to end it as fast as possible so I would affect far less people as if I were to further force myself to stay alive. I used to blame myself but now I am just angry at everyone else. I am so so sorry to everyone considering suicide, I am so sorry that this world has failed you to the point where you want to end your own life because your pain must be so awful and still unrecognized. I used to be so ashamed that I've not yet found a passion or that I am failing to contribute to society but now I realise society has failed me all along and it would be pointless to try and be a functioning member as I would just end up another meaningless part of a gigantic machine.

Finding quick options to finally kill myself has been difficult due to me being a minor with absolutely no money. Weapons and strong medication of any sort are off the list as I live in Germany. The mental health system here is still a fucking disaster and is basically just designed to force you to stay alive and "functioning". Funny how this place is supposed to be such an amazing utopia and yet everything is still built off of the exploitation of the less privileged. Thanks for reading all the way I'm sorry if this made you cringe. I'm not very smart even if I would like to be. Not proof reading this btw haha so it might be terrible
