A month after the attemptso,, i attempted to kill myself a month ago. i ended up backing out and going to the hospital, then was placed in a psych ward for a few days. after going to a new psychiatrist and continuing to see my therapist, iâ€™ve had a lot less suicidal thoughts and i feel like i can finally breathe again. looking back iâ€™m so so so glad i didnâ€™t succeed. i came out to my parents shortly after and weâ€™re working on at the very least having me socially transition. as for therapy weâ€™ve worked on a lot of my self worth issues and even though i still struggle with my image and just how i think of myself in general, i can really see the improvement. iâ€™m proud iâ€™ve come even this far in the past month.
tl;dr: please hang in there. thereâ€™s a lot to look forward to, and depression often clouds your sight for those things. youâ€™ve got this.
