Psychiatric hospital?I'll skip the details but let's just say I'm not good and I haven't been for a long time. I've reached out to my family and a close friend for serious advice and it seems like I should probably just go to the hospital for a while. I'm pretty skeptical about it to be honest but I feel like my options are limited.

I don't have a driver's license or a car and I also don't have health insurance. Im currently living alone in a state far away from my family
so I guess what I'm asking is, is this actually a good idea or am I making a mistake?

I've heard that hospitals for the mentally ill are basically like prisons and that they force you to be around other patients. I don't work well in any social setting at all. Maybe this could lead to real consequences.

Should I check myself in?
