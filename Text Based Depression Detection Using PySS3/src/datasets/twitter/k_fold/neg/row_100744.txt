I've seen human kindness but never experienced it. I envy it. I'm dirt. I'm going to walk my town one last time in search of a stranger's smile. If no one smiles I'm going to go home and rid myself. I see no point anyway.I've been treated like trash all of my life by people I know and by strangers.  I'm alone in a town of a million people yet could scream without a sound.  I do no care any more
