Suicidal but scared to dieFucked up right? How can I be suicidal but scared to die? I donâ€™t get it. I fucking lust over the idea of dying. It gives me a sigh of relief every time I think about it. It makes me feel better, but Iâ€™m scared to do it. Iâ€™m scared to die because what if it actually does get better like everyone says and i miss out on it. I constantly feel like a whole ass idiot because of how badly I want to die because I might miss out on the good shit if I do and thatâ€™s all I want... I want the good shit dude. 
Iâ€™ve been stock piling my zoloft for 4 months. 120 pills... just in case. 
I mean shit i held a gun to my head recently and I sighed because I knew all I had to do was pull the trigger. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s all I had to do and it would be over. 
But Iâ€™m SCARED. 
I feel so stupid &amp; tbh idk why Iâ€™m even posting this... Iâ€™m just so fucking over it all man. 
Why canâ€™t I be normal for one fucking day.
