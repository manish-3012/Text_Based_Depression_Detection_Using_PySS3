Vent.I wish I could've done something with myself like become stronger and stop myself becoming a problem. I wish I could've done alot of stuff but now im here contemplating if I should end it all so I have nothing to lose now then later, and I know my family would be sad but they already talk about me behind my back about how much of a pain i am, and there is no way I am going to let them know about how I feel on the inside right now. Im at my breaking point and all I wish for is to be left alone to perish, I know it's selfish but I never asked to be here in the first place.
