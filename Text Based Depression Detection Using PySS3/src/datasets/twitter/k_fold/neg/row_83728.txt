It feels like suicide?Trigger warning- I briefly discussed my attempt (no details though)


I tried overdosing last year(obviously failed) and sometimes the taste,smell,and feeling of it just comes back randomly. It tastes like pills, smells like sickness, and feels like suicide. Theres no other way for me to describe it. Does anyone else get like this? It comes at random times and kinda breaks me a little bit.

I know this isnt the right thing to post on but I didnt know where else to ask. (If it's bad that I asked this here i'll take it down sorry, thanks in advance)
