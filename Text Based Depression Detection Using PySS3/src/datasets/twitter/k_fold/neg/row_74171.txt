Anyone else notice an uptick in your ideations when... (suicide science to investigate?)...you inhale burned things? 

Feel free to just stop here and comment with YES or NO 

If you have it in you to keep reading, here goes: I'm struggling again but I know it's related to my time in the hospital last year and my ability to maintain my food and meds now.
So I decided I'd post here and see if anyone could help me out or give citizen scientists some data

Im not sure if I posted this here yet or not but I made a crazy important discovery thanks to an overheated oil vape that had turned black (a cheap charger overloaded batt so it was overheating the oil) a few months ago and that I rediscovered recently. 

** I think carcinogens or cumbusted/burned particles SIGNIFICANTLY increase my ideations. **

I believe this for several reasons:
- inhaling this black vape cartridge made me suicidal within minutes. From inside my head it felt like ages in reality it was less than 15 minutes (I looked at the clock because I was aware it might alter my thinking negatively)
-  the first time my ideations prompted a hospital visit, I had recently begun smoking cigarettes daily  at the time I chalked it up to effexor and now I believe it was likely the combination 
- I now live directly on a downtown road, far too close to an oil refinery, and the air filters in my unit are black in about 3 months. My ideations have been almost nonstop since I moved in. The building is also full of mold that could be a/nother factor. 
- I'm an artist and for a project I spent some time turning store reciept paper black with a candle in an unventilated room. I didn't know it at the time, but iirc now reciept paper is highly carcinogenic and obviously candles are combusted. My ideations at this time again noticeably spiked. 


I've discovered that a certain difference in the hz between two speakers also improves my mood (I have no idea how. I think it simulates an exhilarating experience somehow) so this might just be MY weird brain, but keep an eye on it yourselves and see if you notice that having the window down in gridlock, campfires, etc significantly increase your ideations at all. 
And stay as safe as you're all able on this rock full of both wily and uneducated animals.
