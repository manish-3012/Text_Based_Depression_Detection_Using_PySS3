IssuesI just had another thought entering my mind that made me depressed all over again. This happens constantly. My parents also said the donâ€™t believe in me in being successful which made me disappointed and depressed with my life wondering what am I doing here. I wonder why I even try hiding all the pain with my smile. IT HURTS TO SMILE. Then thereâ€™s school that forces stress and anxiety way too much as if I needed more anxiety. Iâ€™m starting not to care about what I do and just do whatever I want health wise. Iâ€™m doing dangerous things and saying fuck it if I die I die. The amount of things Iâ€™m going through is too much. I now Iâ€™m lonely as well and that I will be forever alone so I try to be as anti social as possible and listen to my music all day. Iâ€™m going to die lonely and anonymous. Plus whatâ€™s the point of making the most out of life. When we die are we going to carry those memories over....no we wonâ€™t so why even try.
