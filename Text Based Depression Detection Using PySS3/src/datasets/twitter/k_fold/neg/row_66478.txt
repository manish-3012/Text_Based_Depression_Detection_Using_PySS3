I feel lost.I'm failing pretty much every class in university, mostly because I just don't know how to sit down for a couple of hours a day and study for my classes, which probably stems from me never actually having to study during my previous school years where I just absorbed everything that was taught in the classes straight away. I'm worried that if I drop out of university I'll just become a bum because I have no other skills (I study computer science and mostly went to university because I always figured I'd do *some computer* job as an adult since I didn't excel at anything else besides being *the computer guy* for my friends and family), I don't have the necessary language skills for a retail job, not to mention that I'm pretty much the equivalent of a retarded chimp when it comes to anything that requires being social.
  
I just don't know, I'm uncertain about my future and am thinking about just buying a couple of cases of energy drinks and stay up for as long as I can and get a heart attack or something because for some reason I don't want to be remembered as 'Taskunuga? Oh yeah the guy who killed himself?' even though I probably wouldn't really care when I'm dead.
  
Even rereading this makes me just want to end it because the way I've expressed myself just makes me cringe even though this is the fourth time I've rewritten this, but fuck it, I know I can't do it in a better way.
