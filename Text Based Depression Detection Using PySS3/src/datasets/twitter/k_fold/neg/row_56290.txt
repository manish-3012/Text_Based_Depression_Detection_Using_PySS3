Why not?Ive never used reddit idk if Iâ€™m doing this right 

Yesterday a community Iâ€™m in ganged up on one kid with screen shots that made him seem racist. Idk if theyâ€™re real but I wanted to say that we should wait until thereâ€™s more than just blurry screenshots, and over the next hour I horn 80+ notifications, some reasonable, many calling me an aid to racism, defending and condoning racism, and no one would listen to me. People that Iâ€™ve been friends with for years have no ostracized me and decided that since they think Iâ€™m defending racism Iâ€™m a garbage person, and canâ€™t be their friends. 

This combined with a plethora of other things is pushing me towards the edge. I donâ€™t want to die, but itâ€™s apparent nobody wants me to live. If I didnâ€™t want to leave my family with my $6,000~ in debt, I wouldnâ€™t hesitate to hang myself to better all of their lives.
