My hormones fuck me and I hate itIâ€™m just really sick and tired of this shit

Iâ€™m not committing suicide in the near future tho, I donâ€™t think I can stand getting fucked by this hormonal shitshow more than 10 years from now.

Like, I have a few hobbies that Iâ€™m passionate about, take proper medication, and seek help if needed but it never fucking gets any better. I know this is an absolutely hormonal issue and it makes me even more upset. Iâ€™m doing my best to stabilize my hormones but fuck it doesnâ€™t work, itâ€™s been almost 5 years. Iâ€™m fed up.

I donâ€™t know when exactly I will lose my mind, but well I wish my brain starts working very well in 10 years or I will lose it and fucking kill myself haha
