I don't know why i feel so shitIf youre ceebs reading this plz just help me solve this acronym relating to love: pcmbls

My life is pretty good if you look at it from the outside. I'm still in highschool and I'm at the top class for maths and science and average for english. I also am in a relationship as well. However this relationship is what really fucks me up. I love my girlfriend alot, and she claims that 2. But i seem to have this kind of bipolar personality and whenever i dont get a love message one day, my mind becomes extremely  negative. Like the mini angel and mini devil you see in movies , but only now its only the devil. I know that its really selfish of me to think like that , and i know that she cant send me a love message every night, but that's what im trying to break out of. 

A bit of context b4 i get to the next part. Btoh of us usually send acronyms b4 we say goodnight to each other. For example iwtmy would be i want to marry you. We've been doing that for a while now but now suddenly last night she sent me another one saying pcmbls. I couldn't find out what it was so i asked her but she said it was really selfish. Usually,  when both of us kept nagging about things out of curiosity we usually spill the beans. This time tho, no matter how many times i said plz, she refused. It would be a massive help if someone would help me solve it.

Theres probably some other subreddit 4 this but since I've literally felt suicidal for a while now, i figured i would ask here. Also sorry if i ranted 2 much about my gf, i just really love her.
