My story isn't as important as other people's here but here I go..First time sharing my story on here and my main account, so I'm a bit nervous. I have lived a semi-decent life so far so I wouldn't complain about school, family. But with relationships it was another story entirely.

There was a girl I hung out with from middle school to high school where I am now that I eventually saw ax more then just my best friend. I started to tell her my feelings and then at first she would let me down with a silly comment like how we are just best friends and that's all, but after awhile it tore at me and bothered me how she didn't love me even though I wasted so many hours of my free time all throughout middle school trying to get to know her more... To shorten up what I have to say she never truly loved me as more then a friend and ever since it has destoryed me to the point of extreme depression, anxiety and a great big hate for myself because she didn't want to date me. 

I really want to end it all. To finally kill myself but for some reason I keep telling myself she will love me, and it's always followed by waves of depression and loneliness. I don't know how to cope with it anymore and it tears at me every day, more and more.
