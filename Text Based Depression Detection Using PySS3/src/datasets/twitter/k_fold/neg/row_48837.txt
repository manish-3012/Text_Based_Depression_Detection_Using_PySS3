Teetering on crisisYeah feeling pretty close right now and it's fucking horrifying. The fact I've attempted before makes it that bit more scary as I know exactly where I went wrong and how to suicide effectively.....
I need something to help me deal with just this moment, I know if I can make it past these feelings right now I'll be able to get back to a stable mood.

What's a great way to get past crisis point when you're almost there?
