what defines an attempt?I think maybe I've attempted a few times, but it makes me feel really fake to say that because I'm not sure. but at the same time I feel like I'm faking all the issues I probably have, so.  

is there anything specific that classifies a suicide attempt as being such? or is it just doing something with the intent of dying?
