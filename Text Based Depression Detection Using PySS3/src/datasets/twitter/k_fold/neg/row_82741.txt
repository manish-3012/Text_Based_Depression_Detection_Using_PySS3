Some Advice?I need to start right off the bat. I've been feeling worthless the last couple of days and I talk to people who want to help me and they talk to me about keep going, and I really appreciate what they do for me, but I feel that I ignore their advice and I lock myself inside my head. I just refuse to listen sometimes and I don't mean to, I try to do what they tell me because I know sometimes I don't do what I need to do and when I don't do it, I feel worthless because I know that I'm throwing my life away because I'm selfish and I want attention and I don't want to crave for attention and complain about it. I just want to stop being selfish. And it's all because I know what I need to do and dont do it and it makes me want to beat myself in the head. And sometimes I wonder if it would be better if I died, and I also don't want to die because I feel like a coward. I know that it's my first time asking strangers on the internet, so I'm taking a chance, but at least I need to hear other voices from the outside.
