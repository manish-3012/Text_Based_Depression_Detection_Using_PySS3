Nobodies and nothingsall the words in the world and insane and inane writings dont mean anything, in comparison to getting the shit beat out of you or success by a heroic person that you toy with. 

If I were to meet either this ego maniacle person, taunting my name, or anybody, truly wishing to play with me, I will surely react, and probably go to prison for a long time.
.....
im hearing things, on peoples lips, and on the wind. 
i have to do something...
But what
I suppose I'll do whatever it takes to set things right.. 
I am a good person. And ive strived my whole life to be someone that negates the despotic, and rides the fires of hell with a glint in my eye and a bite to my teeth.

oh what you have done to me

i am lost. and i am not dead. and if you can, you must do something to make it right, or i can do nothing else
but do something
i fear this thing for it is against my deepest prayer if i still even could pray
