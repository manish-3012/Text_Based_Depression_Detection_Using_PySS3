"Love" is the only hopeSo I came to the realization that the idea of love is something that keeps us alive. I went online to this old profile I had on OkCupid and someone sent me a message. It was like I met my mirror image...someone who understands everything that I think and feel...it's strange because I allowed myself to fantasize about this spark. Of course I came back down to reality. Relationships are not perfect, they're messy and most often than not painful. But for a day I let myself dream of what lofe would be like with someone who has no expectations and who loves you unconditionally. Essentially by allowing the thought of love come into my mind, hope shortly followed suit. Hope is all we have in the end.
