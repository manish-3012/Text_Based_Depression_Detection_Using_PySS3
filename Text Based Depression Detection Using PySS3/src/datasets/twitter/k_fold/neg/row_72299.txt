I tried so hardI tried so hard I came back home and it was going so well I wondered what I was so afraid of what I was running away from? the only thing causing me unhappiness in my life was my family and I wanted to try so desperately to amend it without my sister here we just feel so broken and then my second oldest sister has been so cruel and negative the whole time sheâ€™s been here like always she beated me up throughout my childhood but I even came into terms of forgiveness for that and then I hear from my youngest sister she said to her â€œI hate everyone sometimes I even hate you sometimes but I like you sometimes tooâ€ who even says that? So today I brought it up to her, I didnâ€™t want her relationship to become like what it is between me and Mary and as soon as I start talking she becomes so offensive and loud this is how sheâ€™s always played and because my culture is big on respect for elders, as soon as this happens my parents step in to shout at me say I cause so much trouble this life is just so ridiculous sometimes it astounds me and I tried to calmly ask my mum why do you always attack me and she says â€œyou good for nothing why did you come back here just to cause argument you do nothing you useless your useless lifeâ€ I can only laugh my dad hearing this asks why Iâ€™m causing trouble again. 
Iâ€™m trying so hard and they donâ€™t even see sometimes I really think maybe itâ€™d just be better for me to die who am I even trying for what am I even trying for

I told them I yelled I raised so much money for charity did you guys even know did you even see why do you always say this to me donâ€™t you see how hard Iâ€™m trying
Mum says I told you not to leave to live in London 

Living alone in London was the freest I felt the only unhappiness I felt was that caused by my family

Iâ€™m sitting here crying alone in my room with not a person to talk to

Wishing my sister was here

I wanted to stay another week to be with my little sister but I think this time Iâ€™ll leave and not look back
