Life isn't fair and I'm sick of itI always get the short end of the stick. Always. People can treat me like trash but when I stand up for myself I get blamed. I'm sick of it.

I was faced with blatant racial discrimination and no one cared. Like always. 

What's the point of living in this world? Tell me?
