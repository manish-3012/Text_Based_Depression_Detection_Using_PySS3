I give up.I don't care whether anyone sees this or not, I'm just using it to vent how I feel right now.

I'm tired of living. I'm sick of the person I am, the people I am surrounded with, and the life that I am currently living. I am not happy, and I wouldn't be surprised if I never found that happiness. I always thought that I would have ended my life by now, but honestly I have surprised myself that I am still around. I have no ambition, and my family is constantly disappointed in me. No matter what I do, I constantly get backlash and negativity and it makes me feel like no matter what I do, I'll never be able to please everyone. It is depressing to see that the things that I do to try to make myself happy is constantly looked down on, or isn't understood/appreciated by other people. Even something simple as being supportive would help me immensely, but I have never gotten any positive affirmation in anything that I do.

I have always been envious of everyone around me. All of my friends have a set direction in life and are content with the way their life is headed. I keep wondering "what am I doing wrong? How come I can't have the same stability and direction in my life?" I'm so exhausted of the constant disappointment I feel in myself, and just because I am constantly stuck in this cycle of hating myself, I don't think that I will ever get out of it.

I'm so done, I just want this pain to be over with. I want to be free of my own self, I rather be nothing than exist as the person that I am.
