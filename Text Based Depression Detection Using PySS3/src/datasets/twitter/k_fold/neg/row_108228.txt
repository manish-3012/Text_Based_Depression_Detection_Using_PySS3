I once wrote here - I'm turning things around todayA long time I wrote here (might have been a dif account) about my struggles. In the end, I did come to a point where I was about to kill myself. I managed to call an ambulance before I was able to hurt myself luckily. It has been a struggle ever since, but I'm on the right path. In the coming weeks I'm getting an intake for a more intensive therapy and I've contacted University to pick up where I left off 3 years ago and finish my education. 



Thanks for listening back then and the responses. 


As for everyone who is struggling, it's a long road ahead but that road is definitly worth taking. Even in that darkest hour, people care for you even if they do not know how to express it to you. Keep believing in yourself and others around you.
