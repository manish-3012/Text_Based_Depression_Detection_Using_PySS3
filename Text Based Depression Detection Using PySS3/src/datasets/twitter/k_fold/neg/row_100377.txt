I don't know what will helpI've been depressed/suicidal since the age of 15 (I'm 24 now). I feel as though the only times I am somewhat happy is when I'm dating or with someone. That appears to be the only time I feel motivated to do for myself and feel okay instead of sprialing back down. Recently, my boyfriend and I broke up. We were together for almost 6 years and I still love him. It hurts me insanely everyday. I feel so alone. I don't have any friends really that I can turn to and I feel like my life is falling apart. I don't want to end up hurting my family if I attempt, but I feel so lost...
