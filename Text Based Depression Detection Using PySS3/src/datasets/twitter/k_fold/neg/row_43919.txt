My brother hates me and my family is on his sideMy brother is angry at me and told me he hates me (because I told him to stop yelling when he lost an online match).  I'm 18, he's 15.  I've been depressed recently because of the quarantine.  My mom took my side, and my dad took his.  Now.my whole family is fighting and it's all my fault.  My brother just sent me this on snap: "You know, we've been tolerating your bitching for hours upon hours these last few weeks. We're pretty patient with you about it. But you need to listen to it for 15 minutes and you cant take it anymore. Fucking hilarious you fucking hypocrite. Next time you're annoyed at something and venting. I'll tell you to shut the fuck up. See how you like it."

Should I just do everyone a favor and kill myself?  I hate fights
