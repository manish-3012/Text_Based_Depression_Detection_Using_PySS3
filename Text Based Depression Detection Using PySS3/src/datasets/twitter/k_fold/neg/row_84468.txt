I am the kid that tries to join your friend group but fails. I am the kid that canâ€™t take a hint. I am the kid that no one likes. I am the weird kid. I want to die.So I have always been that weird kid who kinda tries to join a friend group and they hint they donâ€™t like you but your motivated to join anyways. Iâ€™m super weird. Everyone thinks Iâ€™m annoying. And it goes much deeper than that. Yes. There are some parts of my life such as family that Iâ€™m lucky for. But I just wish I was with different people. I want to die. Why was I put on this world if my only purpose was to be called names, bullied, have no friends, and be the most annoying person on planet earth. Why did they do this. Please help me.
