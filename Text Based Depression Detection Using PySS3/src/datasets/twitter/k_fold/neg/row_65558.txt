Post-grad depressedI went to art school because it was my passion and it was the only thing that kept me in school. But now Im out and the lack of jobs coupled with the debt is going to be the end of me. 

I only work a part time job due to mental health issues, and I really enjoy my job right now. But my payments to debt are slowly approaching and I have no real way to take care of it. My moms offering to help out a bit (so long as I pay her back) but the feeling of being a burden on anyone, let alone my mom (again) doesnâ€™t exactly sit well with me.

Iâ€™m kicking myself for art school (animation major) because its not practical and it was so expensive but I loved what I was doing there. I canâ€™t imagine myself doing anything else. But getting work in that field (any field really) is so hard. A part of me I wish I sucked it up and did something practical like a teacher or a I.T. worker, but I know for a fact Iâ€™d have ended at this exact spot either way. 

I have plans, I know what I need to do to off and have access to the stuff to off myself with, but Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m not scared to die, Iâ€™m afraid of what its going to do to the people I love. Otherwise Iâ€™d be gone by now.

I just feel trapped. Sorry if any of this sounds complain-y. Thanks for reading.
