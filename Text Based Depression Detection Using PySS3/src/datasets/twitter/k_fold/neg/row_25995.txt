Done.I am so tired of waking up, i wake up in pain and i just want to leave this world. I have fucked up everything in my life, lost all of my friends, my family hates me, drove my fiance off.. and everything will get worse. I have dealt with being suicidal before, friends helped me out but now they are gone. I don't even want to fix things anymore. 

What is the point it will always get worse. tired of climbing out of a hole to just fall right back into a new one i must climb out of. I won't be missed. I have my plans set, everything is ready just waiting until my room mate goes to work. i just hope i can finally end it this time. want to finally be done with this pathetic life of mine.
