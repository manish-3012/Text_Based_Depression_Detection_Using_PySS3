i dont know what to do.im depressed, my meds dont do anything, and i dont know whats left for me. 
my boyfriend got me to stop self harming, but i want to all the time. scratching, cutting, anything. i want to so much. 
i cant tell my therapist about this though, because im only 15 and she would legally need to tell my parents. 

my boyfriend trys to help, but its hard for me to tell him this stuff, because i dont want him to be upset. 
he knows how i feel right now. 

im not sure what to do. i just feel so fucked up, like theres nothing else for me. im just done.
