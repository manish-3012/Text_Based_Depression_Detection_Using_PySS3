Thoughts of jumping.Even though I am not feeling as suicidal as I once was a couple of years ago I canâ€™t help but feel compelled to make plans and sometimes I zone out and be like â€œyou know that bridge I am thinking about in the city would be easy to jump off of like the barrier on it is kinda short and I could just climb over it.â€ But the only thing stopping me is actually going there - the travel time and having my brain committing to it. Like if I was instantly transported to a location where Iâ€™d want to do it I wouldnâ€™t hesitate to jump over because my brain wouldnâ€™t have any time to reason with itself and I wish I could do that. 
I feel lucky that I donâ€™t have easy access to things like guns in my country otherwise I would be long gone and things in my life feel like they are going fine despite the everlasting depression (like I have a mostly alright family/friends and a new boyfriend) however I canâ€™t help but feel these intrusive thoughts that I canâ€™t shake.
