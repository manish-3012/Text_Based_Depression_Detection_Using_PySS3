Been depressed before this feels differentIâ€™ve suffered with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager but the way I feel lately is much different. Whereas before I was all alone and very sad about that Iâ€™m now in the opposite position of feeling trapped in a bad relationship and that there is no way out. I think my current situation is worse because before I would just sleep a lot or find things to do by myself when I felt bad but now I have actual responsibilities and donâ€™t have a place to escape to when I need it.
