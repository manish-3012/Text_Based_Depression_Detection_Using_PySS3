SuicideWhen I see that word, I think of that feeling when you cross the finish line at a race. After you cross it, you feel relieved it's over. I want to feel this feeling of relief, but I can't because I don't have the courage to commit suicide. I wish I did...I wish I did. It's been 6 months now...Depression, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, sadness, loneliness...My parents still don't know...I don't take any meds...Nobody knows except me and it's hard...
