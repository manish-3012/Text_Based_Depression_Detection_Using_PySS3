i dont even know what im trying to achieve hereI posted 2 or 3 times in subreddits like this before. In the most recent one i actually tried to say goodbye ( to people i dont know, i guess i wanted to tell somebody at least)and end my life afterwards.
I have told the story of my depression in those posts before. I tried to end my life after the last post and woke up in my own vomit. I did not succeed, tho im not sure if i even tried honestly.
Im scared to try again and hate myself even more because i cant even kill myself without crying for attention on reddit. I am crying for attention here, i cant irl. I cant open up to people i know in personal i try to hide my depression.
Trying to hide my depression actually sometimes distracts me from my depression but as soon as im alone i drop into a hole again.
It feels like every meaning of existing is being sucked away from me.
I dont cry everyday or something like that, its just a feeling of not wanting to be alive.
Sometimes i desire to disappear.
I dont know what im supposed to do and so i post here seeking attention.
I know it wont help longterm but i really need to telll somebody.
I feel pathetic for this text but i somehow have to write it.

Sorry for this unstructured text.
