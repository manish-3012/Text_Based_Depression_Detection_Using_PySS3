more shit...I'm taking meds now, I've been feeling guilty, I'm forgetting stuff lately, i think I've developed a caffeine addiction, like I'm basically living off Red Bull, i just cried my eyes out, i need don't even enjoy playing video games anymore.

i cant keep going like this, my day consist on listening to music while over-analyzing the cracks on the fucking ceiling.

i think might be having an identity crisis, i am not who everyone thinks i am, and this is killing my will to live, i hate myself, i hate who i pretend to be, i hate everyone who thinks they know me.

i'm not the happy kid they think i am, I'm fucking depressed, but no one gives a single shit about the "funny" dude who bullies other socially awkward kids to feel better about his regrettable life choices and pathetic existence.

i sleep less than 18 hours, weekly.

fun fact: i tried killing myself inhaling spray paint, my parents found an unconscious (and naked) teen in the bath tub, the whole bathroom smelled like vomit. until this day they think i was trying to get high.

^(hope you rejoice on my poorly structured  "draft" about me bitching about my depression.)
