I feel like I have nobodyI'm feeling more upset about everything and hopeless each day, and I feel there's nobody I can turn to. I no longer have friends due to isolating myself, and I sit alone with my thoughts, which can't be good. 

I sometimes feel insanely happy, and lucky to be alive, but that feeling has been withering away slowly, and I hardly experience that now. Only a few select things have prevented me from attempting I think, I'm not sure. I think I have the fear of missing out. 

I've been struggling with these thoughts and feelings I don't know who I truly am anymore. I wake up, go to school, go home, do homework, go to sleep. Wake up, go to school, go home, do homework, go to sleep. It's a loop that I feel suffocates me more and more each day.

Who can I turn to when I'm feeling this way? The feeling of having nobody in my corner is in turn forcing me to back up into that empty corner. I'm losing willpower, and I don't know where to get help.
