I want to die but I can't find the courage toI want to find the courage to die, but I can't find it. As much as I hate living I can't bring myself to die because I know it will most likely be an excruciating and painful death and I'm scared. On one hand I think I don't care how much it hurts as long as I'm dead by the end of it, but whenever I actually try I can't bring myself to do it. I'm probably going to try again today but I won't accomplish anything.
