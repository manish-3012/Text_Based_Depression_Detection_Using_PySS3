I cant get over her, i just want to dieI am a 17 year old male,  leaving in greece. I had been dating a lovely girl for 1 year and 4 months ago broke up. I knew her from kindergarden. We were both each others crush from a young age, and always competed. We are both very good at marhs, and we often went to tournaments and such. This was in the elementary school. In junior highschool, we kind of seperated (i went to a private school for one year) and at the second year, we were again toghether. Nothing happened. This brings me to the start of the story. We got together instantly, both being amazed by the other. It was so beautyfull. I really cared (still cares) about her, helping her every move and constantly taking care. She was also very nice to me, with many surprises and gifts i still have. Things got more serious with time, even aproaching you know what, with many intimate and passionate moments. But after a year, things have fallen appart. For the last 4 to 5 months, i have been extremly misserable. I constanlty want to die, i dont want this anymore. I miss her sooo much. Every night i dream of her, not in a sexual way, but more of a romantic one. I just want relieve the memories. I want her, not this. Everytime i think of her i break down in tears, and lose my mind. And with all the pandemic happening i am extremly scared for her, since she has an underlying family dessease. I have called her many times to check, but she neither replies, nor answers the phone. I have spoken to my mother about this (she is a psycitrist and psycologist), followed her advices, but things are only getting worse, please help me
