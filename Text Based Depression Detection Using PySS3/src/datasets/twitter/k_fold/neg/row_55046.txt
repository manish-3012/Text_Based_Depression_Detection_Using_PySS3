Cutting feels so good sometimesI'm a wreck. I have no self esteem. I'm going nowhere and doing nothing in life it seems. My relationship is a mess because of things we've been through and what she has done most recently. 

But cutting my arms? Stings a bit. But do I ever feel a calming breeze at the end of a wind tunnel when I can feel the blood slowly roll down my arms. 

One of these days I'm not gonna be such a pussy and get it close to the vein. One of these days it's gonna be a deeper and longer cut so I will calm down again. I can't take the waves of emotions. 

It's like a duality relationship. Crying doesn't make me feel good. Cutting doesn't make me feel good. But when it's both? It's like I can see the light after that.
