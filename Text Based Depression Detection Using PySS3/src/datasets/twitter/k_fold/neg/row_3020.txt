Suicide seems like the way outIf I'm being frank I don't seem like the person that would commit suicide but if you gave me a rope I would probably hang myself from it right this moment , life is a gift they say from god or whatever but what kind of gift is this ? This is like a fucking punishment and it's not fair as people around me don't have the same problems as me and they live healthy lives with amazing parents and everyone loves them , it's amazing how my parents are annoying and not so supportive of anything I want to do. It's awful how I can only do certain things and all. It's all fucking bs,  I hate some OF my friends as they don't understand me , but you know what I hate the most ?high school , how cliche but trust me I have my reasons to hate this God for Saken place , I had my fare share of awful moments . And those have just broken me down and I want to start fucking ruining everything and then swallowing some pills ; or else I'll just hurt someone really fuxking bad... I have an exam tommorow that I didn't prepare for and I hate my life . I don't have any fucking energy to prepare and at this point I'm crying my fucking eyes out. i need someone here for me in rl and i have noone , absolutely noone and I feel like I'll hurt myself ... or someone...
