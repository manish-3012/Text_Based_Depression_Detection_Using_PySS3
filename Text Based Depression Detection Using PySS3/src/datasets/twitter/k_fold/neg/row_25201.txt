I want to kill myself againOk first off in a nutshell I have two Reddit accounts (when maybe I shouldn't) u/MaybePunk because I planned to use this one to create a subreddit and possibly tell my friends about it so they wouldn't be able to read all of my suicidal posts on my other Reddit... But now I realise that I've just created an inconvenience for myself. 
Ok TL;DR go to u/MaybePunk to read my post history if you want some background info.

I've been suicidal for over 2 years and I've just hit one of those "I thought I was finally getting better but I guess not" for like the 3rd time... 

Life seems shitty, death seems shittier but I just can't do this anymore. I can't.
