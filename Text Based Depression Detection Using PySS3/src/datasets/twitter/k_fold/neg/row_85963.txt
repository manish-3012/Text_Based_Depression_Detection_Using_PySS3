I dont want to waste peoples time anymoreI wish i was never born. Ive fucked up so badly so often it feels like all ive ever done was waste peoples time and ruin their day.

I wish i could say i feel like this bec im abused or whatever but my family is alright. Theyre not perfect, far from it, but im so lucky to have them anyway. My best friend is the kindest, sweetest person ive ever met and all of my other friends are just great, lively people.

I feel like im dragging them all down.

My mom would never admit it, but her life went to the shitter when she had me. A promising engineer that just got shot down because of an unplanned pregnancy that tied her up with a shithole of a husband.

She works so hard to support my stupid jobless ass and all she asks is for me to find a job with medical benefits but i cant even do that because im too stupid and hardheaded to land a job at a place big enough to afford that kind of support.

My friends are always so kind but everyone knows im the dumbest of the bunch. The ugliest and whiniest too. I never do anything right and my luck is so bad its fucking legendary to the people who know me.

My best friend is so sweet im so sorry i keep wasting her time. She deserves so much better than some stupid fuck who cant keep a job or even try to pursue their dreams because theyre not even good at the thing they love to do. Shes the brightest, kindest star in the universe and i know i cant give her all the love and positivity i should.

Getting up every day feels more and more like smashing my head on the pavement but i cant even end it all because i know theres gonna be somebody out there whos gonna have to deal with my ugly obese corpse and i dont want to ruin their day too.

I wish i could just poof out of existence without bothering anybody. Ive already wasted so much.
