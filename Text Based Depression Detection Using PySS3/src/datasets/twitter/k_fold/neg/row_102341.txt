tired tired tired tiredschool is going bad. i can't stay focused for more than 10 minutes at a time and i can't remember anything. being online has ruined my ability to study. i just look at notes during quizzes and tests and i'm gonna be fucked when we go back in person. i try to distract myself from this but then i just end up thinking about all the assignments i have due plus midterms plus having to teach everything to myself since my professors still aren't doing much of anything. then i try to do something nice and get called "weird" for it. apparently buying my mom coffee and dropping it off at her work is "weird"? just like inviting a friend to hang out is "weird"? just like worrying about school is "weird"? i haven't talked to any of my friends in weeks and they don't even bother to check in on me even though i tried to check in on them when they would stop replying to me before. i could die and no one would even notice besides my parents.  i don't even want to go to my therapist anymore because i feel like my issues are nonimportant and insignificant to what other people face. i feel like all of these thoughts in my head are made up and a way to seek attention even though i'm not sharing them with anyone besides venting here. i'm just so tired. i just want everything to go away and end. i don't see a future for myself anymore.
