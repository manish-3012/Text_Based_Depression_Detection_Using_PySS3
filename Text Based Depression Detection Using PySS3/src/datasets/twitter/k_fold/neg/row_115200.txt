feeling extremely lostI've been feeling extremely lonely and lost. I have tried reaching out to friends but it seems like no one cares or wants to hear it. My own boyfriend told me he has enough stress for himself, how can he handle mine. I've always thought that part of a relationship is helping each other through stress... I guess not. One of someone I considered a best friend I tried to talk to and she didn't respond and then text me "my life is drama", this from a 23 year old woman with a pretty easy career.  Everyone else is too caught up with their bullshit. I need someone to talk to talk to that isn't a therapist... I'm tired of therapists. I just want  someone I can really talk to... someone I can cry with who will hold me and let me cry and vent... I don't feel like I have anyone like that. I feel like I have God, but I feel like he's turned his back on me. I feel like everyone has... I'm having trouble finding the answers to my questions... or even finding the questions at all... I'm trying so far... and I don't know anymore... I'm getting closer and closer or want to disappear, whether that be death or something else. I dunno... I just want to die so people can start to forget me...
