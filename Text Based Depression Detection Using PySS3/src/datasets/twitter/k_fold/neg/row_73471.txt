What if it doesnâ€™t get better?I really like my job, even working for entitled people who donâ€™t care about me as a person. The kids I nanny are sweet. Theyâ€™ve found a replacement nanny who starts after New Yearâ€™s, and theyâ€™re paying her less money than they are me and sheâ€™s not living in. I am a live in nanny. 

Iâ€™ve saved every penny that I made, and found a new job. My mental state sucks and has sucked for ages. I tried to get laid and got creep after creep after creep and I didnâ€™t trust any of them so nothing happened, and changed one of my Reddit posts on another sub to say that I did meet someone just to get people to stop messaging me. It didnâ€™t work and I still get messages even now. 

All that I wanted was to meet someone and get married and to live happily ever after. All that I get are people who want to use me. 

What if it doesnâ€™t get better? Iâ€™m losing hope. Is living a miserable life all that Iâ€™m meant to have? Iâ€™d rather be dead if thatâ€™s what itâ€™s supposed to mean.
