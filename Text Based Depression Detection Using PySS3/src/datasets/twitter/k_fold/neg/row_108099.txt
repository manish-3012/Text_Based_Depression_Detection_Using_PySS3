GoodbyeIf you're reading this, I'm gone. Gone from this world more specifically. I'm posting this online because no-one in the real world really cares about me. I know this now. I've been abused both physically and emotionally practically my whole life as well as neglected. Ignored by everyone around me, it's as if I'm invisible. Like I'm already dead. Which I guess, if you're reading this, I am. I've never really had any friends. No one I can go to when I'm feeling lonely. There were a couple people that talked to me at each school I went to, but as soon as I moved or transferred to a new school, it's as if they forgot about me. They treated me like an imaginary friend. Even my best friend from childhood, the one I'd known since before I could walk and who lived across the street from me, stopped talking to me when I moved away. I thought things would get better, but recent events proved they never will.

I don't know what else to add here. As soon as I hit submit I'm going to go hang myself. To everyone who made me feel this way, if you stumble upon this at all, fuck you. And please don't stand over my grave and tell me how much you cared about me. If you really did care, you would have told me while I was alive. Maybe I still would be.
