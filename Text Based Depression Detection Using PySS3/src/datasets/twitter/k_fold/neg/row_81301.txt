It sucks having everyone knowPretty much my entire family and my close friends know that Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself and I hate how everyone treats me differently. I used to be the one everyone could depend on and would look to for help and now hardly anyone does anymore. 

The only positive thing is that itâ€™s opened a dialogue between me and my friends so that they wonâ€™t be as shocked when I go and have time to start accepting that I wonâ€™t be in their lives long term. Tried pushing them away for a while, but they said theyâ€™d stick with me until the end at least which is comforting. I wonder if Iâ€™ll be able to have this kind of dialogue with my family someday so they would better understand me. Has anyone else had successful open talks with their family or friends?
