I'm brokenI don't know where it went wrong but I don't have any idea who I am

I tried to love but I failed, there are people who love me but I failed

It started with me feeling sad or down and before I knew I cried every night and after that I stopped crying and then I stopped caring and now I do not feel alive anymore at all.

I found out I wore a mask. So I took it off. Then there was another mask. So I took it off. Then there was another mask. I am just an infinite stack of masks now, a mirror of other persons, without personality of my own.

At least, until I found out I am simply broken

I am a broken human

On the one side, I don't want to be alone anymore. On the other side, I'm so god damn scared of intimacy.

On the one side, I want to achieve great things with the talents I got. On the other side, I slouch away until these things are long forgotten.

On the one side, I am the upbeat cheerful guy that wants everybody to like him. On the other side I am an empty husk of a human, rotten to the core.

The thought of suicide has crossed my mind. More and more often now. I've been thinking of ways, but I'm scared. Scared I'll fail again. I don't want to fail again. I can't fix myself so what should I do? Who do I tell? 

Please help me before I drop too low and don't climb up again. I feel like a wave of depression that's too large can hit me at any moment and draw me under like a wave of death.

I feel like I'm going mad. I feel so broken...

I might be going mad

I'm tired of fighting myself.
