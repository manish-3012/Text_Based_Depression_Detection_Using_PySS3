Going to blow my brains out (22M with BPD, MDD, and psychosis.)Iâ€™m afraid of being alone when I do it. Going to go to the dark, isolated woods early in the morning, I have written my notes. Will be doing this in my car. 

Going to aim at the brain stem through the mouth Iâ€™m just afraid what will happen if I pull the trigger. 

Will there be pain will the sound shatter my eardrums? Will my death be instantaneous or will I be in excruciating pain for 45 minutes before passing? 

I have done all my research and have decided this is what I want. I have no friends, no education, my family knows Iâ€™m a failure. My life will only get worse the longer I delay the inevitable. 

Iâ€™ve been dealt a bad hand in life, my brain has never and will never function like a normal persons does. 

What is the % success rate of a self inflicted gunshot?
