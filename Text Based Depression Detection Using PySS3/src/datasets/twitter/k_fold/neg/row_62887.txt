This is the only way to see if all this can end.Fuck all this. Fuck trying another day. I've been obsessing with improving my life over the past 10 years. Nothing has worked. I'm still in the same boat today that I was over 10 years ago when I started obsessing about improving my life. I still deal with everything I hate everyday. Everything I've tried to get away from is still a problem in my life. I used to dream about starting a new family but that seems like a unreasonable thing for me to want. I tried for 6 years to go back to school but failed to do so. I will never have the resources to make that dream a reality. Every job I applied for where I was lucky enough to get an interview blew up in my face somehow. It was always some fucked up curve ball that is unimaginable that caused me to not get the job. 

So today I'm going to blow my head off. I'm not living this life for one more day. There is no way to stop this right now other than killing myself. I'm lucky that everyone related to me is dead and I have no friends or anyone that cares about me. My death will have virtually no impact on anyone alive. Good news is the people who get paid to clean up messes like the one I'm about to make can take solace in the fact that I validated their position in the workforce for another day. 

This is the only way for me to see if this life can end. I'm sick of the situation and I lack the aptitude to correct it. So I'm just going to finally submit to the fact that I'm an idiot. I lack all the ability to fix this and the only thing I'm capable of doing to make all this end is to blow my brains out today.
