Not seeing the lightI'm in a tough grad program. Its for my dream career, but I'm starting to slip. My dad killed himself a number of years ago, I'm using his inheritance, its not much... But just enough to pay for the program if I work on the weekends. My work is irregular and sucks I'm not getting the shifts I need and my boss is nuts. This weekend was my birthday, my mother as a gift rented out a cabin in the woods, I invited over 20 peoples, over 15 confirmed and only two showed up. We couldn't make it to a concert or an event because the weather closed the roads I invited the girl I'm head over heels for and she bailed.. I've had relations with her before, and she always leaves me out to dry. Right now I'm 25 in debt, alone, without a career and on the verge of failing out of my program. 

I've always been unlucky, people say "you create your own luck" but I've broken 17 bones, and I live with a chronic disease that gives me almost constant dull pain. I asked a girl to marry me once, she left me for another man. My family has never been financially well off, I relied heavily on local charities for clothing and food growing up. 

I've always been depressed, on my fire crew I even earned the nickname of "Blue" because I'm known to be melancholy. I've just never been this depressed or hopeless. I thought that people cared about me, they don't, the girl doesn't either.
