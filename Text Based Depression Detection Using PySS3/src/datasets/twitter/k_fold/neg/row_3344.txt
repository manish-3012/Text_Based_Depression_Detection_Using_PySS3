Banned from r/depression?So I think I've been banned from r/depression, although I could be wrong. I haven't been notified or anything, but I can't submit anything (I can to other subs).
Granted, my post may seem like I was merely attention-seeking, but I was genuinely asking for opinions/advise.
The links included in this post. Thoughts?
