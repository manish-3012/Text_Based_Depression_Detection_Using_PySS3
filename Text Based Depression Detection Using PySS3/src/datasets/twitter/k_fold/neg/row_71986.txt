Just feel like im very alone.I know this sounds really cloche and stupid but it's true. I'm with a wonderful woman and we have a beautiful baby boy but there's always been a part of me that feels hollow. It's been dormant for some time but the feeling of just not being creeps up every so often. I feel so useless and hopeless. I can't hold down a job because of a medical condition. I feel like I've failed as a man because I can't provide for my family. I just want things to be normal.
