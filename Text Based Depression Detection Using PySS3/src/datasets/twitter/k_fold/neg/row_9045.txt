Got "big bertha" pointed under my jawI have 24 hours from the moment I posted this to pull it. It seems that no one, I mean, NO ONE, NOT EVEN ANYONE IN MY FAMILY is willing to help me process all of this. So much abuse and unfair treatment from my father has made me grab my "last resort". Just posting this because I want to let people know what I'm going through at least before I pass. I already wrote a note a few days ago and I have no plans to push the date on it any further. Check out my last posts if you wanna know what's been going on in my life.
