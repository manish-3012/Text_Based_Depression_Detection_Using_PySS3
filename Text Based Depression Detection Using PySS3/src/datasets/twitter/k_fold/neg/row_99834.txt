Iâ€™m the fuck up in the familyI get shitty jobs. I can never get a gift anyone in my family wants. The college major i chose is disappointing my mom and dad. All my friends constantly do shit without me and my girlfriend is way too good for me and itâ€™s only a matter of time before she realizes it. My sister is the golden child. Makes as much, if not a little more than my mom even though my sister works at a restaurant and my mom is a social worker. my dad absolutely hates me and everything that i do thatâ€™s part of my passion but loves when my sister follows her. iâ€™m going to a school in arizone (i live in nevada) and my family thinks that iâ€™m making a mistake and that iâ€™ll just fuck up my life by not doing what my sister did and stay instate and theyâ€™ve blamed me for my dogâ€™s failing health even though iâ€™m not even allowed to take care of them. despite my sister consistently getting lower grades than me and taking less challenging courses in high school iâ€™m still the â€œfucking idiotâ€ who had all Aâ€™s and one B on my report card last quarter. Am i really that shitty? Whatâ€™s the best way to end it without feeling anything?
