My kids. But I want to die.Iâ€™m new here so probably doing this wrong. I want to die all of the time. Like every second of every day and then in between the seconds. There is almost nothing in this life that makes it seem worth living. I have 3 (almost) grown children. I love them and still breathing only for them. Itâ€™s an awful life.
