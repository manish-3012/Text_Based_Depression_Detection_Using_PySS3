Almost 2 yearsI'm about a week away from the second anniversary of my last attempt.  My family and friends think I'm doing fine but I think about suicide several times every day.  My depression has never been worse, I'm just so afraid of disappointing them and making them sad if I were to try again.  I just feel so trapped, nothing excites me anymore and I don't see the point in doing anything.  I can't even broach the subject with anyone or else I'll get sent to a hospital again, which is always a terrible experience.
