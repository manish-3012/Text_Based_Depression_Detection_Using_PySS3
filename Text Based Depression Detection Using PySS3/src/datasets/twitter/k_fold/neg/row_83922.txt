I don't have anyoneI have both parents live and well, also two older sisters. But I can't talk them about my deepest fears, because for some reason, they feel like strangers to me. I have three friends but we never talked about anything serious and one of them is definitely better friend for me than I am for him. 
I was on one date in my life and I never had girlfriend (24yo) and my friends mock me for that. They are older and have girlfriend/wife so they moved on. I can't stand crowds and I am terrible at social interactions and boi I tried. There is no one who would care about my interests books/movies/games. Yet i am not part of any community. I feel so empty. I drift trough every day like ghost. Sometimes I want bash my head against wall. I am on edge for 3 years because of college. From which I probably will get kicked out. I am just tired but I have no rest or someone to comfort me.
There are two reasons I didn't kill myself yet. 1. Upcoming games (I know...) 2. I am coward and afraid what come after.

Sorry if it is confusing - english is not my native language and I just wanted to write it down.
