Please just let it end	At this point, I no longer feel I have any control over my life whatsoever. Everything has either been taken from me or I am so limited in my social mobility that my only recourse is to try to piecemeal my life inside this computer. I no longer take any real enjoyment from this box anyway, as most of my relationships have either fallen apart or I have lost contact with virtually all of them. It seems that all avenues of escape have been denied: unemployment, veterans benefits, fuck I can't even get food stamps because I'm trying to get an education to get a shit job with a shit degree. I've been living a meaningless struggle for existence since I was kicked out of the Navy and I'm ready for it to be over since it doesn't look like anything is getting better.

	To give you an idea of what I went through, I had my Captain at Captain's Mast declare that he would throw me over the side of the ship. That I was a virus and needed to be removed from the crew. When I got to shore, I was brought up on false charges that didn't exist for having 2 2oz bottles of alcohol in my barracks room. Oh yeah, the I denied Captain's Mast there and demanded a Courts Martial because at least in a courts martial you get the chance to defend yourself and I was on a shore command, so I had the opportunity to do so. Anyway, about a week later I was forced to sign my discharge papers without any ability to contest it. I wasn't allowed to go to legal because I didn't have an escort and they wouldn't provide one.

	So here I am, 5 years later, without educational benefits and without any real opportunity in front of me except massive debt for a degree when I'm maybe... what... 28? I've wasted the best years of my life and even those were a struggle. I just don't see the point anymore. Why continue on this path of never ending disappointment? I mean fuck, I can't even afford gas or food or even rent. I can't even take out enough student loans to cover the cost of living, much less a comfortable living. Besides, where I live now, there isn't even the promise of completing a degree that would even make me marketable in this job market. So far ever resource I have tried pursuing I've either been denied for or just ineligible. I can't get the help I need because I can't afford it. My credit is ruined after losing my car and having several collections that I couldn't pay.

	All of my income has gone towards either survival or trying to find some sanity in my computer with the hope that one day I'd have the skills to somehow make programming a career. I don't have anybody to talk to because the people I have don't understand or don't care. My friends has slowly dwindled down into nothing, with most of my relationships being broken due to me being a generally unhappy person. Nobody wants to hang around with that person. Not only that, a few friends have tried helping me and due to the circumstances I've either disappointed them or ruined our friendship. Now I rarely leave the house and I can't find the will or determination to follow through with most of the important things affecting my life.

	I've had sleep issues since the navy which never really properly got diagnosed. While I was in, I went to medical and saw a doc about my suicidal thoughts and sleep issues. I was put on meds and supposed to follow up, then was separated a week later. My discharge review board didn't even go through, apparently I didn't make a good enough case so that I could at least carry on with my life.

	I'm just really fed up with trying because it always leads to disappointment. I'm tired of being disappointed. I would really just like everything to magically change, to finally be able to get the education that I spent 4 years of my life working for, to get an opportunity to be independent again and fuck... Just be happy again. The Navy has taken everything from my personality and turned me into a hollow shell. The VA has been completely useless, I've tried the veterans crisis line twice and well... I'm writing this as I chat with a particularly unhelpful rep. I've taken I don't know how many sleeping pills and I just want this nightmare that has become my life to end.
