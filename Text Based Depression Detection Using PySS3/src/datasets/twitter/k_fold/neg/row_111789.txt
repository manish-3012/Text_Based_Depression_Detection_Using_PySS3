if i canâ€™t even pass the 9th grade, how can i do anythingi should be in 11th grade but iâ€™m not even finished with 9th. i went to public school up until 9th and then some shit happened and i couldnâ€™t even get up for school without having a panic attack and feeling so sick. then i switched to online school, and that didnâ€™t help. i felt so overwhelmed by it all that i didnâ€™t even want to try. every time i did i got bad grades. i failed. then repeated it 2 more times and failed both times.

now today, iâ€™ve been kicked out of the online school because iâ€™m fucking stupid and canâ€™t do it and no one helps. i canâ€™t go back to public school and now i just have to hope some other online school lets me join. probably not. not really sure what the other options are. i guess drop out and explain to my family why iâ€™m such a fuck up? cant wait for that conversation. or kill myself. suicide really sounds like the only thing that will help me. fml.
