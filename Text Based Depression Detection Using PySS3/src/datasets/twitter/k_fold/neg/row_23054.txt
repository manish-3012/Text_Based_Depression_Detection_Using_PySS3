I think suicide is a good option for me.I'm tired of being an autistic manchild. I have no friends and my family is full of trashy losers. My life is empty, bland and too fucking hard on a day to day basis. It struck me driving home from work:

 tomorrow could be your last day if you really wanted it to be. Get up early, go buy some rope and hang yourself in the woods. 

I've always planned on 'checking out' early, but it's always been in distant future. 6 months, a year whatever. And I always push it back when it gets too close. I want to do it now. I don't want to be here anymore. I feel so disconnected from people.
