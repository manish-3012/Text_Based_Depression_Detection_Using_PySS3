I should be happy. Why aren't I?I should be happy with my life and actually wanting to live. I have friends, I'm doing fairly well in school, hell, I even managed to get myself a significant other. But I just have this overwhelming fear of not being good enough that is always present, always controlling me. I feel like just giving up, even though I know I shouldn't. What's wrong with me?
