I never truly thought of suicide but I don't think I'll be alive for my 25 th birthday either.I'm a non native english speaker but I think my english is alright , Just do not mind of the few mistakes I might do please.   
 

Basicly I've always had bonding / social problems because I never felt any connection with anyone , But learned over the years how to "fake" socialisation , I've seen a lot of therapist and child psychiatrists about the anxiety / stress problems I was going through which they never understood the true cause since from an exterior point of view I was fairly normal , As time passed I got to highschool , First week I only cried second week I did three vasovagal pass out due to pain that comes with stress /anxiety (Since I cannot do panic attacks due to how I control my emotions so this is what happens instead, Had those since I was 6 but I always had atleast three months between each one those were three in three days) I then did a burnout , Stopped going to school , still seeing a child psychiatrist I was 15 at the time , a year passed we found nothing and I was feeling very guilty of everything that was happening because she was basicly saying I was inventing my problems And I wasn't willing of doing anything that she told me to do since I just didn't have the energy for it which made her mad most of the time  
After that we found a mental clinic close by and since my mom is invalid we are 100 % covered in medical costs so I could go there which I did First time I went two weeks full time They kinda had the same idea as my child psychiatrist so I went on the internet and did a lot of research like A lot of it And since I had a depersonalisation problem I was kinda objective on myself I found that I was probably Schizoid Went back to the clinic for two weeks told my psychiatrist (for adult this time) everything I knew about it and how I linked myself to it she told me she'll program an orchard test for me even tho they weren't orienting themselves toward that Two months later I took it (two weeks ago) I'm 17 , got the results from the therapist that made me pass it And told me basicly everything I needed to hear to feel understood I cried a lot that day I felt like after 11 years I was finnally partly understood And that my "self diagnosis" was probably right tho we needed more info for that So everything should be fine right? Well now that I know all that I'm questioning If I really want to live this life where I cannot truly experience any feelings or do any true bond So Yeah I really question myself do I really want to live or not.  
I know that's a lot of lecture but I'd really like anyone view on this
