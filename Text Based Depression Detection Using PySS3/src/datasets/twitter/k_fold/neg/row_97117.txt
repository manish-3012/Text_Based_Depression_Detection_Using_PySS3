Part of me wants to stay. Part of me wants to go.Everything is so messed up. 

My boyfriend and I have a weird messy relationship. He basically broke up with me yesterday. 

My grandma died. 

I hate myself. I hate my thoughts. I hate my body. I hate life. 

I just want to end it. I donâ€™t want to be here. 

I cut for the first time in over a year last night. I hate myself it. All day Iâ€™ve wanted to cut again. Iâ€™ve wanted to just keep cutting until the pain was no longer there. The pain of looking in a mirror and not knowing the person who looks back. The pain of not being able to hug your grandma. The pain of failing the person you love more than anyone. The pain of knowing youâ€™re wasting everyoneâ€™s time. I just want the pain to stop. 

I donâ€™t want to hurt my family killing myself. But how can the person I am right now be any less of a burden?
