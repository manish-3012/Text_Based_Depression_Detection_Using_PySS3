The only choice im sure of is I dont want to be here anymoreI dont know what it isâ€¦ I dont want to leave her but my body is like just leave her.. feel like im hurting her, or that I will hurt in the future. I feel 100% in this but also like im not supposed to be in this. I feel so lostâ€¦ Endless void of something. And I think even removing her would just cause me to fall deeper in that void. Iâ€™ve just felt like im done with this but also like maybe im just done with life. Im so scared of the future im so scared that everything thats gonna happen is going to happen so fast and im going to end up drowning. I feel like Ill never have it figured out. I feel like im stuck . I feel like everything is falling somehow slowly but I can see it. I can see how this is all going to end. I feel like I just need to escape for forever. I feel like while tripping I felt the most real. I felt like I was supposed to. But now im back to this death feeling. I feel like I cant figure out who or what I am and that brings me sadness. That makes me want to figure out who I am. I feel like I cant do that with her here. And im not even interested in anyone else. I feel disgusted. I feel like im fucking sick all the time. I feel like I need to just get high all day. I feel like I cant do anything anymore. I dont even want to make another photograph. I feel like I just want to disappear without a trace. I feel like thats the my only move or something. How do I fix this feeling. How I get passed it. Did I lose my care for herâ€¦ or did I lose my care for living bc nothing seems worth it anymore. I feel like im aware of why I am the way I am but at the same time I donâ€™t know how to deal with it. I canâ€™t figure it out and if I dont figure it out soon I think im just going to jump. I canâ€™t really hang on any longer. I love her so much though... I just dont know what to do with myself.
