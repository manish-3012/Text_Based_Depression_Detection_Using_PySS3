I am sick. I am tired. I have nowhere to go.I can't even escape into *books* any lore because the authors are almost always bigoted in some way. I can't cope with everything in life with no refuge and no escape. I am scared of the world because so many people have come out in support of ideals that want people like me dead.

Everyone says "oh just seperate the books and the author then" but how can I possibly do that when the author thinks I am scum just for existing? How can I do that when the entire community is willing to condone that by sitting in silence?

My last safe place has been taken from me. This isn't the only event, this is just the final straw. It is clear to me now that the people on this planet do no want me here.
