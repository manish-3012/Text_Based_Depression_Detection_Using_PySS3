Last night I tied a nooseI tied a noose and I made my first and what I thought would be my last post on here. But then I started reading through everyone elseâ€™s posts and I guess it distracted me enough to calm me down, and I didnâ€™t do it. I have suicidal thoughts all the time so Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll be back. But Iâ€™m thankful to have found a community like this.
