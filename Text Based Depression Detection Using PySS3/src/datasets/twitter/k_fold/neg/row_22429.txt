i am tired of tryingGood Evening to my family and i am sorry but, this is the last thing  you will see for me.

Mom, Sorry i turned out to be a failure even though you kept trusting i could be something better sorry for failing you. each day goes by and i see you get older and i can not help you with bills and other items. I'm sorry i am an anchor but i am an anchor that pulls everything down including myself 

Sorry for the cars i truly am. there is so much i want to write and tell you how much i miss you and love you but i can't.

To the rest of my family please do not hate yourself it was not your fault.

Everyone will call me a coward, i am.

The last few weeks are the happiest i have ever been in the past 4 years. and i want to thank mom for that, for the first time last Saturday i laughed alot like truly felt happiness and for a moment i thought maybe things will be okay But, they got worse Sorry.
