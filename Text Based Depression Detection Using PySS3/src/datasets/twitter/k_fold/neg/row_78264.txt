I'm so lonelyI have lost all of my friends. They just don't talk to me anymore. I was in a wonderful relationship for 7 months and he ended it because he wants to sleep with other girls. I'm worthless. I have nothing to live for. I will never find love because I'm not worth loving. There is no reason for me to keep going.
