Iâ€˜m just tiredI just wish I could kill myself without throwing my family into financial problems and then them having to deal with it.


Iâ€˜m just tired and want to die in my sleep. Iâ€˜m sick of no one really caring about me and then me feeling bad when they say "bla bla but we care". I donâ€˜t feel like anyone really cares, itâ€˜s always about them and their emotions and problems. then they expect me to open up but when I do, they donâ€˜t understand me. Me opening up to anyone isnâ€˜t helping me anymore because no one cares anyway.


Iâ€˜m already in therapy but I donâ€˜t even think my therapist cares. Iâ€˜m just tired. If I was dead nothing would bother me anymore.
