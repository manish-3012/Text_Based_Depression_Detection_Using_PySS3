I don't know who I am anymore.I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2, personality disorder and dissociative identity disorder. 


I took a blow to the head during an army exercise due to my own negligence and stupidity. Ive not been the same since. I hear voices, i cannot control impulsive behavior, I drink to excess.


I hate myself so much. Ive ruined my career in the army. The only thing i wanted to be was a solider, someone who defends the helpless, helps those in need and protects his fellow man. 

The only reason keeping me alive is that I dont want to do damage to my family. Even though my family were the ones who fucked me up initially in my childhood. Ive been molested several times and raped twice.  Recently my childhoold memories have been coming back to me, due to therapy, and being repressed for so many years and it horrifys me. 


Ive never accomplished anything major in my life. I never graduated college,  the only thing my parents keep begging me to do, so Im overwhelmed with guilt. 

When I did attend college, I loved it. I was a tutor and TA in computer science, I spent my summers interning at a US embassy. I was getting ready to be an officer in the US army. 

But then someone connected to me betrayed me. My boss, Cathy, a previous 'friend' of mine, had me fired intentionally so she could hire her new friend. 

I HELPED HER GET THAT JOB AND THAT BITCH CUT ME OUT. 

I lost my way then, dropped out of college joined the army and now here I am. Ready to slit my wrists and die. My leg hurts from cutting it so much. 

I deserve a painful death and then to be forgotten.
