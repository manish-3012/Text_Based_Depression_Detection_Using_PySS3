Might as well try to talk about itHi, Iâ€™m nearly 23, white, straight and a man, and Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m absolutely miserable, at my core. Suicide is constantly in the back of my mind, and Iâ€™ve been on the verge of wanting to go through with it for a long time, and attempted it twice in the past.

Iâ€™m so angry all the time, and sometimes, I just donâ€™t know why. The media has set it off today especially, and the more modern media I look at I feel as though anything I do, Iâ€™m being viewed in the most terrible way possible, despite the fact Iâ€™ve done nothing to deserve it. Itâ€™s getting to a point where I feel like I canâ€™t exist with the people in this world anymore, like I canâ€™t be accepted by anyone, like Iâ€™m not worth the time. My self-esteem is at an all time low, and I donâ€™t even want to get out of bed anymore, I sort of just wish I die in my sleep, guilt free of actually doing it myself. 

I doubt Iâ€™m the only one who feels this way in the grand scheme of things, I just donâ€™t know where else to turn really. Most people just tell me to get on with it, which I very clearly am unable to do. I wish I had a good end to put on this, but I canâ€™t think of anything for the life of me, so, if anyone can offer advice or some perspective, Iâ€™d really appreciate it. Thanks for reading if you did.
