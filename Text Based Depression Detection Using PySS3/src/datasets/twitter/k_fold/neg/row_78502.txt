Everything's pushing me to do thisI am trying really hard not to do this.  Why? I really don't know. 

But everything is a driving force. I've lost motivation for everything, I weak a mask like I'm OK and it's draining me. I've tried medications for depression and anxiety, they don't help. I feel trapped. 

I also have to pretend I believe in something that I don't anymore. Im sure I exhibit BPD traits. 
Its hard for me to make friends, being shy and introverted. I have family issues and it drains me. I've been this way ever since. I'm trying to distract myself,but it's not doing much
