As the world caves inMy world has slowly been collapsing for (at least) the past few months. I've been trying to ignore it as hard as I can, but it's happening. It's really happening. I've spent my whole life studying for degrees, but I'm too far behind to graduate. I'm an adult, but I've never had a job, and I haven't moved out. I have parents and relatives, who are relying on me to succeed, but I can't, and I can't hide it for much longer. No matter how much help I seek for depression I've never changed. I'm broken and unfixable. So this feels inevitable. Like an asteroid on a collision course with Earth.

I want to get in the car right now and drive off a cliff, but I'm scared. I've always been scared. Driving off a cliff would be the bravest thing I've ever done, but I don't know if I can do it. I would leave behind the people who depend on me, but I'm already such a failure it's probably for the better. 

Oh well, I can put it off for now, I guess, but soon my time will be up. 

Anyway, I just wanted to shout this message out to the void. I don't know why, it makes me feel a bit better. Also I probably won't read replies since I can't stomach it. Look at me trying to justify my own post like a fucking wanker.
