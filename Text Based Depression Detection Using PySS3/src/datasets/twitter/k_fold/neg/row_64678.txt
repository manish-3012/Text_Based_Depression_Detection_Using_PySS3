Why is it okay for the others to be mean to me but if I ever do something mean I am worse than Hitler and Stalin combined, please helpIf I am ever negative I am somehow negative and bitter person, 70 percent of my insecurites are something the others forced on me. It is always better for the others for me to be a victim and not help me. I do not know how to set consequences for people who are mean to you but know you won't do anything to them because you are peaceful and harmless and love to help the others. I feel lost and am tired of being the nice ugly girl no one likes. I do not know why was I called disgusting when I had good hygiened (expect 10 th grade where I was suicidal and tried different things to destroy my self, mostly pills with alcohol) 

I want to live but do not know how to escape the bully/abuse cycle without being something I am not good at - being agressive. I do not know how to make the cost for harassing me high because I suffer from anxiety due to abuse and predatory types like bullies have always managed since kindergarten to get under my skin - make me angry, laugh at me, harass me until I cry and even if I cry they become so hostile that I always had to ask a teacher to seprate them from me. Maybe it is "weakness" bullying is natural   for many animals, but I was never a bully to anyone so i do not understand how can people who do not know anything about me can hate me and gang up on me and make the common enemy (scapegoat)and imitate my reactions. I still try to think that when people laugh it is not at me and try to get over my trauma. 

Can someone help and explain to me how can a scrawny anorexic girl make the cost high for anyone to bully her, I see that the bad sassy girls that read twillight and laugh at abuse videos ar always liked and accepted and have many boys who crush on them, even the bullies like them.
