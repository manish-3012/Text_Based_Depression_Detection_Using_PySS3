What do I do?I've been feeling like this for 2 years now, a bit more and all I want do to is die, I think of killing myself everyday, I selfharmed and still do, all I like and enjoy doing is sleeping, which I do about 11hours a day..., I sometimes starve myself and then eat too much, i regret waking up everyday, because I feel like a mistake on this world,  I know I'm useless, ugly, stupid, worthless etc. 
I don't see a reason to be alive and to continue this pain... I want to tell my mum but I don't want her to hate me, I don't want to disappoint her... I've tried commiting 7 times now, unfortunately I failed all 7 times... I want to find help but I'm not sure how to tell my mum and dad, that their only child is depressed... I don't see a point in living and trying, the only person holding me up right now is my friend who is also the only one who knows about this... I put on this mask pretending I'm okay but all the "I'm fine" lies that I say aren't true and I've had enough... I'm not sure this will help but honestly I don't even care anymore... I'd just like to thank my friend who helped me and hope that I don't wake up tomorrow.
