What to do..What do you do when you lose the last thing you were fighting for to keep your sanity? When the last bastion has fallen? When the only thing you feel in your chest is an overwhelming crushing darkness? When you truly have nothing left why is it still frowned upon if you just want out? The friends who told you they would always be there just ignore you now? Left to rot and suffer but they punish you for wanting to be free? What is really left...
