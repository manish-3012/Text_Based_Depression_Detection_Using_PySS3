Somehow managed to fail this early in lifeEverything that could have gone has gone wrong, and I have no reason to keep going. I have the worst grades I've ever had, I'm probably going to be forced to drop out of a college course, I don't have any real friends, my parents are splitting up, I'm good at absolutely nothing, and I'm a faggot.  All in my freshman year of highschool.  
No future in school, no future professionaly, no future socially, and. no future romantically. The only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is that I'm too much of a coward to slit my wrists.
