Rain on a White ShipRecently, a dream found me.
Raindrops pelted down from the vast blue sky, thousands of diamonds falling in abundance.
The floor of the deck was saturated with moisture; I gripped sturdily onto the handrails, watching my steps as I crossed to the other end, a destination which remained unseen.
Ghosts of the past appeared like a flash of light.
The woman that I wished was my mum.
The perfect family I yearned for.
The quiet girl whom I never got to know.
The handsome boy  whom I never once spoke to.
All of them appeared in an order, a chronological sequence to the life I never wanted to look back on. A past so pathetic that I hid my face in shame.
Everything was afloat, I was in euphoria. There was nothing weighing me down or holding me back. This must be heaven.
In a flowy white dress, I smiled, drenched in water that cleansed. Peace washed over me, as the dirt stayed behind in the sea.
The escape I could only have in a 7 hour dream.
