so in debt. tired of being autisticI have a lot of mental issues and am mentally disabled and may be mentally ill I dunno if I faked the mental illness or if that would be qualified as real. I have been mentally disabled my whole life but I come off as being smart so I just have always rolled with it. I'm trying to get paperwork that shows just how profoundly dumb I am but I don't think I will get it in time to show my father. I have lied to and stolen from my father. I am good at reading and am really well read so I can pretend to be smart but I am not smart. I always convince myself that I am not in debt or not lying so I think maybe I am mentally ill but I don't even know anymore. I owe who knows how much in medical debt. I owe 8k to a previous place I got evicted from, I owe 3+k to the credit card company, I owe 3k in outstanding rent and am probably about to get evicted a 3rd time. I will owe them 9k total after I get evicted because of lump sum stuff. I don't know why I make the financial decisions I do I am so fucking STUPID for fucks sake and nobody will help me because they tell me I am smart. I have dug myself into this hole and have no earthly way to dig myself out. I think I owe an additional 2k in rent but don't even know. I think I owe like 10+k in student loans and owe like 400 bucks in payment to that due tomorrow but yeah. I have a wisdom tooth I need out too and my teeth are kind of fucked in general. I'm so afraid to die but I will never get myself out of this hole and it is all my fault. my mom was the only one who kinda knew how disabled I am but even her I would always lie to her and try to convince her I was smart. god the lies. I just wanted to not be so dumb but I am dumb and can't run my finances as an adult but I was left to my own devices as an adult because of my lies and now I will never recover from it all and there's only one way out I don't want to be homeless again
