Should I be standing in the top of a hill, or in its depths?There are way too many things wrong with me, maybe I should just disappear (die)? 

Explaining is way too much of a hassle. Keywords - that'll do it for me.

(My) father - suicide, 37 years (I was 4)
(My) mother - died (when I born)

currently living with uncle, the SUPREME CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS FANATIC.

Me? - A very, very sadistic 3/4 [heterosexual?] male (under 18) that totally looks (and acts?) like a girl (1/2 intentional, honestly) - Addicted to â€œPhysical trainingâ€ (torture [on myself] pretty much), big Ds, cute girls, playing the piano.
---
Absolutely hate: Fat / any sort of religious people (especially Christians) - vegan folks - country folks - ignorants (general) - getting called out in the school's office for "violently attacking other students" - being labeled as weirdo.

That'll do for the key stuff. Now, (people that are going to reply to this bunch of whining) please DO NOT try to pretend that you care for any of this, for I know you donâ€™t - all I want is a to read up a good reason to cancel my suicidal plans. If anyone come up with anything that lights my dark path then I may stay alive for now and die in another (distant?) day.

Side note~
I wish I hadnâ€™t become... this / I lost count of how many times a d*** thrusted into my a**, my mou** and other holes of my body. Why does it even feels SO GOOD when I hit other people with heavy objects (or bite them hard) and they bleed a lot!? Why people keep saying that my â€œmusical talentsâ€ for pianos and keyboards were wasted on someone like me? That's too much work for keeping up this male-girly body with my messed-up head in the current society, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m gonna simply bail out of my life (yes, kill myself). Iâ€™m not tired, but I know that I wonâ€™t be able to keep being myself for long, as the â€œlikes of meâ€ hardly survive on the modern society (I canâ€™t even get a job).
