Im not even 18 yet and Im thinking of suicideBefore telling me that Im edgy,listen to the story.I had a group of like 5 friends.I parted ways with them this year bcs they were bullying me somethimes and made me overthink like crazy about losing them.But thats not the problem.The problem is what came after.

So I have a classmate(my best friend I could say)and after I stopped talking to the group of friends I began talking a lot to him(we talked rarely until that point,but we were still best friends)and I first thought that he wouldnt do crap like that.But here I am,3 weeks after I started talking to him.

Im overthinking everything to the point that nothing makes me feel satisfied or alive anymore.Im basically cramped up in a corner by everyone I know,and Im afraid that someday I wont have any friends left and my parents would think Im a complete failure.Please give me some advice,im feeling hopeless.
