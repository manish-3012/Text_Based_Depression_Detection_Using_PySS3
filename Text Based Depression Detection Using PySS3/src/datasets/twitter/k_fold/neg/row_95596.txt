Sometimes I like to fantasize about a certain thingSometimes I like to imagine that Iâ€™m shaking hands with everyone Iâ€™ve come into contact with, all of us knowing that Iâ€™ll be gone after I leave. I wish them the best of luck and tell them Iâ€™ll be hoping the best for them, then I leave and  before I die in my sleep, I smile in a purest moment as I drift off. Everyone goes on with their lives, not remembering ever having met me, and I cry as I burn in hell for living the life no human with a conscious deserves.
