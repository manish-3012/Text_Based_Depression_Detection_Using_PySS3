Live for the gym onlythe only thing i enjoy is going to the gym.. i go 6 days a week and feel like shit on my rest day.

Can i just work and go to the gym? Or will it not work out? Social interaction isnt working for me i think im on the spectrum somewhere...

I guess ive just given up with friends, losing my virginity, dating and having kids etc
