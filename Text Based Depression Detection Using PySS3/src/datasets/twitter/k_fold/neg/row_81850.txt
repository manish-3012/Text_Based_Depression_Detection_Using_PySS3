I'm thought of too highlyMy parents are disappointed in me because they expect so much from me but I don't reach the standards. They're expecting me to get a job but it's the most daunting thing I'd of done, I'm suicidal and they want me to get a job. I'm giving myself until October 1st, if I don't fix myself by then, I'm just going kill myself. I'm worthless.
