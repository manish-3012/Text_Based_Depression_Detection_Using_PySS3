How can I make my life better?I donâ€™t know if this is the right sub for this kind of thing, but I need help. 

I donâ€™t have a lot to live for. Iâ€™m in high school, I have no plan for my future and the only things keeping me alive are my mom and my dog. It just feels like my whole life is just one big train wreck that just keeps getting worse and worse. When I was a kid I was raped and abused by an older brother, when I got to middle and early high school I got bullied by people I thought were my friends. I keep making mistakes that I cannot shake and i donâ€™t know how to make my life better. Suicide has always been a nice thought for me, but Iâ€™ve never done it because Iâ€™m scared of what it would do to my mom, but I donâ€™t know anymore. My mom knows everything and she tried to guide me through life, but thereâ€™s just so much she can do. I have a suicide note written, I have a plan, and Iâ€™m just counting down the days until I finally get the nerve to end it all.  Today something snapped though, I want to get better.

Thatâ€™s enough of the sob story, Iâ€™m tired of wanting to die all the time, so, my question is, what are some things I can do to try and actively make my life better? For some context, I get an average 6-7 hours of sleep a night, my social life is healthy, however Iâ€™m lucky if I eat one meal a day, and itâ€™s not very good good either, usually junk food. I donâ€™t get much exercise besides the occasional hike. Iâ€™m scared to go to a therapist, I donâ€™t want them to put me on drugs or anything, and Iâ€™m honestly scared of what they would tell me. So, if anyone has any suggestions or anything that may help, I would appreciate it a lot.

Thank you.
