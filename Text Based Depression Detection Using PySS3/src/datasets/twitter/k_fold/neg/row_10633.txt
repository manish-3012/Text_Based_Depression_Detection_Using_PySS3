Hell.I want to kill myself. I want to watch myself bleed. I feel nothing. I feel no joy I only feel pain, suffering, and misery. Okay, I'm being a little melodramatic, but I really am...sad.

I don't feel real. I feel like I've spent so much time hating myself that the person that I used to be is gone forever.

I want to die. I am in constant pain and I hate myself for being in pain and wanting to die. I hate myself so much, I don't eat, I don't sleep, I don't talk without judging myself. Every day is pain. I want to die.
