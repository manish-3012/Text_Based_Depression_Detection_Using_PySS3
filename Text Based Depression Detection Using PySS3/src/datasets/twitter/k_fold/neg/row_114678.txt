Gone, I couldn't murder your promise right before my eyes.The revolutions of my psychosis kept me out of the way. Once inside, all I hold is ash. Suppressing every feeling, I'm in so much pain. I have every right to hate, I can't take it. The hardest part is knowing that I could never be you and now all I do is sit around and wish I could forget you. Who are you to me? Who am I to you? Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence? By default you are my only link to psychosomatic suicide. Where were you when I was down? Can you show me a way to face everyday with this face? When I blur my eyes they make the whole world breathe, I see you fucking me and I am absolutely controlling every urge to mutilate, the one and only answer. So much for memories, I want to dress in your insecurities and be the perfect you. I'm out-streched out for all to loathe
