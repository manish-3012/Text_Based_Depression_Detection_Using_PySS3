Is being suicidal close to homicidal?I heard someone say this recently and I vehemently disagree. I can not express how extremely damaging and engraging this sentiment is. Is this a widely held belief?! Do people really think this? I'm sorry I have no one to talk to this about but I feel very strongly about it and want to hear from people. 

I feel if someone is homicidal then that's how they were going to be anyway. Idk if that makes sense, but what I mean is that you probably can be both, but I don't think everyone who is suicidal is automatically potentially homicidal. You have any idea how fucked up that is for me to think about?! I've tried to kill myself many times and came very close at one point and I'm thinking about it again. I've been suicidal since as far back as I can remember. I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and cptsd. and I've broken my bones and cut my wrists and blackened my own eyes... I've burned every bridge, burned all my money, killed all my accomplishments, destroyed my health and cut off every friend, I've killed myself in so many ways. And I have never once came close hurting someone else physically or committing violence against another human being. I know I'm just one case, but the posts and notes i read here everyday mirror my own thoughts so much sometimes. it's an indescribable feeling.

I want to know why people think this? Is it because suicide is viewed as someone killing.... someone? Idk if I'm even right in saying this but killing someone else is very different from killing yourself. Do they think maybe because they've broken down the mental barriers to inflict self harm that somehow this also unlocks something that would let them harm others?!  FUCK THAT. I don't need to feel like anymore of a fucking worthless unforgivable monster than I do. I've focused and thought about the repercussions of suicide my whole fucking life. it's been a struggle in my brain to figure out what's right and wrong about it. and if it's my fucking fault or my fucking defective brain. If it's just bad luck and the way i am. my genetics. is self destruction just in my blueprints. if its just a part of the chaos and unfairness of it all and how unfair everything is for everyone.

i don't know if I'm making any sense. but when I heard someone say that on a podcast or something i was listening to. I just felt my stomach sink for everyone else who is suicidal and might here it too. And the casualness of how they said it... like it's some widely accepted fact. Don't they have any idea what that does for the stigma and people trying to get help?!? it made me so angry in a way i haven't felt in a long time. i needed to vent and see if I'm just wrong or something. Maybe someone will show me an example. I know there are such things as murder suicides but again to me that's just one thing on top of another. Not just that suicide propogated the homicide guaranteed... you know?

I think society's and the world's view of the suicidal will change in the future. It's such and absolutely important and delicate topic but I think the advancement of understanding could help an immense amount of needless personal suffering. 

I will never harm someone else. in fact when I'm suicidal i feel an overwhelming urge to give all of my self up. my blood my organs my body to research or to help someone else. to just go away. I know I've read the same from a lot of you. I know if we could just have to the option to go away we would, but all we have is the option of horrifying grotesque suicide to end my pain to get to my goal of peace and just... non life idk what to call it. whatever we are before we're born. i just want that. my brain isn't wired right. it can't stop being in pain. i know it's not as out right as terminal cancer or a more promin birth defect or something. but I'm in constant mental pain all the same. and maybe in the future they'll find a way to fix this for me and so many others. or they'll have a humane and understood way to let us pass with dignity and control over my own body... it's a disease that's taken everything from me. it's so unfair. it's unfair for so many and I'm happy to be drowned out by so many other cries of pain, so many others screaming and reaching out.. i just had to say this and i won't dare to speak for anyone else anymore, but i am not a monster capable or killing someone else. if i had the option i would just disappear and disintegrate. just because my only option to not live anymore is suicide doesn't mean i want to kill myself. it's just what I'm forced to do because there's no other way to not live anymore.
