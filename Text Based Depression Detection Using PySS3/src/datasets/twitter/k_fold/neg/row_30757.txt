I need helpHello idk what to do rn I think I should post this here. I'm only 15 but I've lost a person who I've loved more than anyone due to suicide earlier today. I have no idea what to do with myself. My relationship with this person was close to a full blown relationship but he wanted to meet first which can't happen now. I can't even open my eyes as I see things that remind me off him and I am scared. I seriously don't know what to do can I have help?
