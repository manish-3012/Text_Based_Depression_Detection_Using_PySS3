Life is getting more and more difficult...I have to fix the damage others did to me, just like I have to fix my own mistakes as well.

And if I don't do it, then that means I would stay wallowing in my own misery for the rest of my days.

Both roads will be difficult. It's pretty much: "You have to change and fix everything, otherwise you'll be fucked up for the rest of your days".

It's like I have to earn everything again, I have to earn the right to be happy again, unlike other people, whom they get happiness just by existing.

I don't react well to most people's kindness, it's like I can't comprehend it... I didn't accept some instances where people offered me their friendship, or when they at least wanted to know me, because I was afraid of being roasted again.

And look where that got me.
