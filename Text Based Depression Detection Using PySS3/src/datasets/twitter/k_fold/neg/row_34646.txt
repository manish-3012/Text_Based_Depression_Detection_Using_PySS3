I do want to die. But I donâ€™t want to want to die.I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m going to be able to articulate this right. I wanna die, not sure if by suicide or if Iâ€™m just hoping for a freak accident but Iâ€™m getting pretty sure that things would just be easier if I was dead. The thing is I donâ€™t like that I think that, I feel like I shouldnâ€™t want to die and so Iâ€™m upset that I do. 

I told my close friends a month or two ago about my feelings on the matter and they were saddened to hear it and all promised theyâ€™d come visit if I needed them. And instead of taking them up on the offer Iâ€™m pushing them away, and being mean so that theyâ€™d miss me less if I do go. But thatâ€™s the ting I donâ€™t know if isolating myself is voluntary because I want them to come see me and I want to be close to them. But for whatever reason I seem to be choosing to push them away and I donâ€™t know why?

I guess what Iâ€™m saying is that I do want to die and so am making preparations towards that. But part of me doesnâ€™t want to be doing that and doesnâ€™t want to die, but itâ€™s a minorityâ€™s and is losing the fight. I guess itâ€™s that part thatâ€™s making this post atm because I guess I want to know how to turn not wanting to want to kill yourself into wanting to live.

Iâ€™ve not gone into the reasons I want death as I low key couldnâ€™t be bothered/ idk what the rant will really achieve. If you seem to think it would help if I posted it let me know and I will. I know this isnâ€™t as urgent as other posts and yea it isnâ€™t, I donâ€™t have any formal plans to kill myself, but I feel like it may be coming soon and I want to nip it in the bud before it comes to that.

Thanks
