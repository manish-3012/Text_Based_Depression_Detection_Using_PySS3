Don't lie.While I may not be feeling suicidal anymore.. or right now, don't say that you care. Don't lie. Don't pretend you care about a random person. It gets better, but that's what everyone says. I assure you, our OPs here don't want to hear "it'll get better" because it's all they're told. They want a friend. They want someone to be there.
