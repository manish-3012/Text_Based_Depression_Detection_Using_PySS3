Something I wrote. And something I feel more often then I'd like.Had the words existed and my voice been found, 
I could speak of how I felt.
But this pain builds deep inside and now I feel
There's nothing left.
Dual streams of dysphoria leave paths down to my chin
This void begins within my chest and my head starts to spin

I'm all alone deep in my thoughts
of which none should have to see.
Creeping pessimism taunts, 
I'm at the edge of sanity
Optimism lost its hold, aversion lets me fall
Perseverance was left untold, poised psycopathy applauds

What can be done when nothing feels right?
How can I face the day?
There's nothing left inside of me
Save for regret and shame

Overwhelmed with pain
Haunted by disdain
Losing to my fate
As I pray to the blade...


(I know it's not very good but I wrote what I felt and I still feel this way a lot. I desperately want it to stop but it doesn't seem to want to leave. I can push it away for months at a time, but some days it forces itself back on me and my entire world is crushed for as long as it takes to drown it out again.

Anyway, thanks for reading. And if you have something to say, I'd really like to hear it, as these feelings have returned once again to tear at my mind and soul and happiness.)
