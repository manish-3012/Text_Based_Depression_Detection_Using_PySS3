I'm not sure what to do.I'll get to the point, my wife and I have been married for over 4 years. When we first met she was kind, confident, and independent. Slowly over the years she has become despondent and is having mood swings. Since we got married she hasn't had a job. putting a lot of stress on me for money. She gets angry at me for reasons I don't know. She is always putting herself down and she sleeps for hours and hours on end. She just started anti depressants but they seem to be making her have anxiety attacks. 
Like today, she found out she needs to go into town and give someone something and I had told her I just felt like staying home since I'm really tired, she acted like it wasn't a big deal until after she left. She texted me letting me know she has having an anxiety attack. So I start rushing to get into town, and I tell her this and she says it doesn't matter because she'll be back by the time I get there anyways. And she proceeds to calling me an idiot. When I ask why she's angry at me, she tells me that she is always angry at me. I just don't know what to do. I love her but I honestly am so depressed to have my life end up this way. I keep thinking about an easy way just to end it. 
I'm so tired of having to do things the hard way the whole time. Nothing is ever cut and dry going to happen for me, I'm a photographer who takes mediocre pictures, I have a wife that is cold and co-dependent, and a job where everyone screams at me all day (Tech support for cable company). I just don't know what to do.
