I Hate MyselfI'm a very masculine looking teenager (16). But I'm gay. most of the time anyways. I even have a girlfriend (we started dating while i was still in denial). I haven't told anyone. I don't think I will, no one will look at me the same, what would be the upside? I'm not really allowed to be sad or act feminine because I look manly and I'm known as the happy guy. I can't help myself, I totally support gay rights and the lgbt community, but for some reason, I hate myself for being gay. I get a pit in my stomach just thinking about it. I love my friends and family, and they support the lgbt community to, but I don't think they would understand. Being gay shouldn't change how they view me or my personality, but I don't think I could be the same person or 'one of the guys' if I'm gay. It's not their fault, but I know they would hate me (or at least they wouldn't think of me the same way) if they found out. I just want to be straight. I don't want to kill myself, and i probably wont, but I've gotten close before. Anyways, thanks for your time, just wanted to put that out there somewhere. Have a nice day!
