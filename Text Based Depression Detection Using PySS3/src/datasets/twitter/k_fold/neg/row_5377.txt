What to do What to do......I've lead a pretty good life as a 25 year old white male. But there's something I've never told anybody, not even my brothers. I am a pedophile. Though I have never actually engaged 8n nor have I possessed any pedophilia, I am constantly bombarded by fantasies and imaginations when I am out in public. I find my thoughts and emotions tending more towards the sociopathic, I'm afraid I will eventually do something. I can't bear the thought of my family ever seeing this side of me. I think I should end it, before it's too late.
