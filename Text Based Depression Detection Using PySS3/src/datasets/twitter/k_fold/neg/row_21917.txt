I canâ€™t stand my mother. My school. I deserve death.My mom is such an angry person. She is always on my back about everything, and even if I enjoy just a couple moments of video games, she yells at me. I donâ€™t do anything to upset her. I have good grades in school, I have good friends who I see after school. But going home feels shitty now. I have nowhere else to go after Iâ€™m done hanging out, and now I must go home and my mom yells at me, even when I do nothing wrong. I explain myself, and she wonâ€™t ever listen.

Iâ€™m trapped. Nothing is good right now. I want to enjoy life like a normal person but I canâ€™t because my mom yells at me so often for everything. Iâ€™m sorry for whatever I do. My brother is never yelled at, but I always am. I hate being yelled at for everything, so I may as well just end myself.

I donâ€™t know how to solve anything. She is so angry, so immensely selfish, too. She asks me to do everything for her, such as going out to somebodies place who I donâ€™t even know, and if I say I feel uncomfortable, I get yelled at. She blames her mother for everything she does, her mother is more angry than my own. I looked up how to kill myself, and an app she uses which lets her see everything on my phone allowed her to see me look up how I can kill myself, for her to yell at me. She made it about her, no concern about me wanting to kill myself. 

I want to get help, I canâ€™t handle living with her, considering how much she treats me like shit. Iâ€™m done, I donâ€™t want to live just to be an insignificant waste of life, nothing matters in the future anyways. I might as well kill myself so my mother can live with a painful emotional scar that will haunt her for the rest of her life for making me feel like worthless trash. I hate school as well. I want to exist more than just please a teacher, then get thrown into life where I will be helping with nothing, my work which will be replaced in the far future. I hate so much of everything. I donâ€™t know what to so.
