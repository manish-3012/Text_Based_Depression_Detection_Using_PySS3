I am so done with life I just don't know what to do I really don't want to liveI am 15 years old in grade 10 studying from CBSE board and so basically since last year I have been having many issues with my parents and on top all the stress from school so basically last year during my summer vacations I had a huge fight with my dad and I did say some pretty bad stuff and then eventually it got better and we were both fine then in my final exams for grade 9 i had failed every singel exam for french tthat whole entier year and if I passed in that final at least I would have gotten a decent grade like maybe a D or a C but I failed that exam too so I had to write a retest for french but well i failed that too and some how even i dont know I passed grade 9 and i am in grade 10 so CBSE decides that they should have full portiions for the final exams and for our board exams well because they want to produce better quality students froom CBSE well increesing the amount you study doesnt improve the quality first try to have good quality teachers who can acctually teach unlike most teachres especially in our school so ow there is this strees of the full portions for the first time because well last year we didnt have full portions and we have no experience with it. and your grade 10 makrs decide what streem you will get and i want to take science with maths and for that you need to get at least 75%in both science and maths and arround 75 overall and here i am i cant do anything in my unit test i scored very bad i hadnt gotten more than 26 in any subject and these exams were out of 40 and in my halfyearlys ii scored very bad as well  and the problem is that i work hard i put in everything i can and i know everything but i am not abel to write what is in my head on paper my marks dont refect my hard work and knowledge  and also my spellings are very bad and manytimes i dont understand what i read and i am very bad at reading i panic a lot i start panicking for no reason at all this happend 3 times to me and i have these 2 really really nice peopel whome i hardly even knew but are ready to help me they both have helped my a lot like just 2 days back i had my english exam and i started panicking and i didnt know what to do because i felt if i went up to their class something bad would happen so luckiely one of my friend came in the class i told her to go call one of them and then he came and he calmed me down honestly i have never seen this good peopel so yeah i panick a lot especially before my exams and sometimes during my exam and mess up and the on top of the other problems that i have so when i told  these 2 peopel they were like you should go to the councellor so thenhe probably sw the scared look on my face and then he was like ok ill take u there do we go to the councellor and well i tell her all the issues i have been having related to school and well she indirectly tells me that she cant do anything about it and my grade 10 marks just depend on me and my efforts and the also told me some more shit but well i was panicking and then after that he drops me to my class and well i was panicking for a good 45 after i get into my class i feel that the councellor doesnt take me seriously becaouse she was my councellor when i was small an di had the same issue related too studies and she didnt help me much back then and even now and my family also doesnt take me seriously and one of them suggested for me to get a councellor out of school but i dont know how to tell this to anyone or if anyone will even take me seriously so i asked one of them to tell my rother about it to then tell my dad about it and i feel that i am the most tupid person that exists and honesly i wanna die i dont want to break my dream of being an astrophysisist and getting a nobel prize but right now everything just seems to be breaking apart and i can see my dreams break right in front of my eyes and i really dont know what to do
