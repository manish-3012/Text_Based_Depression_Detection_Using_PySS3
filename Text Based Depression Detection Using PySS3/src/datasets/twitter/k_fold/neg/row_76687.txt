I don't know what to doI've been depressed for as long as I can remember, and I've been thinking about killing myself to get away from it. I just don't know how to kill myself, you know? What would be the best/easiest way out?

It's not just depression that's making me want to, I am a huge failure, burden to my family, nothing going for me, and I just HATE living. This is the first time I am seriously considering it, because I am just fed up, I am not and never will be prepared for what life has to throw at me. Anxiety always gets the better of me, I hate almost everyone around me.

What is it stopping me? I don't want this anymore.
