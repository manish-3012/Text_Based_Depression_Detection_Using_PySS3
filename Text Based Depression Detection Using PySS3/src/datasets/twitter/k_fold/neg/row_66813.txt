I want to shove a box of rusty nails down the throat of my childhood selfTo my childhood self,

Fuck you for being an effeminate little boy that made you such an easy target. You could have interesting in ANY FUCKING WAY yet you had to be just a fucking vanilla ass piece of shit in the corner for people to show and shoot shit at. You thought it would make you into a stronger, more interesting person, but it just made you more quiet, more boring and easier to ignore.

Fuck you for remembering the physical and emotional abuse your dad did to you and your family.

Fuck you for letting your mom run her little experiments on your body like some sort of lab rat.

Fuck you for speaking out about your suffering when you did. Going to the adults really improved your life and didn't just make your abusers hate you more while they got off with slaps on the wrist, huh?

Fuck you for remembering your childhood, especially only the bad parts. I'm 25 now and am just now experiencing these again, and you have no idea what sort of hell I'm in getting these vague memories again and again. This is YOUR FAULT!

I want you dead like how I want me dead. I want you to suffer way more than you ever had before just so you won't survive and I don't have to experience it anymore. I don't hold a fraction of this malice and those horrible wishes to anyone but you, but you're the only person in this world that deserves to suffer until you're ash. Kill yourself so you can kill me, too.
