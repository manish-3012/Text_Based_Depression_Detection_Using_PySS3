Tiny rantI realize how fucking conceited this sounds and that I have no real right to your attention. But the weight is getting too fucking heavy. First of all a disclaimer, I have literally no right to be fucking depressed. There has been nothing in my past but support. I have a financially stable future, pretty much no matter how badly I fuck up. My family loves me and would be very supportive if they knew.  So there is no real reason for me being down. But nevertheless I do no longer see the fucking point. Today I spent an hour staring at a wall and thinking of different ways to kill myself. Even in the supermarket I could not think about anything else. Food is just a chore, just like anything else. I do have friends who I could call, but I wonâ€™t. Not because they would not care but because I do not want to burden them. I do not have the simple right to depression or to these suicidal thoughts and they should not worry someone else. And before anyone says that everyone has the rights, I know that in theory everyone can get depressed or down. But for a white male who is financially and culturally so goddamn privileged, it does not check out. And yet I will probably not off myself. I could not do that to my family and to my loved ones. But that does not take the need or the drive away. Therapy would be a good move but even that feels like failing for me. The problem is that I do not feel like I deserve your pity or your compassion. This has probably been a huge waste of your time. And yes this whole thing has been pretty fucking conceited and I feel like a fucking brat after writing it. But maybe Iâ€™ll share it just to get it of my fucking chest. Sorry for the cursing and my apologies for any grammatical errors. English is not my first language.
