Tonight was a bad night.I cut again tonight. I had just over two months with out cutting, but I'm so low right now.
I'm going to try to kill myself this weekend. Parents will be out of town, I'm going to build a zip gun, go down to an old bridge on the river, get really drunk, high as fuck, and then shoot myself. If the shot doesn't kill me (which, given my track record of failure, seems likely), I'll fall into the river and drown.
