I am incomplete health wise. My quality of life is 0. I have lost confidence and i am always afraidI am 22 years old. I got erectile dysfunction last year.
I have lost all of my confidence.

I am constantly thinking about what will i do in life?
Will i be able to settle and have a family?
Will someone accept me?
Should i tell my parents?
But it will break there heart and the are old and will get depressed?
.

No proper medication can help me, just some Artificial ways.
I cannot focus in my work life and i am getting beaten there as well
I never thought my life would come to this. I lost all my dreams of being and entrepreneur, opening and NGO..etc. I am alone and suffering. I am scared that if people will know about me then they will leave me which is true. I cannot contain this sadness and i cannot tell people about my problem as well otherwise they will leave me.
Funny how life turns around all of a sexond just when you thought that you have figured out about life.

I wish i had a second chance
