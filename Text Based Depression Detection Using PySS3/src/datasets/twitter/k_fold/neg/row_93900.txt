I donâ€™t know anymoreI just feel like dying.... Iâ€™ve had a history of past suicidal situations, and I just want someone to care yâ€™know?  I was sitting on out my apartment window earlier and all I could think of is â€œwould this jump kill me?â€ And even saying it out loud in a room full of people and nobody even asked if I was okay... does anyone even care? My fiancÃ© looked at me and then turned around  to go play with our daughter... does she even want me here? Would she be better off if I was dead?
