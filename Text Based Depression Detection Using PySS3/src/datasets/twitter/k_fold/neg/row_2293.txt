My life fell apart, what now?I love my girlfriend.. Ex... Girlfriend. I love her so much I have fought to keep living to be with her. Tonight after a rough night of work her mother picks me up with all my stuff in the back. I'm currently at a women's shelter and my head is hurting so much from the crying I can't remember half of tonight. Its a struggle right now to not end it, and what's keeping me going is the hope I can be with her again. She is.. To fall into mushy relationship banter, my soul mate. She completes me. Please, any advice on how to proceed and words of strength to keep it up are gratefully accepted. I need them now more than ever. Thank you all.
