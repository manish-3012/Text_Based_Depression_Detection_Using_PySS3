I probably won't do it but considering. I cheated on my SO, she's leaving (rightfully so), and I'm staring at a loaded 12 gauge on my coffee table.First of all I mean no disrespect to people who have dealt with much harder problems than this.  However, I feel like I'm considering this and would like to talk to someone anonymously.  I lost someone who took their own life a few years ago, so I know how serious this is.  I don't really know what else to say but I think this may be the answer.  If anybody else has dealt with this as a result of guilt from something they've done I'd like to hear from you.  Thanks.
