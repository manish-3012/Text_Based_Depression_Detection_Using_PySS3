Why does it take me suiciding to let people of this world know that I'm not invisible?Why?

So I did try suicide by car, leaving it in run while I await death. Didn't work the first time, obviously. But I'm trying again today and again on Friday cause right now I don't 'have the guts' to jump or shoot myself like my rapist told me. My days consist of painful suicide methods that either fail and I sleep the rets of, wake up and try a different one hoping I won't fail to have to wake up another day.

I had my fair share of trying to do XYZâ€”all as failed, all are tired of me, and (passively) want me to do it already. At least then, not only will I be free of this, they can also not worry about my weight.

No amount of "talking" this or that will shift my mind, I'm become determined to do this. These are simply my versions of last diary entries. The only thing I drop down on hard paper is name of my rapist. That's all you need to know after I finally succeed. Eventually one of these days I might shoot or jump, but for now I'm trying to go the less messy route.
