lonelyi am so incredibly loney. all i really know is my job, when i go home there is nothing waiting for me, nothing motivates me any more and i am not looking forward to anything.

i have been wanting to end my life for quite a while but i have been overwhelmed by guilt every time i think about it. i feel so sorry for how my parents will react when they learn about my death (i cannot talk to them about things like this, they have never been good at handling emotions). so i have realized that i live basically because of guilt. guilt keeps me alive and i am tired of being sad all the time. i want to end this
