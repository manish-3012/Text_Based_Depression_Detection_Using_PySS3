Bleeding in PublicI don't know how much longer I can do this. I'm not okay. I've been crying every day for so long. I know how stupid it is to get this knotted up about a woman but I don't think it's just the loss of her, it's the loss of validation, the feeling that for once someone saw me as something other than a freak or a mistake. I married twice and I have 2 kids. I feel like an infection, like I'm the sickness they've contracted. I didn't love either woman I married as much as I love the woman I've lost. I feel fucked up and unclean. I don't want to kill myself. I know how that would affect my daughters. But I don't want to be alive. They would be better off without me. I want to go back to Iraq and just die in the desert. No one would miss me. I cut my wrist when I was 18 or something. I wanted to bleed all over my dad who was sleeping in the living room. I wanted to show him I wasn't okay. I needed help. No one wanted to help me. People are intimidated by my weakness. I went outside and waited because I called the paramedics. I tried 2 knives and they wouldn't cut my vein so I gave up. I sat in my front yard bleeding and waiting. My neighbor came out, and I waved. She waved back, scared to death. That's me every day right now. She made me feel ok. I loved her, but she didn't know, not at first. She was a friend and I put my feelings aside because she was married. She had an affair with my best friend at the time, I later found out. I felt pretty raw about that. I still do. I wondered why not me. The same as now. She divorced her guy, we dated, she's just fallen out of love. And I'm not ok. I'm bleeding every day, waving, looking for someone to talk to and everyone is scared to death of engaging me. I want something terrible to happen to me because I feel like I'm dying every day but it won't ever actually be over.
