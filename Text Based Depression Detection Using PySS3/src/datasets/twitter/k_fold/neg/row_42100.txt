Just Missed out on over 100k+ earnings on the stock market, canâ€™t even think straight or go to work Iâ€™m so upset, thinking about just ending it nowtitle, Iâ€™m a retard and watching everyone make gains while I lose money and wish I was dead, might just throw in all my money just to see what happens and kill my self at this point, life is rigged
