I honestly do not know where to turnI'm supposed to graduate college in five days. supposed to. I'm waiting for a final few "make or break" grades for one class. if I don't graduate college, I know how disappointed my family would be in me. all of them. and honestly, i'm not sure that i WILL graduate. i've come to the conclusion that if i don't graduate, the easiest thing to do would be to commit suicide. i can't face my family, who have all graduated in four years or less from ivy's, about this. my mental health has taken an enormous toll on my academics, but i've done everything i need to in order to graduate. it comes down to one professor's grades on two assignments. i'm lost and don't know where to go. i feel like if i don't graduate, my family will never think of me the same again. i can't face that kind of disappointment. i'm so fucking scared, but i feel i have no other option and i don't know where else to go
