Iâ€™m no longer living a life worth leading.I had so much potential, I had so much talent in music, in being a leader, in my spirituality, in my charisma. But I fucked it all up. My latest break up has damaged me and my spirit irreparably, it was a twin flame relationship and i fucked up so badly towards the end of the relationship. I gave away way to much of my power towards the end of the relationship, I cannot let her go. I have nothing else to go on, my sister has been living at my expense and been poisonous to me ever since Iâ€™ve been born. My dad is an alcoholic and since the divorce he basically disowned me. I have no foundation, no friends, my mental health is horrible. Itâ€™s time to go, Iâ€™m no longer serving a purpose. I would be turning 27 in July, lots of spiritual changes happen around this age. I guess Iâ€™m kinda joining the 27 club.

If I can leave you guys with anything, itâ€™s to choose LIFE. In any situation you get yourself in ask yourself if youâ€™re choosing life, or death, and donâ€™t really mean this in literal terms but figuratively. Choose to be strong, stay away from drinking and drugs, I loved my life so much when I was sober. Follow your instincts, and appreciate your opportunities, donâ€™t take them for granted because I did and no Iâ€™m out of them, I do not have any redeemable aspects to myself I am a lost cause. Choose life.
