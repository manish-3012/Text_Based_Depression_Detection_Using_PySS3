I regret ever being bornI didnt choose life. My parents are really great and  wonderful people, but I'd be lying if I said a small part of me doesn't resent them since they created me. The only thing stopping me from committing suicide is I am religious and I am scared to go to hell. Yes, I know people will tell me "oh hell isn't real it's all fake", well in my mind it is as real as anything I've ever seen with my eyes, there is no convincing me otherwise. So, I am scared to end my life, but I hate actually living my life. I am just trapped and there is no escape. There is nothing  I can do. I just wish I was never born.
