Has anyone else actively taught themselves how to commit suicide?I spent a few days learning how to efficiently tie a noose with a rope and how to properly suspend it. We have strict gun laws in the country I live in so thatâ€™s not an option but i have also spent time researching how effective certain drugs are in stopping your breathing during an overdose and the various different lethal dosages. I feel itâ€™s important (for myself personally and only myself) that I have the knowledge and skills to remove myself from this world on my own accord. Iâ€™m not advocating it or saying that itâ€™s a good thing to do because it isnâ€™t but when your suffering reaches that point, you need a way out.
