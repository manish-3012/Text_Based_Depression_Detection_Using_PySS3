I'm going to try one more time to have a nice day. Tomorrow is my deadlineI guess it's clichÃ© but I'm just "so tired"... 
I've tried so hard, I've stayed smiling and held back the pain when my loved ones are around. 

I've exercised, tried getting help, tried fixing my diet, got healthy, tried new hobbies, rediscovered old ones etc. Its weird. I'd describe myself as a usually happy person.. But now, when I'm not doing something or I'm alone at home and my mind is idle, the world becomes black and I'm wanting it to end again. 
I tried.. 

Tomorrow will be nice though, I'm going to play video games with my best friend. After that I'll buy some of my favorite food and go visit my mum and play with the family dog. Then I'm going to have a beer and go fishing. Maybe after that I'll come home and play some more games.


After that, I'm going to sit and see how I feel. If I'm still choking from the constant and crushing pain and sadness then I'll go and end it. But I'll be happy to go because I know I tried everything to be OK. 



Its strange.. I kind of feel relieved that I actually have made some sort of decision now instead of having the anxiety of " I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO". now I know, which feels kinda nice for a change



I don't know why I'm posting here.. I feel alone. I usually love my own company and never get lonely but tonight is different i guess.
