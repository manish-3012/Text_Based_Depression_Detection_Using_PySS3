A message of HopeHi there everyone, I am new to reddit and see that there are so many groups I can relate and share my experiences with. Experiences that I have found resolution in dealing with, and share with those who need it most. I am not here to spam, but simply deliver a message I sincerely hope is well received. Thank you all.

My name is Eric Michael, and like so many others, I am a survivor of Trauma. I have spent the entirety of my life keeping my head above water. I was raised by a narcissistic, sociopathic psychiatrist, and his drug-addicted, mentally ill patient, my Mother. As a child, I experienced the monstrously cruel acts of rape, molestation, neglect, abandonment, as well as constant physical, mental, and emotional abuse. Until finally finding myself at the edge of fighting both drug-addiction and mental illness. It has taken me a very long time, and across even tougher terrain to come to a point where I have been able to confront, accept, and find salvation for my experiences. I have written of these tragedies so many of us share, the hurdles I have overcome, and the resolution discovered within the suffering, in order to share that message with those who need it most. With the help of my illustrator, close friend, loving Father, and fellow Trauma survivor, together we have brought that story to life through painfully beautiful recollections and captivating motion graphics of imagination, seen through the eyes of the battered child. With your help, we would like to both share and deliver this message of the Heroâ€™s journey with the world, fight hand in hand, find acceptance for our pasts, and move forward, together.
