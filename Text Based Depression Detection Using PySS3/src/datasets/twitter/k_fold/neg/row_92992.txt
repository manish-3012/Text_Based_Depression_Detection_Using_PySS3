The lack of money and struggling to pay my bills makes me think about suicideSo I basically live at college and the frustration at not being able to pay my bill just makes me cry. Colleges donâ€™t really care if Iâ€™m homeless and they say stuff like â€œtake a year offâ€ Thanks, Susan. I could then just go back to the homeless shelter, a utter nightmare of a place, and just hope the homeless men donâ€™t rape me. 
I honestly would rather be dead then go back there and every time I think  about my situation with my college I just start thinking about how to kill myself.
Iâ€™m just so tired and tired of being alone and having no one to help me. And Iâ€™m mad at myself and Iâ€™m sick of all the â€œit will work out in the endâ€ When does the end happen?!
The last time I tried to commit suicide was years ago when I was living in a shelter the first time, and I kept regretting getting talked down from it. And I thought that my life was finally getting a little better after I got my 2 year degree, but then I had to go to a 4 year school because it was my only option. Then I didnâ€™t work for 4 months and my life got worse.
I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m doing anything anymore!
