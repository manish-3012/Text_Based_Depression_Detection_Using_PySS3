I'm 16, have a loving family, don't have any money problems either but i still feel empty and want to end my mental miseryI am gay and haven't told anyone. I live in a country where it isn't excepted and i believe and follow a religion which says that people who participate in gay activities should be stoned to death on a tall building and that they will forever rot in hell. But i still firmly follow it.

My family is religious so i feel like they would change their attitude towards me if i came out and i feel like if i do come out and they show any other emotion other than acceptance I'll start begging them to kill me or just kill myself.

 I feel like I'm never meant to be happy. Forever lonely putting on a mask to prevent people from coming in.  Its not like I'm never happy... it's just that most times when i feel happy its only temporary and its only a matter of time before i break down again. and then there's college and studies being there to bash me down further. I can't bring myself to start studying and that makes me scared that i will turn into a failure.

I feel like coming out might fix my suicidal urges but there's an equal chance that it might lead to me killing myself...i want to leave this country and be alone but i also love my family too much to leave...and leaving will still only be possible if i can force myself through college and university and actually be able to earn for myself.
