Feel like Iâ€™m going to kill myself over my student loansTl;dr: probably going to kill my self over my student loans 

Whatâ€™s the point. I went to school to get a good job so I wouldnâ€™t have to stress about money. My parents gave me some really poor guidance and even though I told them I didnâ€™t want to go to law school they basically forced it on me. Now Iâ€™m 220,000 in student debt and make about 90k. I work at a big tech company and also have stocks and a bonus, but honestly Iâ€™m not even saving for my future have no money in my savings have to sell all my shit and there is no end in sight. I think my loans will probably prevent me from marrying my current BF who is the the absolute love of my life. Iâ€™m truly considering killing myself because whatâ€™s the point. Iâ€™m basically living in poverty with no end in sight and I hate my job but canâ€™t quit because how will I afford my loans. Iâ€™m 32 and feel like Iâ€™ll never be able to have a house a child or get married. I canâ€™t even push forward on anything I need to do, my life is joyless because of my debt. Suicide seems like my only answer. I need relief. I need it so badly.
