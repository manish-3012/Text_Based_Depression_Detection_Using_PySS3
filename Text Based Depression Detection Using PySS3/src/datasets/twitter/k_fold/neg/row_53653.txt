At the end of everythingI have zero family. I left school at 16 as a runaway. I worked for as long as I could but at 32 I'm without a job because of lack of transportation. The transit in my town is limited and I cannot afford a vehicle, I can pay my rent and my bills but then there is nothing left. I was randomly let go from my job a month ago because I could not get into work 30 minutes before my shift. I do not have close friends because I am shy and spent my youth being bullied, and beaten for living out of a hotel and wearing out of style clothing. My mother was in prison while cops left me with her pedo, drug fueled husband. I spent time as a street kid getting raped in multiple places...now that I'm without a job and about to be homeless I can feel that trauma all over again and I just wanted to say goodbye because I don't have it in me to beg and apply for resources. I have nothing left in me, soon this phone will be cut off and there is just nothing out there for me. I wish everyone all the happiness in the world. Please be thankful for you family and friends that love you. I think this is the end of everything for me. I have no tact or energy to make this more understandable, I just want people to appreciate what they have and to love each other. I'm going to wrap my arm in a towel so I don't make a colossal mess when this is over. Goodbye. Best wishes, from a girl who meant nothing to no one.
