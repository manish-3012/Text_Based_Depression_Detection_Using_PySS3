When itâ€™s overI really hope and pray that all the people I loved and lost to death especially the untimely ones are there to greet me thatâ€™s the only thing that calms my fear is imagining the people who I loved that died before me are all there together and available for me to spend time with again. If I were certain Iâ€™d have left this earth  already. But like most of us Iâ€™m too scared to do it and I think of the people Who do care about me and how Iâ€™d be hurting them plus Iâ€™m dying from sickle cell anyway I donâ€™t know how many years I have left bc I asked not to be told so I just have to live until Iâ€™m done anyway Iâ€™m all over the place thanks for listening back to my PlayStation and good luck to my fellow thread mates or subredditors idk Iâ€™m new to reddit donâ€™t know the lingo yet
