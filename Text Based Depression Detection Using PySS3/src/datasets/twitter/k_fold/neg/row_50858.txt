My entire day has been me thinking about hanging myselfI posted for the first time last night, here's that post if you need some context(I don't have the energy to elaborate on certain details): https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fgpy38/feeling_low_have_thought_about_ending_it/

So I tried distracting myself today by going to a resource center for my learning disability. Want to get into work and eventually go to college.
It was good while it lasted but I had to walk home which took around 3 hours...it gave me too much time alone to just think. If it wasn't bad enough that every vehicle that rushed by was a potential friend to jump at in my head I saw every light pole and tree as a spot to set up the noose.
By the time I got home I was exhausted.
I used to walk as a way of clearing my head, now all it provides is opportunities for me to turn into a lemming.
I took the advice of my best friend and finally managed to get an appointment in for therapy. Problem is it's on the 19th and could get canceled due to the spread of the Coronavirus(sorry to bring that pile of shit up but it could actually affect me in my attempts to get helped).
I keep thinking about my friend H. Ever since they cut ties with me I've felt bruised, light headed as if my head could float off my body and physically heavy. It's unnerving and I want this to go away.
I wondered about not only how strong certain branches are but weirdly enough how scenic it was. If I'm gonna end it I want to hang myself
A. At a hight that will almost guarantee death(no shit, sorry).
B. At a place that I feel calm in, somewhere I can forget about all of the pain and at that pristine moment jump off.
