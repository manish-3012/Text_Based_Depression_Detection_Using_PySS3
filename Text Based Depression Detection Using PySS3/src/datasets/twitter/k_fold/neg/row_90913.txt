I hope they all succeed...even if I'm not sure how much longer I'll be around to see it, or the scene grow.

I'm sorry, guys. It was a decent performance I was able to put on in exchange for your art. I'd miss all of ya. 

But this latest nightmare from my memories just... Broke me. I had forgotten about it all these years, and today it was brought back. Just when I felt safe again, I'm reminded that I never can be. 

Like I never was.

I tried. Just know I tried so goddamned hard. I might have slipped at times, but dammit, I tried hard at this life thing. I've hit too many walls, and it feels like soon I might fall.
