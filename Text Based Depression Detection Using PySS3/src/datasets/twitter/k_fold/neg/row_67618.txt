For the people left behind. Honestly i have never understood mourning like i guess that makes me a fucked up person broken missing a vital piece. The thing of it is even as a teen my grandpa died and hell he lived with us yet when he passed all i did was play video games not giving a fuck while the party after the funeral went on. Last year my other grandpa died I did not feel a god damned thing nothing. My coworker murdered was so cold about it i was called a freak by my other coworkers. So how the flying fuck am i supposed to understand when someone tells me it will make them sad if i die HOW! 

Honestly i don't get it for all of you left behind please tell me why is it so sad? Why do you care how do i learn to care how do i become normal?
