The lemonade will still taste bad if life gives you 
rotten lemonsSo I have problems, problems with my life and the way I think. My life is a story of failures and setbacks. A story of me being a burden to my family. A tale that I am not sure I want to continue to live in. I was born with cleft lip and palate in South Korea. That is the begining of my story and a big reason for my anguish. My mother, who I have only have a name of, discarded me. I can not feel a lot of anger towards her, she may have been poor, unable to manage the costs but I can feel anger against the lottery of life. I went to a great family in my new country but the pain of knowing that somewhere I have a real family and that if I did not have this bloody deformity my live could had been without a lot of the troubles I have now, is at times too much to handle. I hate it. I hate my life. The only reason to live in is for my adoptive family but I only see myself as a burden. I have been in and out of the hospital after about 15 surgeries. I have cost them so much money that it hurts just thinking about it. I have forced them to do things for me that normal people have no problem with as I am not secure in myself because of the deformity. I think that in the end they would be better off without me. To add to that I have a body that is just useless. I love to do sports. All kinds but my body just breaks down. My knees are bad, my back is bad, my shoulders are really bad. I have problems with my feets, my eyes, my butt and I just get random pain. I don't do sports anymore, I am just unable to. I can not even use a bicycle without getting exhausted after 30 meters because of my knees. I loved to bicycle but then I just couldn't do it anymore. The story of my life. The only thing I have is an intellect above the average but not much, I can think a bit faster than the average person but not enough for me to excell in anything. This hurts a lot as I have put a lot of pressure on myself to become something. Not because my family pushes me but because I want to succeed for them. To make them feel proud of me but I don't know if I am able to, if I have the ability to become something more. I feel completly useless, like waste of the human race. I truly wish that I could fix a lot of these things, with effort. I study like a maniac right now to go through but it feels like I fall more behind the further I try to get. I went to Korea a year ago, to find myself and my past, all I found was more pain, there was nothing about my family and in the end I fled home, knowing that if I stayed I would just sink deeper. I will never get rid of the cleft lip and palate , it will always bother me and my mind is forever scarred because of it. My social skills are just worthless. I don't go out to parties, the only good thing that comes out of that is that I don't drink but not much else. I have never ever even been close to get a girlfriend. It doesn't bother me now, I have other things to think about but I can not ignore that with my totally lack of everything, I could possibly never get one. I hate it, I hate the cleft lip palette, I hate that it ripped me away from my country, that it made me a foreigner in my own land. I hate who I am and what I am missing. I have always tried to do the right thing but life only gives me wrong back.  The powerlessness that I feel is crushing me, I wish i could fix it, that I could make lemonade out of the lemons. But all the lemons life gives me are rotten. Another rotten one and I'm not sure I want to do more lemonade.
