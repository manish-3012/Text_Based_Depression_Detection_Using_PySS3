Am I suicidal?(Yes I know you aren't professionals) 
   

Hello Reddit. I don't really know how to start this... I have been really depressed lately, ever since I moved back to my hometown from out of state. I have been pretty depressed for about 4 months now.. I don't know when it happened but I noticed I think about killing myself a lot.. I don't think I would ever actually kill myself but I have thought about where and how... I don't know if I'm being dramatic or if it's just a suicidal ideation. I've self harmed in the past and was severely depressed but I got out of it for about a year and now here we are..... I relapsed (I know self harm is a touchy subject just ignore this) I feel like shit all the time, I'm failing classes and I'm probably not going to college because I can't keep up with life.This is some serious first world problems. I'm just here to vent kind of and get others thoughts. I know only I can truly figure out what's going on in my knocker but I just want someone else's take on things... I'm just tired of thinking about suicide everyday.. I hate the fact that I planned it out because I could never see myself doing it. I think of it as a sort of "plan b" for life and it's horrible I hate myself for it. Tell me what you think of this, am I suicidal? Or just being silly
