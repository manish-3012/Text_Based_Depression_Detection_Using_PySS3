.38 snub in my mouthI donâ€™t even know how to start this. I have so many emotions I canâ€™t possibly put it down into one post, itâ€™s so hard to explain. My parents donâ€™t seem to understand, girlfriend doesnâ€™t understand, no one seems to. Ive self medicated for the longest with marijuana and it was working until my girlfriend said it was unhealthy but I donâ€™t want to go back to anti-depressants. At school, everyone is fake man. People striving for things that donâ€™t matter at the end. We all end up 6 feet under and decay. I sometimes wonder if thereâ€™s a god and there is does he love me? With all the dumb shit Iâ€™ve done how could there be a God who loves me... My mom thinks Iâ€™m faking, maybe if I blow my head off in my bath tub maybe sheâ€™ll think twice...... I just donâ€™t know man. Iâ€™m sick and tired of living. But I want to live? Is there a subreddit that people can act as a therapist rather? I think itâ€™s the end for me.
