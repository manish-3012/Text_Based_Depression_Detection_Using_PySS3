There is a noose hung from my closet and a note on my kitchen tableSomeone please give me the courage to go through with this. I am a toxic, manipulative person with an evil somewhere in me that I donâ€™t think can be fixed. I am so tired of the ugliness in this world and I am tired of contributing to it. The only thing I feel I can do to repent is to put myself out of it. Someone please. I need to leave and Iâ€™m scared to do it.
