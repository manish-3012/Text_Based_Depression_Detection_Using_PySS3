Can't breathe.I don't think I can do this. I don't want to see tomorrow. It's just going to be the same pain.

I have a boyfriend that is far too good for me. I don't want to make him have to emotionally support anyone anymore. He needs support too, and I am incapable of being that person.

I'm a failure. In every way. My body is giving up on me. My mind is tricking me. I just want to fade away. I want the deep sleep.

I'm so ashamed of who I am, and I'm so guilty that my parents adopted such a waste of a person. I want it to all go away, but I'm too weak to do that. All I have left in me is the energy to fall asleep crying.

Please, let me go.
