I have no urge to live anymore.I don't know where to start. Pretty much my life is complete shit. As of right now my friends are the only ones who have been keeping me from killing myself. My family treats me like absolute shit and I've tried to share my feelings with them but they just tell me to grow up and get over it. I'm the youngest in my family and my parents expect me to be like my other brothers, but I'm just not like them. Every day I go to school and sit there just waiting for it to end, hating every single second of it. I have no ambition to do well in school or go to college, I feel like living this life is a waste of time. My father is an abusive, asshole who treats me like I'm not even his son. He has abused me several times and one one occasion put me into a headlock where I nearly passed out from suffocation. Everything I have ever wanted in my life I have had to get by myself. (shoes, clothes, sports equipment.) I feel like nobody in my life cares about me except for my friends and I want to end my dreadful existence. I'm 16 and I have no future. Please help me.
