Was looking online for ways to help me repress my suicidal thoughts. Stumbled upon here.... and I gotta say, it's doing quite the opposite for me.

I am by no means an expert on these things, buy this subreddit doesn't seem to really help anyone. Now it might be my fault for reading any of the posts, but right now I just feel like I want to live even less, somehow.

I have very few options since I do not have friends nor any real human contact. Not online, not my parents. 

I don't know what to say since my brain is all over the place. I just want things to end. I don't expect anyone to read this or have anything sensible to say.

im so fucking pathetic lol
