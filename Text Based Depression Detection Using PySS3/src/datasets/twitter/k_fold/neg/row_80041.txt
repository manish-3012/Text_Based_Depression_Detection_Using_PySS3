Struggling to find a reason to keep going.I'm 21 years old living with my mother in poverty in a third world country. My mom's an alcoholic and she has never had a job in her life (living with her parents her entire life until they both died this year) ever since i was kid she's been making my life  living hell. Right now we are running low on money and we need a job to survive but she is still drinking every other day trying to cope with losing her parents.

It's getting harder and harder to not think about suicide. I don't have anything. no friends, no family and i feel like i'll never achieve anything in my lifetime. From now on i'll have to find a job and work 8-10 hour shifts just to keep myself alive, i'll never have the money to go to college and have a good job. i just feel so alone and lost in this world, like it doesn't make sense to keep going. There's nothing to look forward to, i just want this to end.
