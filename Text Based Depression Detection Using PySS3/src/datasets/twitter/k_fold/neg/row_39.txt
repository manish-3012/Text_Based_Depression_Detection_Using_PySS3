SuicideI didnâ€™t plan on overdosing again, as in I figured I would kill myself in a different manner, but with the world as it is, overdosing is looking good. I have the pills ready. Iâ€™ve had â€˜extraâ€™ medication for months now. I have two months of everything I take. I have enough. Now, I must follow through.
Goodbye to everyone!
