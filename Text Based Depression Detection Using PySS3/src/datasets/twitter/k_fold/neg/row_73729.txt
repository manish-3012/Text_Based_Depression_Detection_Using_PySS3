Suicidal thoughts and sleepWhen I think about suicide, it makes it difficult to sleep. How do you manage to sleep when you have suicidal thoughts? Last night, I thought about suicide while in bed and I had trouble getting back to sleep. I woke up to go to the bathroom and shortly after I returned, I started to have those thoughts. Help?
