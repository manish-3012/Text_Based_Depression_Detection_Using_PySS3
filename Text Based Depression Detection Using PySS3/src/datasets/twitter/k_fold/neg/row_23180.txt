I dont even know why I try anymoreMy whole life has been one horrible episode after another. I've never been loved, family nor friend, I've always been just... normal when it comes to others, never remembered, never cared for. Many horrible things happened to me when I was young including being molested and seeing my uncle kill himself, but somehow I managed to make it through that. Honestly I thought I could be happy in life, I found a beautiful woman whom i loved and trusted, and felt she felt the same way. The first person to really care about me, and when it came time for us to move in together after a year of being long distance, she just... vanished, hasn't said anything to our mutual friends, hasn't returned my emails or texts or anything. Honestly I don't know what to do, I have a plane booked and things packed, my family wants me gone and I have no one to  be there when I land now. I don't see why I should even go on, life has been nothing but pain and sadness, and every time it seems to get better, it only gets worse.
