being alive makes me sadi fuck everything up, i worked so hard all my life, only to screw up my future forever. i dont know what to do with myself anymore, i was never given time to find out my passions. my parents wont let me get treatment (and i rely on them for financial needs, so i cant pay for myself. i know, im useless). time is running out for me, i have to decide my whole life NOW and i cant. i just cant. its too much, im too anxious, ill live in regret no matter what i choose. i think i should just end it all, but im scared. my past attempts have been painful and unsuccessful. i need to make sure it works this time. i love my family and my friends, but i fucked my life up too badly this time. i will miss everyone and really wish i didnt ahve to do this :( i will seriously miss those close to me. ahhhh if only i wasnt so stupid , but thats my own fault.
