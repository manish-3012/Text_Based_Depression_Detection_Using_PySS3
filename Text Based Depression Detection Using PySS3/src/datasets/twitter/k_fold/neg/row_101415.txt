Friend seems to be depressed and might think about suicideI'm a part of a small group of people, around 10 guys. Some of us know each other in real life, but most of the time we hang out on Teamspeak or Skype together because we live so far away from each other.

A few months ago, one of our friends, lets call him "B", changed noticeably. We played shooters together from time to time and B heavily focused on stats that didn't mean that much, in the game itself and for us. While we were all about winning or having fun in general, he just focused on this particular stat. Not enough with that, he started to complain about how bad he was compared to some of us (which was kinda "natural" since we had a lot more experience). He also put up himself unreachable goals and was complaining when he wasn't able to achieve them. So exaggerated, he was acting like a chess rookie how isn't satisfied if he can't beat the world elite in less than 30 turns.

We got used to it, made some fun about it, but it was getting worse. We found out that he had a file on his PC were he recorded his statistics from several games and used illogical mathematics to find out, how long he had to play to reach his goals. Even when we stopped playing, he continued. When we asked him "Do you have fun?" or "It's late maybe you should go to sleep" he was like "No, I have to do this first." The peak of this was when he stayed up until 4am to play a game and had an university exam the next day. 

Over the time, we got annoyed. His constant complaining really pissed us off and we stopped playing together. He continued, alone. 

At this point we thought about how he might feel and why this was so important to him. We already told him all the time that those stuffed he focused on doesn't matter at all, but he ignored it. He also told us that he had problems at university, he isn't good at anything, stuff like that. We did what we thought was right, telling him that this is wrong, he indeed is good at something, we compared his life to ours to show him that his own life isn't that bad,etc. Nothing helped and we stopped trying.

He didn't came online that often any more, but we found out other things about him: He thought, if you can't do anything even if you try hard, you are dumb (for example, if you can't draw like van Gogh even if you try, you are dumb). He lost his job as science assistant at university. His mother put much pressure on him since he was a child and it seems he got his "I'm bad at everything" mentality from her. He ended conversations with "I don't want to bother you anymore" even if there wasn't any reason to say that. He said he was thinking about suicide for several years.

And at this point, it turned into something personal for me. I had a depression myself, with suicide wishes and all that stuff, I'm over it. Therefore I see myself as an example that there is way out of it. I kinda know how he is feeling and try to help him based on my own experience but I think I failed at it.
I kept telling him to go to a doctor, but he said he was too busy with university and I think I might have pushed him to much. When I ask him about it he blocks off. 
I would meet him personally, but he lives hundreds of kilometres away. Our group planed a meeting this month, but again he refused to come because of university. 

So, what shall I do? It's hard to contact him because he keeps a so low profile, I can't just go to his home and talk to him. But I still want to help him in any way.

Sorry for the bad english
