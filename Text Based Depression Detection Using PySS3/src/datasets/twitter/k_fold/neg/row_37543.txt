I donâ€™t want anyone to answer, I just want people to know.Iâ€™m doing this because I feel like shit all the time, the person that I thought was supposed to support me and love me, will never do that, they will always make me feel like shit.

I pushed everybody away that mattered because I thought that would make him happy... it never did. 

I canâ€™t feel this way anymore, and he literally tells me to kill myself every day. He literally tells me that I am nothing and I made joke and Iâ€™m a loser, every day. I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I just want to make it through Christmas for my son...but Iâ€™m actually planning it. It scares me...but it also makes me feel free.
