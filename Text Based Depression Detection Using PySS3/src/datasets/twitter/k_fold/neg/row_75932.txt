I want to kill someone.I keep getting urges to kill someone, Iâ€™m not angry just paranoid and sad. I think Iâ€™ll be eased if I kill someone. But I wonâ€™t kill someone else because thatâ€™s bad. Maybe if I knew the person was a horrible person then I could do it. It feels like the world is shifting around me. Is anything real?
