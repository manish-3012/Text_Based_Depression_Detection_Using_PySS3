I give upI think Iâ€™m gonna do it tonight. My mom is refusing to buy me a binder (Iâ€™m cis female but I HATE my chest) and I donâ€™t think she actually cares about me. She wonâ€™t let me do this one thing that will finally let me feel slightly better about my body and appearance. Iâ€™m so fracking done. I canâ€™t believe that I didnâ€™t realize before now that she hates me! I think she ants me to hate myself and how I look. Iâ€™m so done, this is the second time sheâ€™s yelled at me today. We donâ€™t have a lot of money anyway (thatâ€™s not the reason she wouldnâ€™t let me get the binder) so Iâ€™ll be just one less thing they have to pay for if I die
