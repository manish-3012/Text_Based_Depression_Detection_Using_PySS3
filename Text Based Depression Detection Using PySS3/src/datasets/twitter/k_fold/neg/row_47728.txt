Today's the last straw, I'm fed up of this life and I don't want to live through it anymore.I'm fed up, I'm stuck in a city I hate with people I don't fit in with studying a degree that is sucking the soul out of my body and overworking myself to the point where I am physically and mentally fucking dying.

I feel ill every fucking day and I feel mentally ill every day too. I treat everyone and everything like prince's, yet I get shit throughout life, bad luck just seems to be my thing. Yesterday I lost my work uniform, shoes and calculator on the fucking underground. Today I locked myself out of my phone and it factory reset itself so I've lost everything that holds dearest to me and reminds me of home. 

I don't see the point anymore, I just realised today I've been like this for years now and I don't think it's gonna get any better. I wish I had done the job in January, what exactly did I keep going for? 

I'm gonna get my affairs in order and get together a plan. Peace out.
