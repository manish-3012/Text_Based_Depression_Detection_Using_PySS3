Iâ€™m ruining every relationship in my life because I canâ€™t let go of my toxic Mother and I want to end my pain.So, thereâ€™s this guy I like-I mean I really like him, heâ€™s been the only one to help me through my sexual assault and heâ€™s the only person in my life whoâ€™s genuinely nice to me. My mom is toxic-she controls me financially and emotionally. I always tread on eggshells around her and Iâ€™ve had to appease her in order for her to love me. My mom doesnâ€™t like him because heâ€™s poor and she said that she raised me â€œa certain wayâ€. I love him, but I would probably let him go if she really wanted me to. Iâ€™ve already stood up against her by befriending him and sheâ€™s cut off my allowance. I was sexually assaulted and my mom blames me for it. She told all her friends about it and deliberately triggers me. She told me itâ€™s my fault for getting sexually assaulted because I was dumb enough to trust someone. She cared more about my grades in university than my rapist beating me and trying to kill me when I didnâ€™t listen to his orders. She said that because of a choice I made, I inconvenienced my whole family. I know my mom is toxic but Iâ€™m so fucking stupid because I still love her and would do anything she says. My dad told me to do what makes me happy but how could I be happy with my Friend if my mom hates me?  He doesnâ€™t deserve such a shitty Friend, who would do anything her Mother says. I wish my rapist choked me a little longer so I wouldâ€™ve died, the bastard almost killed me but he didnâ€™t. Iâ€™m such a fucking garbage Friend and Daughter. Here I have a Friend whoâ€™s helped me through everything and loved me the way my parents never did but Iâ€™m choosing my mom over him. What is wrong with me? I just want my pain to end. I canâ€™t even be with someone I love because I love my toxic Mother, who was totally ok with my grandma abusing me throughout my childhood (my gran raised me) and she gaslights me every single time.
