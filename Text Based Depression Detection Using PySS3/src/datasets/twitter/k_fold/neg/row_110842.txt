My relationship is failing and I have no one to talk toI mentioned wanting to commit suicide to my therapist and she suggested I go to the hospital, so now I canâ€™t trust talking to her about anything. My relationship is falling apart and I canâ€™t handle it. I have so much stress with school on top of everything. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Suicide isnâ€™t selfish, but letting a person suffer is.
