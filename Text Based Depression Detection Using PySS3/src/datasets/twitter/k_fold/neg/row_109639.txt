I donâ€™t know how long I can keep goingI feel like garbage, I have been for a while. I canâ€™t take compliments, I double and triple take everything. I canâ€™t believe anyone and I feel I canâ€™t be sincere with anyone anymore either. I feel like maybe this is a stupid reason or way to think but a person Iâ€™ve shared a lot with seems to not care about me anymore and they wonâ€™t admit it. Idk how to go about it but it feels like I go from one failed relationship to another and I canâ€™t seem to make any sense. Iâ€™m stupid for getting attached and I just donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself for a while and maybe this might be what tips me over. What hurts the most is that even if I did Idt this person would care they just keep hurting me over and over. I canâ€™t believe this is whatâ€™s making me want to keel over. Maybe Iâ€™m being dramatic or in catastrophizing but I donâ€™t want to live in a world where I canâ€™t be with them. I canâ€™t seem to make myself or anyone happy, Iâ€™m a drain and Iâ€™m stupid and useless. I donâ€™t think anyone would notice or care if I was gone tomorrow, not even my immediate family. This post is one part venting and the other is asking for help. Idek if thatâ€™s even allowed here, Iâ€™m just stupid
