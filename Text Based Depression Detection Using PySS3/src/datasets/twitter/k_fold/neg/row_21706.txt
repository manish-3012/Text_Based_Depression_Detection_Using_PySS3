You canâ€™t really help, but I guess itâ€™s worth a shot.Buckle up, this might be long, and confusing because I have too many thoughts. I am 25 years old, I am diagnosed bipolar depression anxiety and ptsd, I guess they all kind of mold together. First Iâ€™ll start by saying that I am in treatment, I am in group therapies 3 times a week, I see a therapist once a week, and a psychologist for medication management once a month. I havenâ€™t been taking my medication, which is probably stupid. I got put on several medications about a year ago, Iâ€™ve barely taken them because Iâ€™m convinced theyâ€™ll make me gain weight (I am worried because over the last few years Iâ€™ve lost 184 lbs) and am not willing to gain weight for my â€œmental stabilityâ€ I suppose most of my issues are in my in my past. I have some things now that Iâ€™m confused about and kind of hard to deal with. Nothing worth taking my life over I guess, but to me itâ€™s not exactly what is happening to me that makes me want to end my life. It is genuinely just how I feel, I really donâ€™t feel happiness itâ€™s a facade, says that I spend with my friends from group, days that Iâ€™m with my boyfriend, and days that I spend with select members of my family I am able to laugh and smile. But as soon as Iâ€™m alone I donâ€™t want to be alive. And thatâ€™s not healthy, Iâ€™m fully aware of what my issues are. But theyâ€™re not going to stop, or I donâ€™t see them stopping. My issues are with me, the way I look, the way I think, the way I feel, I am very unhappy with myself. It is safe to say that I 100% hate myself and I am tired of living. For what? The benefit of others? Because theyâ€™d be sad or upset if I am gone? I guess Iâ€™m generally too afraid to kill myself, because I donâ€™t want to live through an attempt, and I donâ€™t want pain. Iâ€™m constantly wishing Iâ€™d just get hit by a car (not looking before I cross the street) a lot, I wish someone would just kill me in my sleep or something. Idk man, Iâ€™m just unhappy and I donâ€™t want to live and thereâ€™s nothing that just makes me genuinely happy. Iâ€™m in a relationship with a guy who makes me laugh so much, there are small things here and there that I donâ€™t like about it. But itâ€™s not a bad relationship, I just am very VERY insecure with myself and I know thatâ€™s hard on both of us. Because I hate myself I donâ€™t see why someone wouldnâ€™t leave me for someone else or cheat, so sometimes I accuse and I know itâ€™s not right. But I let my thoughts run wild a lot and it makes me paranoid and then it leads to us fighting blah blah. And then my family is a whole other story I guess, I live in a house with my mom, her boyfriend , my nephew, my brother, his girlfriend, and her father. They all have their own issues, and for so long I spent taking care of other people to avoid myself I guess subconsciously, and now that things are a bit better and they can take care of themselves Iâ€™m lost just trying to help myself. Two of the people who live in my house make my life a living hell, micromanaging, criticizing, and plain out bullying me. And the things they say about me kinda further validate how I feel about myself. Negative External validation on someone who already hates themselves is kind of rough to deal with.. I donâ€™t really know what the point of this is to be honest. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s something I can do to really start liking myself. Or wanting to live. Idk, my treatment isnâ€™t working, I thought losing so much weight would make me feel okay but, it doesnâ€™t. Iâ€™m actually less confident with the lose skin I have than I was being morbidly obese. Iâ€™m not good enough, for anyone. Thatâ€™s all I have to say for now, a reply or two would be nice I guess but Iâ€™m not expecting it. 
Thanks for reading.
