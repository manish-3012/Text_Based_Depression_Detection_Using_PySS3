It's never going to get better for meI'm really fucking depressed, but that's not the problem. I can get cured from depression.

I'm autistic. I have autism and ADHD. 

I can never get rid of those things. They're part of my brain. Even if my depression gets better, I'll still be autistic.

I'm happy for people who can find joy and pride in their difference but... I can't do that. I've been bullied for being autistic my whole life. 

I have a boyfriend right now. He doesn't know I'm autistic. He makes fun of autistic people and calls people on video games "retards". I'm lying to him about being neurotypical. If I told him that I'm autistic, I don't even know what would happen. He would probably hate me for lying.

I've been suicidal for 3 years. He's like one of the only people who has made me feel cared for. Expect he doesn't care about me, he cares about the person he thinks I am.

This is all my fault. I should've never lied to him. I should've never got into a relationship with him. I'm so fucking done with everything.

Even if I ever get over my depression, I don't think I will ever feel accepted or loved.

I want to kill myself so badly. I really want to do it. But I'm a fucking coward.
