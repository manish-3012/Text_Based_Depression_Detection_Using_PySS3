Hoping for better daysI think about ending my life everyday. The only thing holding me back is the pain my family would go through. In a way it makes me even more frustrated knowing that itâ€™s not an option. Iâ€™ve been depressed before but these past few months have been soul shattering. Nothing makes sense right now, I think about when I was happy and just want to feel something other than hurting. The constant pain in my chest makes it hard, itâ€™s even harder to eat. I use to love cooking and havenâ€™t made a meal in months. My body and mind feel so weak.
