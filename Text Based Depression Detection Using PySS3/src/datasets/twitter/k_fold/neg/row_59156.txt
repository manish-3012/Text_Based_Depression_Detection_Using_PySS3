Does anybody else feel shittier when they know how many people care about them?the context of this story would take up at least a small novel but i was just wondering if i was alone in getting fucked up and calling old friends telling them half truths in the hope of being put away somewhere and the next day getting a bunch of voice mails about how youre loved and afterward just feeling like more of a piece of shit than before.
