Right now, suicide motivates meEvery day, I make a bet that I can make it through the day without killing myself. 

I am almost certain that one day I will lose this bet, and I don't want to have thrown too much into the pot when this happens. If I kill myself now, I would be the son, brother, and fiance who died. I don't want to also be the father who abandoned his family.

In the past few weeks (and for the first time in my life), suicide has made me feel motivated. It keeps me pressing forward, knowing that if things really go to shit, I can end it. It has spurred me to clean/organize my apartment so that when I die, my belongings can easily be moved out. It keeps my finances and documents organized so that I can write a living will and have funeral costs covered. Right now, these preparations are actually motivating me to make my life better.

I guess I am hoping that maybe, by the time I clean up my life in preparation for ending it, I will have found a reason to keep betting on the next day. As of right now, despite things going well, I'm going to do what I have done every day of my life, and head to bed hoping I won't wake up.
