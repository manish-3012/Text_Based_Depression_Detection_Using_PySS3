To my dad, im so sorry, I tried, I really did.To The only person that really cares about and gives a fuck about me, im sorry. I'm sorry dad that it has to be like this. Im sorry my life has to end so tragedicaly. The pain and the regret won't let me take another step. I tell you I look ok, but in my face you can see i look depressed. And its never gonna end. The depression  will never stop. Sorry im such a piece of shit pathetic loser. Sorry I never made you proud or accomplished anything in my life. Sorry I've caused you so much stress and anxiety of putting up with me. Sorry im a horrible son. I just can't live life like this anymore. I know when i was little you never envisioned your little 5 year old boys life would end up like this. That he would take his own life. I know this will devastate you to no end. And maybe im being selfish for that. But I just cant endure the pain no more.  Its unbearable. 



Dad im so sorry and hope you'll forgive me.
