Who cares?Why would anyone on the internet care about me. You don't know who I am or what I've done. Who knows maybe I deserve to die. Why does it even matter. Of course my family and friends would be hurt by it. Unless I make them hate me. No.. That wouldn't work. I'm just rambling now. Well I don't really mind. I'm too afraid of nothing to ask for help. I probably will never ask for help. I want to beat this myself. I quit smoking pot because it wasn't helping anymore. But thats just a small step. Dying would be a huge step but in what direction. It benefits me but... Idk.
