It feels like the real world was turned off a couple days ago, I don't feel in control just lonelier and lonelierA couple days ago this foggy feeling washed over me and it put me on autopilot. I can remember I did things these past few days but not what I did. Each day is getting more and more grey. I feel like my all of my emotions are numbed or turned off or I can't recognize what I'm feeling well enough to put a name to what it is and it's frustrating me to tears. I want my mom. I want to call my friend and ask for comfort but for some reason I feel like he's mad at me. I don't know why, I think he's tired of me though. I want to walk out into the rain and just go until I find a spot to curl up and die
