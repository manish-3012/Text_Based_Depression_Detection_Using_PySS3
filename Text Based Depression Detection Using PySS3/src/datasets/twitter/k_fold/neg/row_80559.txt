I love the English Language, but am obsessing about what words mean and losing my insanity - please help.It doesn't sound extreme, but I was reading a book the other day and started thinking to myself "why am I reading this? It's just a bunch of scribbles on paper."

Since then I keep thinking about words, languages and communication and how humans are so close to animals that I can't function anymore. I have a life and a job but live on autopilot. I derive no pleasure from life anymore.

How the fuck can I go back to being normal again without thinking about this shit? I'm slowly becoming the opposite definition of what being a human is. I want to live as a human, not feel like an animal, help!

I also posted this here because I am contemplating suicide because of depersonalization and depression, basically.
