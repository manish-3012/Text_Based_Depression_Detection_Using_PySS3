I don't want to finish the weekI've said this to myself a bunch of times but maybe this time it's for real. I am sick of going on and I'm only 17. High school graduation is 3 months away but what's the point? I hate feeling needy and I can't talk to anyone about this kind of stuff. I'm too embarrassed to tell my friends, my parents know I'm suicidal, I can't even talk to a school counselor anymore (Last time I did I was send to the ER a second time). I wish I had validation for my "depression" like I wish I was bullied or abused instead of it just being a chemical imbalance or something. I keep calling depression/suicide hotlines but  I don't know why. I reject any help. I think I'm waiting for someone to tell me suicide is ok. I don't want to hurt my family or friends, they're the only reasons haven't done anything yet. But it's not fair to me that I keep going on. No matter what anybody says that's good about me I don't see it. I am done with feeling this way, like I'm going crazy. I might write a suicide note today. I keep telling myself I need to make it Tuesday when I see my therapist but after that I don't know. Honestly I'll probably fuck up killing myself because I can only slit my wrist. If I finish the week I will post again letting anyone concerned know.
