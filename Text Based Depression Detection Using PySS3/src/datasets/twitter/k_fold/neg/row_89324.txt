It's my birthday in 2 days and I have decided to kill myself at midnight on my birthdayHaven't tried calling suicide helplines and don't wish to. I can't speak properly and stammer a lot and also I do not like talking to people so yeah I won't be calling the suicide helplines. If you guys tell me to think about my parents or my friends - my mother directly said this that she would be much happier if I died, my dad says he is brought his morale down by being so sad and he wouldn't even mind if I did it. I was very close to my friends but I have drawn myself away from them. They try to talk to me but I hardly respond and it is completely my fault for isolating myself. They wouldn't mind anyways, I am not very close to any of my friends,
