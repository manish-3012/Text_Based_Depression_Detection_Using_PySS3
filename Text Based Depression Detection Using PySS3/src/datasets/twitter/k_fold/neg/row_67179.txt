There's no point.I don't think I'm sad atm, but I'm just really tired and bored of life. I mean, I'm 17 it's just going to get more hard from here. So seriously, what's the point of living? Why do people wake up every day and keep going to their terrible jobs? Why not just end it? I really just don't understand. I don't really have anything to live for. I'm sure others feel the same way. No girlfriend, no job, not many hobbies; nothing that makes me think it will be worth it to stay on this stupid planet. Whatever, thanks for reading I guess.
