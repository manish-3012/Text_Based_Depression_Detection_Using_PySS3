I need to leaveItâ€™s late. And I just need to be able to put this somewhere.

Emotions are important to me. Memories and feelings are so valuable. But Iâ€™m not making any. Iâ€™m living such a stupid mediocre life. Iâ€™m a teenager but I canâ€™t do this. I need to leave this town. I want to see the world and feel all the emotions, live a million brilliant and rich lives. I want to own a green mansion filled with different types of exciting plants in Hawaii. I want to own a little cottage and herd sheep in Switzerland. I want to farm in a small village in Japan, I want to live in a trashy town with small adventures, I want to solve a mystery, I want to live in a boat, I want to be a revered snake collector. The hills of New Zealand, an ancient home in Rome, a tent in the middle of Oregon, an apartment in Paris, a facility in Antartica, a small home in a farm town, a castle in Ireland. I canâ€™t run away. I love my family and they love me. I wouldnâ€™t have enough money. Iâ€™m afraid Heaven wonâ€™t have these things and not feel as real- it will be great in a different way, but these experiences on Earth are limited to here. I want to leave. I want to overdose. I want to kill myself. I canâ€™t stay here. I canâ€™t.
