Christmas backsliding into miseryTried to off myself ten months ago over gay unrequited love with my bestfriend, who had cut me out his life a year or so before. Felt like absolute shit but I climbed out of it; stopped drinking, lost 50 pounds, got my dream job working in Parliament (UK). But my issues with this guy have never gone away, even as I got healthier, mentally and physically.

Now its Christmas and hearing about all my friends, who are all mutual, seeing him and his new girlfriend are killing me. Every Christmas Eve we all go to the pub 5 minutes from my house. Last night I knew he was there but couldn't go round to see him and its killed me.

I'm tempted to go NYE and see him, try and show him I'm better again and become mates again. I know it probably won't work, but its that or slipping back under the quagmire of depression, cutting myself again or swallowing pills.

Worst bit is I can see my depression on my family's faces, as they realise I'm slowly slipping back into misery, but I can't do anything about it.

No idea what to do.
