16 and in a ditchIm 16M and have been contemplating suicide for the past couple weeks. i have "friends" at school but when ever i get home no one wants to hangout or even text with me at all. i see them all over snap chat and other social media having a great time and it really fucks me up. my grades are dropping my parents yell at me cuz of my grades. its a cycle that i cant break. i feel like i mean nothing to the world so i might as well go. the only thing holding me together right now is my 7 y/o sister. she looks up to me and i dont want her to be in pain.  i feel like i mean nothing to everyone. my life sucks and everything i do to make it better doesn't work and im done trying.

reddit please help me


edit: i have been in a on and off depression for a year or so now. and it has been diagnosed. therapy doensnt work. just talking about my problems wont fucking make them go away,
