Please read thisI'm literally home alone now or at least it feels like it. Everyday my sister stays in her room &amp; my mom stays in her's. My mom just told me "she going to disconnect my phone &amp; not buy food for any of us now" My sister doesn't care but herself, like literally one time she call the cops on us. My brother &amp; his family, Everytime they visit they don't say hi too me or when I try to say hi to them none of them response back. I don't know anymore...Right now I'm downloading all my favorite music before it gets disconnected. On my next post, it's going to be the finale. I'll name it "My last post :)" &amp; just basically say everything I want to say then off I go kill myself..
Goodbye for now &amp; I love y'all. Have a good day.
