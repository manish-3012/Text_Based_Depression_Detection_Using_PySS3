Cant get faith seeds final words out of my head"And if you don't listen... He'll be right"

I shouldnt tried to do better, I shouldnt shot for the stars, I shouldve known I would fail, what made me so special to be able to actually get out of this hell and be better, I am not going to graduate college this year, I am going to die paying off those loans, I shouldve listened. He is going to be right. They were all right, what makes me different than the thousands of poor mentally ill failures with big dreams in this damned country, yeah I made it to college, but I cant afford it, I am going to be pulled out, my mom wont get approved, we cant afford it, my grades suck because of the fact I cant focus on writing knowing I cant make it to the next semester.

They were right
