Am I actually a terrible person?I feel like a piece of shit most of the time but my therapist always works with me to make me see I have good qualities, but yesterday I really felt like I fundamentally don't deserve to be alive. For background context it was my Brother's Wedding.  I love my Brother and his Fiance and was really honored they asked me to be the officiant for their wedding. However, on the day that should've been one of the happiest days of my life I felt like an absolute piece of shit for feeling so miserable. I sucked it up and got through the ceremony and party, with everyone telling me I did a great job. I smiled and said thanks even though every part of my brain was screaming that they were just lying to me and could tell how much of a piece of shit I am. The whole time I just wanted to leave for my house so I could blow my brains out. Couldn't keep the cute bridesmaid off my mind even though she had a boyfriend and I felt like a fucking incel for not being able to just clear my mind and enjoy my Brother's and Fiance's special day. What kind of asshole can't even be happy for a family member for one fucking day? I just feel like such a piece of selfish shit. I don't want to keep going through life miserable and feeling like I'm bringing my whole family down. Thanks for listening to me vent if you're still reading this.
