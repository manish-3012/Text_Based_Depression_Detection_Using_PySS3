I should be in a mental hospital (Kind of a demented rant. If you read this, I am so, so sorry.)I am so useless. My dad has been deployed for a few months now and I should be helping, I should be being useful but instead I'm slicing up my thighs like theyre deli meats. I can't even eat like a human-fucking-being. I just have to shove it all in *because I'm just* *that much* *of a pig* and fall on the floor weeping about how I'll never be pretty, or useful, or even remotely appreciated because with everyone I know, I need them more than they need me. Just a fat little piggy. This piggy should be sliced up nice and thick and served on silver plates to everyone shes met, as an apology. That would be a start. 

I can't sleep. I stay up so late and crash as soon as I get home from school. But I can't sleep then, because motherbeast is screaming and wailing and it hurts my heart. I wish I had never been born, I really do. Life would be so much easier for everyone.

Instead I'm sitting here holding a piece of paper trying to papercut myself to death. How pathetic, little piggy. Little piggy who can't shut her moth and keep those ugly lies in. It's not my fault, it's not. I swear, STOP STARING AT ME LIKE THAT

Just stop swearing and yelling and cursing, motherbeast, I'm shattering so hard. Little firstborn piggy is dying, and she wants help... But she's too afraid to let you hear her whimpers and silent screams because you'll swearcurseyell, motherbeast
