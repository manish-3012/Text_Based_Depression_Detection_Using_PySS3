It's timeAfter exhausting every possible option, I've finally accept that it won't get better. Biologically, statistically, logically, I know in my soul it ***can't***. My biggest fear now is I'll die slowly and it'll hurt, but, eventually, it ***will*** be over. I know that and it brings me some comfort. Even though I've been planning for years just in case it came to this, I'm still scared I'll screw it up. I've always been so confident in life, except about this. All of my accounts are closed, my belongings are sold, and my final arrangements are made and paid in full. So it's just up to me to jump.

It won't be noticed when I'm gone and there's a good chance I won't be found for weeks, if ever, so it's oddly reassuring to know \*someone,\* even an anonymous stranger, knows. I can't explain why, but it is.
