Someone tell me itâ€™s a bad idea.Iâ€™m either going to kill myself today or tomorrow, the only â€œfriendâ€ I knew has been spreading gossip about me and it hurts so much. I never did anything to hurt him or anyone so itâ€™s so frustrating when I try so hard to be nice to people and they end up stabbing me in the back. All my life Iâ€™ve been trusting the wrong people and they always end up stabbing me in the back, I guess that saying is true â€œgood guys never winâ€ I have nobody to talk to and my family reside 1.000 miles away. I almost killed myself last week and the people that know about it treat it like a sick joke. I guess nobody cares, nobody ever cared about me.  

I donâ€™t wanna die but Iâ€™m also in a lot of pain idk what to do.
