This seems to be a patternI've been dealing with mental health issues since the age of 9 I am 33 years old Born on Halloween 3rd generation my grandmother and great grandmother were also Born on Halloween. I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder severe recurrent I also have panic disorder and PTSD from a trauma suffered at age 6 to 7 I self harm regularly unfortunately though I haven't done it in weeks a depressive episode came on today when I realized that it was almost Christmas we have no lights no tree nothing to indicate what time of year it is I only mention this because we have always celebrated Christmas despite the fact that me and my sister are atheist we do it to make my parents happy and to be honest I get some Joy normally out of the happiness of those around me I was an altar boy when I was young and it was believed that because I knew the Bible so well I would become a priest lo and behold my science-driven mind landed me in the atheist category I don't know what sparks this particular depressive episode although there have been several panic attacks today but I am now sitting in the car outside with no coat on and just thinking I Googled forums for suicide and since I'm already a member of Reddit although I don't post much I was interested when I saw this I have called the crisis team on myself before when I knew I was going to do bad things but I don't plan to sell harm I'm just sitting out here confused why I'm so upset anyway I'm truly sorry if I didn't do this right but I just had to get this out somehow thank you here
