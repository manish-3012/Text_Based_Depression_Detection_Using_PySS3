Going through a rough break upSo a girl I was going out with cheated with this other girl I found out later that the girl she cheated with encouraged her to break up with me and not only her but good friends I have had around for years told them to leave me 

I have never contemplated so heavily for this long I have tried a couple times taking a bit more sleep medicine than what I was supposed to but this time itâ€™s really tempting

I have a hand full of pills in my hand and the only reason I donâ€™t down them is because I know they wonâ€™t kill me Iâ€™m tired of feeling like shit I want to feel something even if that is me dying and everything fading to black I hate myself
