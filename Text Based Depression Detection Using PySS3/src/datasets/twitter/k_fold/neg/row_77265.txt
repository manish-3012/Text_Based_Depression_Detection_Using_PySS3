I've made it, that's what I'm supposed to say anyway.Is been a long journey.   A lot of ups and downs. At some point I started working to fix things in my life. 

Fake it till you make it. 


Well, I made it. Pretending, lying that I was a person who wanted a future.  A degree, a job. A bright future, at least that's what anyone else would think.

Not me. 

I'm selfish. I don't appreciate my life, my work.  Yet here I am stuck, desperate for a way out. I don't belong here. I won't ever fit. I will always be alone. No matter how many people I've befriended I'll always be different.
