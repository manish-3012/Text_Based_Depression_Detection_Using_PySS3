Whenever I think of my childhood I want to kill myself.I try not to think, but i cant. It comes on its own. Not always, but still quite often. Whenever I wander trough city, whenever I am working, whenever I am sitting at school, whenever I am at home.

Not always its that bad. Sometimes even some good memories I made with my friend at elementary school come up. But usually, its those horrible memories that comes up.

Those memories of my father drinking and beating my mother. Those memories of them trying to force me into their problems. Those memories of me acting like a clown at school so I could, at least a bit, cope with sadness and despair in my head.

Now, as I am in my early 20s and my personality is fully stabilized and in many ways different from what it used to be, I thought that those memories would leave me alone or at least not hurt that much. I was mistaken.

But I know where is the problem. It is in my mother. She is on the same path as my father. Drinking, smoking and taking pills. It makes those memories come up in such huge scale. I know I, as good son, should do something, but I wont - never, because I am not a good son and I am fine with it. I tried to spend as little time at home as I could, only coming home to sleep and on weekends to eat hoping it would help - it did not.

But now, I know what will help. Her death. But even with her lifestyle it will take some time. After all, human body is much more durable than any of us would thought.

Who will last longer? My mother or I?

I just want to be free.
