It's been quite some time.Hi reddit.  I find myself in a headspace I thought I had left behind.  I'm on the other side of a meltdown/ panic attack or whatever and I feel exhausted.  I'm drained but cant sit still.  I feel frozen to inaction but feel an unstoppable need to change something. 

My thoughts all focus on not wanting this anymore.  I'm so tired of the struggle.  Struggle to pay Bill's, stay groomed, keep the place clean, car, insurance, social life, work, dad time, sleep.  Everything is a struggle.  Nothing feels smooth or easy going.

It's all so hopeless.  I've been so lonely since my wife left.  I just had my first rejection post divorce and it hurt me way more than I expected.   I was foolish to think I'd be stronger for what I went through.  

The ativan are kicking in hard.  I'll try and get some sleep and hope my mind can leave the darkest thoughts behind by the time I wake up. Sorry for the rambling.
