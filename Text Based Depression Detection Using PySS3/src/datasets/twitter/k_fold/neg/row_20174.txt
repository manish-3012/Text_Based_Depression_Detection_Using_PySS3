I'm stuck...I was supposed to end my life at a few days ago. I chose that day so that I could at least enjoy my last ever summer and finishing a few things before ending my life. However I'm here and alive still. I ultimately couldn't do it because I'm actually scared of dying. Plus I'm worried about the possibility of someone trying to save me and me having to live with that after attempting to end my life. 

Right now I'm at a point in life where things aren't going well at all and I don't see it getting better. I always carry something with me in the car that could help me with my situation, but I chicken out and now I regret not doing it everyday. I'm stuck and don't know what to do anymore. I just want it all to end. I know...it's pretty pathetic of me. I wish sooner than later ill gain the strength to end my life and leave everything behind.
