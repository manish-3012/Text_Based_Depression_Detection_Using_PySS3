I have no hopeFor anything. I'm too scared to ask a woman I like out or to spend the night or anything really. Probably going to get kicked out of online uni for not posting two things which take all of about 2 mins to do. Major debt and no prospects of a job. I have no hope of being happy at all I just want to end my misery by any means. Not even looking forward to the holidays coming up something is very wrong with me but there isn't shit I can do about it and I just can't be arsed to do anything
