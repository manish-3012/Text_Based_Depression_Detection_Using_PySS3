I can't stop thinking about slitting my wrist.I'm eighteen and I got kicked out because I was at a friend's house and I had to pick up another friend that was drunk. My parents found a receipt of his in the car and they told me I was a piece of shit and how they had no love at all for me. I packed a bag and have no where to go. I'm alone and I don't see a reason to live.
