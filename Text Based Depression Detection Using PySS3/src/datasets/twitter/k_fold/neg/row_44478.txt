Anxiety is too bad to call a suicide hotlineI get anxious pretty much all the time. I feel that I want to seek help by contacting a hotline because I'm on the verge of taking the long term solution but my anxiety is too bad to actually have a conversation with someone over the phone about my problems. Is there any way of me chatting online..? I live in the UK. Thanks..
