Why is world like this?Almost all of my closest loved ones were hurt badly and I feel like I'm the lucky one here, but I don't know if I have strengths for this world. It's all tiring. Why can't we live peacefully? And why can't we determinate if someone is still worthy to live? So many people should die. We will all die at some point, but why do we have to suffer? I don't want anybody of my loved ones to suffer, I want to take it all. But still I'm the fcking lucky one without almost any problems.
