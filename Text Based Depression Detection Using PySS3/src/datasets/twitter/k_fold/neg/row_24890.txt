The Sooner I Die, The Better. In 20 minutes.This sub is like a guestbook but me, posting one final message before I pull the plug on this futile life.

I would ask for help but I don't deserve it. My life is not worth saving. I am 25 years old and have clearly taken more than I have received. Money means little to me, but that's one of the reasons I'm terminating this experiment. I am almost broke, despite having made over $500,000 in the two and a half years since college graduation. I'm a stock trader and for the past few months I've been barely break even. I can't handle failure, it makes me a failure and I am a failure. This was sudden, swift, and unexpected. I have no future, I cannot work regular jobs due to physical disability. 

This isn't a contest - I don't want praise or pity. These are just statements of fact. As for why I'm here posting, I figure this is the only place where I can honestly write this without being ridiculed. It gives me closure. I also appreciate the help that readers here try to offer, and if there are any replies I will read them. It's okay - you can be honest and tell me I'm a piece of shit and deserve this.

Pending Divine Intervention, I have about an hour to live. Within a half hour I will begin the irreversible process of death.

Thank you for listening, and goodbye.
