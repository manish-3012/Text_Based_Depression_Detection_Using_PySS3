Fiance broke up with meTitle. Fiance broke up with me after 10 years of being together. Started dating at 13. Engaged at 18. Broke up 3 weeks ago. Was suicidal then. Started doing ok. Found out she started fucking one of her friends the day after we broke up and they are dating. We were supposed to go to a wedding together. She told me she was going alone. Found out she went with him. 

Want to die. She was my entire life. Now I have noone and she doesn't have to deal with the same pain because she has new guy. We were each other's first everything. I have no idea how to even go about finding anyone else and she's already moved on. 

Everytime I feel like I'm starting to get over it something else sets me off. It's not getting any easier. Therapy doesn't help. Talking to people doesn't help. Keeping busy doesn't help. It's been 3 weeks and it doesn't hurt any less. 

I understand I'm only 23 and the odds of it working out were astronomical. Rationally I know I'm being immature and dramatic. But it still hurts so bad and I feel like I will never have anything like that again. 

So I want to end it to stop ruining other people's lives and let her get in with hers. 

Have already been in crisis ward and everything. Don't know what else to do. Help.
