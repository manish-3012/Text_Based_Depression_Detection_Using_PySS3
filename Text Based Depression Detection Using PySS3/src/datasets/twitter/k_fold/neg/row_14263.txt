Loneliness really getting to meIâ€™m really considering hanging myself right now. I thought Iâ€™d be able to calm down and be ok but the feelings just are getting stronger and I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore. No one likes me and I always try my best to talk to people and be kind but itâ€™s never enough. Iâ€™m just another man which nobody cares about. I donâ€™t want to live any longer with the constant feelings of nobody wanting me or even giving me a second thought. I canâ€™t study because Iâ€™m feeling that crap and Iâ€™ve got an exam in 2 days so Iâ€™m going to fail university which just make me want to kill myself even more. Thereâ€™s no one I can talk to or even hold a conversation with that would care enough.
