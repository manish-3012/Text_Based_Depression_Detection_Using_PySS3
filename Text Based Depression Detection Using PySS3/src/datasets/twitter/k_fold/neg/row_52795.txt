I'm so tired of fighting this. I just want it to be over, and some peace to finally find me.....Everyday is a fight, and I'm so tired of fighting it. I just want something that will help me, someone to hear me, and a small sliver of happiness. And every time I nearly manage to get one, The Universe beats me back into that miserable dark place, beats me harder with each attempt. I can't keep fighting this, fighting it alone, and treated like a leper, a black sheep, whenever I try and teach out to someone, anyone. I'm tired of constantly repeating myself, reaching out, and trying to find happiness. No one listens. No one cares. 

I'm tired of the insurmountable guilt I feel every day, for just BREATHING. I don't have the strength to be the mother my children need, the wife my husband deserves, and I am killed daily by the guilt of knowing how much pain they'd be in if I'd left. I don't have the energy to fight anymore, and I can't live with the guilt of knowing what I'd do to them.

I'm so tired. I don't want to fight anymore.
