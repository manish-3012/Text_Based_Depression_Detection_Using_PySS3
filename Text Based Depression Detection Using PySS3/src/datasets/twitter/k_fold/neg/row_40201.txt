Another day deciding if I can make it one moreCheck my post history, specifically submitted for what brings me here. 

I've spent all day starting at the gun in my closet trying to decide if I have the strength to make it another day. Just wanting to post here for someone to talk to. 

Drunk as fuck, trying to hold it together, even if that tmeams crying myself to sleep and sleeping before I do something drastic. 

Life suck, we are forced to do things we hate. I can't tell anyone because it will destroy everything I hope to do after. 

Why does it hurt so much, why do I hate everything. Please make the pain go away.
