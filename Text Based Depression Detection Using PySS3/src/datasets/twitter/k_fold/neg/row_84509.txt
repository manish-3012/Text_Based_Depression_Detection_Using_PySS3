I'm just never going to be good enoughI'm not. I'm not good enough for my parents, I'm not good enough for my boyfriend, and I'm certainly not good enough for myself. From the day I was born I feel like I've just been a massive disappointment. I'm ugly and lazy and fat, and even when I try and fix these things, and all my other problems, I get someone telling me that I'm the opposite of waht I think, and they make me feel guilty for trying to better myself. I should have been a fucking abortion ro killed myself when I was younger and actually had the courage to. I'm so fucking worthless. And now I'm just dumping it on you people as well, because I can't just learn to hold it in where I can't disappoint anyone else with what a fuck up I am.
