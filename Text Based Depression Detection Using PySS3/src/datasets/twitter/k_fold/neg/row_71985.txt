My mind always return to suicideI failed everything, I feel worthless, ugly, unlovable, a burden.
I wanted to be beautiful and had a plastic surgery that was botched.
It was the only hope for me to feel something good.
Now my life is pointless, I live like a vegetable, unable to socialise and enjoy anything, contribute to anything.
I am on medication, it helps to numb the feelings but it doesn't help with anything else.
My mind always return to suicide.
I want to live but I don't want to live like that.
