Dealing with health issues...Iâ€™m a covid long hauler and itâ€™s forced me to clean up health. Iâ€™m cleansing my body now and the cleansing process is causing a natural reaction in the body that results in anxiety and depression for a short period of time. And dealing with post-covid symptoms is depressing enough...

Iâ€™ve never had darker thoughts before in my life.

How are you all doing this Christmas Eve? What are you up to, wherever you are?
