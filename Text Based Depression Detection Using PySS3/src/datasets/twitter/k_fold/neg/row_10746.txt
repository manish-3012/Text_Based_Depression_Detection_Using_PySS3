I wish I could openly talk about my suicidal thoughts with my therapist.But I would rather not be shipped off to a psych ward. Even just talking about my invasive images (of self-harm), my therapist got visibly uncomfortable. 

You guys are the only ones that I can truly be honest with. Thanks for being there
