Day psychiatrist hospitalSo I'm doing therapy every day on this hospital since I tried to end my life (this happened 1 month ago). Here self-harm is forbidden, and so it is drugs and alcohol. The problem is I'm having a hard time while withdrawal of various drugs but I'm trying to not consume and to not hurt myself cause I can get myself expelled if I do it. But I don't know how much longer I will resist, the urges are so so so bad right now and I'm just 6 days clean of everything. God help me.
