Seriously about to overdose on Ambien, and just kill myself.No matter how hard I try, I can't find happiness in my life. I've spent like, the last two months fawning over this girl online, over OKC. Lives like two hours away, and I fucked shit up today.

More info about that can be seen there. Follow up convo, below.




So how was the con today?
[8:48:45 PM] her : Fun
[8:49:29 PM] me: That's good. So, I totally misunderstood what you were asking earlier today. I thought you were wanting to blow off the con, and meet up.
[8:49:54 PM] me: But I might be able to go Sunday if you'd wanna meet then.
[8:50:28 PM] her : That was what I was asking
[8:50:39 PM] me: Oh.
[8:50:44 PM] me: Gdmit.
[8:51:20 PM] me: I'm sorry, I was very tried and suffering from fried brain. Thankfully AC is fixed now.
[8:52:08 PM] me:  I want to meet though, no more stalling from my end.
[8:52:30 PM] her : I think it should be put off
[8:52:38 PM] her : You're clearly not ready
[8:52:45 PM] her : Which I understand
[8:53:37 PM] me: I just didn't understand what you were asking and today was like.
[8:54:23 PM] me: Not a good day. I had zero clue what was happening today so I didn't know if I would have even been able to go. I didn't find out AC people weren't coming until 1PM even though they were supposed to be here at 10.
[8:56:27 PM] me: Anyways, sorry.


Now she isn't being responsive, un 'liked' me on OKC. I'm honestly just giving up on finding happiness. I always fuck up and miss something and blow that once chance because of my anxiety and slef doubt and low self-esteem.
