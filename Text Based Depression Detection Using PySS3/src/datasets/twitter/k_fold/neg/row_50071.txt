Most suicidal day of my lifeI'm a dramatic and angry person. I'll never know why I'm here and how to make the best of it. But I can see so many other people doing such a great job. My only issue is I like to do something perfectly or throw it away. That feeling extend to everything. As soon as I fail or someone makes me realise I have an ugly side...I want to throw myself away. Easier said than done. But the feeling never really fully fades,  this frustration at all of the things I can't take back or fix,  and have to live with for the rest of my life. I'll never claim perfection and I know that's impossible but other people seem to do pretty well. I'd like to meet their standards at least. Most of the time I can not care but some days it all just piles on. Getting help hasn't worked. Taking time out just distracts briefly and is a cover up. This is me. Forever. That's a hard thing to take. I know it's hard to understand,  but that's who I am. It's who I've always been. I can't fix this. I'm broken permenantly. I don't know what to do. 

Counselling didn't work. 
Nothing works. 
I spent the whole day crying over a mistake. I stayed in bed. I didn't want to face the people in my house,  so I didn't eat dinner. Am I being too dramatic?  Maybe. I just don't want to do life right now. I know it'll go away but in that time I wanted to die so badly. 

I wish I could do it.
