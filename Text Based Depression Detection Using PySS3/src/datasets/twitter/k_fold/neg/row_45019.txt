RealizationI was in class today, doing some assignment, and I had a realization. I just got my first job, car, and girlfriend, and it doesnâ€™t excite me, or make me happy at all. I always thought that I feel depressed because my life is pretty boring, but nothing makes me feel better. What is the fucking point? Donâ€™t feed me the â€œIt gets betterâ€ bullshit, because I know it doesnâ€™t. I have nothing to make me unhappy, and plenty of things to make me happy, but Iâ€™m still totally fucking miserable. As I said I have a girlfriend, plenty of normal friends that Iâ€™m very close with, great relationship with both my parents, get good grades. Iâ€™m not sick, or poor, or disabled, or bullied, but I still feel totally miserable. If this isnâ€™t enough to make me feel happy, then what is?
