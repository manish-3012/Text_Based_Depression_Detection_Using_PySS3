I wish I could die because I hate myself, because I donâ€™t even know who I am and I hate having to control myself all the timeSeeking attention or no, I wanted to die because I hate what I am. Being a doormat for everyone to step on, and living like I should hide stuff to not hurt people, in the process of bottling up everything negative because people tell me that â€œDonâ€™t say anything that will hurt others.â€, I ended up just agreeing to everything in life.

And my whole personality is a mess. Itâ€™s like a burst of emotions waiting to be released for everyone to see.

BUT THE ONLY DAMM THING THAT WILL HAPPEN IS, â€œControl yourself.â€

Iâ€™ve been controlling myself for my whole life, and whenever I DID have an outburst, I will only get reactions of â€œLearn to watch yourself.â€

Nobody understands. NOBODY UNDERSTANDS AT ALL.

Iâ€™ve been living like Iâ€™m a bottle, and itâ€™s overflowing past the limit. I have emotions too, I just canâ€™t let all of my thoughts out because â€œI might hurt someone.â€

And when I tell people about this, they would say, â€œItâ€™s ok to let everything out. Itâ€™s not good for the heart.â€

If I let everything out, people get hurt
If I let everything in, I get hurt

No matter what, someone gets hurt in the end.

So...I want to die.

Later Iâ€™ll sneak something sharp in my room.
