Iâ€™ve been 18 since July and only just realized I have the ability to buy a gun now.I havenâ€™t really had strong suicidal thoughts since my birthday so I hadnâ€™t thought about it too much. I donâ€™t care for guns but damn. Even just buying one would feel so indulgent. 

Starting therapy next week and hopefully meds as well. Maybe in a month I wonâ€™t feel so tempted to grab one and put a bullet through my skull
