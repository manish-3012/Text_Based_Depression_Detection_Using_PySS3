I feel a need to sufferI feel a need to suffer. I it's not like I want to die because my life is bad (it's quite okay actually) but currently I am overwhelmed by feeling of wanting to injure myself in some way. I just really need for someone to stab me or torture me to death preferably. I don't know what causes this felling especially when I don't even believe I can feel like this when I am not felling it.
It wouldn't be a problem if I just occasionally cut myself but I ruin relationships by making people abuse me or trying to convince them to kill me. Once in this space of mind I can say anything just to get pain that I want.
I don't even know if I am making this post in hope for help or abuse
