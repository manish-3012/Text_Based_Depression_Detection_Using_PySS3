Feeling low again.Hello people of reddit.  My life is feeling hopless and pointless again.  I cant motivate myself to get anything done.  Since ive been on medicaid my treatment sucks.  My psych doc is so painfully disinterested.  Was telling him about panic attacks getting worse on trintellix making it hard to work my new part time job.  Told how ive used ativan "as needed" in the past to manage.  He just bumps my trintellix dose and sends me on my way "see you in 2 months"

My counselor is worse.  She takes me 15 minutes late and ends the session 15 minutes early.  She seems like a vapid airhead and is difficult to talk to.  I miss my blue cross insurance so much.

My best friend moved away to live with his fiance, might as well write that off.  He really helped me through some tough spots but that support will be mostly gone.  Im sure well hang out a couple times a year...

Girl im crushing on at work just started dating someone else.  My inner voice is destroying me over my inaction.

I pretend im getting better.  I tell people things are better now a year after divorce.  But on days like this i feel just as suicidal as the day i tried to take my life

The recent midwest cold snap fucked my power steering.  There goes 1000 bucks i dont have.

The worst is the motivation.  I cant, i just cant.  I cant study for my CCNA, i cant wash the dishes or grocery shop or cook.  I cant clean, i cant even take care of my basic hygene.  I never exercise and eat my feeling daily.  Suicide by diet it would seem is my goal.

Found out my ex is pregnant with the guy she cheated on me with.  Theyre having a shotgun wedding on march 1st.  11 days before the 1 year anniversary of our divorce.

Im a complete mess.  Completely broken down with nothing and no one.  I mean, i have some people.  My parents are 1000 miles away every winter.  I have a 3yo daughter with my ex.  I love her dearly but cannot satisify my need for adult relationships.

I feel like a shit person, a shit son, and especially shitty father.  Whats the damn point.
