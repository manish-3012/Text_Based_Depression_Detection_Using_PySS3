About toIâ€™ve already taken the first half, I just need to add alcohol and Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™ve had enough of PTSD. Iâ€™ve had enough nightmares. My wife is leaving for a job interview in half an hour and we spent the first hour of our day fighting because I needed to play a video game to get the nightmares to go away. I wasnâ€™t being supportive enough for her, apparently. I was too focused on my own shit, apparently. Itâ€™s my fault the printer isnâ€™t working, apparently, and she didnâ€™t bother to print out resumes earlier this week, but Iâ€™m the one whoâ€™s in the wrong. I wonder, how much of this will feel like it matters to her when she finds me not breathing in the den? Iâ€™m done feeling like shit. Iâ€™m done hurting. Iâ€™m done.
