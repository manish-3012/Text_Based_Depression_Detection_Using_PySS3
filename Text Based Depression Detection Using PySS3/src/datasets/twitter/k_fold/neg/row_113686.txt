How to help my family and close friends deal with my suicide?Strange tittle question perhaps but I made this agreement with myself some time ago. As the days go by I know I'm reaching the point where I will be leaving this world through my own means, and for my own private reasons. 
I'm not necessarily against telling these people outright my plans, however detailed they wish them to be described, but the situation I would like to avoid is making them feel (even more than if I had said nothing) that they could have some how prevented this decision. 
I have kept a diary for the last 6 or so months for my thoughts and feelings, purposefully written in a format designed to be read by others. This was really going to be my suicide note as such. My greatest difficulty is trying to lessen the anguish as much as possible for those that I ultimately burden for the rest of their lives a traumatizing event they will surely feel they could have prevented and absolutely will not have expected in any way shape of form.
I appreciate all advice in advance and hope I have broken no forum rules. Regards, Tom.
