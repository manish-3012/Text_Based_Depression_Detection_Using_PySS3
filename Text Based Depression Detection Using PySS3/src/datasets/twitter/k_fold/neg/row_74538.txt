I don't know how I keep doing itEvery day is a struggle, I don't deserve to complain about my life because it's honestly not bad compared to others. But here I am anyway...

I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't know why there is something wrong with me, I do know that there's nothing to fix it and I know that I don't want to be here. Every morning I keep telling myself that the day will be my last and I can finally get it all done and over with but for whatever reason I keep living and every day I feel the same way and it's so much worse than death.

If someone asks me what's wrong or why I'm so miserable I honestly can't tell them. I guess there are things that contribute to it but there isn't actually one specific reason that I'm so depressed. I just know that I hate being here and I hate myself even more.

I really genuinely want to die, I don't know if it's me or other people or something else but for some reason I'm still here. How am I still here? Why am I still here? I ask myself questions like this too often.
