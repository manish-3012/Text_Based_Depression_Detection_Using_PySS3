Cheers.After a short, relatively ugly stint in the mental ward almost ten years ago I was discharged. Without insurance I couldn't keep my meds (they made me sick anyway), and so I have successfully been unmedicated bipolar/retardedly depressed for almost ten years and I've been *great*.

Have is the operative word here. I *have* been great. I'm not so great.

And everything would be fine if someone would just give me sixty hours a week and let me kill myself doing the most thankless shit.

I want to go to college and be a scientist but lolnofuckyou, hookerscientist. You don't have money, time, or transportation. Fuck you verily. Instead have two overly dependent parents who do jack and shit, a house with no heat, no hot water, and limited communication with the outside world. Oh, by the way, the low will be freezing pretty soon again - forty fucking degrees is balmy.

Ten years of doggedly arguing with this head of mine. Ten years of breaking self harm habits and modifying destructive behaviors. Ten years of striving to make the most of a school district that isn't worth shit. Ten years of being an independent little shit and taking care of your own goddamn self, much less around people who repeatedly question your worth and tear you down because lolfuckyou.

Ten years and I'm getting my ass kicked because my dad made a mistake and lost his job.

Ten years only to prove I'm a failure. Sounds good to me. All I can think is what a fucking waste.
