I don't like living life and I'm ready to end it. Really, I can't believe I've made it this far in life. I don't own anything other than a microwave that takes 11 minutes to warm up soup that should take 2 minutes and a few cans of soup with 4 shirts and 2 pairs of pants. I know there are people with less than me but honestly I couldn't care less about that. I've lived this bare minimum lifestyle so that I could get ahead in life. It didn't work. The price of everything went up and my pay went down. I'm sick of starting over and moving from town to town. In the long run I'm fucked. There won't be a day when I can retire, I'll never be able to enjoy this world around me. There will always be something else I could do or should have done. The people that are always around me make it worse too. If it isn't living around crack heads that keep you up at night it's working around morons that try to bully you. When you stand up for yourself you're kicked out of your home or fired from you job. It's a few months or a year or two of being homeless and then it starts all over again. No advancement, no reward for hard work, no one there that cares enough to listen. I'm tired of telling this story and I'm tired of breaking my back for $-41.61 in the bank. Nothing seems to work out. Everything with everyone is always a problem and I'm the reason it's so. 

There isn't really that much I wanted in life. It's too late now though  because I'm not going to start over again.
