Difficult to keep goingFor the past four days I couldnt stop thinking how much of a failure I am in life and that Im just a waste of air. Im 19 years old with no highschool education no friends no life skills nothing. I just dont see a point to keep going since by this point I feel dead on the inside and no one will really miss me if Im gone.
