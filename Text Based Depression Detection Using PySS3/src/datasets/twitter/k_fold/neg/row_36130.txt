I feel this is the only way outTonight i found out my ex who I am still in love with... We were together for a long time, lived together, spent almost every waking moment together. I learned today that she could live without me because we just said we were taking a break the other day(her idea) and now she is with someone else...

And on top of that, I have PTSD from the military, most of my friends ignore me now that they are married, or they just won't talk to me for some other reason i do not know of. I've lost 3 of my bestfriends in accidents in the last year including my grand mother.

I have no job, I drink way to much, and honestly the only person I really talk to all day anymore is my pet fish...

I just want it all to end, and I honestly think suicide is the only way out of my meaningless existence ...
