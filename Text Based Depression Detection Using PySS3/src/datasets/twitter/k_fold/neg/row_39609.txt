Something seems wrong ðŸ˜Something seems wrong with my mind and itâ€™s ability to function. Itâ€™s as if I have no common sense or foresight and it makes me feel like I could easily be manipulated or unable to read certain red flags or signs.

I started feeling this way when I attempted suicide it was like my mind switched and turned into a dull emotionless numb barbie. I feel partly brain washed. It feels like my mind isnâ€™t mine and Iâ€™ve nearly completely changed into something that isnâ€™t me. Idk who I am. I feel like I wonâ€™t ever be myself or who I want to be and I am freaking out. I feel like Iâ€™m going to attempt suicide again bc I donâ€™t want to live as a persona and not be who I want to be. And ppl donâ€™t understand itâ€™s not a possibility for me to be what I want. Iâ€™m not going to explain or answer to you.
