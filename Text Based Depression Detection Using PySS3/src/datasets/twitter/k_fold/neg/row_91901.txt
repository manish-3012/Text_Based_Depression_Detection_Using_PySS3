My fiancÃ© asked for a break. I havenâ€™t heard from him in 3 months.He took everything from me. All â€œourâ€ friends - nope. All his friends. I wasnâ€™t allowed to have my own friends. The ones I did got pushed out of my life. I deeply regret that.

We were together for nearly 6yrs. Lived together the last 3yrs. Moved into a beautiful apartment with space to grow as a family.

2 weeks later he needs space and moves out, leaving me with this insane rent I canâ€™t afford. He promises to work on himself and itâ€™s not me. Heâ€™ll be back and weâ€™ll be better than ever.

3 months go by and zero contact. Heâ€™s alway been a flirt it just kills me to know he is out there with someone else. I know he is. Heâ€™s never coming back to me.

My anxiety has just exploded. Canâ€™t pay my bills. Canâ€™t function. Work is a nightmare and I just come home as soon as I can and cry. I canâ€™t sleep. I have nightmares and heâ€™s always there pointing out how ugly I am and how unlovable I am and how I should just dig a hole and die.

I want to. I want to die. 3 months suffering in silence, going to work, barely holding it together, driving home wondering if Iâ€™ll see his car, terrified that I might.  Coming home to no one. Empty dream apartment that I canâ€™t afford. Waiting for the eviction notice. Laying around crying. Drinking and self harm trying to just numb out.

Iâ€™ve lost my damn mind and my entire life is a joke. A lie. Itâ€™s nothing. I want to die so bad. Every time I manage to sleep, I hope I never wake up.

I thought my life was starting. 28f, great job, great fiancÃ©. All a damn lie. Everything is falling apart.

Loneliness DOES kill.
First it drives you mad.
Then you just cry hysterically all the time.
And when youâ€™re so tired you canâ€™t stand?
Then it reminds you no one cares.

No one cares about me. And I want to die.
