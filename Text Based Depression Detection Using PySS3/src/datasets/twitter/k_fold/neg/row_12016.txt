I think everyoneâ€™s just waiting for me to actually go through with itItâ€™s a long story but i just donâ€™t care enough to type it all out. I just want to let out that even though Iâ€™ve been out of the behavioral hospital for declaring thoughts of suicide, i still want to do it even though itâ€™s been 2 months since Iâ€™ve been out. I donâ€™t have the strength to kill myself but Iâ€™m tired of cutting myself and never going over the edge
