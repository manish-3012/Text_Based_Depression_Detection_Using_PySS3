Tired and wanting to give up.I don't have anyone to talk to, so I'm posting here I guess.

I'm exhausted, both mentally and physically. I'm transgender, and I started HRT as an alternative to suicide a couple months ago. While I do feel a bit better, I can't help but wonder if I'm ever going to be happy.

I've longed for death the past 15 years. And I've lost track of the number of times I tried to end it all. I know this longing won't ever disappear, just thinking about the fact that it'll all be over someday is kind of relieving.

Besides, I feel like everyone wants us to die anyway. People tend to actively encourage our deaths and even rejoice over it. Who wants to live in a world they're not welcome in anyway?

I've always felt like I was unwanted and didn't belong, even as a child. And now that I've accepted that I'm trans, even more so. I feel like it's too late to try and fix my life. I no longer enjoy anything, and I'm no longer capable of doing anything at all by myself. This life has left me broken, and I'm already way past my expiry date.

I've set the date to be on my birthday, that way grieving dates will overlap. But I'm not even sure if I'll be able to hold on until then, or if I'm actually strong enough to do it.
