i ruined itits over. i think im finally gonna do it

i really did ruin everything. i had a chance at a good life, but i fucked it up

i made this account almost a year ago, the first time i actually considered killing myself. i laughd it off afterwards, but its been happening so much more frequently and i want this to be the last.i dont know why it happened this way. i spent my whole life blamig everyone else, thinking so highly of myself, but now i know that i contribute nothing to life and have no reason to live anymore. sorry guys
