its comingJust broke up with the only person who cares about me.  Told my best friend and he made a joke about being able to fuck her now.  Told my mom and she asked if I could bring her lunch.  Nobody else has said anything to me.  My friends all messaged her to offer their support.  My family hasn't checked in on me.  My ex is the only person who cares and she's moving out soon.  

My friends and family only like me because I'm funny.  I'm just a clown to them.  

We broke up because of my issues.  I didn't want to end up being someone she hated and I wanted to improve myself which requires me being single.  She understands and wants to leave the door open but I don't want to get my hopes up.  

I'm 23 and I turn 24 this month.  I'm all alone.
