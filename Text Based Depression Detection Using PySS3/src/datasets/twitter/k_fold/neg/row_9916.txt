How does this whole "seek help" and "reach out" thing work outI literally don't understand it. I don't have much family and the family I do have is far away and can't do much other than talk to me. Ive talked about it a lot. I always talk about it. That doesn't make me better. My brain is bad.   
    
My fiance is good. He helps me. But he's tired. He can't save me y'know. He holds me while I have panic attacks and makes sure I know I'm not getting psychosis or anything lol. But he can't make me not have panic attacks. He can alleviate my anxiety but he can't take it away.      
    
I'm at my wit's end. I've been having a breakdown for the last 3 hours. Been on the brink for days. I'm kinda calming down, enough to type this out and stop thinking about how I'm gonna off myself.    
    
Everyone says reach out. Seek help. Ok. What do I do. It's gonna take a long time before I can see a professional cuz I have to go to my regular doctor and even getting an appointment to see him takes at least 2 weeks. I can go to the hospital but last time I tried that I checked myself out bc the waiting room made me super anxious.      
    
So yes I can go to therapy but every DAY has been getting worse. Every second. I felt like my shift at work today was fuckin YEARS long but it was just the standard 9 hours and nothing that bad even happened. It was a chill day. But I felt so trapped. So idk. I feel like I can't wait weeks. But who do I reach out to. What do I do. Please tell me. This is my last cry for help before I absolutely go off the deep end. I KNOW my mental health and I know that when I feel like this it's only a short matter of time until I fall apart entirely for months. Please help me stop it. Please. I want to get help.
