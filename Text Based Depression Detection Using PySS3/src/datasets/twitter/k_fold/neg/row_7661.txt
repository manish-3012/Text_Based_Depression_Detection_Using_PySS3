Just turned 18 todayAs you can tell by the title today is my 18th birthday, so why do I feel so empty? Iâ€™m not here for people to wish me happy birthday or anything, I just had to get some things off my chest. So for the third year in a row my friends forgot my birthday. At this point I would be used to it by now but this year really hurt cause less than 2 weeks ago, we were all out celebrating my friends birthday and making plans for mine. Obviously it didnâ€™t happen because Iâ€™m slowly starting to realize they donâ€™t truly accept me as their friend, Iâ€™ll always just be the outsider who joined the group 3 years ago. A couple hours ago me, my parents and my brother went out for a nice supper and then my aunt and two cousins came over after for some cake. But yet after all this, Iâ€™ve got this feeling I havenâ€™t felt in a while. Itâ€™s just this feeling of boredom, not boredom in the sense of â€œOh Iâ€™m so bored, Iâ€™m gonna go outside and playâ€. Itâ€™s more like Iâ€™m bored of my life. Iâ€™m bored of the same daily routine. I donâ€™t get invited out anywhere, me and my family can barely hold a conversation with each other and I canâ€™t open up to any of my friends because I will just get made fun of. Iâ€™m bored of just living to live. Iâ€™m also scared of the future, Iâ€™m scared of going to college to study a degree Iâ€™m not that passionate about. Iâ€™m scared to move out with 0 real world skills and 0 real work hours. Whenever I think of the future, I donâ€™t envision my self with a family or working at my dream job, I actually donâ€™t see much when I think of the future. Thatâ€™s cause I donâ€™t see myself being alive in the next couple years. Maybe this is stupid to say but I feel like itâ€™s my fate for my life to end on my own terms. Maybe this fate doesnâ€™t come true tomorrow or the next day, but eventually it will. I donâ€™t expect much people to read all of this but I just had to get this off my chest.
