Fuck this is going to sound awful. I have a sweet lil 11mo old goober, and a badass wife. They should be enough of a reason,But the past few weeks, I've been praying to the gods at night to please let me sleep forever. I always heard that saying,"praying for death" but I didn't know how all encompassing that mindset really is. It's getting harder to imagine that tommorow will be better. I know how fucking selfish and shitty of me this sounds, but fuck, internet strangers, I gotta get this shit out. Just because I'm moving, doesn't mean I'm not a corpse.
