New to this - probably am not suicidalSmall backstory for why I think I feel this way: been going to a really good college all year. Made more than a few poor choices and haven't done my homework, have not gone to certain things I was supposed to, and as a result I've dug myself in a hole which puts my GPA at a point too low for me to receive my grant for next year. My parents can't afford for me to go without the grant.

I don't see much of anything ahead that I want for my future. I considered suicide as a hypothetical, I'm not depressed and I don't think I'm suicidal per se.

When I considered the option, it felt so good. Somewhat euphoric, like being buzzed from a cigarette. When I dismissed suicide this feeling went away. And when I thought about it again, I felt the pleasure again.

Has anyone else experienced this? I highly doubt I'm ever going to go through with it, but I have a concern that this good feeling could be a problem. Only reason I'm putting this here is because if I told my friends they'd be freaked out and try to get me "help."
