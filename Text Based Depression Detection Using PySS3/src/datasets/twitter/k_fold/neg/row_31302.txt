I'm confused and I don't know if I'm going to kill myself on the next 5 minutes or just slowly drink myself to death or keep going or what. I just need something right now.I'm 18. I've suffered with severe depression on and off for about two or three years now. A year ago I met an amazing girl and I fell in love with her. We fell out because of my depression, she came back a year later, we had quite a serious fling, the first serious relationship I've ever had. Then it happened again, pushed her away with my illness, now she wants nothing to do with me and I can't fix that. Earlier I sobbed but now I just feel dead inside, like I'm not even myself. I'm confused and hurting and I don't know if I'm in shock or what. I honestly think I might kill myself soon and I couldn't care less. I really don't understand what's happening or who I am. It feels like I'm already dead.
