Today my brother told me he tried to commit suicide# My brother (26) opened to me today and told me he tried to commit suicide about two months ago. He took a cocktail of 24 pills, but he said his body just automatically purged them.

He was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about a year ago and went to a therapist for a short period of time. He eventually went on the recommended medication, which did not agree with his body at all.

They had some major side effects and so was advised to go off them. He decided to go off them cold turkey, which I have since learnt is not advisable. I, therefore, asked him where he got the pills he tried to OD with and he said he was given a prescription by a doctor. Would a doctor prescribe drugs that could be used to OD on to someone who has clear signs of depression? We are based in the UK and from what I know of the medical system here, it is pretty robust when it comes to prescribing drugs, but I am open to being corrected.

He says he has suffered from sleep paralysis (though not for quite some time now) and hallucinations (told me he still suffers from this today). He said he sees people coming into his room and then leave. It usually lasts a couple of minutes and he feels anxious whilst it's happening.

Though I am glad he trusts me enough to open to me about his attempted suicide, I am lost. I don't know what else I can do to be supportive other than telling him that I am there for him and that I am contactable at any time of the day. He said he hasn't told anyone else about this, but did end the call by saying he will go to see a doctor tomorrow about a possible referral to a new therapist.

My mind has been travelling a mile a minute since he told me about this earlier and I don't know where I should go from here. Please help Reddit.
