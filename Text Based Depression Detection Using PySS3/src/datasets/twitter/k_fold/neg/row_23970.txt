Just lost my only friendWe were very close and she was always there for me. Well a few months back we had a falling out and I thought it was over. It was actually so bad I had to go to the hospital for Stress Cardiomyopathy and that almost killed me.
Anyway 2 weeks ago she decided to mend things with me and I fucked up again. If she doesn't forgive me again, which I don't deserve, I have a shotgun and I'll give my wall a fresh coat of paint. She was the only bond I have and I might have lost it forever...
