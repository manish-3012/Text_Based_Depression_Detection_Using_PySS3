I can't cope anymore.I'm 20 and I've had anxiety for about 6 years. It's always been challenging but it's never been unbearable before. 2 months ago my American boyfriend came to stay with me (I live in Turkey). During this time everything was stressful, in fact I don't think I've ever been that stressed in my life. I did things I'd never dream of before. But pushing myself so much broke me. I already had eating problems for years because I feared choking, but a new obsession presented itself. I thought I was losing my language skills. Reading writing speaking became incredibly hard for me at times, which I saw a neurologist about. Clean bill of health. Just elevation of my general anxiety disorder. I started seeing a therapist. 
A week ago he left. I also changed antidepressants about 5 days ago and I've never felt this miserable in my life. I'm either crying my eyes out because he's not gonna be able to come back for 6 months, which is a long ass time considering how much I struggle everyday. Or I feel restless and hollow at the same time. Like I should jog to the train station in freezing weather and throw myself in front of a train. I don't know if this is just a combined effect of Prozac and my boyfriend leaving but I'm really at the end of my rope. I have a bottle of Klonopin I could down and I'm sure it would at least send me into a coma. And on the bright side no one would care because they have their own problems to deal with. All I am and all I've ever been is a burden to myself and others.
