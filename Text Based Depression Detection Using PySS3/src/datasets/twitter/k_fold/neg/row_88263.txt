All I can think today is taking a whole aspirin box and then cutting my wrists. To put my mind off it, I wrote a poem.If youâ€™d came through for me,

If you were here for me,

If youâ€™d let me be me,

If only I felt free.


Instead, I am trapped, scared, scarred,

Pleading for my life

To an unknown god that wonâ€™t hear me,

To all the heroes and saints,

they are all so perfect.


And yet, only the silence answers,

With questions, accusations, with misery.

In the end, all my gods are dead,

All I am is past history.
