Monday June 11th I will depart from this worldI am too much of a burden and it really sucks it has to come to this I am thinking right at 12 am on the dot if you see my post on depression sub reddit it explains my life and its troubles somewhat I post on there often I have nothing to live for im just a depressed 19 year old I already posted my suicide note once on instagram but deleted it but someone saw and was worried but this time I am going to write a very long one and it will be the final draft.  I just don't know how I am going to end it probably a knife. But I will be lurking here for a while its gonna be  a long 2 weeks
