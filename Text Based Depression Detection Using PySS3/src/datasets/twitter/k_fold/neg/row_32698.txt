Seeking advice. I ruined my life within a year and I'm too coward to move forward.TDLR I've messed up my life but it can be fixed...if I suck it up. I just don't seem to have that courage.

Long:
Second semester of my first year of college, there were all the preindicators that I wasn't going to graduate. I didn't buy my books, i torrented them. I rarely showed up to class. I isolated myself. Turns out, those reasons made me take a leave.
That leave made me see how naive I once was. I thought college was stupid, and people with low self-esteem went there for validation. Well, wasn't I in for a rude awakening?
I am one of of those stupid, low self-esteem people LOL. I've spent the whole semester outside of school, in my house on reddit. My mom wants me to get a job but I can't even get out of bed. The dream of being a successful entrepreneur dropout was all in my head...
The friends I made weren't and that hurts. They were real and when I left, life progressed there...they toughed their sophomore year out...together. Those times I'll never get back. I've lost my rank and while that doesn't matter, it kind of does.
friends were what kept me going when I couldn't go. I'm stubborn so it's hard to see clearly rn and I'm out of the loop. several don't text me back, i'm inactive on facebook and it's bad.
what's worse- my anxiety has skyrocketed, i feel hopeless, and i realize I had it all just a year ago...a wide-eyed 18 year old with a full-paid scholarship.
So why won't i just swallow my pride and return? before i left, i wrote this girl a love letter and showed it to her. she never responded and im afraid of seeing her again. what if she hates me, what if shes afraid of me, what if she doesnt even remember and ive been thinking for nothing?
im such a coward i might end my life over this semester. i know college isnt the answer, but its the question. Can you endure? I'm not sure anymore.
