I've being preparing to kill my self for a month or so.. Then few things freak things today have left me thinking otherwise!So today I was sat in my run down car in a parking spot.. I was trying to get my head down (sleep) and car pulled right up to me and never turned the radio down, it made it impossible to sleep! Then next to me on the other side an old guy pulled up, really old and kept playing his radio!
So eventually I sat up, I was so tired, and i just acted like these guys, the old bloke to my right, just chilling in the car park... After abouy 15 minutes and two hours for the old guy they left..
I then started hating people over and over again, I even started googling on my phone are people like rats, because that's how I felt just then...
I fell asleep again and woke up an noticed there was some nice cars behind me and there was one bloke looking at me..... I thought time to go turned my ignition and nothing just that dull click over and over again.......I started to hate humans again, after I seen a an get old feller get in  his merc with a smile on his face as he heard my ignition fail...
Then in the car park came a pappa John pizza driver for some reason, I said this is along shot mate but you won't have some jump leads on you would you, to cut along story short, my car is running and so is my life thanks to this guy, I was suicidal..
And my earlier thoughts about humans being rats are not true... I was saved today by somone that earns nothing... I was shrugged by somone that earns somthing!
