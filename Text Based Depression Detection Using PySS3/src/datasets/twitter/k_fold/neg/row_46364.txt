Trying to AttemptI just stood on my 3rd story porch for a half hour. The only thing that kept me from going over was the fear that it wouldn't work, that 3 stories onto grass wouldn't be enough of an impact to end it. I've ruined my own life. Sexually harassed multiple women online and have an inquiry opened by my university. I can't tell my parents. The shame is already killing me, but I'll just starve if I can't bring myself to jump.
