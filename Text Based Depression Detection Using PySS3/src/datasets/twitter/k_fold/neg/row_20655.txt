Iâ€™m tiredHi guys,
I was depressed before quarantine and I could easily hide my depression of my parents  because my parents donâ€™t come in my room often but during quarantine I had several anxiety attacks and moments where I cried for hours straight. I almost never left my room and days turned into weeks, I was stuck in a loop where I couldnâ€™t take care of myself (hygiene/eat). My mom sent me to several therapists even before quarantine because she found a diary of mine where I said some of my intrusive thoughts (thatâ€™s the thing that pushed her to take me to a therapist lmao even after I complained about not feeling well). She kind of dismissed it (the idea of me needing a therapist) but I kept on insisting and when she did let me see therapists, the ones I saw didnâ€™t work. I have a new therapist now but Iâ€™ve only seen her twice in the span of two months and when we talk it doesnâ€™t help me. Iâ€™ve been on vacation for a week now in another country and I just want to go home. Iâ€™ve had a LOT of intrusive thoughts recently. I think of killing myself everyday. Iâ€™ve talked about it to my friends but I didntâ€™t want to scare them so I pushed them away and now I only have 5 friends left (even if thatâ€™s a lot) I only have one that is a close one and I canâ€™t seem to talk to her about anything. The last time I tried I had a huge anxiety attack and to cheer me up she poured water on my back (because she didnâ€™t know how to react) and I re-went in this phase where I couldnâ€™t breathe properly or move. I just ran to the bathroom and started to hit my head on the wall. I canâ€™t decide if I want to live or die because living seems like such a burden but I couldnâ€™t live in a world/afterlife without my family,friends and music.

Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m venting I just canâ€™t tell this to anyone else rn.

TL;DR: venting about my mental health/life and contemplating suicide
