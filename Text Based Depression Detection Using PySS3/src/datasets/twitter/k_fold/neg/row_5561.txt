Is there any reason to tell people Iâ€™m suicidal?I mean seriously what would it accomplish? I spend most of my days just wanting to be dead how could anyone actually help? My family? My parents donâ€™t believe in depression or â€œtreatmentâ€ theyâ€™ll just think they failed another kid. My friends? What can they do besides pity their poor friend and worry about me even more. My teachers? Iâ€™m already a failure, I can hardly face my teachers as it is why would I want them knowing Iâ€™m beyond help. What would anybody do? Call someone before I hurt myself? Iâ€™d kill myself before I get checked into the asylum here. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore but I know Iâ€™d rather die than wake up tomorrow.
