My life is so miserable and the only way I keep myself afloat is through escapismI'm 16, I've been severely bullied for almost 2 years now, I've recently discovered a hate page that posts pictures of me with awful, disgusting captions that are used to entice older men. I have an abusive ex that hates my guts and leaked my nudes. I run the risk of running homeless because my father is so in debt with the utilities and he barely pays our bills. My mom has age-inappropriate expectations for me and treats me as if I'm her therapist, I'm expected to also juggle AP classes at school, study for my SATs and obviously do well. 

There is nothing redeemable about my life. There used to be, but now I cannot think of anything. The only thing that keeps me afloat is escapism, whether that's chasing after a crush or a partner, locking myself in my room for hours, listening to music, etc.. I am genuinely so miserable. I want to die, I really do want to die. I haven't thought about it in a while but that's because I always act like things aren't as bad as they really are. It's like, I might as well just give the people who bully me what they want. Fuck this dude.
