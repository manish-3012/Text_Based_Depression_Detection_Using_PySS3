Struggling with life, need someone to talk to...Been struggling with depression for 2 years so far... My mom is always yelling at me about how I'm bad at school and how a lot of people are doing better. I then think to myself that why do they waste their time for a useless brat like me? I can't even get straight A's while everyone else I know does. They have all of the good stuff such as their own high-tech phones and fast computer while I just have a potato computer and my mom took away my privileges, I need someone to talk to online, but I can't from my limits.
My mom always wanted me to change to study hard, but I keep trying, it just won't work for me.
I'm losing trust within my real life peers, it seems that they've all betrayed me or can't feel what I'm feeling. I suck at everything, the only thing I'm good at is games, but that doesn't impress my mom or anyone. Just myself and no one else.

I'm running out of options, I'm getting to the point where I might end my misery and kill myself...
