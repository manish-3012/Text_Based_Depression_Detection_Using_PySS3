Waiting to dieI havenâ€™t found an effective way to kill myself and Iâ€™m afraid it wonâ€™t work and Iâ€™ll be handicapped or something so Iâ€™m just waiting. I wish the government didnâ€™t regulate drugs, it makes suicide a lot more difficult than it should be Thereâ€™s nothing that I enjoy in life. The only thing Iâ€™m good at is school and I hate it. At work my boss found I had falsified data (I go door to door, canvassing and some days Iâ€™m too anxious to do it so I just fake it). I havenâ€™t been fired yet, but Iâ€™m a disgrace and am so embarrassed. My life isnâ€™t that bad, relatively, but thereâ€™s literally no reason for me to continue living because I enjoy nothing and am always in pain. I also have no social life because I moved and my anxiety makes me prefer being alone to trying to make friends. Iâ€™m a senior and next year Iâ€™ll be going to college so that means if I donâ€™t kill myself Iâ€™ll have to spend another consecutive year at a new school with no friends. There is nothing in life that I enjoy and I get mad when I see people that are naturally happy and social because Iâ€™m jealous. Everyone at my school is always so happy and friends with everyone, I hate it.
