Seems hopelessI am worried about myself, my thoughts and eventually my own actions. People always tell you things will get better, but will they actually? Isn't it just a trick to keep you from complaining and making sure you won't harm yourself?

I feel helpless, I feel as if I don't have any grip on life itself anymore. I usually blame myself, telling me I was the one who screwed up and now does not want to accept any help.

Long story short; I suffer from mental problems and as a result I ruin everything I love. I hate myself. I harm myself. People always seem to leave me. I can't even separate dreams from reality anymore. I am too sensitive for this life. I cannot see how I will ever be able to cope. I've tried to kill myself once, and I know I will try it again, I just don't know when. I have been in therapy for years, been to a mental hospital twice, meds don't seem to work well on me. I feel as if the only way for me to go is backwards. I just don't see a way out.
