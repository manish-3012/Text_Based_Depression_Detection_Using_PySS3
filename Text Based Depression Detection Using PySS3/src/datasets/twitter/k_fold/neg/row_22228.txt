Anxiety. Loneliness. Confuse.24m. Im an only child. The way i deal with loneliness as a young adult is seeking the warmth of another body and this often meant prostitution as In really bad socializing. Got gonorheaa last year. Recovered. And now it seems I might had contracted another STI. Too afraid to go to doctor for checkup.

Friend of mine attempted suicide last year. Really admire her having that courage. I just dont know why Im doing these things or having these thoughts. I, dont know what to live for.
