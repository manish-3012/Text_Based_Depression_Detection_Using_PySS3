I'm getting more comfortable with the ideaI just downed two shots of Vikings Blood mead and two shots of NyQuil. I've been researching the most painless ways to go. Decided on sleeping pills mixed with this crap. I'm not doing it today but it's getting easier to think about doing it. I can't even type the words out. The folks in my life that do know I'm suicidal which is really just my wife and doctor don't help. My wife just says she doesn't know how to help and walks away. Life's been downhill after my major car accident that required back surgery. Lost everything. Living with the inlaws. Went from owning my own business to working in a grocery store. I know there's bigger things happening in the world but I can't stop thinking about "it". I don't want to live here in this apathetic world.
