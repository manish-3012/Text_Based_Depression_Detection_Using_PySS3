That Feeling Again.It's quite common for me. I see no reason to live. I'm sure you've heard it all before. But I really don't want to. There's nothing that makes me happy. The only solution is to load myself full of pills. No thanks. I'm so tired of hearing generic statements "It gets better" "The storm will pass" "You're not alone".

It's all just so pointless. There really is no plausible solution other than to kill myself. I'm not going to keep living like this and merely hope that it will change. It's never changed. I've always been like this. And I'm definitely not going to change myself. So why not do it? That's how I feel.
