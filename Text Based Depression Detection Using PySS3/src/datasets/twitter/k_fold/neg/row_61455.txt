There's no point in human trash being aliveI'm useless, stupid, ugly, i make nobody happy, i annoy everyone, i'm so boring, i'm so quiet, i just make everybody hate me, i'm ugly, i'm fat. Everybody is better off without me i just deserve to die for being this pathetic and worthless. I'm just a massive disappointment and failure who wasn't meant to be born. You would want me to die as well if you knew me in real life and that's okay because i deserve death and pain. 

I have around 35 pills to overdose on. I just don't want to fail and end up being alive with liver failure or some shit
