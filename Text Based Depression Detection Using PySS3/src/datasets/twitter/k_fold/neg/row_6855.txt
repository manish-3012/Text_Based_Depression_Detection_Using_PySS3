Iâ€™m at that point where I need someone to tell me not to do it everyday. I want to just disappear.Iâ€™ve told my family and friends they all seem very passive about the whole thing. Idk what to do. I donâ€™t want to go back to the hospital. But I have no one here that wants to help me. My roommates only care that Iâ€™m a work or that Iâ€™m cleaning and my family only cares that Iâ€™m paying my phone bill. Iâ€™ve missed worked because I am afraid to go outside some days. There is something wrong with me. A bug. Either I want it fixed or I want to die. Two options. Iâ€™ll take help but those are my options.
