Longterm Plan for Suicide Anyone?I guess the only reason why I am not seriously contemplating suicide is because my family (my parents+ younger brother) needs me to support them financially.

But, I come to the decision that once I outgrew my purpose I will gladly embrace the void. Seriously, who the fuck came up with the horror story we call existence?
