How childhood sexual abuse ruined my lifeMolested by father. Emotionally neglected by mother. Abandoned in foster care from 12-18. Raped numerous times. Abused and neglected both in institutions and in foster homes. 

Today has proven to me that the damage my father has done to me has been irreparable. For the rest of my life, what he has done to me as a child will forever affect every single aspect of my life. It will permeate all positivity in my life and engulf it with its endless darkness. Because he trained me to please him like a wife from the age of 5, I have been hypersexual. I was trained to please, and thatâ€™s why I have such a lax attitude about sex. I have had sex with countless men I donâ€™t care about. Constantly put myself in danger for a bit of validation. 

There are a thousand anguished screams stuck in my throat. Iâ€™ve always been discarded. I am here again, but it hurts because you were the nicest man to me in my life. You were the kindest man in my life. You know more about me than my father. I trusted you. I let you in. I told you that I was molested as a child. I never told another man this. 

If I wasnâ€™t touched as a child, I would not be a sexual person. I wish that things were different and I could have been the person you wanted me to be. But you said you canâ€™t be with someone who doesnâ€™t value themselves, no matter how intelligent, kind, and beautiful they are. 

To my father: when you die, you will have to answer to your maker for what youâ€™ve done to me. Those times where you used me for your own sexual gratification and sick satisfaction will never make sense in my mind. I was five years old. I hate you. Itâ€™s because of you my life is falling apart sixteen years later. Why do I have to pick up the pieces?
