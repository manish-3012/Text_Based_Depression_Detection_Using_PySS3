WhyWhy am i expected to live this life. I want to end it so badly yet something so deep inside me tells me not to. Maybe it's the ape in me hanging onto the last pieces to keep me alive. I feel a calmness i haven't felt in a long time. I know i can take this blade and kill myself.. yet I'm not doing that. Why am i such a pussy. How much longer can i last.
