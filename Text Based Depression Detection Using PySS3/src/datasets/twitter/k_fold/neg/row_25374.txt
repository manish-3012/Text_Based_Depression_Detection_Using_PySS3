Getting close to the tipping pointI can't even go to my usual coffee shop anymore. Every evening when I'm there doing work, I see this absolutely gorgeous girl who sorta knows who I am and who I kind of know. It just reminds me of my crippling loneliness. I can't even go to my coffee shop anymore without being reminded that I spend my evenings alone at the coffee shop with my laptop doing school work (as opposed to the only alternative I have, which is spending my evenings alone in my apartment).

I can't really do anything anymore without being reminded of all that's wrong with me and my entire life.
