I really hate the holidays.Another year. Another year of having to plaster a fake ass smile on my face and pretend like Iâ€™m actually enjoying my existence. Another year of various family members asking me what Iâ€™ve been up to (depression &amp; endless appointments with the psychiatrist) and what my plans are for the future. Another year of my immediate family telling me to fix my face or go away if I canâ€™t fit in and be a part of the holiday. Another year of being forced to socialize with people that donâ€™t give a shit about me &amp; that I donâ€™t care to talk to anyway. I really want all of this to be over. I canâ€™t stand it any longer.
