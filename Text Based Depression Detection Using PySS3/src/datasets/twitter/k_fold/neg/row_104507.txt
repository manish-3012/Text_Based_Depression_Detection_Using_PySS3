I'm trapped**Post I put in a thread on suicide**

I've been semi suicidal the last 2 months so fuck it throwaway venting.

I grew up poor and abused. After my situation improved when I was 12 I began trying to get out and get to a better place. I spent from 13-24 dreaming the American dream. In 12 years I had gone from under educated impoverished child to a college educated man with a wife, house, career and car.

I hate my career,
I hate my house,
and I am not fond of paying out the ass for my car just to keep the house and career.

My wife and I met at 17 and she is an intelligent and beautiful person. She is also very selfish. We opened up our relationship, a thing I still don't regret. In that time though she got caught up with other guys and neglected me. I never wanted her to be hurt so I didn't tell her that it's ok she sleeps with other guys I just needed some love too. I tried to tell her in my way but couldn't I had accepted that I had lost the love of my life to my own idiocy.

At the same time I started dating one of her friends (against the rules if I asked but her friend approached me which was ok) and we fell in love almost instantly. We both went through almost the same thing as children, we have incredible amounts of things in common. For the first time in my life someone understood me. Which in the process of making me very happy almost entirely destroyed me. The stark contrast of being understood for the first time ever with the rest of my life has left me in shambles. On top of that I told me wife I fell in love with this woman and I've been trying to work it out since.

I know I'd be happier with the new woman and so would she. I believe my wife would be happier with a man more like her. My wife is putting all of the blame on me for the situation. I am "cheating" as she calls it. I am the one doing all the wrong. Why is it wrong that 2 people who have felt isolated and alone found each other?

On top of everything my house is signed by the father in law. It's also worth $10,000 less than when I bought it. So I can't sell it at above a loss and I can't abandon it as it would be a terrible thing to do to my father in law.
So I am stuck with:

* A house I don't want,

* A career I have to have to keep that house,

* A car and loan to get to and from the job that just had the check engine light come on today god fucking damnit.

* A wife who is blaming me for our joint failing marriage,

* A G/F who is being torn apart by her role in all of this,

* I have debt for almost every item on this list. Debt that financial advisers told me was a wise decision, debt that I was told to take on so I could chase my dreams. Dreams that I was told would finally give me some happiness. So that one day I could fucking feel like I'm not a societal mistake, that I contribute more than I take to the world.

What do I do? I hate my life and I see no solution that doesn't cause others pain. Throw on top of all of this that I have psychological disorders I can't get help for because the waiting list is 16-20 weeks long. One of those disorders being that I have incredible empathy for loved ones. I literally feel everyone's pain in this situation. I know how much my wife's heart is breaking at losing her husband. At the same time I know my g/f heart is breaking because for the first time in her life someone has understood the rape, abuse, poverty, torture she went through and not recoiled in disgust or thought of her as ugly because of it. But that person is a married man and she is contributing to ruining a marriage 

I just want everyone I love to be happy but making any of them happy will make others unhappy. Making myself happy will cause others unhappiness that will in turn make me unhappy. Doing the same thing day in and day out is the least painful option but it's wearing me down. I cry silently at my desk many days. I wake up and arrive late to work because I fantasize about killing myself instead of living another day in this perpetual state of impossible.

We are in crunch time at work so if I don't show up and work my ass off everyday then the company may go under. So I can't even take time off.

And then it's become clear either through my abilities or understanding that no one knows how or why I am in this situation. It's incredibly clear people misunderstand me. All I want in this life is to love others and do something great. There is more standing in my way to doing that than I can handle. I need help, I can't do this but who will help me? Everyone on here will tell me to lawyer up, gym hitting etc etc. 

I'm so stuck and I hate this life. I hate this society we live in. I hate the way our government works and I hate that I understand just how screwed I am. I just want to die. I don't want to have to look at my wife with tears in her eyes as she begs me to fix this. I can't because part of the problem is things she has to deal with but won't because she is blaming it on g/f existing and not on her neglect. I hate this and just want to kill myself. It will hurt others but not as much as others are hurting me.

I am afraid that without help my willingness to endure will be seriously compromised. I have already seriously considered it on 2 instances. I also attempted suicide at 11 and failed. I know I'm capable of doing it and this time I'm afraid I'm much smarter than 11 year old me and won't fail.
