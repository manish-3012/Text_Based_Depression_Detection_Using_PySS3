Strap in, this is a long, mostly vent-oriented post. Feel free to move on.My entire family except for my father is on antidepressants. Or were, I don't know, I don't keep up with them. I hate spending time with them. Moving on.

I've actually always been pretty well adjusted, comparatively. I had a weird patch in high school where I didn't feel like I had direction or was accomplishing anything and I sort of let everything go and had a meltdown, but I picked myself back up and have been fine ever since. Nowadays I have a great significant-other of 4 years, a cat, and some post secondary education.

I went to University for 2 years, switched tracks a couple times, and eventually bailed all-together. I'm preparing to go to College for a new program soon. It's cheaper, faster, and I think I'll like the program more. Except student loans in my area are a joke, and I'm flat fucking broke. The student loans they plan to give me are about 2 grand short of my absolute minimum living expenses, and that's living on about a grand (total!) per month, plus school expenses. $1,000 in my area per month is a fucking joke, but I somehow manage it anyway. My peers pay about $2,000 at least. I grabbed a job to pay bills/earn some savings before my new program starts, but it's minimum wage, it works me waaaay to hard for that pay-grade, and they don't give me enough hours to make ends meet. I'm looking for another job now because going there everyday pretty much always reduces me to tears. It just all seems so fucking helpless and hopeless.

My SO is great, she knows about all of this except for the magnitude and how bad it is, and is super supportive, but we don't share many interests recently, so we're not spending too much time together doing things, and she seems like she's reaching the end of her rope holding me together all the time. We've been getting in weird 'fights' a lot recently, and it fucking sucks every time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, it's just all been going on for so long now that I can't fathom escaping it all, I haven't talked to any friends in a while, and I hate being together with my SO recently. It's a lot of guilt and stupid fights and more guilt. I've been trying to figure out how to kill myself, and failing that, put myself out of commission enough to merit not having to care. But there wouldn't be an insurance pay out for her, and it seems difficult to do painlessly, and I'm a coward. And honestly, if I had a choice between "All of your financial problems are solved", and "Instant Painless Death", I'd definitely pick the former, it just doesn't seem realistic that I'll get there anytime soon. I don't even know why I'm making this post I guess, and I'm certainly not proof-reading. I suppose this just seemed like the most likely place that someone would care.

It's more like this: If I'm dead sometime soon, that's great, this is my suicide note, and my last thoughts on the world. It fucking sucked. It took all of my happy thoughts, probably fucking burnt them into more pollution, (that's right, I have existential crises about the state of our planet and society too, bitches), and it's left me empty. There are good things, this subreddit included, but honestly they don't stack up at all. I'm so fucking eager to be done with all of this.

If I'm not dead, I guess you guys did something right, or I guess my situation reached a miracle, or I decided that I would suffer on because my SO is actually super dependent on me (it's actually my only sticking point with the relationship, it can get sort of suffocating sometimes). Regardless, if even one person reads this, thanks. I've felt heard. I hope this is the last you hear from me.
