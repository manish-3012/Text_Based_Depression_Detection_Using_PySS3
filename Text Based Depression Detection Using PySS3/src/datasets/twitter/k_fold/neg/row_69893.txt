Iâ€™ll be honest, there doesnâ€™t exist a day were I donâ€™t feel suicidal : (Every single day the thought always comes back. "Kill yourself" "do it" "youâ€™re worthless" "everyone hates you". Combine this with isolation, loneliness and parents who donâ€™t understand and you get the picture. Itâ€™s a lonely existence and a painful one. Iâ€™m just trying to keep myself sane here, I felt so good, mania, I was jumping and dancing and then my depression came back and it hit me harder than ever, suicidal depression in a way.
