22 Bigger VA guy just wanting to end it allI've been dealing with depression for a while and have been trying to work on it. However, after facing numerous rejections from guys, I really just don't feel wanted anymore. No one wants a fat, clingy, suicidal, scarred guy as a boyfriend. If I'm gonna die alone, why prolong it any further?
