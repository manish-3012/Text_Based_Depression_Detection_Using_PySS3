Has seeking help worked?I was recently at the end of my life but my mum kept my head together and I have been able to slowly to a grip on myself and life. (Still not happy to be here) 
But I did promise her Iâ€™d seek help because of the pain I was putting her through, but I found there to be no help at all!!! All the crisis numbers and websites and foundations and they were all so difficult to contact and I feel no help at all. 
I want to change that by setting up an easier way to get support and basically anything I think would have helped me at my lowest point. 

I just want so opinions and thoughts, maybe some input and help. Thank you in advance
