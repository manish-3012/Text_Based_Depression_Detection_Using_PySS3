I have never been so far in such state of suicide and hopelessnessI am suffering, period. I have had lots of suicidal thoughts but never an action or force. This time, it's worse than ever. Never been so bad. I have never felt so hopeless and taking a decision to suicide. I found myself planning my suicide. I found myself for the first time in my life taking a conscious decision to end it all. I write this with tears flooding off my eyes. My heart racingly pounding. I feel alive no more.

Never went from "optimistic no matter what" to "total hopelessness and disbelief in life".

Nothing is the same for everybody. A situation that might seem nothing to you can be a traumatic experience.

I feel no more. I don't live in a region with suicidal Hotline and can't afford a therapist either. My only choice is to dump it all here until we see who wins the fight : **Me** or **Suicide**.

If you see someone, he might seem male and masculine. He might seem large. He might seem fit. But don't let that distract you. He's clearly open with you. You know from his way of interaction that he might be autistic or with SAD. Doesn't matter he's very weak and fragile, you know that. No matter what he does, do not hurt him. He's so fragile and he's so open about it. An action towards him can actually terrorize and traumatize him. The kid is so fragile, that he can be abused and manupilated by kids years under his age. It's all clear and y'all know it. That kid can commit Suicide so easy. Don't prejudice his weirdness or large body. A body that he didn't choose doesn't mean he can actually use his body. Don't face that kid with Toxic Masculinity, **you're a man**, **men are strong**. Never hold anything against that kid.
