Life is starting to feel like it can only end in suicide..I have no options no hope..either suffer indefinitely or stop all the pain...I canâ€™t handle it anymore..life..itâ€™s so overwhelming and I feel like Iâ€™m fucking suffocating and I have no one no help no one to turn to I feel like my only option to ever feel happiness is to commit suicide already..I just want to throw on my favorite movie take a fuck ton of sleeping pills and drift away and feel genuine happieness again one last time...because I really donâ€™t think itâ€™ll happen ever again for me..Iâ€™ll never be happy with my life..and every day I wake up I just find new reasons on why suicide is the best option
