I am on the spectrumI am an aspie and I hate it. I yearn to be normal. I yearn to not be a burden. I yearn to never feel lonely. I yearn to have romantic love. I feel cheated by the wheel of fate. I don't want to live as a monster. But yet everything I am is terrible and change is next to impossible. Can I even love? How can I live when my values of causing no suffering to people and the need of not being alone are at constant struggle. I didn't ask for this. I didn't want it. I may have finally obtained a new romantic relationship but I don't want to tell her yet that I have this terrible curse because the last people I have told ran away from me romantically. Why can't I be normal like all of those people who have gotten relationships. If I could kill a part of myself it would be the aspergers. I fucking hate it. Can we please have a cure? Can we please not be burdened with this? Please?
