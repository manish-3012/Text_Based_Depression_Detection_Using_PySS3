Friend is in a spiral. Help me reach her.Hi. I've been on here quite a bit in the past on other accounts (this one is obviously a throwaway too). I never did follow any of the advice for myself, but just having people to talk to helped me, so, thanks for that.

I'm here today with something a bit different. My friend is just breaking up with her girlfriend and she has a hard time letting go. She grew up in a very abusive household (if you've read the book "A Child Called 'It'", it was almost as bad) and she doesn't really know how to deal with such strong emotions. She's nearly killed herself before during a breakup because she just doesn't know any other way to get through the situation.

I need your help to get through to her. I've held her in my arms while she's cried and confessed her darkest secrets to me, and I've told her that I love her and I'm not going to abandon her like everyone else has. I think it's good while I'm there, but as soon as I leave to give her some privacy, I get worried as hell that she's going to end up almost bleeding out like last time.

Any advice for getting through to her would be appreciated... for what it's worth, she's 24, moderately successful, and stunningly beautiful. Yes, I am falling in love with her, but I don't want that getting in the way of our friendship so I'm leaving it alone.
