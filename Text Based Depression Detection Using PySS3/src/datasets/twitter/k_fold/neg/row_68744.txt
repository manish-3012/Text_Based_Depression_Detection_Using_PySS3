Just waiting to get outI'm in psychiatric hospital after I took an OD. My life fell apart after that. My partner left me, my friends decided they can't cope. It's fair, my madness has taken it's toll on everyone around me. I don't seem to be able to make progress despite medication, in fact really I feel worse than when I tried to originally kill myself.

Today I finished my book of suicide notes with instructions to my solicitor. I have several hours a day where I can leave the hospital on my own, as I'm apparently much better. I want to leave tomorrow and visit some childhood places and then do the act.

Stupid but I'm a bit scared to have chosen a new suicide method (because OD just doesn't work and I keep being saved) and to know that I'll have the Police looking for me. I don't know why I'm scared, I suppose it's the thought of it not working and me ending up in this place for even longer being tortured by my own brain - yes I have tried talking to the staff they just assume hysteria and tell me to go to sleep or do some colouring but that doesn't take the thoughts away.

I've been in psychiatric hospital so many times abd I've hurt and made a mess of so many people's lives. I can't live with myself and I know that I can't stop the insanity so I just have to end things so I don't do any more damage in the world.
