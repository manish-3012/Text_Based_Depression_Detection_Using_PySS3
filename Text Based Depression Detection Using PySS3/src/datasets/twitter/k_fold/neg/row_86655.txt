lost again igtoday I wanted to tell my girlfriend about going to rehab for drug addiction. I physically couldn't say the words so I started talking about a butterfly and said how it was sick and needed to go to the hospital. I think she got it and we started talking about how long the butterfly would be in the hospital. it made me feel loved, that she understood..... and didn't get angry and yell at me for my addiction and not wanting to tell her completely. I feel terrible because I can't help her more.... I know she's lonley and sad and I just feel like I'm not doing everything I can to make her happy. she deserves so much better than me, yet I'm thankful she's stayed around this long. I think I'll always love her for that, for staying when nobody else cared enough too. she's the light in my world, and I'd hate to have her think that she isn't helping me because she is. most of the time I feel like a burden so I try not to talk.
