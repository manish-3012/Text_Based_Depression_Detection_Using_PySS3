How is my life worth more than a bottle of pills?I'm posting here as a last resort. I've never thought about suicide and don't believe in it, but I keep telling myself that I should end it, and realized that at some point you don't have anything else to live for and  suicide seems like the only answer. 

I'm 28. Never had a girlfriend. Never went out. Never kissed anyone. Got drunk for the first time last month. Closest I've ever been to anyone was a girl from Craigslist that I paid $165 for some conversation and a 30 minute back massage. To tell you the truth, I took a few Ativan and had a few beers, to deal with the anxiety, so I don't remember most of the experience. 

Have never had a job for more than 6 months at a time, and have been unemployed 3x longer than have ever worked. I've tried so hard to find a job that I could tolerate. I have social anxiety and am very inarticulate a, so anything that involves a phone isn't doable for me. I have some sort of speech impediment, but never had any sort of help for it. My mind thinks of one word and says another. It happens all the time, and when I start sounding like an idiot I start stuttering and mumbling.

I do have one positive thing happen to me recently though. This past week I helped some friends move, and even though it took 3 days and was really tough to do in the Texas heat, it was one of the greatest times that I've had in the past decade. I paid for just about everything, the truck, food, beer, everything. My friends were very appreciative, and didn't know why I was being like that, although they're the only friends that I have. On the last night of the move, we had some beers and I shared a little of what I said above while tearing up, but I don't think they understood my situation. They thought that I was drunk and needed to let out some steam, but I was pretty sober.

That morning when I went home I went to sleep with my sidearm and took too many pills to count. I didn't expect to not wake up, but I wouldn't mind if I wouldn't. I don't know why I did it. I guess that speaking your mind is supposed to help, although the lack of answers from the people I told just showed me how hopeless my life is. Now I don't have any of my anti-depressant left and I'm going through withdraws. I won't get more. I rather be the unemployed recluse rather than the happy looking unemployed guy who sees how good some people have it.

I have no hope for the future, never have, and I don't want to be anyone. I can't tell you something that I really like or want to be to save my life.

I've been like this for as long as I can remember, and am too tired to go on. I cry myself to sleep just about every night. I've started to cut myself which still makes no sense to me, although seeing the scars gives me some satisfaction. The funny thing is that I can't find a sharp enough razor, so while I don't bleed, I still get the scars, so I guess I'm just scaring myself. 

I wish that I'm making things sound worse than they are. I don't expect anyone to say, ya off yourself, although if someone could tell me why this life is worth living then have at it. Well, maybe one of my numerous CL casual encounters posts can get a reply, so maybe that can be considered to be something to look forward to.
