There is absolutely no other option.I am going to kill myself tonight.  


I am Disabled.  
I am diagnosed with  bipolar, BPD, and PTSD.  
I have IBS and a un- diagnosable chronic health issue.  


I can not apply for disability in my country.  
You have to have a diagnosis, to apply. So no matter how bad my chronic health issues get, I can not apply for disability for that.  


The criteria for mental health includes "Ability to work, use transport, make friends,  plan, and concentrate." which means even though working makes me want to kill myself, I do not get it, because I have friends who are as crazy as I am, and I can catch a train. 

I work three days a week. I get home so tired that I'm unable to eat or even watch TV. Not because of lack of want, but because I honestly don't have the ability to concentrate or feed myself.   


I am unable to afford to support myself on unemployment, and anyway, if I quit my job, I lose ALL benefits I get.  
I am unable to reduce the amount of time I work, as the government believes I do no work enough, and so I have to continue to look for work and go to interviews. If I do not do this, I get all my benefits cut off.   


I have reached out for help time and time and time again. NO ONE HELPS. and saying "you can get through this" IS NOT HELPING. I have tried to get a psychologist. I cant.   i am still waiting 6 months later. I can not afford a private one.   


I can't even afford to take a day off work.  


I'm killing myself tonight.  there is literally nothing that anyone can do. I am writing this in the minute hope that this will draw attention to how much the government is fucking up disabled people's lives.
