Not asking for handouts, can anyone chat on my thread here?Hi, i had one kind Redditor help me get my cell phone activated on Christmas 

I am extremely grateful for one month of phone service.

I need to earn an income but I cant get one.

Some people have non dischargeable debt. I am well aware of what ths terms are. One of them is IRS due to the unemployment I had received in this State, which was extreme low. 

I will owe taxes, so I am starting out with a deficit

I am financially literate

Aside from the debt which has to be paid and cant be discharged, I cant get interviews face to face for any jobs

I am homeless and the shelters are full. They are dirty and they dont allow you to just walk in, with a bag and shower and blow dry your hair. 

They have admission requirements, expectations of case management work and discharge expectations

That didnt work for me. They wanted me with my Masters degree to work min wage at a supermarket.

But my debt has to be subtracted from that. And my car expenses cost money.
There's nothing in there for housing

I was also told I am not permitted to think, use my knowledge or ask questions.

I cant use any of my knowledge at this level of poverty. I am only to speak when spoken to.

I am not allowed to discuss my hygiene or healthcare needs.

If a person is renting a room, I am not allowed to ask questions. If they need me to leave certain times in the day, I must follow their orders. 

I have no autonomy or privacy

How do I mentally function at this level?

Not using my finance knowledge and pretend my debt doesnt exist? Or my need for sleep, hygiene and bathing arent important?

Can anyone show me how you live on $15/hour or less, with an inital wage garnishment, no housing, and no way to shower, dress and appear for an interview?

There is no help on my end. No churches or nonprofits. They told me I have to remain homeless because there are too many others in need.
