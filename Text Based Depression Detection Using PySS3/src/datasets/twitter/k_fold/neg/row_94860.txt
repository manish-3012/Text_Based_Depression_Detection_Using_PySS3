MelatoninI don't think an overdose would kill me, but I don't really want to do anything aside from sleep. If I can't kill myself, at least I could pretend I'm dead. Would anything really bad happen aside from a coma if I took a bottle that has 120 pills, 5mg? 

I took my written driver's test today and fucking failed. I'm 22 and don't know how to drive,. Sure, I've grown up poor, and that might be the problem, but this is just another disappointment in my life. My sadness is affecting the family, and I feel like a huge asshole. I can't do this anymore. There's no point. I keep thinking maybe I'll be okay, that I'll feel better, but I can't. But even if I'm not dead, I just want to stop thinking about it.
