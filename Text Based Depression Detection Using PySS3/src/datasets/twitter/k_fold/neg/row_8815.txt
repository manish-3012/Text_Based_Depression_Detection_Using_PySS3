I've come to my crossroad and unsure what to do.The past year has been difficult, beyond difficult and have been dealing with depressing for a good part of it.

The girl I was seeing has left me, breaking almost all communication. She left her boyfriend and like an idiot went back into her life with hopes that we could once again rekindle whatever it was that we had before. Once again she's seeing someone else and it hurts beyond belief.

My father is suffering from chest pains and stroke like symptoms. He's been to the doctors and waiting for test results to come back.

I've lost nearly all my friends and currently have maybe one or two people that I can actually talk to. They're also my business partners so bringing these problems up may affect how they see me within the businesses we run and own.

I'm also being sued through from my old boss because I left their business to venture out on my own.

I suffer from social anxiety disorder which is making it extremely difficult for me to be intimate with anyone, which causes me a lot of self esteem issues.

This year both my dog (my best friend) and my grandma has passed away.

The pain is constant, I'm finding myself becoming angry and wondering if my life would be better off, not just for me but others if I was no longer around.
