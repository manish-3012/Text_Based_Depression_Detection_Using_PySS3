Whatever, bye.I've tried.

So hard, over these last couple years to be friendly. I've wore a smile on my face in my darkest days. I encouraged others to success. I've tried hard to fight this endless battle in my mind.

Nothing  has brought me happiness. I can't take it anymore. I want to end it all, so badly. I do. I can't. I don't know. My mind runs at a million miles per hour. I want to live a normal life. I want to be friends. Maybe I'm just not meant for this place. I want to go grab a bite to eat with friends. I want to go climb that mountain with my friends today...

They didn't even invite me.

I've tried hard to be friendly. I know I make mistakes. I know I have my faults. But really? Is this world so pointless and dark that I'm meant to be alone. Is that really my destiny?

I think it is.

I've struggled with these thoughts for twelve years. Twelve fucking years I've fought to be better. To be normal, to be the person people wanted and expected of me. But why? It hasn't brought me friends, or the feeling of being loved. 

I'm alone. I'm sad. I'm insane.

Why do I even bother, why should I? What's on the other side? Nothing, great I'll be used to it. But what if there is something? Awesome, maybe I'll be tortured for all enternity because of who I am..

I don't care.
I don't need anyone anymore.
I'll live what I consider is life. 
Whatever, bye.
