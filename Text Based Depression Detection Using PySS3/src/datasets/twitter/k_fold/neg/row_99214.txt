20 year old failure, why shouldn't I end it?I'm 20, still live with my parents, don't work, and don't go to school. I don't really have any motivation to work, and I have social anxiety. Can't afford school and even if I could, I not smart, have no idea what to learn, and still have social anxiety. I have no real interest in doing anything with my life. I should just end it right? I already dislike life and it will only get worse from here. Just want to here some other opinions.
