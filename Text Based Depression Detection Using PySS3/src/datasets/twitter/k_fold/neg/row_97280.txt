Stressed &amp; Depressed i guessschool is so exhausting. my thoughts managed to go away for a while but trying to keep my grades up just made them all fucking come back. i can't really talk to anyone about wanting to die either because I'll probably end up getting sectioned... I don't know I'm just so stressed and I have no idea how to deal with it anymore. it's the 7th week and I don't think I can make it for the the other 29 weeks.
