Why can I help others and not myself?No matter what I do I canâ€™t feel happy and when I do itâ€™s for a moment.
I have a family,a boyfriend and job but yet Iâ€™m so depressed all I think about is the day I die. 
I help anyone I can with their issues and yet I canâ€™t take my own advice. I feel like Iâ€™m alone and yet theirs so many people.
Everything Iv ever done wrong keeps coming back and I realize Iâ€™m stupid and shouldnâ€™t even be alive cause all I do is harm people I love. All I wanna do is cry anymore and I feel selfish and stupid for it. Hell writing this makes me feel like crap cause I know so many people have more problems then me. 
Since I can remember all Iv ever wanted to do was stop people from harming themselves or worse. I help whenever I can and have even gotten my best friend to stop harming for a month...that was amazing for him. But yet I canâ€™t take my own advice. Why is that?
Sorry for the rant...
