Wish I could stop existing just for a moment. [tw]I'm sorry. I just want to pour my heart out right now. Please don't read if you're vulnerable right now.

I wish I could see my counselor sooner but it'll be three weeks until we meet again. 

Flashbacks all day every day. 

I was so stupid. I was just stupid to stay with him. I should've ended things even if it meant I'd die. By suicide. I was suicidal and alone with only him. Sure, I had friends but nobody knew what was going on inside my head but him. I let him abuse me. I let him rape me. I let him coerce me. I let him slap me. I let him assault me. I let him... for five years. My fault. I was stupid. So stupid. Or maybe I'm a liar? Maybe it never happened?

I should've realized it sooner. 

Flashbacks all day every day. 

I should've taken care of the house. Sure... I was a kid. A kid nobody never taught to take care of the house. Nobody taught me to clean. Nobody cleaned. It was a disaster. I slept on the floor. Floor which you couldn't see due to trash, dirty clothes and such. Surrounded by insects. Beetles and larvae. BUT I could've done something. Right?

There's so much more I could've done. I was stupid for whatever. I should've done something. 

Dog shit everywhere. Dog piss everywhere. Nobody took the dog out. The smell. 

I ate plastic and caused the pipes to get clogged. It was my fault I had to take showers standing in shit-water. Pieces of shit floating on the water that was up to my ankles. I remember the smell. It was my fault. 

It was all my fault. We lived in a house too expensive for us. My fault. I shouldn't have cried when mom said we have to move again. 

Even now. I have social anxiety. Depression. Anxiety. Schizotyal disorder. It's my fault too. I shouldn't have social anxiety. I should just... try to endure it. I shouldn't have symptoms. I shouldn't be anxious around people. I just... can't help it. I AM anxious around people. But I guess it's my fault?

I just.. want to stop for a while. I want to black out without all these memories and thoughts.  I want to disappear. I want to hurt myself but I know I can't. I want to throw up. I want to cry. Stop existing. 

I'm stupid and useless. I'm too slow. I'm just awful. I can't do anything right. 

Sorry for venting. I'm just so sad right now.
