How important is a suicide note?I'm not suicidal RN, but my gut tells me that I should write one when the time comes. There's still another part of me that wonders how important that is. 

I don't want my family thinking it's their fault that I wanted to die. But on the other hand, I feel like I shouldn't owe the two people who forced me into existence any sort of explanation for why I did anything. My birth was unfair (for me), and technically my offing myself would undo that error. But I know it comes at an emotional cost, and it is that cost that makes me think twice about any action I might take where my own life is concerned.

Thoughts?
