Sick of this shitI know I can control my own thoughts. I do believe that in the end itâ€™s all up to me, and I try my best to regulate my mental state everyday. I try to think positively and thank god for my mini everyday triumphs. I pray everyday after forgoing the thought of gods existence for years. I beg to a divine power ,something I know much greater than us , to give me guidance, protection and security. But STILL, even on a great day around people who love me- I still wouldnâ€™t mind dying. Why?? Why do I feel like this? Why is my own death nothing to me? I still want to die at the end of the day. I just wouldnâ€™t mind it at all
