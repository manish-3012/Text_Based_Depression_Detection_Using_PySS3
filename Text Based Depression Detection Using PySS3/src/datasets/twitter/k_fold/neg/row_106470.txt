I just don't wanna be here anymoreMy life's always going to be the same, and the meds don't work and the side effects are near unbearable and I've been to the hospital before and it helped minimally but all the symptoms came back and now I feel just as bad as when I had to go in, I just dont know what to do anymore, I can feel me convincing myself that suicides the answer but I just dont have the energy to intervene with the thought processes
