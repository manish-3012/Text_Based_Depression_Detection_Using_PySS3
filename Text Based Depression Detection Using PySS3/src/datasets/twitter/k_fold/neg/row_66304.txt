Just like cancer, there is no cure.I'm normally thag happy go lucky, that people really get on with, but I can't get on with myself. These past few days have been extremely hard. I hate my life, so generic I know. I just can't do this anymore. I needed to post and vent somewhere. My greatest achievement in life was contributing to two wonderful daughters, my biggest disaster is being an absolute zombie to them. I hope someone learns from this.
