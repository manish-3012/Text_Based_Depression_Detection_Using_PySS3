I'm tired of going from "meh" to FABULOUS to, I want to die. Right now, I dropped straight from decent, to I want to die, over the dumbest thing *VENT*I do this quite often and am in therapy and on some meds we are trialing here and there. I wanted a stupid hoodie that was adorable and they didn't have 4x but they had a 5x left (I like them baggy as well as I'm fat and in case they go in the dryer, they're maybe not ruined) Well, they sold out in .05 seconds after I had started to check out and I started internally sobbing (I'm at work) I cut myself a few days ago and my boss knows now so I'm kinda freaked out about that. I just can't handle my emotions, my physical or mental state as a whole and I just wanna end it all. I already know that by tonight or possibly tomorrow, these feelings will lessen or be non existent, yet to pop up again in who knows what length of time. I just wish I was brave enough to end it. I really *really* wish I was. I'M A FAT PIECE OF SHIT, WHO CAN'T LOSE WEIGHT BECAUSE THEY EAT TOO MUCH WHEN STRESSED OUT, OR BORED OR THEY DON'T EAT AT ALL/RESTRICT AND DRINK BOOZE ALMOST DAILY IF NOT, IN EXCESS. I.WANT.TO.DIE.
