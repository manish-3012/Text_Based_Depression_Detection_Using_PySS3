God's planEverything happens for a reason. Everything, good or bad, is part of God's plan.

I want to kill myself. By this logic this means God wants me to kill myself. God hates me and he doesn't want me to exist, otherwise I wouldn't want to kill myself so badly. 

God wanted the Holocaust and 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina to happen. God wants babies to be raped and tortured. God wants suffering and sickness and horror. 

God is evil. Or maybe I'm evil and God wants to save the world from me the only way he knows how. 

Maybe the world will suddenly fix itself once I stop poisoning it.
