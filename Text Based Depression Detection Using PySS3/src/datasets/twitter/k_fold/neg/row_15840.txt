Wish I was never bornI'm 15 years old. Ever since I was born I was whiny,arrogant and annoying. Because of me my family and now my only friend live a lie. I never really had any positive things about myself. The positive things I done are rare. 
Besides being whiny and narcissistic, I also commonly lied(and still lie,I guess). I also had and still have victim complex. I dont like criticism against me. I have short temper. I hurt my sibling so much. 
My friendships were unhealthy because of me. I've never had any relationships.
Even though I may seem remorseful I'm actually not. At all. Dont get me wrong I wish I wasnt a terrible person and all these terrible things Ive done never happened. I just have low empathy I guess. I know thing I did are wrong, the guilt feeling is just not there.
Even if I go to pyschotherapy and some sort of thing and become a "good" person, these things will stay with me rest of my life forever. And people on internet say people without low empathy or people with mental disorders that caise them to be bad people cannot be cured. I potentially have one of those. And theyre rigjt I guess.
There is no point of me to live. I want to die. I wish someone would come from back shot me in head. I dont even know how to suicide.
I feel bad about my family. Theyre wasted their 15 fucking years. 15. Years. For nothing. I hope Ive somewhat manage to kill myself and leave a suicide note telling terrible things Ive done. so they can see the truth. They dont knoe the things Ive done to my friends, sibling. They still think either Im good or that I not that bad. I just want them to see the truth.
