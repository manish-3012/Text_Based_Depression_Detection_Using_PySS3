Fuck it.  I just want this to end. I don't think many will read this but I just have to vent.  I'm so fucking sick and tired of my life...myself, everything around me.  My life has been a series of accidents, starting with my birth, and constant mistakes and bullshit.  

I moved to a new city about 3 years ago very optimistic about my life...I was going to work at a new division in our company, on something i was very excited about, surrounded by my closest friends that happened to live there.  It all seemed great on paper.  I bought a home there even.  

fastforward to Summer 2010, and I'm almost homeless...the division shut down 10 months after I'd moved there and no prospects to go back because I had this fucking house I purchased tying me down.  I had to file bankruptcy.  I lost everything.  I went from a job where I was paid reasonably well, was treated with a level of respect to going from shitty job to shitty job, performing poorly and losing more and more confidence in my ability to do my work.  I FINALLY get moved to another division at the previous employer in another city...abandoned the house, filed bankruptcy and now my current employer is unhappy with my performance.  I've been there about 7 months now...things keep changing so much from day to day and I just can't keep up.  I "can't handle the job" so my manager says.  My team has been going behind my back and telling him I'm not performing to their expectations.  He's frustrated with me.  I personally don't enjoy the work I'm doing now....it isn't what I was told it would be.  I"m fucking miserable.  I haven't dated in years...I have never been in a real long term meaningful relationship...my family has abandoned me.  What's the fucking point?  I'm rapidly approaching 40...I wasted my college degree to pursue an industry that is causing me nothing but pain and heartache, and I have no direction.

I'm fucking lonely, terrified I'm going to lose my job (this wouldn't be the first time I was either laid off or fired...this has happened about 9 times in my "career" now).  I'm a fucking loser and a failure.  I've tried SO FUCKING HARD to fit in, to make things work, to prove myself.  I'm exhausted and angry and frustrated with these fucking companies, the politics, my anxiety disorder issues, and my persistent depression.  

I dread getting up in the morning.  I don't even look forward to the weekends because I know it's just a brief stop till we go right back into the hell that is the weekday.  I don't want to be around anyone...I don't work out anymore (I used to go 5x a week).  I'm gaining weight, and have nothing to offer anyone.  I mean, seriously, who would really be interested in someone like me?  FUCKING. LOSER.  

I fantasize about throwing myself in front of the train every day I leave from work.  Or fantasize about hanging myself in my apartment...even taught myself how to make a proper noose.  I fantasize about downing the entire bottle of clonapin that's SUPPOSED to help me through these periods but does not anymore and drifting off. 

People would be upset, yes.  But people would move on.  It wouldnt have an adverse impact on anyone's life...not really.  At most it would be an inconvenience and a "sad thing" but what's the point of all this bullshit when all I feel is pain in my heart every single day.  I can't even cry anymore.  I just hate myself so fucking much I want to hurt myself like I did when I was younger....punching mself in the face so hard I can see stars...or banging my head as hard as I could against a concrete wall...or taking my finger nails and dragging them down my face.  WHY THE FUCK did my parents conceive me???  This wasn't MY choice, so why do I have to finish this life out, knowing for a fact there's nothing else beyond this.  It's better to die than face the fucking rat race every single goddamn day.

Suicide worked for my uncle...and my cousin...and my aunt.  When they killed themselves, I felt nothing, except maybe envy that they took the logical way out.  I am nothing on this earth.  I am nothing to anyone.  I'm nothing but a creature that consumes and shits and sleeps and works in a cubicle all day till I go crazy.  And I think I'm finally there.  

tl;dr: fuck this, I want out.
