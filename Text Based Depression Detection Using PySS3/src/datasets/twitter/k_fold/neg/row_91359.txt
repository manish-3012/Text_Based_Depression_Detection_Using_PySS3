Feel like it's my time.I'm terrified of doing it, but I really don't see a future for myself at all. I am a failure at every single thing I do. I hate myself in every single way.
I lost my mom a couple years ago to suicide, and everyone is okay without her. I'm not. I have never been the same. 
I don't see a way out other than this. It needs to be done, but I don't know how.
