A few days away from doing it.Feeling anxious about doing it, I hope I planned it out well enough. 

Not really doing the things I wanted before I died, just staying in bed.

I hope tomorrow I can finish up a few things. Sense of calm knowing itâ€™ll finally be over, hope itâ€™ll go alright. Iâ€™m tired.
