I think Iâ€™m gonna do it soonI donâ€™t know for sure yet if I want to. Iâ€™m gonna take a walk around town to see if I do and probably talk to some people before I make any permanent decisions. Kinda sucks though because itâ€™s literally Christmas tomorrow, and I really thought Iâ€™d be able to make it through the holidays and I had something going on with friends on Saturday but Idk how much more of This daily grind I can endure just to get a tiny ounce of satisfaction that only comes a couple times each month
