Tommorow I'm gonna try hanging myself.I've came so close. The last time I tried was on Saturday and my boyfriend took half an hour talking me down on the phone from the top of the multistorey carpark. Then I went to A &amp; E that's made everything worse.  
My voices won't stop and I'm so fucking miserable.  
I don't want saving, if I don't do it tommorow I'm going back to the carpark on Saturday. Fuck this.
