depression is no fun.I'm thinking I might be bipolar because these suicidal thoughts keep coming. My dad died when I was young, i've had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis since i was 3 and its just getting worse. I feel like I have no real support in my life, at least not the kind i need as my family no longer speaks to me. I'm addicted to drugs, mainly painkillers and alcohol - which is usually just to get me through work. With only a GED and job experience only in food service i'm stuck doing manual labor which is getting harder with my deteriorating physical condition. People at work dont see the joint pain (mostly hips) and i look young for my age so it adds this misunderstanding of me being apathetic or lazy. I feel like i cant tell my employers about this condition due to the risk of being fired/replaced. I've never had a real relationship, and i dont even see how its possible. I do drugs to get through work and then pick up the pieces when i get home.

I've been clean in the past for extended periods of time and it never seemed any better. Hip adhesions make sex painful and unenjoyable. I'm uneducated and have lost all motivation to better myself. I try to explain this but it seems like when i open up about this girls just smile and say they dont mind.. but seriously. I dont think a relationship would even make me happy. The fact that i'm 23 and feel like an 80 year old man by the end of the day is terrifying especially considering the lack of education which pigeon holes me into labor intensive jobs that exacerbate this. I can't remember the last time i've been truly happy, and as my health fades how can i hope for things to get better? I want to learn to be less self centered . the painkillers just kicked in 30mins ago so I guess this post doesnt sound too depressed, but i still feel like ending it.
