PlansIâ€™m tired everyday. Iâ€™m so tired, I hiccup and cry every time I remember how I wasnâ€™t good enough and Iâ€™m sick of being reminded that Ill never be. What was so wrong with me? I think Iâ€™m deformed, like I donâ€™t really look like a girl and like I was born wrong and this sad ending to my sad life was destined. Iâ€™m tired, Iâ€™m not fighting it anymore, every time I try to get back up something hits me in my stomach, like Iâ€™m not supposed to get up. Iâ€™m so fucking tired, I donâ€™t want this pain anymore, it just hurts so much and so often, I hate it so much. Iâ€™ve got no support and I have trouble opening up, when I do and Iâ€™m shot down I just feel so much worse. and my mom knows Iâ€™m sad and tried to covertly guilt me into not ever killing myself saying things like â€œthis one womanâ€™s daughter killer herself so she committed suicideâ€ like lmao I do not care, youâ€™re part of the reason why Iâ€™m miserable and that I got this way. Not that Iâ€™d ever say that to her. Even if my mom doesnâ€™t help me, I would never ever want her to blame herself. Ever. But she guilts me, not even knowing that Iâ€™ve already got plans laid out to commit. Itâ€™s like she can tell. I see no hope everyday and Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m so tired of looking into this abyss and pretending itâ€™ll get better because it continues to fucking get worse. I know Iâ€™m doing it with an OD and my wrists at the same time. Somewhere quite at night under the stars. Im just not sure when, or where to get what I need, but I know I can. Im not sure why I post here, Itâ€™s not really for response, I just, vent.
