The one thing that made me happyThe one thing that made me happy and calm is being taken away from me. I feel helpless, angry and really really depressed. I feel my depression will get worse if I don't continue this activity. It was really good for me, it was constructive and allowed me to get out of a bad mental state. I hate this, I don't know what to do. It may seem really small but it's breaking me. This was how I coped, life is just fucking unfair.
