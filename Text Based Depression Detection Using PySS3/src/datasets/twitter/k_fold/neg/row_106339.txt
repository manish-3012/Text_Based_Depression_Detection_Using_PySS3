I Fucking Failed Again.I don't know what I'm going to do. 
I made a promise to someone I was talking to online, that we would talk before I try suicide again. 

I broke that promise, and failed to actually die *again*. This is the second, technically third time I've failed at ending my life. 
I have such little conscious control over my own life. I naturally ruin everything for me myself, but I can't change anything when I want to. 
I feel like a completely fucking loser. I can't even control when I die. 

I'm thinking of just stabbing a paper clip into every power outlet near me. I'm so tired of being a completely failure.
