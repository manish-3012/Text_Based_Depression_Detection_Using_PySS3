I dont want to live anymoreI've fucked everyone off. No one is here to love me and i want love but i can't accept it when i get it The only love i get is from opiates and drugs. I'm a fucking mess and death is close I'm on the edge and nothing is stopping me from falling. I'm ready now, I'll be with you peep. I don't know where my life can possibly go from here now I've not experienced much of it but it already feels like it's come to an end. I don't know how to feel and you know how that feels?
