Ayy lmaoWelp I've reached this point in life of my 17 years of living. I'm more than likely not going to graduate high school because I'm just a fucking idiot so that's a thing and I don't even know what to do when that happens, I'll have no source of a decent income without at least a high school diploma. With no money or happiness what's the point of living? I mean I thought of plans of trying to do things I've wanted to do in life to give myself some form of purpose, one being me trying to make it as comic writer and hope to make a living off of that. But that comes with the whole issue of trying to get people to like the shit but that's a whole different discussion. Suicides obviously come across my mind when the chance of me having no life after I fail high school is pretty high, there'd be no point.

Suggestions and thoughts
