I want happiness in my life and somebody to talk to.I am a guy 18 summers old and live in Sweden. My english is pretty absurd and I am very sorry about that. Throughout my life I have moved to alot of different places in Sweden. Mostly because of my parents need to find better jobs and make my brothers and my life easier. Everytime I have moved to a new place I have ofcourse started in new schools and got to meet new people and made good friends with some of them. 
These friends of mine are long gone because of me moving to different places over and over again. This was between me being 6 years old to 16 years old. I have during these past 2 years been in my single room apartment alone. I have been severly depressed for 6 years because of my thoughts. I have had to start over again and again with new friends, new schools and new things. I have lost motivation to go out and meet new people. I have lost the ability to be happy over several things that once made me who I am. I have isolated myself from the world for a very long time and have had issues with my suicide thoughts. I am on medication but that does not solve this. 

I am very ashamed of myself and would want to spend some days happy for once. I felt the need to post here because I do nothing productive during my days.
