my gf is having suicidal thoughtsHello Iâ€™m a boyfriend of an amazing girl, Iâ€™ve known her for years sheâ€™s 20 Iâ€™m 19. Weâ€™ve been dating nearly 4 years, 2 years long distance (on and off) and 2 years together. 
Within the first 2 years Iâ€™d remember her being on the phone expressing how she wants to get away from home, wants to see me be with me etc. later along the lines I found out her parents are controlling. I used to be such a tool towards her I cheated before, fucked off, made promises Iâ€™ve broke and came to the realization I really love her. During the time of separation I found out recently sheâ€™d barely eat while we werenâ€™t on good terms.. This morning is what brought me here, last night was lit we had Hennessy did the do and we began talking roughly 1am leading up to nearly 4am probably due to me. This week sheâ€™s been hostile, with arguing one moment not the next which is why I think last night was a sense of opportunity to express herself more than ever. She mentioned to me that earlier in the week after a disagreement she thought of cutting, I knew nothing of this until told today but I was there with her. Wtf I cried with her as she was telling me this I stated theirs more options and continued trying to get to the underlying problem. I really care for her and she knows I do she said she said if I didnâ€™t care no one will and sheâ€™ll serve no purpose sheâ€™d wanna die. Sheâ€™s clearly unhappy but itâ€™s not with me itâ€™s situational Iâ€™m guessing? I always try to keep her busy and satisfied as Iâ€™d hate to see her down. We have so much memories together for it to go to waste, lose her and what we grew to be together would be devastating. Iâ€™m not sure if her are family or friends are aware of thoughts like these and if not Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™d be able to tell without provoking my girl. The last thing I wanna do is make her unhappy and telling a relative to have an open eye/mind for her would probably be smart. Her brother and aunt are fairly closer to me than her parents but Iâ€™m not sure how to approach them with such info if I should. Itâ€™s 7am I havenâ€™t slept sheâ€™s here beside me sleep when I come to a conclusion itâ€™ll be known to her for sure.
