hiDeath has been more intriguing lately. I have anxiety problems and God if I could have a day or two where I could let it all go because I knew it was the end, maybe that would be enough.. No thinking about school or people or where I have to be and who I have to be around.. nothing would matter and there wouldn't be consequences because I would be gone before they arrived
