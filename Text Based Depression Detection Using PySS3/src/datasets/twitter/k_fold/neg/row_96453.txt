Iâ€™m afraid to die, but Iâ€™m afraid to live tooThe pain is too great. The self loathing is too much. I canâ€™t bear it. All Iâ€™m thinking about right now is walking in front of a train. It would be so easy. Thereâ€™s a track thatâ€™s practically in my back yard.

But part of me wants to stay. Thereâ€™s stuff I still wanna do. But....

Iâ€™m broken and I canâ€™t be fixed. All I do is make low effort shitposts every day. Iâ€™m trash. I donâ€™t deserve the life Iâ€™ve been given.
