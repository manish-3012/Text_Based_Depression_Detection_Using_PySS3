Anyone know how to get cyanide pills?All I can think about lately is suiside, everyone in my life hates me. I overheard my family talking about how much they can't wait to get rid of me. My brother with anger issues has tried to kill me over and over again, yet he's still their favorite. I have no window because he threw a rock threw it. Then proceeded to try to bash my head in with the same rock. I want to tell the police but my family said they'd kick me onto the streets if I did. 

If I end up on the streets I'd be stuck, I have no money for an appartmeant. And my parents take all my money because "I owe it to them for feeding me though out my childhood." I have no car to sleep in. I have no friends to take me in either. 

I feel like the only escape is suiside. Apperently cyanide is painless, and extremely effective. It seems like an easier way out them living like this.
