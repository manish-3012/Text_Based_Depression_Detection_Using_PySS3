End of the RoadThis isn't going to be super long, I've been contemplating for years.  As of now, I've come to terms with it; and I think tonight is the night.  I've told my friends I love them, and that they should always take care of themselves; but that's who I usually am, so it doesn't come as a surprise to them which is fine, easier that way.    


I would go on to post why, but who really cares?  I've spent my entire life trying to get along with other people, do understand and be appreciated as much as I appreciate others; and it never seems to be a thing I can grasp.  Too many words over too many years, and they've lost all meaning.    


I just wanted to vent to somebody, to let SOMEONE know that tonight I'm going to end it.  It's a small bit of solace in a place where I feel nothing but suffering.    


I hope the person that comes after me can be stronger, because I'm breaking.
