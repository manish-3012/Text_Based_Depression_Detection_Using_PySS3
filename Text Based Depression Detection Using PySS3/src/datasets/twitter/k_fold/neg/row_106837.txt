I feel worse after my boyfriend broke up with meI know this whole thing may sound stupid because it's just me having suicidal thoughts after my boyfriend broke up with me blah blah blah. 
to start off, I've had depression for almost 4 years now and on and off suicidal thoughts for about the same time. I've tried to commit suicide about 5 times and went to the hospital twice. a few months ago I found a guy that was so nice and caring I always thought we would be together for a long time. I've never had such strong feeling for someone,ever. I know he loved me and sure did love him right back. I found out that he was thinking about breaking up with me for a while before he did. he said it was because I lied too much, got upset a lot around him,I blame him too much for things, and that the arguments that we had were all caused by me. he also said that I could find someone better when really he was the best person I have found. I never meant to hurt him, I guess I didn't even realize that I was lying. and when I got upset around him, it was really me dealing with other things mentally and he doesn't seem to believe that's the case. but I swear it is. I care about him so much. I drew a portrait of him, made him a bracelet, wrote him letters. basically I did all that I could to keep him.
from this I feel like I was the worst girl friend to him. I tried so hard but it didn't work. I couldn't keep the one that I love dearly. ):
