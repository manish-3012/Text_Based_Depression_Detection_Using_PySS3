It gets better. And it also doesn't.It's been about a year since I was at my lowest point. I tried a few desperate things then, knowing somewhere deep down they wouldn't really be enough to kill me. Even though I didn't believe in God, I prayed it would work, and it could all be over. Some people realized that I needed help, and got me to see a therapist. And she's really great! I love her. In some ways I feel like she's helped, and in some ways I still feel like the girl with a bag over her head... I feel more joy in the daily things in life than I did a year ago. But I still don't feel happy. It's silly, but I don't think I'll ever feel as happy as I did before everything happened. I don't think I'll ever smile as big or love as deeply and freely and truly. I don't feel as powerful or creative or inspired. I feel like I'm just trying not to kill myself... For the hope that maybe I can feel better? I don't really know why I'm still alive. I still go to sleep every night hoping I won't wake up in the morning. I stopped wearing my seatbelt months ago in hopes that I'll die in a car accident. 

I guess I just want to know if you ever really recover from stuff like this? Or is it like a traumatic brain injury or a loss of a limb, and you just have to make do with the new you? Thanks for reading.
