I finally bought the ropeEvery time I finally grew a pair and I'd finally hang myself, there was this extra step of going to Walmart and getting a rope first.  And usually that extra step generated enough time where someone would stop me.  Someone would show they care enough to stop me.

Last night that didn't happen.  So when I reach down and sack up again, I can skip that step and hopefully I'll die before anyone tries to stop me.
