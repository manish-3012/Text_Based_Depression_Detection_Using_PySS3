Yet another "I don't want help"I'm done.

I've recently lost the only thing that ever made me feel, that gave me a purpose and a reason to live for. This is not just yet another heartbroken guy. My whole life, I've never truly enjoyed anything, I was only just here, spectating myself in auto pilot. I never cared about anyone else enough to feel if anything happened. In the last couple of years, I've been getting help from psychologists and psychiatrists, been reading self help books, taking 4 different antidepressants and talking with friends and family. Nothing changes. My life is between pain and not feeling anything. The only joy I had is gone and I'll never have it again, because my trust is broken. I'm fucking tired of people trying to help and saying that time will heal, that I'll forget. This is even worse, because if I'm not supposed to feel anything about the past, and I can't feel anything now, then what's the point? I'm only here for the sake of those that care about me, so now I'm disconnecting from them. They will soon forget about me, and then I'm finally free to leave this "life". 

Like I said, this is not a cry for help, I only want to know the best way to end my life. I'm too smart to do anything stupid, and eventually end up stuck here in a state that I can't do anything about. I understand that you can't encourage suicide and all that shit, but it's my life and my decision in the end, so spare me the talk about rules and society. If I can't get help here, I'll keep looking until I find. Email me at strofakol@mailinator.com
