I failed to kill myself, should i go to the hospital ?I tried hanging myself tonight.. Thought i was a goner for sure, but i woke up on the floor.   
My neck and eyes are red and hurts from all the popped blood vessels..  
I tried finishing the job but it hurts too much now..   
The first time was painless but now it gives me a killer headache.   
I'm dizzy too.. Thinking i can maybe sleep this off.
