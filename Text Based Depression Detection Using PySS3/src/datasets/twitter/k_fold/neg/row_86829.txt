i have to repeat globabl history &amp; i wanna die loli WANTED to go to summer school but the people there said i was too "mentally unstable" (had a depressive episode for most of the school year) and then REFUSED to let me and now apparently i have to repeat the class. i know this isnt something serious but i'm really contemplating on commiting right now /: it just feels unfair. i'm sick of being depressed and fucking stuff up
