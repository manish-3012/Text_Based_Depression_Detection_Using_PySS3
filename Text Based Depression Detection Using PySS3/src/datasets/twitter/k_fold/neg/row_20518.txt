Why can't I just want to die, I just want my will to live to completely disappearGod I've just been working so hard these past months really fucking trying for the first time in my life and all I have to show for it is shit. If I just slip up just once, all my hard work goes to shit. As soon as I just lose motivation just fucking once everything I've worked for goes to shit. I really can't fucking do this anymore. And I know as soon as I join the 'real world' things will get even harder. So what is the point of going on when things are never going to get better.


Fuck I just wish that I can truly truly wish to die. Because the only thing stopping me from killing myself is myself and that is just so fucking pathetic. I can't even get being suicidal right. I'm a fucking failure at fucking killing myself how pathetic is that. What am I even afraid of.. I just wish I can hate myself to the point where I can grow some balls and shoot myself in the head

I hate myself why can't I just let myself die
