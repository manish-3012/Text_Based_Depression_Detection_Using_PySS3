5am and thinking about an endless sleep.So I've got a meeting with my boss today.  I've decided that if I get fired I'm going to off myself.

I'm 28 and a failure in every metric I can think of.
I'm poor, stupid, fat, lonely, ugly, 
Worthless, annoying, obstinent, desperate, hopeless and insignificant.

I kinda hope I get fired.  Maybe it'll give me some courage.
