I did it to myselfI did it to myself, I've cheated on my wife multiple times, when she was pregnant even, because I didn't think I was getting the attention I deserved. I left the army to move home and work a dead end job where I make 1/3 the money I used to. I really don't have anybody that cares about me anymore. If it wasn't for my 17 month old son I would have ended my life before he was born. He is the only thing that keeps me going, I don't want him growing up wondering why his dad didn't want to be with him. I'm so afraid of the day that I can't take it anymore and pull the trigger. I need help but have nobody to talk to.
