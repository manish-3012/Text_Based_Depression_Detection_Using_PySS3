Why do I have these thoughts?I have a great life, but I still have suicidal thoughts. I once held a gun to my head, one pull of the trigger away from death. I couldn't, obviously. I just want to know, why? Why am I like this? People have it much, much worse than me, I feel ungrateful for this wonderful life I have.
