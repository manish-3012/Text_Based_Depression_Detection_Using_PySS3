It all seems uslessI can't stay here any longer. I hate these people. This world. It all just hurts. They don't know that I'm contemplating suicide again. God I fucking hate my family. Their heartless. They don't care about me. Just gawk when I break down. They say the more I grow up the younger I act. I just want to disappear. Or be with my best friend. She makes everything better. To be honest she's the only thing I'm living for lately. And now that my mom has taken my phone  (For not wanting to be around her and trying to tell her how I felt "This family makes my life hell") I have no contact to her. No way to talk to her. I need her. So fucking bad. I don't know how much longer I can live without her. I just. Want to. Go. Home.
