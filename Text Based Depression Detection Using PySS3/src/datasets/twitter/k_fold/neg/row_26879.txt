I just donâ€™t want to keep goingI canâ€™t be the kind of mom I want to be. Nor the kind of friend, wife, daughter, employee. Right now, I should be sleeping so that I can serve as my sisterâ€™s doula. But instead, Iâ€™m awake and ruminating because my husband and I had a spat after I came home. 

And Iâ€™m overwhelmed and grappling with suicidal ideation. I canâ€™t get my daughter to keep her room clean, or respond to me without serious attitude. Sheâ€™s already acting like a snotty teen and she isnâ€™t out of single digits yet. I always get stuck playing the bad guy role, because my husband has lousy follow through. My husbandâ€™s parents are another bone of contention, namely in how they ignore our daughter but insist on doting on every other grandchild. And my daughter is starting to see the differences and struggle with them.

I canâ€™t get control other people. But thereâ€™s so much sadness in knowing I donâ€™t have a partner who will protect me and I donâ€™t have good enough parenting skills to nurture my daughter. I donut want to live to see my fuck-ups.
