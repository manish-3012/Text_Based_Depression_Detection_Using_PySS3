Imagine Living To 80I have this weird feeling that Iâ€™ll always be suicidal but never do anything about it ; and Iâ€™ll be depressed till Iâ€™m a old man. Just imagine life getting sadder and despair increasing for another 60+ years WTF did I do to deserve this; I hope I have the courage to swallow as many pills as I can next year
