Its All Over NowI'm sorry, but I just can't keep going. My life is a dumpster fire, and I'm not good enough to handle it. I love you all, Reddit has been good to me. Thanks for everything guys. If I do die tonight, I just wanted you all to know that I truly appreciated you; you were here for me when no one else was.
