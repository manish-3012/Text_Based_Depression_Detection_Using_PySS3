Weird turn in life have really got me thinkingI'm a male in my early thirties with a good job, lots of friends and a loving family with great connection to uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins and parents. I have always been a happy person, and compared to a few posts I have read here, I'm blessed in that I don't feel depressed and I never really have.

But I got some health complications 2 years ago, and without going to much into details, I can no longer have sex. I first thought this would be temporary, but after 5 different doctors, 2 surgeries and enough time to heal properly, I feel like I just have to accept that I can not have sex for the rest of my life.

Now, this might seem shallow to say that I don't want to live without sex, but it's the things that comes with that. Without sex, I find it hard to see a way that I can find a relationship. And without a relationship, I don't know how I will ever have kids and a family of my own. It has kept my up a lot of nights in the last few weeks. What is the point now? I'm going to wake up and I'll be 50 and alone, and all my friends and family will have kids of their own. I just don't see the purpose, and it's eating my up inside. Nobody knows about my health complications nor how my mental health has started deteriorating the last couple of weeks. I'm thinking about getting into an accident on purpose, or drowning, so it doesn't look like a suicide.
