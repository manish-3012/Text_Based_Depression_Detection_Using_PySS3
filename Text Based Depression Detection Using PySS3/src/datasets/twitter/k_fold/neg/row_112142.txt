I'm still alive...sadlyI have nothing and no one, even if i try to find a reason to live, i just can't. Everyday is just a worse version of the previous one... I can clearly see, how my depression grows... I'm tired of living, but I'm too scared to end it all, I'm in so much pain rn, idk what to do...
