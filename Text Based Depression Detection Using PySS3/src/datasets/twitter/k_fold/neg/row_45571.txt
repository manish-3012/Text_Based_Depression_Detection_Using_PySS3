Yeah, it's just hard huhIn theory, a night in the city with friends should be awesome. AirBNB near the beach, friends drinking and all that stuff, you would think it would be a Fucking blast... But it just feels kinda empty. I feel empty.. 
Friends and family my ages are in happy relationships and getting married and moving in together, and I struggle to feel anything.. It's just kind of at that point where I am finding it harder and harder to continue you know? 
It's even a more common thing for me to avoid eye contact nowadays, and I'm feeling like the walls are closing in and Gah.. I just want to say sorry to everyone.. You reading this, I'm sorry for wasting your time. I'm sorry that I am not stronger than this, and I'm sorry that I don't have the strength to keep being Fucking chipper and cheery when it's the trait that  I am known for.. 
I'm sorry.
