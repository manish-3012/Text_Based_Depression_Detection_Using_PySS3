Depressive Quarantine with toxic familylong post 

This my first post here and I've been seeking answers , because I have encountering problems and the only solution I have is stabbing myself Infront of my family...my mom especially.

I am 21 years old, a college graduate I was supposed to move out and find a job (aviation) but I lost the opportunity because of the pandemic and I'm stuck with a toxic household.

Its been 5  months and my depression just keeps going and going and going , my mom just making it worst. She  blames me of everything , I get compared, she would shame me or compare me to her visitors son/daughter even in social media.


My mom is a Christian , and she throws me words like depression is just a word for those who are weak and doesn't pray enough, treating as if its nothing. 

There's never a single day  that I didn't cry , and not a single day that we didn't argue.
Every arguement we have , My eyes just darken , i feel numb , The urge to stab myself and prove it to her eyes  that im not acting and show her that's shes wrong. I want her to open her once just once and listen to his son, who's suffering. Stab myself Infront of her eyes, because im done.

I made attempts, I slammed my head on a mirror , used blade to cut myself and  slammed my head to a  concrete wall but im not contented , its never enough. I JUST WANTED TO END THINGS FOR HER TO SEE ,I WANT HER TO SEE ME SUFFERING NOT A JOKE
 I DON'T WANT TO DO IT MYSELF. I WANT HER TO OPEN HER EYES, FOR HER TO WITNESS.
What she preach in church , stays in church and to other people ,but not me.
