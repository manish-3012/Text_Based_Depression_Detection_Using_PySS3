I don't know what to do anymore.I've been having thoughts of suicide ever since I've left high school and entered college. I can't really tell anyone around me about them because that'll only distance themselves from me.  I want help but I have no way of getting it.

I've squandered all opportunities to better myself.  I've given in to laziness time and time again.  I tell myself that I'd stop being such a lazy fuck, but I always get hit with a big, "Why?"  I have no goals or ambitions so what am I working hard for?  Even if I had a goal, I honestly don't think it's possible for me to me be happy with how everything is right now.  I know I'd hurt a lot of people if I tried to kill myself.  I'm scared that I'm starting to care less and less about that. I don't think it's fair that they call this selfish.  I don't like being here but being reminded that it'd hurt someone else stops me from doing so. 

I don't really know what I'm doing anymore.
