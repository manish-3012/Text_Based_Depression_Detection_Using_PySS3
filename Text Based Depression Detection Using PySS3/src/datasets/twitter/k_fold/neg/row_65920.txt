Need some helpI know I won't commit suicide, I know I can resist and I will, but I do wish I had someone to talk to, to make it easier to fight it.

I'm lucky enough to have friends and family, but I don't want to drag them down with this, they have their own lives and worries. 

I have a chronic illness, I live in pain, I can't work, had to give up on studying too, society hates me and makes sure to remind me everyday. I know I should get used to it, since it's just the way things are and I can't do anything about this, but it still sucks. 

I'm on medications for the depression, but it seems it isn't enough, I tried therapy multiple times but had no success, or rather it made it worse, and I don't have that much money in the first place so I won't try to find a new therapist.

I know very well that seeking help on the internet won't make the suicidal thoughts go away but it might help at least pass the night.
