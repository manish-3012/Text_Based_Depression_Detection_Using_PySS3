Plan1. Get back home from holidays. 
2. Say goodbye to my 2 bff (leave them letters cause we live in separate countries)
3. Get 60 50mg of dph.
4. Wait for so to leave to uni.
5. Get into shower and bleed out while on sleeping pills.

Iâ€™ve visited my family in the US, iâ€™ve visited my so family in eastern europe. I feel like these are my goodbyes to the fams. 

Iâ€™m tired and in pain, and the impending void calls out my name every day at every time.

Will be posting my plan with more detail later, for tonight Iâ€™ll just take more dph and hopefully pass outðŸŒº. The void is calling my name and i need to follow it. Hallucinations, dissociation, anxiety, depression, bpd, ptsd, ocd ... how many more labels do they want to throw at me before helping?
