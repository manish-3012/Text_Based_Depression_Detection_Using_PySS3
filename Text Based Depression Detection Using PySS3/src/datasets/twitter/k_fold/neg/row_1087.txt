This loneliness...This loneliness is just so bad, like I said in a post before why should I feel this way? Well it's getting worse, I want this pain to stop and maybe... maybe doing this might end this pain. I feel so unimportant and useless and this loneliness is making me shake so much. I don't know what to do...
