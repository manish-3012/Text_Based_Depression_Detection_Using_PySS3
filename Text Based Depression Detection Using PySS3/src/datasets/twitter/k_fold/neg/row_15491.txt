I think tonight might be the night.I went to rehab a month or two ago for my drinking. Tonight I got wasted. I took a bunch of muscle relaxers (baclofen). Almost the whole bottle. 

If I die I just want this to be here so I can tell everyone that I love them. This wasn't because of anyone. The anti-depressants didn't work. I hate my life. I'll never be happy. 

I'm sorry.
