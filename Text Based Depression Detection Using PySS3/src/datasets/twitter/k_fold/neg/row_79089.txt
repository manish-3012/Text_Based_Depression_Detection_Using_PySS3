The thoughts are really bad.Iâ€™m having really really bad thoughts of suicide. Have a plan and all that, and my dad keeps telling me how lazy I am and how I never do anything, and he wonâ€™t stop yelling and making sure I know that Iâ€™m a horrible person. Heâ€™s telling me to do chores and as Iâ€™m doing one chore heâ€™ll tell me to do two more and if I donâ€™t manage to do all them he yells at me and along with these thoughts of suicide itâ€™s super stressful. I already cut this morning and did it again in the bathroom before I started typing this. Iâ€™m having a panic attack and I feel like my heart is going to explode. I canâ€™t stop crying and if my dad sees heâ€™s going to make fun of me, or think Iâ€™m begging for attention. I want to run away from this dumb family. I want to leave. Iâ€™m tired of being here. I donâ€™t want to be alive.
