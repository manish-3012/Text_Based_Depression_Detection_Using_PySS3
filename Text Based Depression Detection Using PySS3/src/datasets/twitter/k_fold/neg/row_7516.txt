My existence is problematicI am a piece of human garbage.
Everything I do is selfish, I make the most stupid decisions and I am easily manipulated.
The world would be much better off without me because everyone that I have ever been associated with has suffered. I can't take it anymore.
It's not even like my life is bad. I'm heavily privileged, but nothing makes me happy, I just spiral further and further into nothingness. I'm not okay with who I am, I have never been and most likely never will. I'm sensitive and attention seeking, you can tell because I'm writing this. If i didn't ache for attention I would just keep this myself.
I ruin everyone's lives. Everyone I know that was a genuinely amazing human when I first met them has become a shadow of their former self.
I do;t see a way out of this.
Has anyone else been in this position?
