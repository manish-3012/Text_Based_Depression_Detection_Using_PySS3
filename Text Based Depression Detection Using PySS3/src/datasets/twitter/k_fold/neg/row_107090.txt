What if you just don't like living?I hate when people say "All of the things in your life are fixable" because I don't want to die due to personal problems.


I hate when people say "Well, find a job you love" because I hate the concept of having to work. There is nothing that I'm passionate about that I want to turn it into a full time job, and even if there was I don't want my passions to turn into yet another means of making money. Maybe if you have a college degree you have more options as to what you're able to achieve, but what about those of us working shit jobs who have no degrees? Not everyone can drop everything in their lives, live in a van, and just travel the world.

I hate being human. I hate how people make assumptions about people's appearance and then don't bother to see if what they think is true. I hate how outgoing, narcissistic people get ahead way more than those who are less popular but by no means less qualified. I hate how stupid, vapid, and easily manipulated human beings are. The world is just a popularity competition based on how many people like you. Why should I have to go out of my way to force people to like me? This society was shaped by narcissistic sociopaths for their own benefit. 

I don't care how my friends or family will react, because emotions are temporary- remember? No emotion lasts forever, and someday- maybe not now or in a few months or years- they'll get over it. Life doesn't stop when one person commits suicide, and it's not like I'll be conscious to regret or miss anything. 

I'd rather die that go on trying to pretend to be like anyone else. I'll never be that popular, outgoing person that everyone flocks to, it just isn't me. I cant go back to blinding optimism when I've seen so much terrible shit. Life is cruel, heartless, and not worth enduring. I just see suicide as a way to opt out permanently.
