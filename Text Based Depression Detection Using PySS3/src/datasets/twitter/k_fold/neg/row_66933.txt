EmptyI'm in pain every second, A hole that just expands. My personality disorders, depression, and other mental illnesses love to play and poke at me and make me feel worse. 

I'm not even 18 and my dad is kicking me out of the house, telling me to fix my shit or live with the mother abused me. 
Life is so hard, I have no friends  not even family at this point. My boyfriend is amazing but he doesn't really understand and makes me feel worse... It triggers me into an anger and i say horrible things. I just want help, I want to have a happiness that isn't ruined from something bad. I'm scared of living, I don't know what to do.
