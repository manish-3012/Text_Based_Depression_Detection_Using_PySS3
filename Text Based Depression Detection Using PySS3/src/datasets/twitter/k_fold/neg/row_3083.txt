iâ€™m so tired.i just need to vent, i have no one to talk to about this and i feel so alone right now. i feel so powerless and weak right now. i feel like i have no voice but honestly even if i did i dont think anyone would give a fuck. iâ€™m tired of my life, and always hearing negative things about me from my family. i dont think my life has a purpose or any meaning.

i really wish i could just kill myself, but i know iâ€™m probably too pussy to even do that. so iâ€™ll just keep thinking about it and punching myself in the face hoping iâ€™ll get a brain bleed and pass away.
