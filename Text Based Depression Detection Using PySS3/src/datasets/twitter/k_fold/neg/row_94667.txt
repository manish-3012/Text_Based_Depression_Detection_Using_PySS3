I'm not suicidal, but the way my life is slated to be becoming more and more apparent, the passage of time is pushing me closer and closer to the edge...(First off, if I interest you heavily here, let me recommend you read another Reddit of mine that subtly was referring to the topic of thIs subreddit. I don't have the time to retype all that info here. https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3d3jsf/i_have_a_crippling_fear_of_spending_the_rest_of/ )

I have become less and less optimistic of life. I'll recap the major details here (all of them are in the linked post) and add some more:

-My life is slated to be spent going to a job I am almost certainly going to dread going to (nothing I am interested in is a marketable job) just so I can afford a lifestyle that will be defined by me going to that job... Cycle. That detail is the key to this post. The notion that I will spend most of my life at a job I am heavily predisposed to intensively dislike... URGH! That makes me WANT an apocalypse or some type of unrest-inducing event to come just so I can avoid the stigmatization (on individual, familial and societal levels) of abstaining from this path (then again, I know that most people don't share these thoughts, so I wouldn't want that in actuality, it's just a thought my brain likes to have).

-I, even though I am young and this is still open to change, am quite confident that I am an aromantic (the thought of me being romantic with anyone is so unappealing to me that it would take a MASSIVE reversal of my worldview to change that), and I'm also VERY sure that I won't have kids. I wouldn't want people to be born in less-than-ideal circumstances, and I, since I can barely manage to keep myself stable mentally, won't want to force that responsibility down to another. At least those of us with kids or romantic partners can have a motivation. I wouldn't. (Before you try to, let me just state that I heavily recommend you are a phenomenal convince-artist if you are going to challenge that belief of mine, I can honestly say it borders on hard-wired in my brain).

-I (due to things like how I was born, what circumstances etc.) don't have any major purpose or whatnot in life. I'm just your average joe.

-I (long story) am irreligious, I don't believe in the afterlife.

Now, I am not yet actively suicidal -- I still fear death and I would try to exit a dangerous situation if I had the chance. However, if I KNEW that death was 100% certain and unavoidable, I (even though I know that I'd be fearing it like shit once it is actually arriving) would be accepting. But frankly, I haven't even entered the eternal grind yet, and I'm already being depressed at the prospect. I'm certainly going to try, but if what I hear from everyone I know is true, I'm not going to have a good time in there.

I really don't have a positive view on life. Life is going to be a prison. The best-case scenarios that do not go too far towards the edge of the realm of possibility for me is me getting a good job that the prospect of attendance is not joyous to me. Really... I can't imagine being trapped in that place for 4-6 decades. And to be honest, the fact that I can't think of a better system to replace this capitalism, as well as the fact that everyone else is committing to the grind, do not mitigate the fact that I despise this system where you need to work to live (I know that those facts should make me more accepting, but in my mind and heart, they don't, that logic isn't relaxing them).

Now if you had the patience to read this (or even better that more detailed version), then I, even if you have disdain of my acknowledged laziness, respect and appreciate you. My question to you is this:

-Any words, feedback, advice etc. you can give me?

-Any philosophies, schools of thought etc. I may be interested in (besides obvious ones like populism and laborism)?

-Any resources I can get to?

-Do you sympathize with or share (or once shared) these feelings?

-For those of you who are older; does it get any easier? I know people always say that to be politically correct and to avoid infusing a pessimistic tone into conversations meant to be friendly or optimistic, but really... Does it get any easier? Is this really just something people say?

-For those of you who have disdain or are unsympathetic to me, I, as long as you are willing to speak with rationality and refrain from insulting, am willing to hear you out.

Thanks.
