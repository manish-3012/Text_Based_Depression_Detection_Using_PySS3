Does anyone else feel icky when they research ways to die painlesslyThose posts would include ways to die but how there would be some pain and I just feel really icky hearing about the nausea that comes with blood loss etc. 

I used to surf r/watchpeopledie and felt only gross at the most gory ones like a man being torn in half but other than that Iâ€™m pretty desensitized. I do have a weird thing against needles though and I get queasy when people talk about medical stuff even if its just general stuff like cells. I also hate hyper realistic medical surgery scenes. Is there something wrong with me?
