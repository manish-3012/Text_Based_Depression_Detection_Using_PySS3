I live in a lieeverything around me if fake. nothing is real, it's all an act, a theater, all my life I'm being controlled somehow, everything that happend to me, good or bad, was precisely crafted for some reason that I dont understand. I'm a slave of that reality. I have fears normal people dont have, and I have courage normal people dont have. I've always seen death as a way out, but now I just dont care anymore, I'm losing myself, I'm vanishing like a washed out image, turning white, until it  disappears completely and no one will remember no more...
