I don't know how much more of covid life I can takeJust venting here. I don't think I'll last a whole winter like this. My one shred of hope for the future has just been lost. I have nothing to keep me going. I'm a pointless waste of life on this planet. The years just keep getting worse and I can't take it anymore. Its really just not worth it and hasn't been for a long time. It's just shitty. I know loads of people feel like this. I guess I'm just one of the weak ones ready to check out.
