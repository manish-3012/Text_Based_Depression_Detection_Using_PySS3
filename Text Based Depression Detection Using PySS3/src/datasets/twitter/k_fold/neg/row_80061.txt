19 and donâ€™t have any reasons to go oniâ€™m 19, not in school and donâ€™t have a job anymore even though i was actively still looking before i gave up hope and just stopped because of my math disability and how terrible i am at counting change and worthless it makes me feel it caused me even more depression....i have no friends and talking to my family would only make me feel more alone. i feel like i disappoint them and that makes me want to harm myself even more than i already do. iâ€™m lonely and i have nobody and no job and nothing to do and i just sit and feel even more depressed and think negatively of myself more times than i can count, i just want to fucking end it so iâ€™m not a burden to my family anymore and so my disability will no longer be a problem  theyâ€™ll be fine without me, i have a lot of siblings so theyâ€™ll be fine without me, i just want an end.
