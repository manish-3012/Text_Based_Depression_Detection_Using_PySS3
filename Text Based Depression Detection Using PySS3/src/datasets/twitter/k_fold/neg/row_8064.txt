I don't want to die but I see no way to get betterPeople always say you're supposed to ask for help when you're suicidal and that it'll get better but I've been asking for help for 7 years and now no one knows how to help any more and it's still not better. I've been through mental health services, inpatient and outpatient, therapy, tried a bunch of meds and the only thing that helped was the meds I'm taking now but since I'm struggling now the doctors are saying that I should change my meds to another antipsychotic with horrible side effects and to an SSRI which have never helped before. 

I'm honestly scared I won't survive a med change, I think my current meds are the only thing keeping me alive. I don't want to go back to the way I was before them, very suicidal, delusional, depressed, self harming and in and out of the police cells and inpatient all the time because of it.

I don't know what else I'm meant to do though, my mental health is deteriorating again and I'm feeling very stuck in my current life, being 24, single with no family or best friend, a shitty fast food job where I probably more money than doing what my qualification is in if I could get a job in it, no car and not much money saved because I haven't been able to hold down a job before these past 2 years.
