After 24 years of this shit, I'm left wondering, How will I do 24 more.  Birthday Quarter-life crisis emo crap.Today's my birthday.  24.  It's been a little over two years since I went to the hospital to prevent myself from killing myself.  I'm medicated, and functional, but god dammit if life doesn't try its damndest to keep me down.

I hate work, and as a result I can't find a job.  I'm broke, and I owe more money to creditors than I'll reasonably be able to pay out.  

After the whole Lucidending affair, I don't see why I should keep up hope that things can be better.  People are full of shit.  We don't deserve to exist.

I'm not sad anymore.  Just angry.  I lack the discipline or the support networks to change my life.  Trying to be connected with reality just makes me want to burn it down.

How will I make it through the next 24? Seconds? Minutes? Hours? Days? Years?

How do you come to terms with the fact that you're not special?  You're as average and broken as anyone else?  How do you get the strength to do "things" (whatever they may be) well enough to feel good about it?

Is life really just about those moments where I forget about hurting myself?  They go by so fast.

I just thought I'd reach out to strangers on what is arguably the worst birthday I've ever had.  Say something...anything that makes me feel better and not worse.

Don't worry.  I won't actually hurt myself.  I just want this frustration to subside a bit.
