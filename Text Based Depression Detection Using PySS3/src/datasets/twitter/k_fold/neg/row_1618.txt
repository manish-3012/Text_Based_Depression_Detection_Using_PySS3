I'm aloneI have been depressed for a long time now. About 7 years. It was bad, but I could manage because of my friends.

I also had the help of a girl that loved me a lot. We dated for 4 years.

But she left me for another one. All of my friends are gone since college. I don't have any friends in my college. I don't have any friends.

I've been thinking about killing myself for years now. I'm worried the time has come.

I have a small gun, shoots small lead bullets, but I'm sure the gun is too weak to do any real damage. But I can't stop thinking about shooting in my head.

I've been thinking about going out, visit the centre of the town and see if I can buy a gun from the blackmarket.

I have also thought about slitting my wrists, but I've read that it's painful and I don't have any drugs at home besides my prescribed medication.

I have thought about throwing myself out of the window. But my apartment is on the first floor, and the fall might not be long enough to be lethal.

I have thought about taking all the pills. Kill me with antidepressants. I think it wouldn't be painful.

My point is, I'm lonely.

I spend most days crying myself to sleep. I can barely get out of bed.

Why shouldn't I kill myself?
