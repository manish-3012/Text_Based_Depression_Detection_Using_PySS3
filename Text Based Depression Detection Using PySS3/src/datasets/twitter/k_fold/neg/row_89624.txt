ObsessedI can remember being in first grade and crying while laying in bed and just wishing I was dead. I am now 30 and I still constantly have these thoughts. Currently I am going through a break up after 11 years and it is only making these thoughts worse. I guess my point is that I have always felt like suicide is my destiny. My whole family has always battled depression and suicidal thoughts. I just feel like that my whole life has lead me down this road.
