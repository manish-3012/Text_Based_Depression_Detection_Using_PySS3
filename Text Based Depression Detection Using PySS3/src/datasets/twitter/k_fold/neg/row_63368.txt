I want to die, I want to live.I hate my life. I've pushed all my friends away from me. I'm hated by so many. Every day I think about killing myself. It feels like a good option. It feels like a terrible option. I don't know what to do. I guess I'm just like every other person on this subreddit. Not special. Just all lost.
