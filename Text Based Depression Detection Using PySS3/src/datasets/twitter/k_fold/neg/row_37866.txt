A casual friend of mine attempted suicide recently and doesn't know I know about it - I want to send her an encouraging message, can anyone give their opinions?So this person isn't a close friend - I worked with her for a month or so and got on very well actually - she's a really sweet, awesome kind of person to talk to. We've peripherally kept in touch here and there over the years, but not to more than 2-3 times a year. I was completely unaware of what I assume is her serious depression.

A few weeks back, she jumped off a 5 story building and survived.

The story that her family has put out there is that it was a hit and run - I don't want to debate what they should have said btw, but this is the situation.

I don't mind hinting that I know and I'm here to talk with her if she needs, but I don't just want to drop the bomb that I know tactlessly. Here's what I've sketched out so far:

&gt;Hey mate, so sorry to hear you've been going through so much!

&gt;I truly hope you continue down the path of improving and getting all the help you need. You're awesome and I'm glad you're still around :)

&gt;I'd like to invite you to a board games night with the Mrs and some of our other friends whenever you're feeling up to it.

&gt; I'm sorry to say it takes me hearing such terrible news to remind me you're awesome and I'd like to catch up with you.

&gt; Wishing you all the good feelings in the world and don't hesitate to get in touch if you need to talk to someone

What do we reckon? Light enough?

EDIT: before someone suggests it, I'm aware going to see someone is the best way generally, but it is not applicable in this case - I'm not close enough with her for that and I certainly don't want to intrude on her privacy by tracking her down seeing as I don't know which hospital she is even in - she has family and her partner with her, so she certainly isn't alone.
