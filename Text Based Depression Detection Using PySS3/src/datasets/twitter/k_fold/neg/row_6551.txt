iâ€™m drowning againIâ€™ve been trying to push myself because I know Iâ€™ve grown a lot but my mental health is so scary. I feel so unreal and itâ€™s like thereâ€™s a buzzing around my head and my chest hurts. I feel like Iâ€™m dying and I want it to end. I can barely sleep. when I sleep, I live the most traumatic memories over and over again. when I donâ€™t sleep, I get in such a scary place I donâ€™t know how to manage it. Itâ€™s all spinning in my head to the point iâ€™m nauseous. I donâ€™t feel real. I donâ€™t know if I can do this.
