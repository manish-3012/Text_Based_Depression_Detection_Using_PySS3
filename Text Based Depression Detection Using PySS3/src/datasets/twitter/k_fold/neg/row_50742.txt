I'm out of ideas. Need help, this might really be it.Itâ€™s getting worse. I think Iâ€™m actually losing my mind, and my grasp on reality. Thoughts of killing myself and wanting to die are constant. 

&amp;nbsp;

I donâ€™t always want to kill myself, I just want this to stop so badly. I donâ€™t want someone I know to find my body. I donâ€™t want to try only to fuck it up and wake up exposed and feeling like shit. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. I just canâ€™t live like this anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel terrible all the time. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m crazy and itâ€™s all psychological, or if itâ€™s actual symptoms of a medical condition. I canâ€™t tell the difference anymore. Maybe I just want someone to give me a name for what the hell is wrong with me. There is still a part of me that doesnâ€™t believe depression and anxiety are really real, that this is just how I am, and itâ€™s all my fault.

&amp;nbsp;

The only respite I have is weed. But it isnâ€™t enough to calmly waste my life away feeling high and somewhat okay, knowing that the moment I come down Iâ€™ll be in hell. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I am so, so tired. I donâ€™t know what else to do other than end it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I can feel my boyfriend pulling away. Iâ€™ve tried so hard to keep our relationship stable in the midst of all this, but I honestly canâ€™t blame him for not wanting me anymore. Iâ€™m nothing. Iâ€™m a fragile, sad, worthless, lazy stoner who will never be able to hold any sort of relationship together. 

&amp;nbsp;

I donâ€™t know how to pull myself out of this. I donâ€™t know what to do. I need answers, and no one has them. Everything I do to help myself just feels like stalling the inevitable. Iâ€™m going to die. I want to die. I feel so close to it. I feel like a total lost cause. What little time I can manage to stay alive will be nothing but agony.

&amp;nbsp;

I need help, but I donâ€™t think there is anything on this earth that can help me. Iâ€™ve tried all the â€œrightâ€ things. So many meds, CBT, mindfullness, diet, exercise, medical testing, nothing has worked. At best I feel okay for a couple of months, but always comes back, and it keeps getting worse. 

&amp;nbsp;

Iâ€™m out of ideas. I just can't do this anymore.
