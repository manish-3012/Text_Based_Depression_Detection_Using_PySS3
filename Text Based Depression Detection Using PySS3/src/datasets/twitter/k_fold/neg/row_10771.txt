Self hatred and SuicideI feel like my minds an equilibrium. When I feel less suicidal my mind will just put me through an intense amount of pain and make me more suicidal. It's good because it works both ways, but it also means I can never get better.

Right now I'm filled with intense self hatred. I'm ugly as fuck. Good people have broken up with me and refused to date me because they've found me unattractive. I'm useless. There's not a single thing that matters that I can do right. I have no friends. My family would prefer that I killed myself- they have told me this several times. I'm a waste of space. I'm suicidal- I should have long stopped trying, but I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I want to rip my arms off. I want to cut until there's nothing left but bone. I'm not mentally stable. I'm not emotionally stable. I don't know why I bother. I'm just living for no particular reason. I need to die.

But I just don't have it in me to kill myself. I don't know what to do.
