Feeling like suicide is my only optionI feel like there's something wrong with me and there always has been, but it's only getting worse. Something will happen, I'll get shitty, upset and irritable. My parents get fucked off with me. My friends become disconnected. I have no idea how to fix anything. I can only think of suicide. I don't explicitly want to die, but I'm starting to think it's the only thing I can do. I don't know how to talk to anyone about this or how I can seek help. Whenever I've tried to do something about it in the past, I'm fine for a little while but just keep coming back to how I am now. I need to fix this. I want to have purpose, I want to be loved, and I want to be normal. Please help me reddit.
