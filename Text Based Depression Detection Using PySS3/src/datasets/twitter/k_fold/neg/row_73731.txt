The harder they try, the less I'm convinced.Does anyone here ever feel worse about the state of life when other people try desperately to make you feel like it's worth living? What I mean is, when people want you to cheer up or stop being depressed and suicidal, they say things that to me seem blatantly not true just for the sake of some wholesome encouragment. 

"It gets better"

Not always. Probably not even most of the time.

"It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem"

No, it's a permanent solution to a permanent problem.

I just feel like the hollow and useless advice of others has only convinced me that life is so confusing and horrifyingly, soul crushingly pointless that other people are simply avoiding the reality of it. 

It's like having someone tell you that everything is perfectly fine, but they are sweating and they have their fingers crossed behind their backs. 

It's a lie to keep you here for what? 
Life really is a curse.
