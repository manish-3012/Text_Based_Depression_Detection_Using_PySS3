I was walking to the store, and a tweaker walking on the opposite sidewalk could even pick up how sad I was and said "don't look so bummed out, lady. homeless people have it worse off than you do." ... The thing is, I used to be homeless and was happier then than I am now. Nothing, on paper, is going bad in my life. A few things, but nothing unmanageable. And yet I'm still fucking miserable. All the reassurances that nothing is wrong, I have nothing to be sad about, etc. are not helping. Then, I at least had an excuse. It made it more bearable, thinking that if things were different maybe I could be happy. But I've put a lot of energy into improving my situation, and I'm still not happy. And it just makes me feel worse.
