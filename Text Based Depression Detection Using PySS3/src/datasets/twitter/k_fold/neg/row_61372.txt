Im short and i just want to end this.Ive never been taken seriously in my life cause of my height,im 1m and 65 cm and i am 18 i just cant take enough of this anymore.
I've always had a weak character,i submitted to people just because they were higher than me and i still ahve to do this.
People just cant take me seriously because of my past and my height i look like i fucking 14 year old boy im ashamed to be alive,to go around,to live.
My parents say get a job for this summer yeah like someone is gonna get me when i look like a freaking midget.
And i cant think about when i get a car i wuold get sopped 24/7 by police asking for the driving license.
I thought working out wouldve helped me ,now i got a pretty nice body and can do a lot of things but yeah nothing changed and i feel even more empty.
Im sad everyday of my goddamn life and the worst thing is that i hide everything behind a smiling fucking mask.
I always try my hardest to loook the happier person in the world but nobody still notices me.
Lets not talk about girls cause yea i can understand them how can they get along with someone shorter than them.
Im hopeless unmotivated im only alive thanks to a videogame,if i would die now some people would care but theyre gonna forget me quite quickly..
A quick thrust would end all of my pain.
