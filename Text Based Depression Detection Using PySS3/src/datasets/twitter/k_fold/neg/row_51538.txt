Hi.Hi guys. I don't know what there is to say. 

These days, I'm sad or apathetic all the time. Brief moments of happiness are had, but the sadness always comes back, and it's not even an intense depression - it's just some sort of throbbing constant ache. I hide it pretty well, and none of my friends have an idea other than the ones that I've told. I'm glad I'm not burdening my friends and that I can help them when they come to me with their problems, but I wish they would offer it instead of  having to ask them for help.

I feel like no one cares about me, but I know they do. Everything's a contradiction these days; I just spent half an hour counseling my friend out of killing herself and now I want to do exactly the same. I was looking up how to obtain cyanide because I was worried she'd get her hands on some, but now I know how to get it. 

I don't think I'll actually end up doing anything, just wanted to get this off my chest.
