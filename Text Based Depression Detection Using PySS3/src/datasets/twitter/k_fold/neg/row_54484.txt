Just point me in the right directionI think about killing myself everyday. It's usually a fleeting thought like an image of putting a gun to my head or a knife to my chest. It only lasts a second or two and I never feel particularly depressed when it happens, I just kind of push it back to where ever the thought came from.

The last couple of days I've been feeling more depressed though, and it's getting harder to get up in the morning. I know I won't do anything, but this isn't normal is it? Ugh, I feel like crying just from writing this down. 

I'm too proud to talk to someone. Any good books?
