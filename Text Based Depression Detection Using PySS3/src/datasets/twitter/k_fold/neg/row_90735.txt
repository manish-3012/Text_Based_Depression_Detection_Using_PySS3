Have just given upMy rent is over due, my job sucks, pay me hardly nothing and my girl friend broke my heart. I am 28 and this is the 4th time this has happened to me. I plan on taking some no doze and pm drugs on friday as I quit. People suck. everyone only cares about themselves and now I am for the 4th time trusted the wrong person. With my rent and this whole break up weighing on me the only choice and logical move is to end it. I plan on ending it on friday.

PS:I also think this random bullshit txt to post for help i bullshit.
