My mental illnesses are getting to me. I don't want to get better, I just want to not exist.The worst part is, I don't even have it that bad compared to many other mentally ill people. It's just too much for me to handle. The only thing that has kept me from ending it is the thought of hell really existing and the fact that I would be going there if it does exist.

Edit: I'm not actively planning a suicide attempt, though. Like I said, I'm too scared of the possibility of hell existing to do it. Funny part is, I feel like I'm living in hell currently.. so why don't I just do it? I genuinely don't know how long this fear will keep me alive for, though. With how bad things are getting I really want to attempt again, but I know I'm too scared of hell to actually allow myself to die from it. An attempt right now would just be a shitty cry for attention.
