Tonightâ€™s the nightBefore I say how or why, I want to make it very clear that I can not/ will not be convinced out of this. My life has been way to stressful for someone of my age and I decided around 2 am that tonightâ€™s the night that I am taking my life. Itâ€™s currently 3 am and I am saying my last goodbye as everyone I know is asleep. My note is written, my girlfriend has a letter addressed to her, and her alone. Itâ€™s almost time so I want to say one last goodbye to this cruel, hideous world. Goodbye life, goodbye redditors, goodbye quotevians, goodby world.
