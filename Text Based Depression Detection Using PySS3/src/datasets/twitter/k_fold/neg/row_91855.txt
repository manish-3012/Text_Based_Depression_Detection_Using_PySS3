Everyone needs to stop treating me like trashIâ€™m tired of everyone on this earth treating me like crap. All everyone does is reject me, ignore me, make fun of me, and leave me. No one wants to be my friend (especially irl), no one wants to be my girlfriend, no one wants to do anything with me. Everyone else is having the time of their lives with others while they all treat me like crap. Why should I get treated this way? I didnâ€™t deserve this. Suicide is my only option at this point because no one gives a fuck about me. Killing myself will show others what happens when you treat people horribly.
