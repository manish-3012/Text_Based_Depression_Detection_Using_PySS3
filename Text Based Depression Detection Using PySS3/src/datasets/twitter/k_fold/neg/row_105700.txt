My roller coaster I feel so tired of being tired, i feel worthless and thereâ€™s no hope, i just want to die.

I start thinking how could i do it, i look for ways to do it without pain and suffering.

I realize that thereâ€™s no easy way out, and that i donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, even if itâ€™s only 3 persons in the world who would mind about it. I realize i just canâ€™t do it.

I start thinkg about how could i overcome it, how could i learn to live with myself, and i have some hope.

I make plans, i write down small goals, i ask for help...

But the more i think about it, about the steps i need to take, the effort, the suffering, and in the end, thereâ€™s no reward at the end of the roadâ€¦.  so sudenly iâ€™m back to the start, feeling tired of being tired, just wanting everything to endâ€¦. and then again, and again, and again....

Can anyone relate?
