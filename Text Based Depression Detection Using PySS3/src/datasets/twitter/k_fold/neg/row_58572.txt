Is everything just pain?I read that we, as humans, only want to betray others, and will do so to feel better about ourselves with little to no regret at all.

We're all probably hypocrites, in various degrees but, we are. Every single year, no matter how much we try to avoid it, we piss off people, we break promises, we fail others and others fail us as well...

That's why I feel that nothing makes sense... Why only a few people feel like this? Why can most people have happy, fulfilling lives, without questioning their existence? 

Why do I feel like my entire existence has been nothing but lies and sadness? 

Sorry if this sounds selfish but... I wonder if I made a microscopic difference in the world surrounding me. I wonder if I truly managed to do something to prove my existence, and not just being someone who's easily forgotten, replaced and discarded...
