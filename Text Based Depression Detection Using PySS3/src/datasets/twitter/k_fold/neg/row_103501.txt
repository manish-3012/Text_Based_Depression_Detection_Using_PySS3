This loneliness is becoming debilitatingI can't even say it's "too much" anymore. It's too much to fucking live with every day. It's been too much all my fucking life. I just wanted to be fucking loved.

Sometimes it feels so fucking unfair. Not that that's anything new to you. I'm sure some fuck's gonna say "yeah it's unfair get over it", that's how the world works. But no. Fuck you. Making a fucking child go through a lifetime of physical, sexual and intense emotional abuse isn't fair. Making sure he never gets any soothing from the pain no matter what he does or doesn't do isn't fair. Making him so deeply, intrinsically unlovable and worthless to the world so that any shot at any small peace I had is completely destroyed is NOT FUCKING FAIR FUCK YOU 

The very fucking anxiety of never being loved stops me dead in my tracks no mattee what I'm doing. It's the reality, I get it brain, please just fucking stop reminding me.

I just wanted to be loved. I just wanted to feel one day where I didn't wanna kill myself.
