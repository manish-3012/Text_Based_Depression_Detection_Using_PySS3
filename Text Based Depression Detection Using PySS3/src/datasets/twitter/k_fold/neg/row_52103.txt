Making preparationsI'm on the final stretch of ending my life, but I need some kind of checklist (I have a habit of being forgetful, even in terms of the last thing I'm ever gonna do).


I've done the following-


Written the note, explaining why and a little extra stuff.


Cleaned my room and organised it for easy removals.


Emptied the trash from my room, so they don't have to worry about the smell once this room has been blocked off.


Sold all my higher value items.


I feel like I'm forgetting something, and I want to cover all bases, advice?
