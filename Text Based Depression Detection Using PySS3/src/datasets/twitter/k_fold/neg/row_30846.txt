Suicidal FriendMy friend confided in me that she tried to kill herself recently.  We had a falling out about 10 days ago and I finally missed her so much I messaged her.  I told her I still really cared about her and that I wanted things to be alright.  She told me she tried to kill herself but that was it.  I've been trying to get her to talk to me or at least sit so I can share my story with her but she won't respond.  Our falling out may have been the last straw that catalyzed her attempt which may make it impossible for me to help her further.  What do you do when all you want to do is help and all they want to do is be left alone?  She works at a store and I'm tempted to drop by and just say I'll be there if she needs me but I don't want to overstep.  I just know she doesn't have anyone else to talk to and she likely isn't seeking help because I couldn't get her to do it for months before this.
