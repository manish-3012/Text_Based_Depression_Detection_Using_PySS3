Mire rambling(Ik I ramble alot on this sub, so if you guys want me to stop, and feel like I'm talking up space for someone who probably needs it more, I will stop if asked) I might just be going crazy at this point, but hear me out. I can't improve my situation, so, how can I get truly better? I can't force people to care nor do I want to pressure people into caring by telling explaining how I'm hurting. I've noticed that the few people that I have told, either run off, or stay closer, but how long can they stay close before giving up? I don't blame anyone for giving up, don't get me wrong it hurts, bit I can see why they would. I don't want to be treated like that by everyone. But how am I supposed to improve my life like this? I don't want to be treated like either a child, nor do I want to be treated like I'm dangerous to others (the only person I ever want to truly hurt, is myself). However, that leaves to options: Lying to myself, or suicide. Lying to myself only helps me for so long, before I crash down. So I guess I only have only one option that where won't hurt anymore.
