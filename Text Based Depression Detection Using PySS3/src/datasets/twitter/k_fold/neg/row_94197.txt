I should probably tell my therapist I've had thoughts of hurting myselfRough week. Rough life, whatever. I feel like I have nothing and no one to bring happiness to my life. 

  
Hell, I work at the fucking *happiest place on earth* and I still can't get out of bed and take my pills at a decent time.   


Some people might think, "Oh, but you're at the theme park of everyone's dreams! You have loving friends and family and a start of a promising career! You shouldn't be sad. People out there have it worse!"

I haven't reached the point of actually hurting myself but one failed relationship has almost brought me to that point. I'm not going to be good enough for anyone. People will use me, my parents will be disappointed in me, I haven't got the money to live on my own anywhere. I couldn't even afford to feed myself some days!

How in the hell am I supposed to live in a world that wants lower class citizens like me to fail?
