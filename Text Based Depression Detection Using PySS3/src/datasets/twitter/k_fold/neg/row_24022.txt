AloneI think i am quite done with life. I am waiting for Christmas to be over and some changes at work and then hopefully i will have made up my mind to end my life. I give myself full permission to do so sooner if i need to. I have been very depressed for several months and am at the end of what i can cope with. Words cannot adequately express how lonely and agitated i am. There is something in me that resists emergency help. I often don't see this as a crisis. When i do get distressed i sometimes text for help (helpline) but am not very honest with safety questions. I always do not want to be hospitalised or held until this "passes" because it doesn't ever pass and furthermore, i find psychiatric services more anxiety provoking than anxiety alleviating. I have never felt this way for so long.  I look back and cringe at my life and do not even know where i could start to make changes that would give me hope. I am scared of suicide though and the nothing that would follow and possibly hurt for loved ones. At the same time, i am so freaking alone and let down by so many people and so i am angry. A tiny bit of me still wants help, support and love. How does one ever fully make up their mind about this?? I had two suicide attempts recently and i now know better about technique.  I am just so confused and alone.
