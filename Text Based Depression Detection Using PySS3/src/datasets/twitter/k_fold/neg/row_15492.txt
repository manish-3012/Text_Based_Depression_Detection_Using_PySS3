Just cut myself, going to be gone soon enough. Thank you reddit for the support over the timeI've finally started bleeding out. This site has given me a lot of support over the last couple years. A couple people even tried to stop me in the end. Thank you for that. I hope at least when I die, maybe people wont hate me so much.
