Feeling better today after medication, however constantly ignored...So today I started taking Bupropion. I have to take 1 every morning and so far, my mood is pretty much stabilized. I stop taking Latuda because it just makes me very drowsy and sleepy, but I think I only take it when I really need it.

Anyways, I can't say I'm not upset about the past few weeks.I asked my girlfriend of 4.5 years for her permission to die. As a result, she wanted a month break (meaning no contact whatsoever for a whole month). So far, it's been 2 weeks and 4 days.

Even though I started my medication and got some more perspectives, my situation is still stagnant. No friends (which I can actually live with), no job (constantly working my fingers to the bone with that), and no sense of direction in life.

I have no piercings, no tattoos, clean record, exercise, diet, sleep 7-9 hours each day, hygienic, and still I get overlooked as an individual. I want to know what my flaws are, my weaknesses. Clearly I must be doing something wrong that I can't get the attention I deserve. I'm not an attention whore, but this constant feeling of being ignored. I just don't know if I can tolerate that much longer.

Girlfriend has made no attempt in contacting me and job attempts are getting futile. There's a reason it's called the cost of living, because everything has a person. But I digress. If I'm ignored, does that mean I don't exist?
