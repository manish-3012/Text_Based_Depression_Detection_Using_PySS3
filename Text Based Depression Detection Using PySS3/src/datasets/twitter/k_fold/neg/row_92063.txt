please im not looking for attention, ignore this post even im just so fucking tiredi cant do this anymore. nobody in my life fucking cares. only my mom who i feel bad that she has to deal with me and my depression and issues, my dad cant deal with it at all, my boyfriend thinks its a joke, my friends dont wanna hear it and i feel so fucking worthless. im gonna do something soon. im so scared but my families life would be better without me. they all fucking hate me anyway. im useless. even my boyfriend who i thought i could confide to told me he got over his depression through meditation and i can do the same but i dealt with depression for fucking years after years and im so exhausted. i tried everything. every fucking thing. i feel so selfish and weak for having suicidal thoughts but i have remained strong for so long. no body fucking cares and i cant think of any other options. when i get depressed and cant do anything thats when my dad tells me he dosent know why im dealing with it, if i was really depressed i would have killed myself, i have everything i need but im still feeling depressed? these are all things he tells me and im so tired of being a burden to everyone. some of my extended family ignores me because they think im a depressed slut who does nothing, but in reality im fighting a mental battle that is getting really tough. im so lost
