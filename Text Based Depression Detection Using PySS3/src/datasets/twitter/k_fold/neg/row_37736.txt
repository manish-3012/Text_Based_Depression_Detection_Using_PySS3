I'm HIV positive and cant afford treatmentI am going to die anyway and I would rather die now than suffer for a few more years. Even if I could afford treatment it may or may not even help. Also the treatment conflicts with my hormones, so no more girly pills for the rest of my life.

My life has been one massive shit show. Just when it started to get better. Just when I started to look forward to my future, this happened.

I just dont even know how to feel. I might hold off a month or so since my sisters birthday is coming up, and my moms is shortly after. I have a plan though. I think early October will be good.

I'm glad I found someone I love before hand. I am also glad I found out about this before we had sex, so I didnt transmit it to her. We were perfect for each other. Two lesbian queens. I can still talk to her and enjoy her company for my final days atleast.

So many things I wish I could have done. So much I wish I could have been. I wont live long enough to be my true self. Atleast I have a few good memories. Just a few.
