In the moments when the stress and adrenaline fades away, a cold and terrible clarity would descend over me. My hands would shake, and the urge to cut becomes so strong that I would have to close my eyes lest I harm myself.The nightmares and self-hatred have gotten worse. Instead of taking care of myself, am lost - a shade, cut off from the world around me. People drift around and part away like shadows, lost, at the end of an unimaginable tunnel. I cry in the evenings, and wake up at night with such sharp clarity and terror.

I am cold, my voice feels strange and distant, my heart a pitiful creature of pain and sorrow. When will it end?
