I dont know what to titleI don't really have anyone to go to here, so I figured fuck it all, Ill put this out there and then maybe someone random can help. I don't really care at this point.

I am 18, just about to start college, and something is not right with me.

I literally have the worst anxiety about the future. I know I will fail, just based on the past. Everything I have done I have either gotten lucky, or just half-assed it just enough to scrape by and it is 100% not an exaggeration when I say this. I fucking hate myself for doing it, but I know that no matter the circumstance, its inevitable that I do the exact same shit that I always say I shouldn't, I just don't care ever and it hurts me, and sometimes the people that I love.

I have no sense of direction anymore. Everything just seems worthless to me. There's no future, and even if there was, I know mine would have me end up in a fucking ditch. 

So here I am, whining to empty air about how I am too lazy to do shit, how I don't know what to do and how I am scared, and I expect sympathy from random people. This fact alone makes me feel like even more of a low life, "please, take pity on me and drag out my inevitability to amount to nothing." The irony is that I doubt anyone I know has even the slightest clue about what I am feeling, and I really don't want to change the image that they have of me. 

I am ready to just go off.

Tonight makes the 3rd day of a string of suicidal considerations. I so fucking scared either way, it goes to show how useless I really am if I cant even make the decision to make the most selfish action a reality, even then so to simply consider it. Its a cycle and I keep going down.

I know I am being a pussy, but I guess all I can ask is for you to persuade me. Nobody else I know can, because nobody else can know
