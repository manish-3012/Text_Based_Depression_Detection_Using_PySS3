This quarantine is making me feel numbI just sit in silence waiting for happiness to pop up in my life. But it doesn't work like that. I haven't been sleeping well, a couple hours here and there. I always feel alone. I was supposed to have an online therapy session.. skipped that because I tired as fuck. That was a big mistake... I scheduled another one so I can redeem myself. I haven't been eating well.. fast food like every day. I just feel absolutely disgusting. Slowly losing control.. I'm normally a pretty active guy. But just losing my mind over but not sleeping and eating poorly, and watching a lot of porn. I'm a musician(drummer) in a band.. music isn't even helping. I just need a hug and someone to talk too. I wanna hear a voice that's not my own, telling me I'm worthless and stupid and fat and ugly etc.. 
I close my eyes, I think of my funeral. I can feel the gun being pressed against my temple. I would love to shoot but I have no gun. I feel like shattered glass
