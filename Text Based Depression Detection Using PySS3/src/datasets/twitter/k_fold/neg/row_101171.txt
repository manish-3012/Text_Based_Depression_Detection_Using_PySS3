Venting The rotten putrid feelings I haul around every day.I've been putting this off for years, Lately I feel like it's all been wasted time.

You'd think  17 years of someone asking how you feel and throwing pills at you would fix any problems you have.  You try so hard to fit in , Get a good job, Do well in school, Just exist outside of the fucking institution.  


I'm beginning to think some of the past attempts were just one step from being a success.  The reason my life has gone to shit more and more is that I wasn't meant to be around this long.  


I don't know exactly what to do anymore, Every day is a fucking struggle anymore. Each time I drive I just vividly fucking dream about throwing the car into a semi.  If I cross a street I do it as slow as I can in hopes someone will make the decision for me.  


I can't bear this shit anymore, But I'm such a pussy I haven't gone through with it just because of 'How it will affect others'.  


How fucking pathetic am I?
