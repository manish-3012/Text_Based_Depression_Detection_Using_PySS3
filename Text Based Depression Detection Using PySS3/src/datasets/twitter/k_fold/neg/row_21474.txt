I am a giant asshole who pushed everybody out of his lifeI literally have no one to talk to and only have myself to blame. I have had made attempts on my life before but I am just so tired. I just step on everybody around me and then feel like a piece of shit afterwards. It is a vicious cycle. I don't want to tell anybody because I am afraid they will call the cops, but sitting here letting myself boil over isn't helping. Everyone in my rad tech course hates me. I treat my chick like shit. No one wants anything to do with me. I am at ropes end and I feel myself pushing to get over the last hump in order to just do it. Trying to get a hold of myself but my thought process is always, "whats the point? You will be here again in a couple of months." I am tired of being so fucking tired all of the time. Trying to stop myself from buying a six pack because I know that is what I need to gain the strength to get it over with.
