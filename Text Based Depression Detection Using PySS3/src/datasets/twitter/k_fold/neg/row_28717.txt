I want to kill myself because I keep failing college.After a recent exam where I failed due to running out of time I realized my college experience has been a never ending cycle of failure. A lot of that was due to my bad mental health, but a lot of the material I just cannot get, like math. And I have terrible time management. I'm just so tired of failing and I don't have the money to keep doing it so at this point I'm thinking either drop out or kill myself. A lot of other things in my life sucks to, like me, the fact that I have no social life my life is just generally going nowhere so it might be time to end it.
