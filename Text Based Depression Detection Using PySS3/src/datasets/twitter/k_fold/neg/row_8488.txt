I don't care if this sounds patheticIf my FiancÃ© dies of cancer I see no other option but to die. He is my whole life. I've been with other people and no one has ever loved me and treated me as well as he does. I love him more than any other person in the world. He is my best friend. We have lived together for years, shared our lives together since we met. He makes me laugh, brings my spirits up and has always taken care of me. He's sweet to strangers, and if you ask him for anything he will do everything he can to help. He's so positive and strong and since he has been diagnosed he has only broke down and cried twice. 
His cancer just relapsed and he feels like he "let everyone down" 
He's the best person I've ever met. Selfless, Kind and humble. 
I've been trying to prepare myself for the possibility of his death. Every time I even think about how I will live if he dies the pain is unbearable. And that is only thinking about it for a second. I can't live on this fucked up planet with out the light of my life. I wont make it.
