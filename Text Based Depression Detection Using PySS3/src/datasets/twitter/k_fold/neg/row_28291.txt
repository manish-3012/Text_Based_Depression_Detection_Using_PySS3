Reasons to die nowGeneral info:
21 year old white male in USA.
Mom's brother committed suicide before I was born.

Reasons to die:
I hate everything society has to offer.
I don't feel like I even have a personality.
My anger affects others negatively.
I'm sex obsessed and have a 4.75 inch penis (good game)
I'm awkward.
I wouldn't have to work and do dumb shit.
I wouldn't feel remorse for killing myself because I'd be dead.
I wouldn't have to think about killing myself anymore.
I could frame a person I don't like for my death.
Better to die by my hand in the way I see fit, than to die at the hand of another or by disease.
Sick of seeing ads and hearing shitty music all the time.
So I never have to experience "Nobody likes you when you're 23."

Reasons to live:
So my parents and sister don't feel the pain associated with my suicide.
So I can continue being a sick fucking pervert.
So I can continue consuming and destroying the earth.
So I can get married and have kids and hope they are happier than me.
So I can listen to music I enjoy with subs.
So I can continue waiting to be attacked by a stranger so I can slay a man in self defense.
Being in the military, suicide would be considered destruction of government property, which is really really bad.

Just my opinion on my life, although you are certainly entitled to one. I'd like to hear it.
