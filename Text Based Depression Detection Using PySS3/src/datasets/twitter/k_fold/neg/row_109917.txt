I have to kill myself tonight. It's the only way to end this pain23 year old man with severe anxiety and Bipolar 1. I have 2-5 panic attacks a day, every day. I decided to go to the dentist about severe sudden pain and had a massive panic attack the whole time. Then he told me my tooth is dead and I need a root canal!!! Noppppe. I literally almost drove into 3 trees on the way home to end the mental and emotional pain. I have a root canal scheduled Saturday and I can't deal with that crap!



On top of freaking out about Saturday my life sucks. I've had severe mental issues my whole life, namely the last 8 years. I've tried tons of meds and tons of therapists. I'm so done.




I have to kill myself now to end my pain, to end my sorrow.
