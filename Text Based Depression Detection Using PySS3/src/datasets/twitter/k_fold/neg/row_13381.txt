Itching sensation to get it over with I feel like i am one step away from actually going through with it. It feels almost like a compulsion, an itch I cant scratch and i want relief. Anything I look at lately I've just had a looming feeling of what it would be like to kill myself with and or by it. I feel like i will randomly take the plunge. 
I don't know where to go for help. Part of me wants to do it and part of me realizes it's completely irrational and I'm not actually depressed, i just feel like killing myself or disfiguring myself. It feels like i feel it in my bones and its all i can think about. 
A few days ago i almost went through with it and it feels like i'm that much closer to getting it over with.
