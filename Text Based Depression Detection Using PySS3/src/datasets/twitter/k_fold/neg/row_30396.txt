Well bSo my plan is to play in my concert.  Get home steal a moment to myself and then kill myself. 

I just don't enjoy any thing any more.  I've pushed everyone away. Everyone I love. I saw the one of the two people I truly love. It reminded me of how much a fuck up I am. I'm weak and pathetic and I shouldn't be allowed to live. 
I'm also planning before i make the final cuts to carve a couple of words into my body. 
Specifically weak fat crazy Emma and grace.
