I'm not sure what to title thisI have struggled with thoughts of suicide for as long as I can remember. I'm really tired. I've been through all the stages of constant crying. Constant anger, constant loathing. It feels like every emotion that could be felt, it was in my heart at some point. There was a point where I thought I felt nothing, and then hope. Hoping that somehow this was how I was suppose to feel. That was what everyone should of felt like. However, recently for the past few months, there's a new feeling. Two maybe actually, content. With content after a while, acceptance.  I'm accepting my fate. That this is what was supposed to be in the cards the whole time. I was playing a game that I wasn't supposed to win in the ways that I thought. 

Before, i thought end would in life or death. When conent came, I did try out life with this new feeling. However, it became more and more clear, I was living for other people. There was a constant need for a new people in my life, so it would be lesson and move on. 

Acceptance came when it was new people for 5 minutes. There's nothing left for me to give. I'm not upset, im really not. If you decide to message me, don't tell me there is a reason to live, when there's not for me. Its okay, for me. My death isn't in vain. My death is actually really peaceful, and my hope for you guys to know this. I died know I did everything that I could. When youre reading this, don't be upset for me. Please remember all the good times we had. Please remember the hours long conversations we shared. Please remember that even though I was so angry at you guys, I loved you all. And whatever happens, smile. I'm finally at peace.
