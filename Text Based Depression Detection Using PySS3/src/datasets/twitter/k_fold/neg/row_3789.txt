I wish you the bestIm so glad you got everything you wanted. I'm so glad you didn't do anything for me. That would make me feel guilty in the long run.

But I don't feel you love me anymore. The distance isn't going to make it any easier. It's okay, you are worth it. You are worth whatever my family will suffer.

Im sorry, but I wish you a great life. Do a great postgrad, have better jobs than the one you landed, marry a great woman and father great kids. 

I will not be alive for it all.

This is my last post, y'all. Im sorry. I can't make it to a month. It's been a lovely supportive group. But it's time to leave this world.

Goodbye.
