ConfessionI'm sorry.

I guess that's a good place to start. I'm sorry for a lot of things and to a lot of people. I never thought I'd have this many regrets as a 29 year old, but here I am.

I'm sorry to my parents first of all. I'm sorry I took every opportunity you gave me and ruined it. I'm sorry I left the military. I'm sorry I never went further with my education. I'm sorry I gave up on all my dreams. I'm sorry I lie to you constantly. I'm sorry I let you and my siblings down. I know you're disappointed in me. I know that deep down inside, me being gone will be a relief. I'm sorry I failed you as a daughter.

I'm sorry to my friends that I abandoned over time. The projects I gave up on and left you to handle. The weddings and birthdays and moments that I missed because I was too depressed, sick, or scared to attend. I was a bad friend. I'm sure it was embarrassing to be around me. I was such a mess, always trying to get your attention and ask for help I didn't deserve. You all deserve so much better. I hope you all know that.

I'm sorry to my boyfriend for being a shit girlfriend. For not working harder to make you feel loved. For not getting sober so that maybe you could follow. I'm sorry I never loved you the way that you deserved. I know that you have a life that you can lead elsewhere with your family. I hope it makes you happy.

I don't feel sad anymore. I don't feel anything. I just feel... Numb. Every time I fall just a little further, every time I hurt myself just that much more, it doesn't scare me anymore. None of this does. I think I've already died a long time ago and I'm just a husk. 

This life has taken so much from me. All I have to give back is my life.

So I'm sorry.
