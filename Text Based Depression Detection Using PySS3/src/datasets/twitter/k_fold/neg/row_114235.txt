Really down........just need some words of encouragementOk, to put it in a nutshell, about 6 months ago, I left my husband of 17 years because our relationship was emotionally and psychologically abusive (on his part) and unhealthy and codependant ....and all in all, just bad.  We have a 4 year old son together and I have been trying my best to be super-cool for his sake.   today, I asked for a divorce and things are baaaad...

Another layer on this is that I have a very good friend who is male, who i have confided in over the years (read:emotional affair.  yes, I admit it was wrong).  Recently, he has decided that him and i being involved was wrong and has cut off contact with me.

End result:  I am left completely alone and wondering if I should have just sucked it up and continued to put up with a shitty marriage.  

A couple years ago, I was plauged with intrusive thoughts of just driving myself into a tree and those kind of thoughts are starting to come back.  I'm starting to think that everyone would just be better off if I were dead.

How do I get out of this hole i have dug for myself?

Edit:  I posted this in SW because I am at a really low point and am consumed with thoughts of just giving up on this life....I KNOW that having an emotional affair was wrong.  I reacted badly to an extremely bad situation.
The point was that just because I was wrong, does that mean I deserve to feel like I should just kill myself?  Apparently some people on this subreddit think so.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Way to be supportive.
