Tonight is rough.Tonight is rough and Iâ€™m really struggling. I have so many outside emotional stresses that are weighing down on my own mental health that I even struggle with breathing, Iâ€™m sending myself into panic attacks every hour. When so little seems to be positive itâ€™s hard to find a light that can guide the way to living, and right now I feel as though my light will have nothing left in a few hours.
