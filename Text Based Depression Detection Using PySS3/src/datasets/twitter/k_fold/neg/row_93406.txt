Merry ChristmasThe girl I love is happy with a new guy. There's no foreseeable future between us. That should be enough to make me want to move on but it's been 4 months and I feel worse every day. Planning my suicide now and taking my time to make sure it is done right. Don't want Christmas to be ruined forever for everyone I know so I will wait for my birthday mid next month. My thinking is if I do this on my bday anyone who is sad won't have to mourn me on my death day too. Anyways cheers merry Christmas if you love someone make sure you don't let them down
