i feel so emptyi dont even know what to say. i dont even have any problems like depression etc. i just feel empty. i feel so little emotions and it hurts sometimes. i have no way to express myself anywhere. its been driving me crazy waking up every morning doing the exact same thing everyday and just sitting there waiting for the days to pass. im trying to make a change and its not working. i need to feel something again. im trying everything i can think of. im sorry if this looks bad im on my phone and i also dont usually write stuff and im bad with words. i just needed somewhere to say this.
