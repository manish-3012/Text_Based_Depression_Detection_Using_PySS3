I canâ€™t let myself suffer this much anymoreAt this point , I want to kill myself out of mercy, kinda like euthanasia. Itâ€™s not even motivated by self hatred or whatever which makes it even more final for me. This is a means of emotions that will pass, this is a means of the reality that I have suffered way too much , more than I was ever meant to and that I simply cannot let myself continue to suffer this badly, it is I humane and I dare to say almost evil to witness myself suffer this much and to not off myself out of mercy. Itâ€™s like watching someone die and slow and torturous death, just kill the poor guy so he wonâ€™t have to endure more pain than he already has.
