I need some advice and or somebody to talk to.To start, the advice, I feel so emotionally unstable. Has anybody got any advice or tips on how to try and keep your emotions steady during the day? Especially while having to be social and talk to people. 
And lastly, somebody to talk to, about anything and everything. To distract me. I have Skype. 

Thanks, 
Emily
