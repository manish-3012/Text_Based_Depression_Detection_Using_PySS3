Save me.I have come to terms with death and no longer fear it. I accept it with open arms. Iâ€™m not afraid of the pain or what comes after it, Iâ€™m honestly quite curious. But the only thing to do now is run through every possible outcome. I have been having suicidal thoughts for quite a while and feel worthless. I know I will never make my parents proud. I know I always will be the screw up that I was destined to be since the day I was born. Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where it actually hurts to do anything. It feels like my mind is being ripped apart with the force of a thousand suns. I donâ€™t understand my own brain, and what humans donâ€™t understand; they fear. I throw on a mask to hide what is really there. When you talk to me, you are not talking to me. I am not me, I am trapped in a cage within that I fear; my mind. I want out; nay, I NEED out. The only thing is what happens if I fail? What would my family do? Think? Say? This wouldnâ€™t be an issue if I succeed, because Iâ€™d be dead. And I donâ€™t have any close friends to worry about. Guess I just have to make sure I donâ€™t fail.
