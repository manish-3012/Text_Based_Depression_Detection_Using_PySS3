my life is over, i never had a chanceits more like a sick joke. Let's take someone and keep them at the bottom of the barrel, in a cage just out of reach of everyone else, but do it in such a way where they can't express it to anybody else. 

The only people that will miss me are my coworkers, but they would really only miss my work and not me personally. 

Im tired of working hard, trying everything I can, and getting nothing in return. Some people just weren't meant to be here, and I am one of them. 

Thus is a fact of life.
