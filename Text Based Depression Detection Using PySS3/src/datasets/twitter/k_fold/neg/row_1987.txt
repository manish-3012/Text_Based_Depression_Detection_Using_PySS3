I canâ€™t take it anymoreI canâ€™t eat I canâ€™t drink I canâ€™t sleep. My head hurts all the time and I feel so lonely. I canâ€™t take it anymore Iâ€™m sick of crying sick of always being left out. I just wanna die. Please I wanna die. I just want to sleep and never wake up again. Iâ€™m smashing and breaking everything so angry and out of control all the time so lonely so cold I canâ€™t hold it I really canâ€™t I just want to die. This life doesnâ€™t worth living. Why you should live while every single breath hurts ? Oh god I feel like something really heavy is on my chest and keeps me from breathing. So lonely so fucking lonely there is no one absolutely no one Iâ€™m so cold ...
