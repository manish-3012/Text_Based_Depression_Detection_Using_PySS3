My thoughts and feelings, every day... Wall of detailed text inbound Hey guys, this is going to be a long one, so if you're going to read this all the way through to the end, you might want to get comfy.  I would first like to disclose that I am not in immediate distress of any sort, nor am I making any plans to snuff myself anytime soon, at least, not just yet. 	I've been lurking on this sub-reddit for a little while now, and I've got to say that it's actually refreshing to see other people getting helpful answers and comfort, rather than just the typical â€œI know how you feel.â€ or the classic â€œThere is help out there.â€ or even better the people who spam the suicide hotline's number everywhere you look. I'm not knocking the suicide hotline or anything like that, if it helps someone that is in immediate crisis, then all power to them, nor am I knocking friends that don't really know any better on how to help you when you're in a distressed state like that. Me personally the suicide hotline has never been effective. To just parrot back to me the things i'm telling them and for them to just add â€œI'm sorry, that must be toughâ€ to everything that I say, no offense I can do that in a mirror and it be just as effective. Some people just need someone to listen, and that's okay. I'm in need of well... a bit more than that at this point. I've seen others on here getting things off their chest, and I guess that's what i'm doing right now. Some of the things that i've seen people post on here are similar to my own thoughts, while others are not. One of the similar things is that while not having the intent on taking immediate action, there have been quite a few people o here that have basically accepted that they are most likely going to die by suicide. I am one of those people. I already have a method in mind, one that isn't so messy, mostly painless and will make for easy clean up for when the authorities find my body. The most likely thing is that I will eventually get sick given my family's medical history. My father had brain cancer and he got treatment, but then I got to witness the slow decline, his new wife leaving him (she was the one who destroyed our relationship in the first place) and now he is in a nursing home, possibly with dementia. One of the thins that a lot of cancer survivors don't talk about is the toll it takes on the other loved ones. The medical costs, the constant treatments and doctor visits, in spite of being strong the person withering away to a shell of their former self... I've already decided that if something similar happens to me, I will start putting a plan in motion to where the few loved ones that I have (assuming that they are even still alive) will be taken care of. Going out that way? Nah... that takes courage. This is however something that I am conflicted by. As long as my mother and father are alive, I can't put them through that. Only if the circumstances went to the far en of extreme would I ever even consider that. This has slowly developed into a toxic trait. Not that I wish any harm on my loved ones, but I find myself wishing that we would all go out in some freak accident, or that they would pass away in their sleep, or something to that effect. With them no longer here in this world, I could finally give myself permission to take my own life. It's thoughts and feelings like this that make me feel like a real piece of shit. Over the course of the past couple of years I have distanced myself away from acquaintances, and even the closest of my friends, hoping that they will think about me a little bit less ,and less each day, that way if for some reason I do end up taking my own life, it won't hurt them as badly. I forget who wrote it, but they said that a person dies more than just once. The first time being in the physical body, twice when their name is spoken aloud for the last time, and once more when the last fleeting thought of you crosses someone's mind for the last time. I know they mean well, my friends that is, but some of the things that they say annoys the hell out of me. â€œThere is professional help out there, if I was in your situation I would've gotten it a long time ago.â€ that's the things though. It took me a long time to realize this, but I don't want help. It already takes so much motivation just to do te bare minimum just to get by, now I'm  going to go to someone I've never met, develop a trusting relationship with them and break down all of the barriers that I have put up brick by brick, tell my entire un-censored life story, and then they're going to tell me to slowly start working on things like my thought process, give me some pills, and now I have this to keep up with among other things, work the next 40 years of my life away, pray some major catastrophe doesn't happen in the mean time, and then I die. Yay. Besides, I don't really have much to go on as far as religious beliefs or there being an afterlife, and I don't feel like there are any magic words or pills that they could put me own that would magically make me believe in Santa Clause, a god, or change my views on the world for that matter. I know some of you are probably thinking â€œOnly you can do that.â€ You have a point, but once you've seen the way certain situations play out, and the way our sociological constructs work, you can't really un-see it. In the past when i've told people some of the things that run through my mind on a daily basis, I'm told I need to â€œgrow upâ€ or â€œthat's lifeâ€ Quite frankly I never asked for it to begin with, and for thinking that way I'm an ungrateful, selfish, immature person? Fuck that. No. What's selfish is the people who claim that they would miss me and shit like that, but we can go for says, months at a time without talking to eachother. So my staying here, with these thoughts, these feelings, all of that suffering is worth the few minutes of interaction that we have with eachother? The same interactions that you don't even give a second thought before you go to sleep each night? And I'm the selfish one.. right... I've come to realize that most humans are one of the shittiest things to happen to this earth, and I know there are some good ones out there, but humansare some of the most cut-throat species to ever exist. No one is going to be your friend unless they have something to gain from you or use you. Being nice is something people do to edge their bets, and because it's what society has taught them this is the way they're suppose to act, but behind closed doors, all of those kind remarks, all of their â€œloveâ€ and â€œhospitalityâ€ it vanishes. I just can't be okay and find comfort in the fact that this is the way society is. I have no future ahead of me, not one that isn't riddled with bullshit and always struggling to make ends meet. I'm so tired of trying and giving it my all, pushing all of these feelings and thoughts down and putting on a happy face, it's so draining. Always struggling to make ends meet. I'm so tired of my best never being enough. I started a new job about a month and a half ago. They keep saying that iwas doing great, that I'm so good at everything I do. But then they hire a new person that's â€œjust here to fill in and pick up the extra shifts.â€ â€œokay.â€ I thought â€œLet's see how this goes, I'm pretty sure I know where this is going but let's just see.â€ Low and behold all of a sudden he is getting all of the shifts that I would normally get. I later on find out that he has a lot of experience already in being a front desk agent at a hotel. Now I'm basically getting the two days that our night audit lady is off, and the rest is basically played by ear and helping the house keepers and shit like that. It doesn't matter how you put it in their little euphemisms and such, it's busy work. Sure I might be lending them a hand and it makes their jobs a little easier and helps cut down on the time they take to clean the rooms. I'm the part time guy now. It doesn't matter what job I'm doing, I try and try, again and again. I have an amazing work ethic and I am always on time, I'm great with customers, I'm very professional but at the same time personal and engaging with the guess. I just don't understand why I am always second choice. I know I should be happy to even have a job right now, but it's just such a swift kick to the balls that I finally found something that I like doing, and I'm always pushed aside for other people. It makes me feel like such a failure, that I can't even be thought of as adequate for basic level jobs, like being a front desk agent a Holiday Inn Express making $11.50 an hour. Any half decent job always picks other people over me. Trying my best and applying myself is never good enough for the places that do decide to give me a chance and take me in. At this point the highlight of my day is getting off of work, watching a bit of youtube after I take my ungodly amount of over the counter sleep aids and pass out. Theres something that I love so much about the warm fuzzy feeling I get when they kick in, and then fighting it for a bit to enjoy it before they finally kick in. I really wish that I could give my life to someone who would actually use it, someone who would actually enjoy it. With the way I intend on going out, maybe if I call the authorities right before I do it, they can get to me in time to where my organs will be able to be donated to those in need of them, that way my death could give someone a new lease on life. Hell if I were ever in a robbery or something or someone tried to mug me I'd do just about everything in my power to get myself killed. I've even thought to myself that if I were to do something horrible that ended up with me dying as a result, my loved ones wouldn't miss me as much. But I couldn't even bring myself to do that, putting the weight of that on my mom's shoulder's especially. That she would have to bury her only child, and she was the mother of â€œthat guy that decided to have a shootout with police and and had a gun full of blanksâ€. Suicide by cop is also so messy. Even though they were only doing their job, they would have to go home and sit at the dinner table and remember how they shot a guy earlier today. No one deserves to have to live with that weight on their shoulders because of my stupid decisions. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up, to slowly be forgotten about and everyone else's lives to go on as normal, maybe even better perhaps. Being someone with a more scientific mindset, I imagine death being like you are just going to sleep, only you never wake up again. I don't believe in an afterlife, re-incarnation, heaven or hell or anything to that effect. I think trying to imagine anything after death would be like trying to remember your own birth, the time you spent in the womb. Speaking of which I have a biological son, whom barely knows of my existence. I tried to be there, but the mother didn't see me as a good father because I wasn't a â€œman of godâ€. It's all fine and dandy though since she found someone who was and ended up having two more kids with him and married him. I signed my rights over and they have full custody. It's all for the best. Regardless of her bringing him up as a church-going god-fearing christian, he has what I didn't. Loving siblings, (something I wouldn't have wanted, she did) a stable family, a father figure that could've actually taught him things, things that I could never do. A lot of my friends think that he will want to know me when he is older, I strongly disagree and honestly that's for the best. Who am I to disrupt the natural order of things? When I make suggestions and get told â€œdon't tell me how to raise my child, I made the right decision seeing where you are nowâ€ So I just watch him grow up from the sidelines, all out of place, this polar opposite of a person with spiritual beliefs just hanging around. He's happy. That's what's import to me. He's happy without me, who am I to take the chance of confusing him or fucking things up. There's so much more that I could type but it wouldn't make a damn bit of difference. I'm so ready for all of this to end, but at the same time, I'm terrified of it, for reasons that I don't know. My best guess would be because death is such a permanent thing, and I can't comprehend not existing like I was explaining earlier. It's not really like there is any reason to fear it, Since it's going to happen to all of us eventually, so why not just embrace it... If you've made it this far into this wall of text, I would like to thank you for having the patience to do so, just another day in the life of a suicidal nutcase. If someone can take comfort in knowing that they aren't alone in the way they are feeling or thinking, maybe they are afraid to say it aloud or type it out, or just don't know how to word it the right way, even if it's in the anonymity of a bunch of strangers on reddit, if this applies to you, the best I can say is take it one day at a time, don't think about how many more are ahead, it will all end eventually.
