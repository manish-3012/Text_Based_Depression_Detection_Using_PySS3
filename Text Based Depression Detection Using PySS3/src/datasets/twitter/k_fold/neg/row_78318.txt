Behind the meme might be in riskThe youtube creator â€œbehind the meme â€œuploaded [three very concerning videos](https://youtu.be/9fQhj77xxbI) where he gets drunk, talks about the hate he got for uploading things he enjoyed making and drives (drunk) to somewhere that appears to be a bridge while sounding very depressed... I donâ€™t really know if these are enough sings of suicide thoughts but people are starting to get concerned including myself.

I tried using twitter to spread the word to other youtube creators but other than that I donâ€™t know how to help.
