I have suicidal thoughts every secondI think of how i might just be involved in a car accident and die everytime i am on the car,
Think about how I my death would bring peace to everyone,
But the problem is i have such a loving family, they dont know about my mental state, they have no idea how miserable i feel living. I self-harm with the hopes that i can release my misery, but soon after guilt follows me everywhere, all of societyâ€™s eyes on me. I am tired of putting up a fake front, i am tired of everything. I might do it pretty soon, Iâ€™m reaching a breaking point.
