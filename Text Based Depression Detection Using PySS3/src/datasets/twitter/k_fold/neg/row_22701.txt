I feel empty and alone, i just want someone to talk toEver since i was 12, ive had depression. After school one day, i told one of my friends that i was going to kill myself once i got home, which i had been planning for a couple days. she promised she wouldnt tell anyone, but when she got home she told her mum, whos friends with my mum. My friends mum texted my mum about it, and she started to beat me. My mum has this thing with reputation, so her having a suicidal daughter "hurt her reputation". Ever since then, i stopped talking to anyone about my problems. I would really like someone to talk to on here because no one knows who i really am.
