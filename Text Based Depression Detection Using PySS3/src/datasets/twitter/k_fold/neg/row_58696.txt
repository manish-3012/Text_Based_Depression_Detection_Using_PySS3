I'm drowning and no one will help meI'm failing college, I'm overweight, I have destroyed every relationship I have. I slice my thigh because I don't want anyone to know I cut myself. My boyfriend is the only one who knows and when he found out he told me I could never do it again but then just dropped the subject and never brought it up or offered help. He's a very happy person so he doesn't really understand the darkness that I feel. My parents are disappointed in my because they expected A's when I got to college and got C's and D's they remind me all the time how much money I'm costing them and how lazy I am. I despise the person I have become and I can't even stand to look at myself. I don't deserve my bf I don't deserve anything. I deserve to die. It's been about a year now that I have wanted to no longer live. I have googled methods, stolen razor blades from work, held pill bottles, but the truth is I'm a coward and I can't do it. As much as I blame my parents for my depression and anxiety, I can't bring myself to ruin their lives although I feel like I already have by being their daughters. I walk this earth like a zombie and I only feel joy when I am distracted from my thoughts. I don't know what to do anymore. I have asked my parents to give me space as well as my bf I told him to branch out and try to find new people because once he sees what's out there he'll realize he doesn't really want me. I wish he would just find another girl and end it with me. I don't deserve him and I lash out at him and he deserves better. Please someone help me.
