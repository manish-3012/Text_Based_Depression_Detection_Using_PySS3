My girlfriend is genuinely thinking about killing her self right now and me and my friends need advice on how to convince her not to end her own lifeJust tonight my girlfriend brought up to me that her phone had been taken away and her siblings were talking about anything they could to get her cut off from me and to get her in trouble and this is all after she was verbally abused by her parents and she was telling me things like "i could just go in the forest and no one would ever know" and "my parents would never tell you anyways" and I am absolutely terrified she is going to do something very soon if not tonight. She also told me thing like how she thinks she is worthless and that not even i would care if she died which is obviously not true so any advice on how to convince her not to end her own life is greatly appreciated!
