I don't know how to continue...I'm 20, for the last 10 years I have been dealing with depression,  as well as some anxiety and insomnia. I have spent most of my life without friends, they would often notice how depressed I am and make fun of me or just leave me. About a year ago to may of this year I have been less depressed as I found my first girlfriend, she helped me through the suicide of my uncle back in February and a death of another uncle at the end of April. She made me happy even though it was long distance and it was hard. At the beginning of may she broke up with me, my depression kicked in again hard and over the weekend she told me she never wants to talk to me again, I love her, probably the only person I truly love in this world besides the uncle who committed suicide. I don't know what to do. I feel so lost, alone, and much more depressed that I ever have been in the past. In the last 10 years I've probably attempted suicide once every 2-6 months and in the last 3 months I have been taken to the hospital and had a couple failed attempts. I just don't know what to do from here.
