So I'm here now..I don't have a good reason, I'm not even sure why I felt this way for the past five years.. Things have never really effected me, most of my life has been okay.. But somedays it's a stronger feeling then others and it's finally broke me I've never had a moment of weakness but I've finally told my SO how I've felt.. I'm not even sure how but yesterday was enough strees for this to be vaild in my eyes..

Sorry if this dosen't make sense to some, I'm not upset at least it never felt that way but I'm concered about it now.. I don't have many reasons left to be or not to be..
