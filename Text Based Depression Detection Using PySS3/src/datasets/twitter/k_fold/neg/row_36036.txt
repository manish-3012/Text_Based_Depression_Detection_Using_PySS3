my life is falling apartfor once in my fucking life it seemed like things were going well but just as i was succeeding it all goes to shit. my car breaks down. i can't afford to fix it. i probably won't be able to afford moving out of my abusive household. just blow after fucking blow. i don't have enough money to live comfortably and every time i feel bad i feel guilty because i am privileged to even have a house to live in. i'm just stuck in this fucking loop of pain and suffering. i hate living day after day because it's the same or worse everyday. i have anxiety, bipolar disorder, severe depression, insomnia, and my family ignores it all. the only clarity i have is when i'm with my therapist. i just hate living and every day is a chore. death just seems like a comfort. ill never kill my self but the thought is so appealing sometimes.
