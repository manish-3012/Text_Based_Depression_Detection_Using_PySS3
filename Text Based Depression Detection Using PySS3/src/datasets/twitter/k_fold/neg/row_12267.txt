I cannot go on like this.I can't. 

I wish I could just talk to someone. I wish there was anyone who could tell me what to do. But no one can. I have no friends. My family is a complicated topic on its own. Post on this subreddit went unheard, and there is only so much online people will listen to. I have a therapy appointment on Thursday, but that might be too late for me. Also, how much can you really achieve with one hour of talking?


I started cutting again. That's why I know my time is running out. I cannot go on like this. Something needs to change but I feel like I cannot change anything. 


I don't want to die just yet. But if the alternative is living, then I'd rather die right now.
