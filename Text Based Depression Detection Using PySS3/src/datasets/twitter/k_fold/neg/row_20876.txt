My therapist told me to call herWhen I feel suicidal again. Not because she cares about me apparently... 

Her exact words were: Because that's what pays my bills.

I'm glad that you get something out of people their calls. Sadly it's not the right thing for the right reasons. 

This makes me want to do it even more.
