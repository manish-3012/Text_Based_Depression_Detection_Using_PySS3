Suicidal geekFor months, no, for years I have thought of suicide.
It's an everyday thing for me to wish I was randomly killed, the quicker the better of course, you see, I don't have much of a life worth living, I hardly see anyone but my own reflection in the mirror, or a few relatives at the occasional family dinner..

 I believe in somewhat of an afterlife so I'm not that scared of dying. I'm scared that I won't be able to play video games in that life.. I'm a super paranoid person with lots of mental issues, I tend to fade into the virtual world to forget all my troubles but as soon as I turn off the console I'm in a hell called life. Loaded with paranoia.

So I'm on the verge of slitting my wrists, but I'm having a hard time letting go of my console.. I'll miss games so much... do they make ghost consoles? It sounds like a joke but it's my hobby and I love it. Is it worth living a horrible life so I can keep gaming or should I just end it and hope there's something interesting in the afterlife. Fml. 
Just needed to bomb these words down. Even if it sounds dumb.
