I am literally human garbageI have everything, a loving family and good friends and an amazing girlfriend. Still I'm so very unmotivated to do anything, I'm unemployed and too lazy to change myself. All i do is loathe myself, everytime i try something new i get scared feel enormous anxiety and want it to just end. I don't want people around me to be around the pile of garbage that i am, why am i like this and if I didn't have these people i would have killed myself long ago. I am a shitty human being that does not deserve this life while kids are dying. All i want is to die a horrible fucking death. I hate myself.
