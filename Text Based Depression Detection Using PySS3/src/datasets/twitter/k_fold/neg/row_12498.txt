The dreams keep getting worse...I've been having horrible dreams lately. I've dreamed about killing those closest to me, or torturing them. I don't want to do anything to hurt them but I'm losing control. And the only way I think I could stop myself is through means of suicide. I don't want psych ward bullshit or any kind of hospitalization. Just please tell me something to stop these thoughts and dreams before I end up hurting myself or others
