Can't go on, but too afraid to die.It's the same cycle over and over.

I can't seem to permanently improve my mind or life. At this point, the task seems too daunting. I don't want to or think I can put in the work. I'm afraid of almost everything. I can't face anything. I'm soft as charming in a world shaped by the jungle. 

It's so much easier to just opt out, but I'm too afraid to die thanks to hundreds of millions of years of evolution. 

Pete Davidson makes one IG post about suicide and every famous person ever wants to help him out now.

But nobody gives a fuck about us. Not in real way.
