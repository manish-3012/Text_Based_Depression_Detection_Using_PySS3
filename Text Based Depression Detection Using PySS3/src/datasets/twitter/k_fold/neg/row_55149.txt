Money problems....I'm overwhelmedI'm at the end of what has been a long, dark period.  Money problems have sent me spiraling into a deep depression.  I am trying to hold on for my son.   Just struggling to keep my head above water and out of this darkness.   I have been to therapists,  but it's been so hard for so long.  What to do??
