TherapistI see my therapist tomorrow. 

I want to know how to tell him how I feel without being committed. 

I am in daily pain. I spent today getting Medicaid back and freaking out that I couldn't get my surgery in time. I couldn't go to work today. For several hours today, I couldn't feel my dominant hand. I can barely eat normal food. I am emotionally in a space where I just don't want to be. 

I like my therapist. I trust him. But I cannot deal with being locked up without access to my medicine.
