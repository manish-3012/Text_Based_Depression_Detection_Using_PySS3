Angry as fuck - short ventI started this year so happy and hopeful, first week of uni was a breeze and I was starting to make friends and was really disciplined with my studies. But then I came down with a sore throat that hasn't gone away.

I haven't been able to talk or socialize with anyone for the last almost four months, I've been completely alone and isolated and locked up in my house for most of this time. I can't study because I just feel so depressed. I've seen a specialist and apparently I should be healed in the next few months, but it's taking too long, I've got four exams in the next week and I have done precisely 0 hours of study on any of them this entire semester. I'm so fucked.

This really pisses me off because if it wasn't for this sickness I would be fine. FUCK. I need a miracle to pass these exams but realistically I'm going to fail them, I can't focus and just procrastinate so much, even now posting this is just procrastination. Blahrhfhhfh
