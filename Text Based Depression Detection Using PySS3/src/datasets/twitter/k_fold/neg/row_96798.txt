I want to ask my mom to see a therapist but I don't have the guts to. (f14)Yeah, I know I probably have 1-2 mental illnesses and I've had at least one for 3 years now (some form of depression.) 

I really want to talk to her about it (and have for YEARS) but I just can't bring myself to do it. Guess I'll just suffer in silence for a few more years :D
