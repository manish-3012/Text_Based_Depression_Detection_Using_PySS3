As time goes on Iâ€™ve realized that none of my dreams and goals seem to be achievableWhen I was younger I had so many dreams of where I wanted my life to go. As I got older it it got more refined to what the world was like. And now all of the goals and dreams I once had arenâ€™t achievable in anyway. For where I want to end up in life it makes me have to change what I would want to do as a career, and if I were to change my career choice I would still hate it. There is no winning. I donâ€™t want to settle for something else and later in my life just be filled with regret. Iâ€™m tired of thinking about the future so much I dread thinking about each day coming. Iâ€™m ready to just leave it all behind.
