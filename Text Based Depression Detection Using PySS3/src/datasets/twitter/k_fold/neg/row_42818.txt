I feel like I have no controlIâ€™m 17, and I have bipolar disorder. I feel like I am my own worst enemy. I am constantly thinking about harming myself or others around me but I donâ€™t ever have the courage to just kill myself. I used to self harm a lot when I was younger, but now I either canâ€™t find the motivation to do it or I feel too many things at once to do it. When I say that, I mean it feels like Iâ€™m high, but not quite happy. I feel insane writing here. I have a constant message replaying in my head that is telling me to stab myself in the head but itâ€™s more because I want the thoughts to go away.  I want it all to go away. I donâ€™t have many friends because they canâ€™t handle the fact that I am almost two different people. Iâ€™ve seen therapists but they canâ€™t help because I have no root cause for being this way. I donâ€™t know what to do.
