I want to die.Iâ€™m 22 years old, found out my girlfriend of three years cheated on me 8 times. I have no direction in my life. Iâ€™m living in my sisters basement, unemployed due to covid. I feel like Iâ€™m just a walking corpse. My dad killed himself when I was 14. All of my friends have started to distance themselves from me just cause Iâ€™m always so low and down, stopped inviting me to things and barely talk to me now. I have nothing. Any day might just be my last. Itâ€™s 4am here and the right rope is getting thinner and thinner. I just want to die.
