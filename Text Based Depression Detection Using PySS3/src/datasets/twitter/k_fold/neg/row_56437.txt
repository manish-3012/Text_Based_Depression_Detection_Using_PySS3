I'm so lostMy parents recently found my stash of weed. They say that they will send me away and that I'm pretty much a disappointment. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a while now and I actually think they are right. I was smart when I was younger, had potential, but now I just feel empty and used weed to escape. I do pretty well in school but those grades no longer matter to me.

I can't find a passion for anything and life seems gray and useless. I'm this close to jumping out the window. My heart hurts deep down and I don't know if I can recover from my parents hating me. I feel useless and want to end it. The only thing that is stopping me is thinking about my brother and how hurt he would be.
