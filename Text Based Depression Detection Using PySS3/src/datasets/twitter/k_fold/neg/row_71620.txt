Goodbye forever.I suffer from an incurable, inherited disorder called trimethylaminuria. My life has been nothing but hell since my condition worsened at about 16 years old. 

I know that I should be grateful because unlike many other TMAU sufferers I am privileged and have been afforded the opportunity to just stay at home 24/7 so that I can avoid the stress of school or work. But the fact is that I love school, and obtained a 4.0 GPA before I dropped out of college.

I simply cannot accept living the life of a hermit/recluse/hikikomori for the rest of my life. So this is it. I really hope for a future in which people with medical body odour conditions are not discriminated against or better yet, cures exist so that nobody will ever have to go through the isolation and emotional pain and torture associated with severe body odour diseases.
