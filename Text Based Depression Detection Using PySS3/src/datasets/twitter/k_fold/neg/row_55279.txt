They only really care when you say you'll kill yourselfI've noticed this a lot in my life and from what I've noticed from other people online. Lots of people don't give a fuck about your mental health until you say you are going to kill yourself. Are you trying to balance a part time job, advanced classes in school while trying to repay the car you bought and plan your future while trying to maintain a social life and healthy sleep schedule and lifestyle? Well, just keep going, its not that bad. No work is too much work until you literally want to kill yourself. 


I think there is a big problem with everybody pushing eachother to go above and beyond at any cost except eachother's own lives. There is such a big atmosphere around grind culture, that everyone is trying to make it big, that you can do anything, just keep going keep going keep going. Then once you realize you can't keep going you feel like shit. All throughout elementary, middle, highschool, college, people were telling you that you should keep going, you'll get a great job, maybe be a millionaire, famous, influential. People tell you to go for that Master's degree, to work two jobs, to do absolutely everything, just keep hustling and grinding on and you'll make it. So once it becomes too much for you to handle, you haven't had any enjoyment in weeks, you don't have hobbies anymore, despite your best efforts you aren't making, they don't really care. People will keep pressing you on that you'll finish your degree soon, you'll get that promotion soon, just wait five years and you'll be in the Bahamas or something, you'll be able to ride off the rest of your years easily or accomplish something you've always wanted. 


Until you say you'll kill yourself they'll keep pushing you no matter what state you're in.
