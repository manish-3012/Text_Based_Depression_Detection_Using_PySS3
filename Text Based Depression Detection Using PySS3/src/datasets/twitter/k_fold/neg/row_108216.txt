Things just seem to get worseAt the end of November, my grandfather died. 

At the start of Janaury, my mother died.

At the end of January, my uncle died.

In February, I was kicked out of college because I can't afford it.


I tried to kill myself multiple times in February. It didn't work out, then in March I started planning.

I'm alone, no family, no friends, no one to turn to, &amp; I'm gonna lose my house soon enough. What do I do?
