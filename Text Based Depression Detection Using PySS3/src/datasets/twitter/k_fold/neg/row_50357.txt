Sometimes I really just don't knowLast night I took 30 wallgreens 50mg sleeping pills hoping that it would be it. Hoping that it would all just end right there. I had my note written, I had made peace with everyone and I was actually pretty happy w/ it as I eventually passed out. But then I woke up. I wasn't prepared to wake up and see today. Todays my 21st birthday and instead of being cheerful or  making plans to go out I'm sitting here and realizing how fucked everything is. I'm bipolar and the more aware of my condition I am the more I realize that I will never get what I desire. It's impossible for me to get married or have children because there's this side of me that always ruins everything I have going for me. I just lost my best friend the other day really my only friend because I wasn't able to let go of something in my past. I've grown so distant to just about everyone else and I see how it pains them but it's like I can't help it. There's college starting up soon but I just get all this anxiety about it and there's so much stupid paperwork and loans I have to get before the 22nd. I just honestly am not looking to fight anymore. Why struggle when your future isn't bright? I seemingly had just about everything I wanted and ruined it. Ruined it again. I tried to be optimistic about everything even deciding that maybe I could change my career goals and my social goals but that's ridiculous and I know i'll be just as maybe even more miserable. So I have this knife and I just keep looking at it but I don't know. Maybe I should later,maybe I should sleep.
