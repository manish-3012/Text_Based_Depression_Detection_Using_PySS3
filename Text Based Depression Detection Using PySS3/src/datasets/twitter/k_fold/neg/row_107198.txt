My head feels like a bucket of stonesIt starts off empty. Easy. 
I can lift this. I can put this back down if I need to.

A promotion. *dink*. A stone falls in the bucket. It's manageable. I can move. 

A new relationship. *dink*. Hmm, strange a stone would fall for that? But I can move.

A new house! Yes! Fina- *dink*. A big stone... Can I move?

A late essay. Under the word count. *Dink*. That was a big stone. 

A mistake at work. Big consequences. *DInk*

Poor body-image. Loss of appetite. Weight loss. *DINk*

Lack of sleep. More mistakes. Leave me alone. *DINK*

I run the water hot. I sit till I can stand. I push my bones against the side and feel the pain that make me feel real. 
*dink...*

The bucket of stones inside my head is full now. The bucket is too heavy, I can't lift this. But it's too heavy to put down. I can't put it down.

I need to tip the stones out. How do I tip the stones out, before it overflows.
