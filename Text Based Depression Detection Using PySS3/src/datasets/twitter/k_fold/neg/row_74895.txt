My entire life is falling apart and I donâ€™t have the energy to fix itIâ€™ve struggled with depression since I was sexually assaulted as a teenager by a family member, causing most of my family to stop speaking to me. Iâ€™ve had a lot of issues with drug and alcohol abuse. I finally got things turned around and was in college and doing okay, but my I lost my mom, who is my only surviving family member that I still speak to, to cancer. I just flunked out of grad school after spending the last of my savings on it and I have no idea what else to do. Life feels so meaningless and sad and I hate it.
