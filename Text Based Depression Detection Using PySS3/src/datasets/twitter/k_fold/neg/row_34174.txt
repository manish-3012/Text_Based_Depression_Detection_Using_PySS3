Can't forgive myselfIt's been about six months since I stopped smoking weed due to a horrible panic attack and following depression and anxiety. I took molly and a few days later had the worst panic attack of my life. Afterwards I took prozac for two months but that didn't help. I tried to get back to normal sans drugs but eventually gave up and got sertraline. I've been on that since early december increasing dosage until I got to 100mg. I've been on that for three weeks now. I can't remember anything, I can't feel emotions except for anger. I am going to fail out of college. I just can't forgive myself for taking drugs. Even if I get marginally better I will never be who I was. Every doctor I go to just says "it's depression take these". They don't work though because it's not just depression. It's brain damage and it's all my fault. Every day I feel dumber. I can't get homework done. I can't go out with friends due to my new anxiety and depression. I used to love life and now I hate myself because of this. I've opened pandora's box. There's no point in living if you have lost yourself and your sanity. I have lost it and it's all due to my young ignorance. Not everyone has a bad reaction to drugs but I did. I've disappointed my family and my friends. I'm in pain every day. I am constantly suffering. I just want to be me again. I just want a second chance.
