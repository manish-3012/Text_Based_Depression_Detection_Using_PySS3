17 years old. I feel like I'm right back to where I was.About a year and a half ago I was suicidal, but a friend convinced me to get help. I was prescribed Zoloft and began seeing a therapist. I got a lot better, and went from emptiness to being happy. I met a nice guy and we started going out. 

Last fall, I felt the Zoloft was no longer working and I was put on Cymbalta as well as a birth control.

I guess looking back I always knew the Cymbalta wasn't working. But the past few days-weeks it has gotten increasingly worse.

I'm suicidal. I skipped school today and drove around for two hours before coming to a Starbucks, where I plan to be till the library opens in a little less than an hour. I'm hoping becoming engrossed in a book will stop me from doing anything.

I've grown extremely clingy, so I broke up with my boyfriend about a week ago in order to try to become independent again. There were other factors in that break up, but I guess that was the main one. I'm pretty sure I drove away one of my best friends by thus clinging to him. I smoked last night and that helped I guess. I've tried working out but it hasn't done much. 

I used to look forward to the future. Now I don't really care. I just don't see a point anymore. I feel like a mess and I can't get things straightened out.
