Preparing for suicideIâ€™m planning to kill myself as soon as possible. However, before I do so, i need clarity on a few things.
I was wondering if the majority of your digital footprint will be traced and if I would need to clear it; should I clear my browsing history? Will my deleted history still be revealed or something? Should I be deleting my social media accounts and things like that? Will my family members look through my entire laptop and browsing history? As you can see, I really donâ€™t want my internet activity exposed.
Also, will all of my stuff be searched? (Including non-digital items like sketchbooks, notebooks, etc.)
I wanna know if some of my privacy is still reserved even when Iâ€™m dead. Sorry if these questions sound stupid. Iâ€™m not very intelligent.
