I just can't be botheredI'm (18M) about to finish the Swedish equivalent to high school this summer and as the title states, I just can't be bothered. Bothered to potentially go through college, look for a decent job and then grind until I eventually die. What's the point of going through the hassle, pressure, denial and whatever? 

I've been looking at careers I'm interested and how to get there but I always go back to the question - what's the point? Thinking about what the future holds just makes me exhausted.
