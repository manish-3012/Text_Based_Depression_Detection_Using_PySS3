Turned 19 years oldTwo days ago I turned 19 years old. I wasn't looking forward to my birthday, but still I wanted to be happy and enjoy the attention. However, for the very first time in 18 years it felt like it didn't matter to anyone and even worse it didn't even matter to me. 

I have been depressed for the past 4 years, having it in periods. The periods started with a few months at a time but the last period have been for over a year. In addition to that I feel anxious around people and I feel lonely most of the time, I frequently think about other people and what they are doing instead of actually getting out of my bed and do something myself.

I don't even know how I am, what I like to do or what I want to achieve in life because I rarely feel happy at all. I am 19 years old and it feels like I have no purpose in this world. Every night I cry myself to sleep, my heart aching and tears streaming down my face. Every morning I wake up and pretend I am fine, waiting for being able to cry in my bed again.

All I want is someone to love and feel loved by. Someone who understands me, because right now everyone feel like strangers even my own family and I just feel so lonely. I can't even see myself celebrating my 20th birthday. 

I just want to die
