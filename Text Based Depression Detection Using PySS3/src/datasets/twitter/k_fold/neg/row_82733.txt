Idealizing deathI hope this is the right place to post this.

Ive been having a really hard time in life lately.

My baseline has always been sad, and Iâ€™ve been like that as long as I can remember. Iâ€™ve always been high-functioning (e.g. leadership positions, good grades, good job, social at work, etc) but Iâ€™ve always had anxiety that prevents me from doing simple things like go to the store. Iâ€™ve thought about death since I was 11 or 12 years old. I finally sought help with a therapist after the longest time of being too scared to, and she diagnosed me with dysthymia and social anxiety. I only went to one appointment, then some big changes in my life happened and I havenâ€™t been back.

I was dumped by someone I thought Iâ€™d be spending my life with. I (M 24) have been in a few long-term relationships, and Iâ€™ve been through a few hard breakups, but this one feels different. Iâ€™m just numb. I lost my best friend - the person I would talk to every day. I was taking big steps forward in my life to advance my mental health, but I needed her by my side to help me and she left me. Now I have nobody to talk to and no motivation to seek therapy or take care of myself. I stopped buying groceries. When Iâ€™m not working, all I do is sleep.

Iâ€™m a healthcare provider in the U.S. in an ER and as you can imagine, Iâ€™ve needed a good amount of support for all the horrors Iâ€™ve seen (COVID aside). During the peak of COVID I dealt with so much death - patients and family, and the fact that people are out there denying its existence is so disheartening. Iâ€™m not ready for the spike of cases in the fall. I dont have the energy to continue. Beyond that, the state of the world (U.S. politics, global warming) has killed my hope for a happy future.

I donâ€™t think I would kill myself because Iâ€™m too scared, but part of me just wants to die. I want of wish I would just get hit by a car, get cancer, or something else out of my control. I know how selfish it sounds, but Iâ€™ve just had enough. Iâ€™ve felt alone for as long as I can remember, and I think Iâ€™ve finally had it.
