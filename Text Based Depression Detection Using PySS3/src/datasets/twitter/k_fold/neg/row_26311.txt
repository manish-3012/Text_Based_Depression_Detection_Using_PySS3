Only Reason Im Alive is SlothIâ€™d love to say â€œoh, Iâ€™m alive because im a fighterâ€ or some shit, but itâ€™s just because Iâ€™m lazy and fearful. Life is a hassle and so is death. I keep writing notes and making plans, but I just never follow through. Lifeâ€™s never been right for me, and I donâ€™t even care about the drama of it all anymore. I would hope to get hit by a car, but Iâ€™m agoraphobic and never leave the apartment. Somehow, this life is worse.
