this whole thing is fuckedleft a relationship of 3 years, no job, fucked off college so I only have 2 years of a CC under my belt, no future.

why do i keep telling myself shits going to get better, it doesnt. it's just different flavors of the same shit life keeps dumping out on my lap. i cant fucking handle this.

what is the point of living if every reason people tell you to live is something you fuck up at.
