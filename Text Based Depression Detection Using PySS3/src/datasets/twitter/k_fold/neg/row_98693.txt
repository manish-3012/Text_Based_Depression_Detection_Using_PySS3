I was in a car accidentI had a car accident 3 days ago. A drunk driver hit my car from behind. I swerved across the road and into the woods. 
I didn't hit a tree, there were no oncoming cars in that second. Change any minor detail and I'd be dead. 

For some people that's the moment that inspires them to turn their life around and appreciate being alive.

For me it did the exact opposite. I don't feel lucky at all. I don't even have anyone to tell about this.

When I told work I'm not coming in they told me to get a doctor's note and hung up.
Now, when driving I daydream about driving straight into the trees next to the road. I'm living life on autopilot even more than before. 
This is just so depressing idk
