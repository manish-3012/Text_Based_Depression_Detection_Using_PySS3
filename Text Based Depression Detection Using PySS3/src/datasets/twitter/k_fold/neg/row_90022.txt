Seems like nothing is gonna be alrightIt is a really long story..Id need to tell you all my life and my traumas so im just gonna cut is quick.
My parents want to divorce my dad swears,says bad things ,tells my mom to fuck off from the house, become a hooker and lots of things. He is abusive too, both mentally and physically. But..my mom doesn't have the money for a divorce. Lawyers ask for a lot... And even if they get divorced,my mom doesn't have a house here,i have an older sister in college,in another city. Im gonna go to college in 2 years and i need to get ready to my exams,private lessons and stuff and we..cant afford it without my dad cuz i know he's not gonna pay for any shit.I just want to die.. it's hard to breathe
