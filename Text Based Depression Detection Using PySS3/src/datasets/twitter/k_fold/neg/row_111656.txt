Robbed of my phone and now Iâ€™m locked out of my bank account.Photos of my family are just gone and now the thief is stealing the money that Iâ€™ve worked hard at minimum wage to earn. I really thought that the days would change. But they donâ€™t. It just keeps on getting worse. Iâ€™m a burden to my family, but my little brother depends on me. Is it alright to just leave?
