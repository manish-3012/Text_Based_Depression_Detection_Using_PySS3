If I don't find out what's wrong with me, I don't really think I want to live anymore.A super log story short, had weird neurological symptoms a year ago that went away on their own so I didn't bother seeing a doctor. Then back in October, I got mono and shortly after, those neurological symptoms returned. Got a brain MRI, found nothing. Got another one and they found an arachnoid cyst. Thought the cyst was causing my symptoms but turns out it wasn't. Doctor was thinking MS. Got a spine MRI which also came back normal. Every day, it feels like I'm getting worse. Even though the worst symptoms kind of flair up for a week or so and then decrease, there's been an overall steady increase of muscle spasms, pain, and severe fatigue. 

I'm so incredibly frustrated and sick of feeling sick. I'm afraid of people not taking me seriously. I want to scream when I call the receptionist at the neurologist's office. I want to punch the previous doctors I had seen in the face for blowing me off. I have legitimate neurological symptoms (that the neurologist observed) that can't be faked or just the result of being a hypochondriac. 

I hate this and just want answers. I feel miserable waiting and not knowing or even having suggestions on how to help my symptoms. I feel miserable. And then I feel selfish for feeling miserable because I know people who are seriously ill right now and actually dying. 

I'm stuck.
