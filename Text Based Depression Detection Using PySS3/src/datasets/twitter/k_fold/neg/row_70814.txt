I just can't deal with the fact that I have mental illnesses anymoreI just can't deal with it anymore. I have been diagnosed with bipolar, generalized anxiety disorder, and ADHD. In my teens I was diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features, but on the latest diagnosis I saw it wasn't on there anymore. I'm on 5 different medications, and I abuse my ADHD meds like crazy because it's the only thing I find that makes me feel good. 

I can't deal with the fact that I'm going to be taking medication forever. Or that almost nothing will help me feel better like exercise or diet like I had previously thought. I can't deal with the fact that I'll always be this way. And nothing will ever change that. This is no way to live. 

Since last Wednesday all I can think about is killing myself. It's always on my mind, I can't stop thinking about it. My family doesn't know how to deal with this, so I don't bother them. I've been hospitalized 3 times and I can't put them through that again. I just feel like there's nothing here for me anymore. There's nothing left for me to do here. I don't want to be here anymore. I have no hobbies, no interests. No friends. I dropped out of school. No job though I've been applying everywhere since the beginning of the month. I can't sleep well. I just feel that this world isn't for me. 

Thanks for reading.
