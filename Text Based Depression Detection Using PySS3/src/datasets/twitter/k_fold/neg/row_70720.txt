I learned there's a difference between why you would not commit suicide and why you want to live.Today I learned that my answer if how I wouldn't follow through on my thoughts because it'd traumatize my children forever having that story attached to their mother.  

That is not a reason to live.  It just keeps me from following through.  

Reasons to live would be stuff like looking forward to shopping for my daughter's prom dress with her. Looking forward to cheering in my kids as they walk the stage for their diplomas.  

Those are suggestions given to me. I am having trouble coming up with my own personalized list. Anyways... I post this here to hopefully give someone out there the same jolt of realization it gave me... 

I am not living, just being here isn't life. We can have more. We just have to fight harder for it.
