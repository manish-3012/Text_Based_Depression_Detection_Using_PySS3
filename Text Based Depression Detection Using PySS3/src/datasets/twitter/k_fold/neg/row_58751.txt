Probably the worst news i ever had received so farI may be having a curse hanging around me 
And having 2 choices, living a slow death or just a quick one

Have an eye freckle that sort of hurts oftentimes
Then consulted with a friend told me to watch it closely because it can go worst and kill me won't get anymore with the details since its horrifying. 

I am still in denial and hoping that its just a spot in my eyes

Had an afterthought and remembered how my parents and friends treated me when i was sick... 

My parents generally at first were in denial then blamed me for not taking care of myself then blames me even further for not being strong and blames me further down the line with a long list of things, when clearly i've been pushed to really life threatening limits that i get heavily medicated for to recover

Then hearing them arguing how it cost them since i am s deadbeat no good person...

Then overhearing them telling the doctor that i am not taking care of myself this is why i am sickly and being scolded horribly by the doctor and telling me that

 "do i have a deathwish ?? Why do i even do it ??? Do you want your parents to suffer"... 

Cried my eyes out badly on a good number of occasions...due to how unfortunate i am.  

The same with friends and relatives

And now come to think of it ?? 
I've lived a life helping people 
And nobody was there for me when i am in trouble.
