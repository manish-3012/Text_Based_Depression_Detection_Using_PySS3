Help me please.So I've been living with depression for 5 years now. I've never once had a real friend whom I could've share my  life with, reason being is because of my social ineptitude and lack of personality. I have trouble expressing myself in social situations and therefore tend to stay quiet and since I've lived most of my life in solitude I can barely even speak with my parents anymore. 

My dad is depressed and speaks of how life is meaningless and I don't blame him even though my mother scolds him for it. I'm part of the reason why he's sad, he hates his job and knows how miserable my life is. All of this fuels my self hatred and and depression even more knowing I'm the cause of my dads existential crisis and not being able to do anything about it. My life is not worth living yet I cannot take my life because it feels selfish.

Recently I experienced the most self hatred I've ever felt and it was at the moment I just wished my parents would die so that I could end my life guilt free. I'm at a loss what should I do? I don't want theraphy because I feel like it's too late for that after having realized through years of contemplating that life is truly meaningless and no one can convince me otherwise, neither do I want a friend proposal since it would only be out of pity and lead to you leaving me because you got bored of me as everyone in my life has.
