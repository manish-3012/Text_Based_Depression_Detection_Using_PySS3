Why?Unemployed for the last two years. Only potential job offer during that period (seasonal food service job) spoiled due to chronic alcoholism. Just lost my last couch to crash on. Just defaulted on all my credit cards. Cell phone shut off. Disowned by family for not being Mormon. $17.28 cash $18,000 in debt. About to be sleeping on the streets again. I've collected more in food stamps than I've ever paid in taxes during my years of wage slavery. I'm a net loss to society. Why shouldn't I kill myself? Using old novelty account for obvious reasons.
