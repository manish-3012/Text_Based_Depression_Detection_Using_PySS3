couldn't kick away the stooltoday was my birthday. it feels unreal, but then again everything feels unreal. 

been acting like a dick to the people at those suicide lifelines. all they do is repeat what i say and go 'it sounds like you're having a hard time. it takes strength to go through that.' no it doesn't. we don't call people who get the shit beaten out of them strong, we call them unlucky. might as well chat with a brick wall.

decided to do it today, because it seemed fitting enough to go out on my birthday. i tied the rope laying in bed while my dog dozed off at my hip. felt guilty. he's already been abandoned and traumatized once, i can't kill myself with him in the room. i thought about making him leave, but that wouldn't change the fact that i abandoned him. 

i wouldn't have done it anyway. too much of a pussy.

the person i show other people couldn't be any more misleading if i tried. i honestly had the audacity to tell my sister i was feeling optimistic about the future. what a fucking liar, not even five hours earlier i had a poorly made noose for a necklace. i wouldn't even be able to be honest in my fucking suicide note. i'm just a fool dancing around trying to please people and put on a nice little facade because the truth is, i don't have any sense of identity. i'm so gone, it's insane how this disorder can strip away my very own sense of self. dpdr is a fucking bitch.

i want to tell my new therapist i'm not even remotely okay, tell her i'm suicidal so they throw me into the loony house again. maybe i'll get sent to residential this time. maybe i won't pretend to be okay this time.

nah, i'm too full of shit. but i'll clear my room of everything i'm ashamed of, just in case my parents come to collect my stuff.
