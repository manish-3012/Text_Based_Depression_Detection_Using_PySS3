Will nurses at the hospital tell my parents about my scars?So I really don't know where to put this, please tell me if it doesn't belong here and where I can put it if so. But anyway, basically what's going on is, I just came back from the doctor, about my breathing problems, and he said i'll be needing surgery on my nose. Which I'm fine with, that's great, I'll be able to breathe.

The problem comes in because of my self harm scars on my thighs. They are very visible, and I was just wondering if any of you knew if the nurses are going to tell my parents about it, or if you are a nurse yourself and know.

My parents don't know about them, they're just messed up people and will definitely kick me out of the house, take all my electronics forever and treat me like a stranger, or both take everything and then kick me out. 

I'm going to have to wear the hospital gown, and it's open so nurses can access and help me and I want to know if they're obligated to at least ask my parents if they know about it, I've been freaking out over this for 20 minutes now. Thanks to anyone who can help.
