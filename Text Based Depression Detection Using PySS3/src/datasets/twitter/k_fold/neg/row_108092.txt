It's been 14 yearsI don't want to post this but I have no where to turn to the feelings stopped at age 12 no happy no sad no hate no pain no emotion just dull empty nothingness I failed at 14 and thought I was in a phase IV over dosed 7 times from then till 19 at 19 I wanted to jump but got pulled from the bridge by my soon to be wife it's been 7 years since that night and as much as I say I don't want to end it I do the thought has always been with me it's my darkest secret apart from one other thing my point is i think it's time I just wanted someone to know I guess if my pathetic attempt fails again I guess I'm not ment to do it but all I know is sobriety is going out the window and if all goes well so will the breath in my lungs. 
I love you AKMA you are a star a diamond and a goddess I hope one day you forgive me x
