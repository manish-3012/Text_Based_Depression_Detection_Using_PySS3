I don't like myself.Hey, This is the first time I've ever made an account or posted on Reddit. I need someone to talk to though. I don't have many friends in real life or on the internet. all day I find myself not wanting to get out of bed. Not wanting to be a functioning member of society. Over the past year everything in my life has fallen down and today was the final straw. I legitimately don't think I can ever be happy. I haven't eaten in about two and a half days (No Exaggeration) I've mutilated my arm to bits. I don't want to have to go back to drugs just to feign happiness like I did for a bit. the only person who ever gave a damn about me told me to go to hell. I've been on antidepressants and Bipolar medication since I was 16 but my Ex-Girlfriend (Who told me to go to hell) told me I wasn't allowed to take them. I guess that might be a lot to read, I don't even know what I am doing. I guess long story short.. I'm in emotional pain, I want to kill myself and have started a lot of self mutilation and I feel like a bad person.
