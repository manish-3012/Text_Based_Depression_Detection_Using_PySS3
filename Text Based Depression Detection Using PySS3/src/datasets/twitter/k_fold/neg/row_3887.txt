Debating on leaving this worldI have never been in a darker place in my life. I am 20 years old, and I am really debating on taking my life. Suicidal thoughts have been a challenge I have faced from a young age. I have huge attachment issues due to being adopted, and have always avoided getting attached to girls. I fall in love and I canâ€™t take it when it happens. Well it happened, and I took the girl to NYC for New Years and I got rejected. I have never felt more empty, alone, and sad. I donâ€™t know if I can take it. I have avoided falling in love for 5 years. And I didnâ€™t want this to happen. But it did, and I took a risk and got my heart ripped out and crushed. I canâ€™t take the pain this time. I have no one to turn to on this. Really donâ€™t know if I can do it this time. Maybe goodbye.
