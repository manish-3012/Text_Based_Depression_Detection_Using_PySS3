I have no more energyMy uncle committed suicide less than a month ago.  I remember at the time just feeling so shocked and wishing that I could have provided him with more comfort.  Even after going through all of that, all of the emotions that are tied to that, watching the aftermath, I just canâ€™t help but wish I were right there with him.
Just going through a new transition in life and see no end to my misery.  It seems like Iâ€™ve been working towards this one unattainable goal forever, and at this point I just feel too fucking old that I might as well throw my hat in the ring.  Iâ€™d rather die than live one more moment on this world with a dream unrealized.  Yeah, I know, a lot of people donâ€™t get that luxury.  This is one way for academia to weed people out: continue telling them no until they decide to kill themselves.  I'm tired of having no value.
Be good.  I hope someone gets to contribute to the world in a way that I never could.
