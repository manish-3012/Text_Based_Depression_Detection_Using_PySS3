Thinking about ending itim 20, about to fail out of university, for the past year ive thought about killing myself every single day

Im a polisubstance abuser who can't stop taking everything. These past 2 weeks I have been blacked out/in psychosis the whole time from an enormous PCP binge.

and the previous year I have been abusing OTC cough medicine among basically every other drug every day.

I feel mentally slow, ive started stuttering, I have forgotten how to do basic stuff, and I have no real/meaningful memories from the past year, just nothing at all. 

Monday this week I was going to kill myself but fell asleep beside the tracks instead of on them after a huge oral dose of pcp, I called the suicide hotline 2 times and close friends but I still cant get the thought out of my head.

I will update in a day or 2 on my situation. I wonder if ill finally get a rest
