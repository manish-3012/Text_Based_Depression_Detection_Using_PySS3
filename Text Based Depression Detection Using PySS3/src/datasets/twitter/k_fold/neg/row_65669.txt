Itâ€™s been a whileContemplating suicide again, itâ€™s been about a year since I last thought about it. Itâ€™s really surprising since there really wasnâ€™t any trigger at all. I just woke up angry and disgusted at myself. I try to think about the people who would be sad if I did it, but in all honesty I just donâ€™t care how they would feel. Iâ€™m inherently a selfish person, Iâ€™m in this for me not them. I have to go to work in a couple hours, but it all just feels so pointless, it feels stupid to go.
