Had a break down at workMy break down at work was the worse one I have ever had I have bipolar depression and it hit me like a truck I had to avoid people and try everything not to cry like a bitch I even went to places where no one could see me to hit thing to keep my self angry so I wouldnâ€™t just break down this was the closest I have been to wanting to die and idk what made it happen if I was at home that night I would not be here today I havenâ€™t told anyone about this but I need to get it off my chest
