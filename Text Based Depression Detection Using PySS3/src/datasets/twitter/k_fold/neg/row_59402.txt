im a fucking grown ass man and i feel like a 14 year old. what the fuck is wrong with me.i hung out with this girl today who i've been on a couple of dates with. im not going to type a lot because i don't have the energy. i'm 20 years old, been living on my own for almost 2 years. i hung out with her and went in for a kiss, she backed off and basically said she wasn't ready to be involved with anyone and maybe it might happen in the future.

im so sick and tired of rejection. i dont know if i'm just physically hideous or my personality stinks of fucking failure. 

i used to use lots of heroin and had lots of suicidal thoughts and a few attempts, but ive been clean for 16 months and im on antidepressants.

i have a loaded gun which i honestly probably shouldn't have.

not thinking about getting a fix but i am considering what putting one of these hollowpoints into my skull would feel like, and if my mother would ever get over it.

fuck me why am i so fucked up in the head why cant someone just like me for me?
