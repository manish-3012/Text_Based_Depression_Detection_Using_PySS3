Nothing good ever happens to me.I swear I have the worst luck in life. Every year is just one more thing outside of my control to ruin everything Iâ€™ve built up from the last fall. 

I feel like Iâ€™m in quicksand, I reach for a branch to help me get out, but that branch snaps and I sink lower and try looking for a new branch to grab, only to find that one snaps as well. I now feel Iâ€™m sunk so deep, thereâ€™s nothing I can do to pull myself out.

Even with all my troubles, a part of me believes life has a way of balancing out. Everyone goes through bad times and then they bask in good times. But Iâ€™ve never had â€˜good times.â€™ I donâ€™t dwell on things as much as I like, because thereâ€™s always someone who has it worse. 

But Iâ€™m breaking. Iâ€™m sinking.

I just wish that I could have some luck, some opportunity. But Iâ€™m all alone and Iâ€™ve never asked anyone for help. I canâ€™t rely on anyone, Iâ€™ll probably just drag them down with me. 

I feel like my head is barely sticking out of the quicksand and soon it will be too late for me.
