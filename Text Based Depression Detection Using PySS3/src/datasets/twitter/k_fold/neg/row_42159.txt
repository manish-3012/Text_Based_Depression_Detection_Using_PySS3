Honestly, why botherProbably gonna regret posting this on my main, but oh well. 
I don't see a point in living at the moment. Everyday is the same. Eat, work, sleep, repeat. It's an endless cycle, and I hate it. I literally am down to my last Â£5, and don't see any reason to start the cycle again tomorrow. All because I'm broke, and that wasn't even my own fault.
So, this might be it. I'll check in in the morning, if I'm still around.
