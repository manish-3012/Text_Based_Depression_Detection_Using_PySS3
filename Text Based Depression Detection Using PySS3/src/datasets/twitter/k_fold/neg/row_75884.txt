(x-post r/depression, hoping to get some extra help?) I'm so fucking tired and fed up with everything in this bullshit lifeI am so fed up with everyone and everything. I'm strongly considering suicide and just being done with this life. I posted this a while ago 
&gt;
&gt;It all started since before I was even born. My family was composed of my brother, my sister, my dad, and my mom. They were all happy and full of joy. However, once my mother got pregnant with me, my dad advocated for an abortion. My mom refused, and my dad began to produce an affair. Years later, my dad divorces my mother, and makes her in a terrible financial situation.
&gt;
&gt;Now, in present times, my brother and sister blame me for our family splitting up(rightfully so..) and my mother has grown to hate me, too. Every other weekend I have to visit my dad and the stupid whore he lives with. They all hate me, and they aren't scared to show it.
&gt;
&gt;Every weekend, I can't wait for the school week to start. At least there, people don't know how much of a life-ruiner I am. My cross-country team and classmates like me more than my family does. My mother calls me a retard and a useless shit every day, even though I get straight A's in all of my honors classes and take care of the house more than she does. My school thinks of me as a productive member of society, and I wish I could just stay there the entire year. Every moment at home seems like it was designed to ruin my life, and I'm not sure how much longer I can take it.
&gt;

This very morning my "friend" called me a fag and a cunt to my very face and a few other "friends" agreed. I've never felt so low and degraded in my entire life. I'm sick and tired of feeling like bullshit EVERYWHERE I go and I'm just fucking tired of home and tired of school and tired of this life.
