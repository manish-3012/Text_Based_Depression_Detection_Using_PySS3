I just want to be worthy of love.Man... i feel like a fucking wreck. Gf us resenting me because I've been so slow to improve myself and now I'm just trying so hard but the damage is done. She's not leaving me,  but she needed to open our relationship to get a spark going. 

I feel... so bad.  Like I've taken her for granted all these years and I just want to curl up and die. I just want to be a person she's excited to see, but now I'm just crying at work quietly.

I'm finally seeing a therapist on the 30th and that's something I've been needing to do for the better part of a decade... but I fear it's too little too late.  I feel lile I'm an unlovable asshole and a useless pile.

I just... need her to believe I love her and want to stop hurting. Every day I feel like I'm becoming a danger to myself. 15 days is so long.
