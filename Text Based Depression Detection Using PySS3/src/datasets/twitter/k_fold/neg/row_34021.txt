I have too many problems to overcome.I've just got back from an orthodontic appointment in which I was essentially told that I was clinically ugly.  I was told that my jaws are under developed and that even with surgery there might not be much of a change. I've always felt and been told I was ugly but to have it medically explained hit hard. 

But this is just the latest of my problems.  I have had severe depression since childhood,  I get horrible migraines that strike at random,  low self esteem, anxiety,  BDD, I was bullied, had no friends growing up, kept myself totally isolated for 15 years, and then had a string of abusive friendships,  I have no education beyond high school,  never had a real job, my girlfriend doesn't want to sleep with me, I can't leave the house without being crippled by insecurities,  I'm trying to keep fit but only picked up several injuries,  I've got medical issues that no one can explain or treat. The list goes on and on, I'm 30 years old and it feels insurmountable,  I keep thinking about just giving in and killing myself and every time I do it feels a little bit more right. 

I can't cope with life anymore, I know it's not going to get any better and I want to die.
