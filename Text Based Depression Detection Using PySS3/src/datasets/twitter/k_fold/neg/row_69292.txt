I have no friends and no one to talk toMy first bout of depression made me seriously isolated and I now have no friends and no one to talk to. I know how much it would hurt my family, especially my mom and sister if I killed myself but I honestly canâ€™t take being inside my own head anymore, I need relief. I also feel bad because I feel like so many people on this sub have huge problems and mine seem small in comparison, and I canâ€™t even handle those well enough to cope. I think iâ€™m gonna just set a date and be done with it.
