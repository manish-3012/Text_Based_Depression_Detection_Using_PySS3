Advice on how to help a friend who is suicidal?Hello, I have a friend who I believe may be suicidal or at the very least extremely depressed. She posted something that could be interpreted as a countdown in her social media. The reason it raises some red flags to me is that something awful happened to her recently. She has been known to be vocally bored, lonely, and would sometimes get drunk in the middle of the day. How should I approach this situation?
