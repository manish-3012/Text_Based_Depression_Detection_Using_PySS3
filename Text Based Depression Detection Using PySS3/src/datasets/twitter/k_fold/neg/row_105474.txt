What should I do?Hi. Im 14 and my name is AnaÃ¯s. I have been depressive since as long as I can remember and even though I had thought about death for a long time and never thought i would consider ending my life, I now often find myself wishing I was dead, looking for razor blades just in case, and I wish for a fatal disease on every occasion I have to make a wish. I have to fight against my will to jump in front of a car every time I walk in the streets, and I imagine my head exploding everytime I do something stupid. Etc etc
I have been thinking about getting help for about a year, but I never actually did it. What I need right now would be a pause from my family and friends and well, my everyday life. I am getting worse and worse and I have many questions I have no one to ask. If I go to my school's counsellor, does she have to tell my parents about my condition? Should I go to the school counsellor or directly to an ER? My parents will know anyway, won't they? As I am in a special program in school I might lose my place in it if I miss too much school but it is getting harder to work and my grades are droping.
