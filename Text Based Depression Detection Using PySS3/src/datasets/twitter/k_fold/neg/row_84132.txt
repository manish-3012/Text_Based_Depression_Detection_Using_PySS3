Maybe I won't wake up...Ok, got 450mg diamorphine loaded up in my syringe, 300mg pentobarbital and 200mg temazepam for sedation ready to go. The addict and miserable person in me wants to do it all but the survivor in me wants to space it out. Now I don't know if I'll float away into nothingness or if I'll wake up on my floor again so we'll see. For now I'm gonna eat some food and jam Tame Impala. I do have a terminal illness so it's not a "poor me I'm sad" cry out, it's a serious life decision I have to deal with.
