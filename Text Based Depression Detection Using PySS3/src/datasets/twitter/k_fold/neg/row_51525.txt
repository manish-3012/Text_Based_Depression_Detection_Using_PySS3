Never thought I would post hereBut here I am. I've been dating this girl for a while now and it's been the best months I can remember. Today she said it was nice that we tried but that she didn't want to do it anymore.

Fuck man, this feels ten times worse and came way earlier than I thought. Thanks for reading
