My friends think i'm weak.. no one is for real (15 y/o male)So today i was feeling really depressed and i tried talking to my friends about it. Instead of them trying to cheer me up they all took turns calling me weak and that i need to "grow a pair"  and that I am a problem because I talk to them about my problems. It's funny because they all always come to me with their problems and I every time help them 100%. But when i'm feeling down, the world blows up? It's like no one can be genuine friends.
