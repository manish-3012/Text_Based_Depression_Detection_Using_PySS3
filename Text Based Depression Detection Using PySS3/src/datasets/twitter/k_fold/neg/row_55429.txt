no direction and no desirehi, 23 year old male here. i have no idea what i want to do with my life and it is driving me insane. i don't have any desire. i think for guys like me, death is my only option. everyone else has desire and a direction. the reason i 'need' to have a direction is because my family doesn't want me to be a pathetic piece of shit. this world is ridiculous
