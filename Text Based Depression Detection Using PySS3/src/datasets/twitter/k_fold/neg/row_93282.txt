What's wrong with meEveryday, every hour I feel this part of me that wants to be done with all of this. It doesn't matter how I feel, or how my life is going. It's always there.

In my happiest and calmest moments there is still something in me that reasons I need to do this and remove me from this world.

I'm just so tired and worn down by spending the last several years being constantly so afraid of myself that I can't get anything done anymore. What's wrong with me, why can't I ever let this thought go.
