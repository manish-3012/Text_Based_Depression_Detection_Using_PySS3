My story.Hi everyone. Iâ€™m not going to go into a lot of details about me, but Iâ€™m going to say as much as matters, possible.

So Iâ€™m 15, born and raised in Dublin Ireland. Lived a normal life until I was about 12. I developed a severe phobia of vomit up until I was 14. I missed a lot of school over this and still do, to this day.

I am on the dole. (Basically welfare) so no one in my house works. My family is the most supportive people I have right now and they mean the world to me.

This year I was hit in the face about 6 times and kicked by a adult. This has been resolved criminally but not mentally.

I have severe paranoia that people are out to get me and on top of that I have severe unresolved gastric problems.

My life is going downhill right now and Iâ€™m just thinking about ending it.

As clique as it sounds Im really considering it right now. Iâ€™m not crying or sad Iâ€™m just generally fed up,

TLDR: Have severe health and trust problems and depressed.
