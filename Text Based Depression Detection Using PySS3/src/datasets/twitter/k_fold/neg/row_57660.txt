I donâ€™t feel like thereâ€™s a point of living.Iâ€™m almost 21 years old and still lack all basic social awareness. All my coworkers hate me and I feel that Iâ€™m a huge burden on everyone I care about. Iâ€™m transgender and canâ€™t afford to transition. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because I donâ€™t want to traumatize my family and boyfriend.
