Not now but in the futureI know, odd for someone posting here to talk about the future but I am. Now I know this will be scrolled by and if read, quickly forgotten but I wanted to share a fear of mine. Of being married and having kids and being just as sick as I am now. I'm bipolar 2, no I have bipolar 2. Whatever. My mom has it too. I remember one night of waking up to her screaming incoherently about something and blaring music. Cut to 16 years later, I'm doing the same thing. I don't want my kids to see that. But I don't want them not to have me. I dunno. Thanks.
