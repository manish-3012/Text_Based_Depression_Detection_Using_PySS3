My only goal in life is to kill myselfIt's not even a question whether or not I'll do it. It's a question of when. 

Why's everything so fucking shitty goddamn

Fucking bang my head against a wall, crack my head open and whisk my brain why don't you? That'd be nicer than living.

We all know we're fucking pain in the ass. Nobody cares about us really. Some of us don't care either I suppose.

I don't wish to be saved I'm just tired of having this monologue in my head so I wanted to put it out there.
