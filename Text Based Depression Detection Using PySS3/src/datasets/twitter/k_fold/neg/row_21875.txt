I want to die. I want her to die. I'm just no good.I found myself texting a friend that I wished my sister would die. They then proceeded to yell at me. Rightly so I suppose. I'm a miserable human being. I don't care if it's wrong to say such things. I used to have everything and now I have nothing. It's all my fault. I'm just bitter because she has all of my friends now. My ex loves her more than I now. I've always held some resentment towards her but now it's peaked because of this last year. I'd be happy to die as well. Just pick someone Carl Sagan. Me or her. I don't want to have to think of her again. I'm a terrible person I know, but nothing can be done. My heart is dead. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die.
