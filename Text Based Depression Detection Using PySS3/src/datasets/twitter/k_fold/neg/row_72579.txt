I called a suicide hotline and they hung upI'm worthless; no one cares about me. I'm so disposable. 
Last night I tried killing myself with sleeping pills and alcohol. I was going to drown in the bathtub. I fell asleep and should have sunk, but didn't. I woke up cold and just wanted to be warm, so I went to bed. I'm about to hang myself because it's not getting any better and it just hurts so much. I tried anything and everything. Something to just see if I was worth anything. No one cares. I called a suicide hotline and they hung up. Now I'm done. I'm so done. I'm going to hang myself.
