I feel worthless and isolatedI don't even know where to start or if this is the right use of this subreddit (apologies in advance)... so I suppose just some points to start with:

* I'm in my early 20's
* Lost my job and have been struggling to find work 
* I live on my own 
* I feel like I'm driving everyone close to me away 
* I have 1 close friend but I feel like I'm always letting them down. She tells me I'm not but I know things have changed. She's a second year med student with her own issues so I feel like all I do is add to her troubles... 
* All of my family is in another state
* All I want is to be a part of something but I'm a bit introverted and have terrible social anxiety... 

I just feel like I've let my family down and everyone close to me I've either driven off or don't care enough to bother. I live in an empty and quiet house... I don't think I'd ever commit suicide, I know it's a terrible thing to do and I know it would hurt my family... just some nights especially lately I've just thought "What's the point?". I'm alone and just causing trouble for the people around me..

Sorry if I'm rambling a bit..
