"If you're REALLY transgender you should come out!!" NO. Fuck you and fuck anyone else who ever told me that. I've been bottling up my dysphoria for *5 goddamn years* and you know what I got in return when I finally came out to my mom? *Jack fucking shit.* I was told that if I changed genders it would be like "losing a child" and that "I don't care about how it will affect everyone else." Because it fucking shouldn't! If calling me he/him and referring to me by different familial words like son and nephew is that much of a fucking struggle then I was never my mom's child in the first place.

For YEARS my transphobic ex belittled me and called me a trender for not coming out to anyone. This? This shit right here? This is fucking why. I'm sick of everything. I feel like I crossed into an alternate universe where everything went to shit. It feels like a bad dream. I don't want to be here anymore. I hope my ex fucking chokes to death on her own goddamn blood. Because I knew this would happen. My mom backed me into a corner and forced me to fess up about what I was crying about after having another dysphoric episode and I finally spilled the truth. I wish I hadn't. She can hardly *look* at me now.

Anyone who ever said I was doing this for "attention" and to be "trendy" can eat shit from the jar with a dessert spoon. You think I wanted this? You think I asked to be born this way? Because I'm really starting to fucking wish I wasn't born to begin with. I'm sick of having to push my own happiness aside for people I don't give a shit about. I don't care if I get disowned at 18. GOOD. IT'S WHAT I FUCKING WANT. JUST PULL THE TRIGGER ALREADY YOU GODDAMN SADISTIC WHORE.
