i'm so tiredI'm having a difficult time and i need to get a few things written down here because i don't want to vent at my friends anymore.

to preface this; I tried to kill myself in June and got hospitalized for a week. I got diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (depressed type) and I'm going to community college and living from home, before the incident I was going to university and living in the dorms.

also, please don't make fun of me, but I'm trans (nonbinary, i.e. not a boy or a girl just neither) and my parents are pretty transphobic. they refuse to use my chosen name/pronouns even after I've tried to explain it to them over and over again, they don't want to listen and they get upset at me for trying to talk about it and it's been two years since I first tried to come out to them. Because of this living situation I'm just really upset a lot of the time. i spent 4 years of high school praying to be able to get out of this house and express my identity/independence as a person and now I'm stuck here for another few years unless I come across a large amount of cash to move out (i'm working part time but with college classes i don't have enough time to earn the money i would need anytime soon). I know it's foolish, that i should be grateful to have a roof over my head and food to eat and even medicine/therapy but i'm just so tired of feeling trapped in this place and I just want everything to be over. I don't even know what's stopping me at this point and i'm tired of living every day wishing i had killed myself in june. i'll be fine tonight but i'm just exhausted

thanks for reading this
