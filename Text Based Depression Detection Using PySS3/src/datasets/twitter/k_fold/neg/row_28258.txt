I just felt myself snapI have to pretend to be happy in order to keep my boyfriend happy. 
He told me he "doesn't enjoy" that I talk about my suicidal thoughts and when I have my really bad emotional days. 
And as soon as he said that I instantly started smiling, I told him I didn't want to talk about my problems anymore and I want to do something else. I FELT that shift, it scared me. 
I felt all my anger and hurting disappear and this fake happiness come through. But I must do it to make him happy, I have to. 
I love him.
