How can I help?I found out yesterday that my little sister tried to end her life. Thank God she failed.  We are nine years apart and we've never been really close, but I love her and I'm devastated. We are not just divided by age, but also by geography. I'm hurting for her. I'm hurting for our family. I'm hurting for her husband and her three children. My hurt can't possibly compare with hers. I wish I could take the pain away from her. From our parents. I feel helpless.
