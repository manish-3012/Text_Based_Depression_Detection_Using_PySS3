Coping with loss of entire family. I feel nothing, but like I have nothing to live for either. Is this a sign of suicidal idealization, or a risk for it?I'm mostly out of a level of stress trauma that makes me non-functional. It was one of those bizarre life circumstances where several people in my family were egotistical, sociopathic, (and possibly psychopathic) drunks. Other than my mother and maybe a few cousins, they were all heavy drinkers. 

They met their own demise drunk driving with other family members in the vehicle, but on separate occasions. The incidents were not that far apart. Just by a few months.

I find I don't want to be around people much but I don't feel that sad either. Is it normal to not feel much, but still be grieving in a way when you've lost your entire family, but in losing them you realize just how abusive they were after the fact too?

Is something wrong with me for having this reaction, despite dealing with ptsd over it to a point sometimes too? 

I have no living relatives anymore. I'm basically an orphan. I don't think I know how to grieve this, or feel like there is nothing proper to grieve- just dealing with trauma triggers better, or living in ways that avoid them, which is fairly isolated.
