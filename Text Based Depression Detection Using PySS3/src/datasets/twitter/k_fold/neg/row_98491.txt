I donâ€™t remember how it feels to be happyI havenâ€™t felt happy in a long time, any time I havenâ€™t felt deeply suicidal has only been a temporary distraction, Iâ€™m tired of using sex and alcohol to distract myself from how much darkness I feel, I want it all to stop and I donâ€™t want to take anymore. I want to finally do one selfish thing and take my life into my own hands, so I can finally do something that I know will make everything okay
