I wrote a little program that sends a text message to my parents and loved ones just after I kill myself.The plan was. On 8 AM 5/10/2019, I would go out of my house. Take the bus. Go to the highest bridge in my area and jump and drown myself. 5/10/2004 is my birthday. I thought it would've been nice to die the day I was born.  At about 8:30 AM my family and friends would receive the text that I killed myself and I wrote a short little will or note of the reasons that I killed myself for, and the things that I wanted to happen after my death. I then realized that what I'm doing was a very big sin in my religion (Islam). And that if I actually did it and killed myself I would've been in eternal hell. And the other reason why I thought second thoughts was because of how it would affect my family mentally and how my disappearance would affect them. The main reason why I thought about committing suicide is because of how I don't fit in this world. I have trouble understanding people and talking to them. I can talk normally and everything and my physical and mental health are good as far as I know. So no mental illnesses here or anything (autism etc.). I was just very introverted and alone. No girlfriend. No one to talk to. No one to relate to. Every time I tell anyone about my problems they go away and tell me that I'll man up and get over it. I'm 15 after all. My birthday was 4 days ago. No one knew about this. So no one suspected anything. I wore the big fake smile on my face again and my tough manliness look and just got through my birthday with my friends and family. Knowing that this morning I could've been dead in a river. I may still be depressed, but I have no will to kill myself anymore. I just don't want to feel alone again.
