I really think I'm going to do it soonI'm going to start cutting off friends and people I love soon I don't feel as bad. I really want things to get better. I really do, but I don't think they will. I've been hoping they will for over 2 years now. They'll get a little better, but then get bad again. It's an endless cycle. I'm sick of it. I feel defeated. I have so many reasons, I don't wanna type out my whole story, but anxiety is a huge reason.
I already have my plan. If things don't get a WHOLE lot better real soon I'm doing it
