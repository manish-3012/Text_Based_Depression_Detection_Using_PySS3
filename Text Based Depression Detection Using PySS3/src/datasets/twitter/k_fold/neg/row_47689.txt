I want to kill myself but why can't I :(I've posted here several times. Since the first time I posted, things haven't been better. This shit has no "rock bottom". It's endless. I've been imagining my lifeless body with a cable around my neck every single day, every waking hour for maybe a month. I think of nothing else. I have completely withdrawn from my friends. My mother only talks to me to tell me every bad thing happening to our family is my fault although I haven't said a thing to her in a month. Istg if I don't hang myself I might actually strangle her.
