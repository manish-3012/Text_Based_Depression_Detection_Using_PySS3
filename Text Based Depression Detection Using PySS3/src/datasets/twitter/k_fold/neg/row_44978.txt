I just need someone to talk toI have multiple panic attacks a day and have a hard time getting through them. It would be nice if I just had someone that I could talk to about these things when they're happening or when I can tell I'm going to get one. I don't expect you to be my best friend or hold my hand down the sidewalk. I just want someone who can help me get through my attacks and get over my depression if I even can. If you want to talk and get a few more details feel free to send me a message on here. Thank the good fucking people who do exist and come here to help everyone. &lt;3
