It's time.It's now time for me to hang myself. I tried to live, I really did. It just didn't work. I fucked up too many times and this is the end of my story. This is my suicide note, I'm sure people I know will find this. I tried to fight for joy in life, but my problems kept pushing me away. I have lost many friends because of my issues. It sucks, I won't see my family grow. I won't see my nephews prosper. I won't see my animals. I won't ever have a relationship again, I won't have a job, or a family of my own, and it's all my fault. I had to do this. I hope all of you prosper, and find peace in something. I know you guys can do it, I really do. Never get in over your head with mistakes. Don't fuck up. Put yourself out there. Be better than I was, at least. 


Bye.
