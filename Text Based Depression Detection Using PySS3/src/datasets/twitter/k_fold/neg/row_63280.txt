0 days since I almost did itGot a full ride scholarship for a college I leave for in 24 days. Doing fairly well in my local stand up comedy scene. Fucking miserable. I'm an 18 year old who's got ptsd which really fucked up my emotional development from a young age, and the only way I can process any emotion is through the coping mechanism of humor. All I feel is the impulse to make a joke, and the desperate need to end it. It says don't be explicit about methods, so I'll just say every evening I come close. I set myself up, and pull out of it. I can't form any real emotional connection with anybody and I just feel like a hollow shell of a human. I only stay alive because I know logically I've got an amazing shot ay doing something with my life, but I just don't feel like it's a life worth living. Part of me wants to go on with a grin as a big 'fuck you' to life and all that's happened, but I just feel like I'll always be this hollow clown. I've never been a cry for help guy, but I guess that's changed since I'm posting here. I just feel at the end of my rope here you guys... I just don't feel like keeping this going.
