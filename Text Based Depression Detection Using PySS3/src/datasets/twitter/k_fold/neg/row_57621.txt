I need someone to talk to.I had a conversation with a friend last night and ended spilling to beans to her and I realized things about myself that I didn't even know just by saying them out loud to her. I would really like to talk to a stranger about this to get a new perspective. In private if that's alright. I just need to express these feelings to someone. Someone please help.
