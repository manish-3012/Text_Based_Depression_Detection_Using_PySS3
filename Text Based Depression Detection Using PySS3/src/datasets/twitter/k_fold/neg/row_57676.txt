When I was 17 I attempted suicide and was nearly successful.  My life in the past 12 years has turned out how I thought it would, and I am going to give up in 2012I am sick of struggling, the constant pain disappointment and failure.

I spent 10 years in a marijuana and meth haze which made life bearable, to the outside world I have cleaned up my act I have savings now a good job and am clean and sobre but I am utterly miserable.

The only thing that keeps me going is curiosity about anything interesting happening by the end of the year, if not I think I might as well check out.
