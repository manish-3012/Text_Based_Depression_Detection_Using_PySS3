Tried to kill myself SaturdayThrowaway. Not really expecting anything from this, just need it off my chest. 

On Saturday I scribbled down a note addressed to "no one in particular" and attempted suicide by chugging a bunch of gin and ativan. Tuesday I woke up in a pretty bad state. After taking some time to collect myself I realized I'd need to get on with my life (for the time being) so I messaged work and got chewed out for being out  without notice. Today I went back in and had a pretty normal day.

A couple years ago I attempted by the same method, I was living with my parents at the time and they found me and sent me to the hospital, and I had to spend a couple weeks at a shitty unhelpful psyc ward. I'm afraid if I tell someone irl about this latest attempt I'll have to go through another ordeal like that.

My situation isn't all bad. I have a decent job as a software developer and 
enjoy practicing martial arts in my spare time. It's just the loneliness that's been eating away at me, and it's especially brutal around the holidays. When I was younger I convinced myself that things might get better when I got older, but now at 26 and it's increasingly looking like I've missed the boat on having any semblence of a social life.

Anyway, thanks for reading and good luck to all of you.
