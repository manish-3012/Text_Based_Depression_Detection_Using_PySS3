My attempt was unsuccessful. I need to try harder.Iâ€™ve seen many people thankful for the epiphanies theyâ€™ve had after a suicide attempt. Iâ€™ve seen many people thankful to have not died, thankful for the opportunity for a renewed lease on life.

That isnâ€™t me.

Monday night, I took what I could find in my medicine cabinet. I walked into my bedroom, to say goodbye to my daughter. This woke my fiancÃ©, who promptly demanded to know what had happened. An ambulance was promptly called, I donâ€™t remember much after that.

I woke on Wednesday morning, in a hospital gownâ€”not really sure of the day or the time.

Iâ€™m back at home now. Iâ€™m miserable. My eating disorder has gotten much worse. My depression is much worse. My thoughts of suicide are so invasive, so overwhelming. I wish I had died on Monday. Now I have to deal with the guilt of having failed.

Things donâ€™t get better. They get progressively worse.
