Is there any way for me to talk to a psychiatrist/recieve a diagnosis without my parents knowing?If you read my past post you'll understand why talking to them won't work, I've tried and my doctor has tried. I know I'm not just depressed, my mood swings aren't getting better and it's noticeable to everyone around me and I can't do this much longer. I don't have a phone to call help lines and I'm pretty sure the school psychiatrist would have to call my parents. I'm 15 and live in California if that helps.
