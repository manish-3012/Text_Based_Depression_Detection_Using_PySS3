Nothing's goodi'm so pissed off. i met this super nice and pretty girl 3 months ago and i just hear that she were not writting to me cause she prefer ''bad boys'' and she chosed to just skip. that is just the thing i didn't need to my actual life. every things that happens is shit and shit over and over and over. I don't feel good i want to get away from this shity life! Please just don't think that i'm joking, seriously i tried to kill myself with a damn rifle, luckily (i guess) the bullet didn't worked and the gun got stuck 2 days ago... Someone please help me i really don't feel good with this damn girl bad new.... i don't know how to face all those shits!!! i don't want to hurt myself like i tried to do cause this experience scared me a lot and it is absolutely horrible. i need help, i repeat, i'm not planning to do it. But i want to damn die and just never feel those craps again. That girl, had a dream... Being happy and i promised her that i will make her happy cause my dream was to makes her happy. the results are that i broke my ass making all i could to make someone happy  by trying to love her, just to get said by a friend that she just prefer to get away from me cause i was too much a ''nice guy''! What the fuck?? I don't know what to do now ! i want to die and born and die again! i feel like a damn shit ! don't call the police or an anti-suicide shit. i don't need it, absolutely not. all i need is to make it clear in my mind CAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTANT WHY THE FUCK !!!!! I wrote songs to her, i said the sweetest things to her. i respected her cause she've been unrespected her whole life by her ex boyfriends and she doesn't deserve it! i am maybe not that so cool... i am maybe not that so intersting... i am maybe just a poor asshole like an other, trying to do something assholes are not allowed to do. what should i do !?? i tryed to text her and she still don't answer! fuck my life is a DAMN SHIT!
