Hypochondriac convinced I have brain damage, this is no way to liveIâ€™ve been anxious my whole life and depressed for the last two years. Last summer I did some stupid stuff and itâ€™s become the subject of my hypochondria, one being mixing muscle relaxers with alcohol at high doses. I canâ€™t take my mind off it not matter what, Iâ€™m always researching and looking at other dumb stuff I did to see if that messed me up. This is not way to live, im worried about hypoxic brain damage. I know Iâ€™m a hypochondriac but I definitely did some stupid stuff in the past.
