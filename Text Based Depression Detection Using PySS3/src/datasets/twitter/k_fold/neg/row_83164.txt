helpthoughts are growing too much and I can't hold, this too much.

Recently I wanted to hurt myself, but I didn't want to cut or something physical again. so I started hiding my feelings and even keeping distance from other people because I figured it would hurt and potentially get me at least a little bit closer to suicide. surprise, it worked.

today I've cried looking at my room and the gear I have because there are the things my family will have to remember me.

i planned it all, it's horrible, but I feel so much pressure I can't deal with it.

I wanna break away from this thing, I don't wanna think about this anymore, but then I remember how am I, and I hate it. I hate what I do, I hate how I act, I hate how I look, it's pure anxiety and it'll never go away.
