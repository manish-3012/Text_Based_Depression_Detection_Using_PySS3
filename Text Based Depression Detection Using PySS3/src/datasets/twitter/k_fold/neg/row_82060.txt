I can't deal with the pain any longerI'm a 30yo m virgin, and I can't really deal with the constant rejection I get on a daily basis. I've been told that I'm not not unattractive, but that seems to make things all the worse. That just mean I'm just too pathetic to even approach other women. I have anxiety and depression issues. I can't stop thinking about just giving up, and succumbing to my base desires, to just stop living and constantly feeling this pain that I'm always in.
