Do I stay alive for my 4-year-old at this point? I'm 27 and should be so happy that I'm finally in a well-paid graduate job but 3 weeks in and the paranoia, anxiety and alienation have set in so deep I'm in tears every night dreading to go back in. At this point, I'm suicidal too, have a 4-year-old to care for, and have been chronically depressed for years.

 Also broke up with my son's father 3 months ago after 6 years and that has devastated me. I feel so alone and scared and now I'm about to lose the one thing I always needed- a job. The ability to provide for my child.  

I really want to die so badly, just to make the pain go away for just one day.

 I cry every single night, always anxious and paranoid, heartbroken, insecure. Just everything. I've self-harmed in the past. I'm so frightened. So so frightened, and my poor little boy knows it. 

Tonight he cried in my arms and I cried too though I tried to hide it.  He told me he missed being a baby because that's when his dad was here and I hated myself so much inside. I apologized to him and hugged him so tight and tears were streaming. I'm at the end it feels. He needs someone stable, happy and I'm none of that.
