Every day I get closer to killing myselfI don't know why I'm posting. I just don't have anywhere else to go I guess. I might even delete this in the next few minutes. I have no idea. 

Everything hurts and I can't think straight. When I do everything tells me I should die and stop wasting space. I'm terrible at my hobbies. I'm not good at school. I suck at everything. I can never do anything right.

I'm terrified of dying, but every day I get closer to not caring. At this point I just wanna die peacefully. If I ever go to tell anyone I feel this way I panic and just end up making it worse by not telling anyone and spiraling. I don't know how to get help or if I even deserve it. I don't see a future for me. I don't see anything. I don't deserve anything.
