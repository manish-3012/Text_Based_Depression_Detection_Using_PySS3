My boyfriend wants to kill himselfMy boyfriend of six months has shown some suicidal ideation. He has lately seemed very depressed about some things in his life, like his living situation and his past relationship. He suffers from psychotic depression and doesn't want therapy or treatment. I know if he wants to get better long term he needs mental health care, whether that's therapy and medication, or non-traditional treatment. He seems very caught up in his past and how things used to be. How should I handle this situation without pushing boundaries or trying to "save" him? I only want to be supportive.
