I feel I've reached the end.I've not been a good person to anyone around me. All I can ever seem to do is lie to make others and myself feel better about the situations I put myself into and drag them with me. 

I've been unemployed for 7 months. I put in over 100 applications, but only received 8 calls and had 3 interviews with no job offers. I had unemployment, but it's ended, and because of this, I'm going to cause my roommate to lose her house if she can't come up with rent tomorrow. I lied to her to tell her I had paid it, but I didn't get the money to do so. Not only this, she also thinks I currently have a job that was started on Monday. 

I don't know that there's anyone in my life that wouldn't be better off without me. Nothing else makes sense right now, and the idea of everyone having a better time sounds really fucking good. I hate my life right now, and whether they admit it, I'm pretty sure everyone in my life dies too.
