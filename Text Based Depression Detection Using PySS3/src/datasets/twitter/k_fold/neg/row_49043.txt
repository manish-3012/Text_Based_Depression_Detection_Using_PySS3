I fucking hate myself..I was given a chance at life, maybe at being successful too. But naturally I fucked things up that I canâ€™t take back. 

So much guilt on my mind that I canâ€™t get rid of. 

Painful images that are seared into my brain until I die. 

PTSD from seeing my best friend dead because of my actions. 

Anxiety from worthlessness, guilt, and my past. 

Letting my loved ones down, fucking failure.

Iâ€™m 99% sure that Iâ€™ll probably kill myself if not next month, next year for sure. Christmas time would be a terrible time to commit suicide for my family, but I just canâ€™t do this shit anymore. 

Iâ€™ve always had a feeling I was going to die before I hit 20 since I was like 13, feels like itâ€™s inevitable honestly. I just donâ€™t want to hurt my family, but itâ€™s getting unbearable. 

If I had a shotgun Iâ€™d just blow my brains out. But itâ€™d be too messy and besides I probably couldnâ€™t get a gun even if I tried. 

Canâ€™t lie, it is tempting to go to the top of a tall building and just jump off, get some good air time for sure. maybe Iâ€™d regret it on the way down like some do. 

If I hang myself, I donâ€™t want to do it in my house because of family. Maybe a random tree in nature would work? But once I kick that chair thereâ€™s no turning back and I feel like Iâ€™d regret it while Iâ€™m hanging. 

Decapitation by train would be nice but Iâ€™m concerned about somehow botching that attempt and end up on life support of my already miserable life. And at that point Iâ€™m as good as dead or just I fail and just bleed to death in agonizing pain. 

But what do these concerns matter if Iâ€™d just die to one of these suicide plans anyway. Itâ€™s not like  I can feel pain when Iâ€™m dead. Iâ€™ll only feel pain for a little bit then Iâ€™ll finally be free. Thatâ€™s the tempting part. 

If Hell really does exist, Iâ€™m fucked for eternity I guess. Definitely not going to heaven. If nothing exists in the afterlife, Iâ€™m fine with that. Not like I would even know. 

Fuck, I wish there was a â€œDelete Allâ€ button.
