person i liked and my friend.so, ive liked this girl for a few years, and ive been obsessed with her for about a year, and we were friends, and she had been giving me signs that she liked me. about 3 weeks ago, i started talking to an old friend, and we started talking about relationships, so i told him i liked the girl. he then started texting to her, and they were friends. my friend knew how much the girl upset me, and how much i LOVED her. i would cry every night about the situation. he knew this. they started talking and we all met up on saturday, and it was fine. on saturday, they kissed, with tounge for about 2 minutes in front of me. and they both knew how much i loved this girl. she even said look away when they did it. i said i had to go home and i left right there, riding home on  my bike with tears in my eyes. for 3 years ive liked this girl. and i thought about her constantly. i still do. im a very forgiving person, so i forgave them. i saw her at school a few days ago and she looked down, and the next day she wasnt at school. so i texted her to check up on her to see if she was okay. she went and spun the whole thing round so she was the victim. i then told her how much i loved her, and how i would have done anything to be with her, and how much it was killing me, even though she already knew. i then remembered this EXACT THING HAD HAPPENED TO ME LAST YEAR, and then i snapped. on both of them. i told them exactly how it was, and then i told both of them i never want to see them again, and the truly caring friend they both missed out on. i still love her.
