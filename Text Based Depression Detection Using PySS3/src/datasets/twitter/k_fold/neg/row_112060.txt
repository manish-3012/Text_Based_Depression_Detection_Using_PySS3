feel like i'm losing what i barely even have anymoreeverything feels so completely fucked, i don't bother with school anymore because of how much stress it puts on me, not to mention the apathy and lack of energy or willpower. the only things i find any scraps of enjoyment in anymore are huffing and sleeping, and sleeping is already losing its enjoyment since my dreams are usually either nonexistent or just reliving memories of a sexual assault. i know my friends care about me but god sometimes it feels like the second they think i'm alright they just drop the entire thing altogether and don't bother talking about this sort of thing until it gets really bad again. i'm probably wrong, but i can't get the thought out of my head. my friends are the only people i can trust anymore, since my family are easily the worst people i personally know. i've been cutting my thighs for a while now, takes my mind off of things for a little while. pretty sure the only reason i haven't shot myself yet is that i can't find any ammunition besides shotgun shells. we don't own a shotgun, just .22 and 9mm pistols. my dad doesn't even keep them in a safe. the thought of taking my family with me when it happens comes to mind sometimes but the only person who really deserves that is my brother, but he doesn't live with us, hasn't for a while. rest of them are just pricks in general who i'm ashamed to be related to, but my brother's pretty much the driving force in all this. the rest of them can go pretend they actually cared, i don't really care. i don't even know what i can do. maybe ask my dad to take me shooting and do it there or cut my femoral, idk. i'm just so fucking tired. sorry for the text wall, it's hard for me to condense this.
