Another day waking up with zero notificationsI just love at how good people are at pretending I donâ€™t exist. Itâ€™s like at this point I just want for once for someone else to start the conversation not me. And for the other person to participate in the conversation without me having to carry the whole thing. I just want to wake up and be treated like a human being for once instead of being brushed off and ignored.  So yeah now itâ€™s more embarrassing cause itâ€™s on Reddit and random strangers can see it.
