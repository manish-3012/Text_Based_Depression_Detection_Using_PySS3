It's about timeHello lovely people. I am out of money to seek help and out of energy to earn money, so I think this is just about time I confided someone in this; I am killing myself by Friday. I am bipolar, been in and out of treatment for years and now I am glad I finally decided to leave. Yes I am concerned about those whom I love, but I just cannot live like this forever. May life be in someone else's favor.
