Feeling absolutely trappedFirst time poster here 

I've been contemplating suicide since I was 13 (19 now) and frankly I think it's about time I did it. I fuck up and disappoint everyone I meet, my best friend (at least until I fuck it up) just told me our entire cast likes it better when I'm not around (I'm an actor, we do theatre together) that's over 30 people, which is nothing compared to the amount of people who've said it in my lifetime, it's always the same wherever I go, I'm sick and tired of not liking myself because people don't like me and not being able to fix it, stuck in an endless fucking loop and I'm losing it,  I give myself to the end of the summer, because I need an out fast, I've already deleted all my social media so fuck it, won't be missed if there's nothing to miss right? Thanks for reading I guess, needed to get that out after 6 years of not saying anything about it
