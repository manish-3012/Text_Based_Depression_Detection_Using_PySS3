Please help 

Three weeks and three days ago, I took a chance and told my best friend that I had feelings for her. She said she needed some time to think before she gave me an answer. Today, she rejected me. She felt really bad and we had a good long talk about it. However, I still feel just empty inside. I haven't eaten anything since yesterday, and I've barely spoken a word to anyone in my house or otherwise (and I'm a very extroverted person). I have no motivation to do anything. Nothing matters anymore to me.

Even though my friends and family are all here for me, I still feel like I want to die. Please talk me out of suicide.

I'm only 17, and I know my family would be distraught if I took my own life, but I feel like I have nothing to live for.
