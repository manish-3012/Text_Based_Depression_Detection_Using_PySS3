I'm just so tiredI'm tired of pretending to be happy. I'm tired of my friends saying they care and then ignoring me. I'm tired of feeling so alone.

I almost hung myself last month. I obviously didnt but I keep asking myself why I didnt. I wont be missed. I doubt it would even cross anyone's mind for a while that I'm just not around.
