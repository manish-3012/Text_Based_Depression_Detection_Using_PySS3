Suicide..?It's not like im cryng for help, But i mean kinda.. ? 
Well ya, I just don't see the point in being so called "alive". Why not just end it all with a nice kitchen knife in the stomach? Bleed it all out and never have to worry again, worry about making the wrong choice, worry about not being good enough. I just honestly don't know. I've had these "thoughts" for quite a while I just don't know what to think of them. I did try to just "end it"? Hurt too much tho, "Failing at failing" as i like to call it, pathetic, right? 

Well thanks for reading lmao
