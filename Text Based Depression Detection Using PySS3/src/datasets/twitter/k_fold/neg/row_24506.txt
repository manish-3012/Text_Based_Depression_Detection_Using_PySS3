I need helpI'm in a really dark place. Haven't done my uni work, my body is in pain. I'm smoking, not eating enough, I cannot cope without anything changing. I can't get back to my old self.

I used to lift every other day. High grades, eating well, staying on top of everything. I've slipped big time worse than I ever have. I think about ending it mutliple times a day just to be done with it. 

I should've seeked medical help years ago but I didnt. I've lost my faith and drive. I literally sicken myself, I don't know what to do or where to start. I just feel suffocated.
