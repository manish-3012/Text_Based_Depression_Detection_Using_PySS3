I don't care anymore, I'm just going to do it.For 2 weeks I've been planing to kill my self on New Year's Eve. I was planning on drinking a bunch of alcohol, taking a bottle of melatonin and slitting my wrists. This has been my plan of suicide for a while, I can't stop thinking of this plan. I can't do it on New Years now because my family is making me go on a week long trip with them because some random family member I don't even know died. They won't let me stay home. Now I have to stay clean from self harm for a week, and force myself to act normal. Every time I have a date that will work well, someone makes plans or something and I can't do it. I can't stop thinking about and romanticizing my death. Things will be over, I'll finally be able to be at peace and be happy. I'm thinking about sneaking out of the hotel and just letting myself freeze to death or something. Thinking about dying and self harming makes me so happy. It's the only thing that really makes me happy at this point. I don't care what my family and friends think, I won't be around to feel guilty once I'm dead.
