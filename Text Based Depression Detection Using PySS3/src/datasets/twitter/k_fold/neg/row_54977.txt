No one cares, it was all just a lie. Tomorrow is my birthday, and tomorrow I'm going to die.(an unintentional rhyme in the title, I'm not trying to be cutesy with this shit)

No one cares about me. Anyone who has ever said iso or told me otherwise was just lying, trying to comfort me or manipulate me. No one ever truly cared. I am so fucking disposable. I am absolute trash. I don't matter to a single person, and the longer I stay living, the more of a burden I become. 

Tomorrow is my birthday, and I am terrified to receive all the half-hearted "happy birthdays" out of facebook-notification obligation. I've planned for tomorrow to be my day to die for a while. 

I've been too depressed lately to do the proper 'clean up' that I wanted to do, but it just may not even matter anymore. It doesn't fucking make a difference. I'll just throw everything in trash bags instead of meticulously going through everything and be done with it. Then I'll finally fucking do it. Then a burden will be eliminated from everyone in my life. 

I keep grasping at straws, trying to find someone that I truly matter to, that truly cares about me and my wellbeing and actually loves me, but it was all just a facade, a mirage, fake. I wanted to feel loved so that is what I saw, but now I see the truth and it is so painful. It would make no difference if I disappear tomorrow other than people not receiving a 'like' on their  'happy birthday' to my facebook wall. Like they'll even remember they did it in the first place.

After years of planning my death on the day of my birth, with something always getting in the way, I'm finally fucking over it. I'm ready to be gone. I can't bear this pain any longer.
