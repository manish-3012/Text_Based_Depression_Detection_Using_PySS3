Idk a vent I guessIâ€™m sitting in my bathroom with a knife and Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m gonna do yet. In all likelihood Iâ€™ll just cause some superficial damage, patch myself up, and move on. But I wish I could just cut my chest open and rip out my own lungs and be done. Iâ€™m the one my friends vent to but everyone else is falling apart or has drifted away so I feel like thereâ€™s no one I can go to. 
Iâ€™ve tried therapy. Iâ€™ve tried medications. It doesnâ€™t work. I think I just wasnâ€™t meant to exist in this world.
