I had a suicide attempt and now my SO is scared of me.I would like advice from those who've had their SO attempt suicide and how you felt. You can skip all the extra information coming up.

I had an attempt last Friday, which was not planned, but I had already asked my SO not to speak to me for the weekend while he was visiting home. I was having another depression episode and didn't want to bring him down, but I ended up being more suicidal than ever. 

As you can tell, my attempt failed, so I decided to try again Saturday night. But I didn't follow through thanks to the help of some friends.

Come Sunday night I called my SO crying telling him what had happened, and he was worried for my health. (I took a lot of acetaminophen) He had me throw out all the pills I had left, and read me to sleep. He also made me promise to get my liver checked out immediately. The next morning he called to see if I was okay, and ended the call with an "I love you." 

My SO has never been the best at comforting me. While he's scared to lose me, he's horrible at expressing himself. So lately, he's been more distant and cautious, last night he admitted to being a little scared of me, but he couldn't tell me why. I asked him if he still wanted to continue 'us' and he teared up, but then he just asked to go to sleep. Then in the morning he gave me a kiss before class. 

With people out there, who have had their loved ones attempt suicide, tell me how you felt? I would like a better idea into my SO's head. We've been together for almost three years now, and my last attempt was also three years ago. I suppose he is scared of me hurting myself again, but he can't get back into our regular groove of things, and I'm worried about him. 

I know this isn't a post about my attempt itself, so I'm sorry if this breaks any rules.
