Iâ€™ve (22F) been dealing with depression and anxiety since I was 11-12. It doesnâ€™t seem like itâ€™ll get better but every time I want to die I canâ€™t bring myself to do it.Idk what Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™m not happy with my life and never have been. Feels like Iâ€™m not living, Iâ€™m just here. Itâ€™s so hard to get through one day without feeling like I might explode. My head is everywhere and feels like Iâ€™m being pulled in two separate directions. So every time I want to kill myself, I just lie down and do nothing cause I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here??? I guess Iâ€™m desperate. I spent all night looking up peaceful ways to die because Iâ€™m just so tired of hurting and pain. Sometimes I just wish my existence would just fade and nobody notices.
