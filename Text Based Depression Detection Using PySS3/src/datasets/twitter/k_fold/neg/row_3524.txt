This is my last weekI canâ€™t take the pain anymore.
I wish I could tell someone but I donâ€™t want to, I donâ€™t want to leave my family, they are my world, I donâ€™t want to leave them with the pain.
But I canâ€™t take it anymore.
I canâ€™t be here.
My note is written and scarf is ready to go. All I have to do is take a breath and go, 

Thank you reddit for giving me strands of hope, youâ€™ve been more helpful than my closest friends at this time.
