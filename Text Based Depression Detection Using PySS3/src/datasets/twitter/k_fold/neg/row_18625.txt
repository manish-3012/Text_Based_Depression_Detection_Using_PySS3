can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?I don't actually believe in heaven or hell or even god, but the only thing keeping me going right now is an upcoming concert and I know I'm going to (at least) try to kill myself after the event. I'm supposed to go to college in a month and I can't handle the pressure of starting over and having to make new friends and all the responsibilities that come with being in college. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia about a year ago although I've been living with it since I was fourteen. Stopped taking my meds about a month ago. Got all the tools needed and my note written. Now all I need to do is wait for the right moment.
