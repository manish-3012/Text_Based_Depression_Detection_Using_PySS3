I want to kill myself because I'm absolutely terrified of the futureI don't think this counts as depression. I'm not constantly sad. I'm able to find little moments of joy when I'm playing a video game or whatever. But I have always planned killing myself before the end of high school. And now that I'm in grade 12, I have been getting more and more scared. I've always hated school. My grades have completely plummeted in recent years because I don't want to spend my limited time doing something I hate. I failed 5/8 classes last year. I just know I'm destined to be a failure if I were to graduate. The main reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I'm in the middle of a show I'm watching and I want finish it before die. But once I'm done with it I'm probably just gonna do it.

Sorry if I seemed like I was rambling, I was just typing the first things that came to mind.
