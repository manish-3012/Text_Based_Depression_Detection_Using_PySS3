My state of mindHey im a 19 year old dude from Australia . This whole year has been weird. Ive had moments wanting to take my own life. But never  did. I did try once. But i stopped beforehand (sleeping pills).
Im in this state where i dont feel anything. I guess you could say, numb? 
It began eversince i split  from my former partner. The heartbreak made me force myself to be isolated from anyone for a long time. i eventually got out of shell to try and become more social. But i got so used to that feeling of self loathment i kind of accepted it, and i dont like that. I now am very nihilistic and pessimistic and the only thing that keeps me going is to make other people happy. I guess you could say i enjoy seeing people smile. Makes me happy for a while. People say to try be happy, but i know when i try its fake and it never works. 

I wouldnt say im still  in full heartbreak. Just in this hole where  i cant seem to get out off. I used to be so happy and motivated last year, however this year has just been nithing. . I feel nothing, as if i have nothing to lose and that scares me. I honestly  feel empty and it physically hurts.
