I'm nothing but a pain and i ruin everyone's livesAll I've ever achieved in this life is hurting people. I hurt the people I love the most. My existence is just pain and suffering. I'm just done. Done with life, done with others, done with it all. I'm sick of my job, my life, and the way I'm nothing but a menace to my family. I wish I had a reason to stay but I'm back in the dark place. I'm not sure if I'll go yet but I really want to... I'm too scared to right now. Just please give me a reason to crash my car or hang myself. I love my partner but I just hurt them. I love my family but they don't know how awful I am. I'm tired of life. I'm tired of existing. Idk if I'm even real. Is this just a dream or a plot of someone's sick and twisted story...? I'll never know...
