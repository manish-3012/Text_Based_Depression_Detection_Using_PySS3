My ex told me part of the reason he stopped loving me is because Iâ€™m transIâ€™ve never hated myself or wanted to kill myself as badly as I do right now. Iâ€™m absolutely crushed. I donâ€™t even know how to put into words what Iâ€™m feeling. He told me he would love me forever and wanted to marry me, and that me being trans didnâ€™t matter to him. But he also really wants kids and obviously that canâ€™t happen with me.

I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I donâ€™t know how I can ever trust anyone again who says that they donâ€™t mind me being trans or that they can see a life with me. Iâ€™m heartbroken but I have a bottle of vodka and a pack of Valium so maybe Iâ€™ll be okay.

Iâ€™m sorry Alex, I love you so much Iâ€™m so sorry I wasnâ€™t good enough.
