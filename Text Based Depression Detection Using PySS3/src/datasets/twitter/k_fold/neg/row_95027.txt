I need a humane lawyer's thoughts on thisGetting ready to get off the merry-go-round once and for all.  Giving myself a few more days.  Planning things out thoughtfully.

I am hoping a lawyer reads this and wants to do something good for a middle aged loser who has lived enough on this planet.  I need some advice.

I don't want my therapist to get sued by my family.  I want to make sure that my therapist is protected from any lawsuits.  He's a good guy and doesn't deserve to have to deal with this and I've read that families can and do sue therapists after a suicide.  My family aren't very kind or honest and they would sue if they knew they could make money.

Does any lawyer know how to write some sort of will or statement so that my therapist can be protected?

Thanks for your help.
