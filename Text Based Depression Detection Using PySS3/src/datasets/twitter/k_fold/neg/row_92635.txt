My reason to keep living is gone.I stayed alive because I was in love. 
Because we had a plan. 


He gave me goals to work towards, and made a spot of sunshine in my daily life-- I had something to look forward to.
I thought we were happy.


I thought that I was worth something. He made me feel like I was worthwhile. That I was deserving of love and happiness. 
But I see now that I'm not. I wasn't even worth a goodbye. Just a shitty, cryptic note about how he's starting a new job and doesn't want me to wait for him, how I should sieze any happiness and opportunities that come my way. And that the job won't last forever, and maybe when it's over and he's back...
And then nothing.
I was worth five years. I was worth a marriage proposal. 
But I wasn't worth a break-up. I wasn't worth a plan to work through this. I wasn't even worth saying goodbye to.
I'm not worth anything.


I'm ready now. There is no point in me going on. My path in life has ended. 


When I get home tonight, I am going to kill myself. 
I just needed to tell someone.
