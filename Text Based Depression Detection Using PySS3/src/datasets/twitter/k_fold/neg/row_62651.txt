I told my parents that I'll kill myself and this is how they responded.My dad shouts at me to "shut the fuck up" and my mum says "what about my depression" and leaves the room. It's always about them. I have tried and they keep telling me that I haven't. They have no idea what it's like and if anything they've only made my life worse. I remember when I was in my last year of high school being bullied and I would cry and they'd still send me to school. I used to regularly throw up before going to school due to anxiety and one time I threw up in the garage sink right before I was about to leave and they had a go at me. They didn't even let me wash my mouth out or brush my teeth. They just rushed me outside the door.
