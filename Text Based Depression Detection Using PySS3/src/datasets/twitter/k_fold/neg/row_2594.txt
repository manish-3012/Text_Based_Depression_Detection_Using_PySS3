what is the point in existing if itâ€™s filled with never ending pain and monotony?i keep getting involved with people who do not care about me whatsoever. in addition to the constant heartbreak, my days are so boring and i donâ€™t have anything to look forward to. seriously, absolutely nothing in life excites me. instead, i dread each day that is to come. 

the monotony is overwhelming. i seriously do not see a point in living if my existence is filled with sadness. for as long as i have been alive, i have been utterly depressed. i cannot think of a single week long span where i have been consistently happy. 

i hope i can actually get the strength to kill myself either this month or the next. 

what is the point in existing if itâ€™s just filled with infinite pain? the years to come will certainly be worse as my youth is slipping away.
