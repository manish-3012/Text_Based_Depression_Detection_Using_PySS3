I have work tonight, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to finally do it in the morning.I've posted my story on here before and I've found a boyfriend since my last attempt. I love him so much but I'm just a leech to everyone I know. Anyway, just looking for a nice peaceful/painless way out or people to talk to before I go.

Edit: I'm going to look into admitting myself into a psych ward. If anyone could help me research, it would be nice.

Edit 2: I'm back for the night if anyone wants to talk
