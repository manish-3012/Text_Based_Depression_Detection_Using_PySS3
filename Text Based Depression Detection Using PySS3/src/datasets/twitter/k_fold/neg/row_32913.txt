Ode to "Fuck it all"I cannot sleep.

I cannot eat. 

I cannot go to school without wandering "why bother".

I walk past happy couples and wander why not me?

I remember the first day of my depression, the day my dog died over 5 years ago. Since then I have not known what happy is nor do I see myself every being it. My health is shit, my brain is fucked, my life sucks. I am broke as shit reached for help and been smacked down. Asked for a sign and been shit on. Wandering through my life as a nobody, someone hows just there for a shoulder to cry on only to be ditched as soon as the next one comes along. Why run through life as dip shit, half assed, screw up. I hold my friends back, I walk in meaningless shadows of idols. I have no direction in life. Fuck it all, no gives a fuck about me. and to reddit, you give out a helping hand, but lets be honest i dont know you, you say you care about me but you really dont know me. Thanks for listening but what goes through your mind when you think of me?

I have no energy to make my life any better, all hope is as lost as I am. When will some relief come. Fuck it all. We all know life sucks and things never go perfect and i would never expect half that. I ask for one minute of happiness and have yet to know what its like. A random smile for no reason even. Im not crazy, I know what is selfish, I know what is right. But still how can anyone live a meaningless life and have any hope of being happy. I would to be the male version of Oprah minus all the cash. Giving people what they want giving them a chance at what I can't seem to have. 

People just dont get me and I know they never will, how could they? No one wants to hear whats on my minf, but why should they I walk through life a scarecrow to women, and a punching bag to men. Im the stone they step on to make them selves feel better, Im the shit at the bottom of the outhouse. Lifes degenerate. So many nights a pull my hair out knowing I am forgetting some mundane detail about my day. My boss is a dick yet i cant quit, otherwise i would have to drop out of school, but I work too much to be able to study any sufficient amount of time, and if i dropout there goes my loan, and my gpa is far too low to get back in to school. Ill be in debt forever. My health is shit, Im 20 fucking years old and i need fucking heart surgery before Im 25 because one of my valves is completely shut while another is severely leaking. I have no positive quality that any sane woman would ever find attractive and am thoroughly convinced i will die alone at a young age. No posts are necessary, nothing ever is. Why should I expect anything from anybody? So many nights ive stayed after class, hoping to understand what the hell the teacher was talking about. Nothing ever clicked the very fact that i even got into college is sure to baffle even the smartest valedictorian. Ive always been below the 90% mark in my school. How can someone be happy when they are dumb as shit. Or when the car they bought for twice its worth keeps breaking down. You know your up shit creek when even a psychologist teacher says "Damn". Fuck it all to hell, why bother give the effort to breathe when "friends" constantly pick at every little thing wrong with your being. 

I doubt if a girl even did like me that I would have the balls to try to make things work. I cant do anything right, and why should I think that I do. if i had a dollar for everytime i was proved off, I could pay off the national debt ten fold. "Dumbass, fuckface, cocksucker, dipshit, goodfornothing, assclown, fucktard, bitchass" These might as well be the name on my nametag, i get called this more than my actual name. And to Reddit, dont bother sending a PM, this is a throwaway. Nothing you can say will make me feel better. I often try to think of people who have it worse than me, which yes obviously some, probably not many in the US though, and thats what gets me. I dont want to sound ignorant but this is America and our standard of living is higher than almost anywhere else. Yet i feel as though i could be doing better in a tribe in Africa. Corporate America has shit all over me, people need to understand, its not what a person looks like, and its not whats on the inside either for the ignorant assholes who try to make me feel better by saying that. Its about how much shit you can take before you give up....well i give up. Life- your a bitch you win, fuck it all, fuck me. Fuck everything, fuck my boss, fuck my shitty car, fuck my pathetic excuse for a life, FUCK. Damn it, i used to be religious but how can i believe in anything when prayers go unanswered for years, when family doesnt want to know you. When even other ugly people are disgusted by your face. Fuck me, fuck it, why this shit happens everyday, I never get a break, no sign of pity. Bills pile up with no way to pay them and no one to help figure shit out. To broke for a therapist not to mention take a girl out on a date if one even did say yes. I recently made a list of all the positives in my life. I didnt get one. I made a list of all the negatives in my life and it was two columns, double sided two pages, college ruled paper by the way. I can think of an excuse not to try but not one to better myself. The truth is nothing i can say will ever be worth shit and nothing you can say will change my mind. Fuck everything. Sometimes i wish i was mentally insane so i wouldnt have to block out reality my brain would do it for me. Even the girl im texting right now, trying to calm me down is being passive with one word texts trying to get me to stop talking to her. Well lets see where the night takes me. 

**TL;DR**:I don't care if you didn't read it. 

**Edit:** As far as hobbies go, I used to like mountain biking before my bike broke. To poor to buy a new one. I wanted to join the Army but got denied because of my heart conditon. That was my back up to dropping out of school. For right now, I plan on finishing this semester, then I am allowed to take a semester off so Im going to work my ass off for 3 months and take the final two months of the semester buy a bike, and bike across with US (East to West) ill get a tent and sleep on the side of the road travelling as light as possible. If i run out of money ill try to find a place that I can work at for a week or so to get some cash. I know it may be a shitty plan but its something ive wanted to do since I was a kid. Maybe ill find something better along the way. Theres nothing for me here. If I die along the way at least I would have tried.
