I've finally set a date in stoneI'm tired of bouncing back and forth between whether or not I should do it. I've been on and off suicidal for what, 8 years now? The only difference between 8 years ago and now is I know how to kill myself more effectively. So, I'll do it in two years. In two years, I'll have accomplished what I've been working for my whole life. Then I'm going to go out while I'm still on a high note. Before it gets too bad. I suck at everything else, so after I finish this, there's nothing else for me. Humans are social creatures, and I am godawful at that. What is the point of life if I can't connect with anyone? I try, but I don't fit. I get left out, forgotten. I'm so damn socially anxious, that I come across as cold and uncaring. I know I'm not an awful person. I'm just not good enough. Knowing that nothing will matter in two years is a relief.
