Soon to be divorced in my last year of law schoolSo Iâ€™ll try to keep this as short as possible. Iâ€™m in law school after leaving the military, living in NYC. Itâ€™s great. Except that my wife, who is almost 9 months pregnant, told me that sheâ€™s no longer attracted to me, and now feels trapped because we are having a kid. So I consider a divorce inevitable because I donâ€™t want to have a sexless marriage, kid or not.

On top of that, Iâ€™m in my last year of law school, but I have no social network because I had time for her and studying and that was it. Iâ€™ve approached people, but after a year and a half of not being social itâ€™s a bit late to get chummy with my classmates. I also donâ€™t have a job lined up, and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll even find one before or after graduation. 

So Iâ€™m basically fucked, and I am considering death as the only way out. I should have built and maintained friendships that could get me through this, but I didnt and now I have no one to turn to but the Hudson River.
