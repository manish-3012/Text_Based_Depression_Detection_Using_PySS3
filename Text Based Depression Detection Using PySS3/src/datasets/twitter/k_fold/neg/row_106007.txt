Not sure if this is where I should be?Been having problems with depression recently. I'm doing a masters degree that i hate. i thought it would set me up for a good career but i just dont care for the subject matter or the approach to the content.

i've been avoiding work and skip classes. i spend all day playing games and spending money on team fortress 2. i'm depressed. my wife wants me to see a counsellor, but we can't afford it. i'm fat and overweight. i bought running shoes but then it snowed so i haven't been able to go out. my wife can't cope with my sadness. today she shouted at me for not going to classes, threw her rings at me and told me to sleep on the couch. she's the only one bringing money home and feels like she's the victim. she expects me to focus on her when she's around. she's not being supportive. she just gets angry and takes her rage out on me. i feel like i can't open up to her or touch her.

i feel over loaded with a degree i can't stand and worry that i'll fail and will have added more money to my debt that i can't afford. i'm doing the masters because i couldnt get a job. i'm 26 and have never had a salary. i paid for the degree with inheritance.

i just don't know what else to do. i feel a deep sadness locked up inside but don't know what to do about it. i feel like i can't cry, and my body won't cry. i feel like i can't reach out to anyone because it'll cause a fuss and create a damage control atmosphere in my family. i don't really have friends on my degree, so if i dropped out no one would miss me. i'm a pain in the ass for my tutor because i can't think of a thesis topic that interests me. it has to be in the developing world. i was interested in looking at AIDS but then i got a C- on that paper. kind of shot me out of the sky.

i don't know what i should do. i feel so alone and sad. i can't even talk to my wife about these things because she'll just cut me off and tell me i'm being selfish.

i feel like i'm expected to be a person that i can't be. i feel like over the past few years the idea of who my family thought i would be is falling down and i feel unprepared and hollow when i face the future. i feel unaccomplished. i couldn't find a job, and now i don't know where to look. i've been a student for 5 years. i've been broke for 5 years. when people ask me what i want to do for work i say that i jsut want a job. a 9 to 5, with a shirt trousers, sitting a desk doing whatever. i don't care. i just want a job, and to feel independent and secure. i feel like i don't know who i am, or what my life is meant for.

a little help?
