Ignoring the naggingIts all building up.

The weekend was sooo long and sooo full of words.

I feel like I'm drifting once again.
my attempts to ignore it are wearing thin...

I'm better now...

it can't be this...

I don't know whats going to happen...

I just know that I can feel it getting close...
