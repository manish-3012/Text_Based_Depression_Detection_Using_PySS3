My first cousin commuted suicide this morning. Need advice.This morning, I received news that my first cousin decided to end her own life. I'm not informed of the full details (nor will I post them here), but I'm completely heartbroken and conflicted. What confuses me is that within the few times I met her she was seemingly happy and relaxed. Yet, throughout this news I also found out she was suffering through a motley of personal issues. A young girl, outside seemingly full of energy, wit, and elation also decided to end in within a sequestered, yet struggling mask. I didn't have much time to speak with her, but I wish I could've helped her. We're similar on a level that would've allowed me to relate to her pain.

I really don't know what to say. The hardest part at the moment isn't just losing her but having to see her again in the casket. This is the first true time I've experienced a death this direct from the family. 

There's not much I can do right now. I just want to know in what ways can I help out the family grieving atm?
