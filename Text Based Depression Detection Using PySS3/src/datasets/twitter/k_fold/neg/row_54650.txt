Iâ€™m 22 and my parents need helpIâ€™m 22 and I live with my mom and dad. Iâ€™m suicidal. Nothing will change that, I know this. I can go to therapy and take medicine all I want, but the voice will always be there, even if I donâ€™t always want to hear it. 

I have good and bad days, like everyone else. But, when Iâ€™m having good days, or even when Iâ€™m having bad days to be honest, my parents cannot understand that a part of me will always be suicidal. 

I donâ€™t know how to explain this to them, and I need some help.  What are your thoughts?
