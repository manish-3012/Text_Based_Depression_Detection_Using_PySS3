Wife wants a divorceI posted a couple weeks ago. At the time I was depressed. I felt my wife was becoming more and more distant.  Yesterday she told me she wants a divorce. We've been together for six years. I asked her if she wanted to go to counseling.  Her answer was no. She feels that the only thing that they'd convince her to do was get up the courage to finally leave.  

I went to my brother's house today and zoned out there for 3 hours.  Then I came back home. We talked. 

I asked for a hug. She said she didn't want to lead me on or give mixed signals.

We talked some more. We discussed boundaries. What her plans are.

I told her she could stay until she is on her feet.  Mostly because I think once she decides to go. I'll be alone again.  

I don't know what I'll do once I'm alone.
