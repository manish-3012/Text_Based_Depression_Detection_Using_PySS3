Pros and consPeople have been telling me to write a lot of lists recently. I've been writing a list of the pros and cons of suicide.


For reasons I won't go into, I've been free of medication for 18 months and I won't be taking it again. I have a mental health team who I see every few weeks but it's hard to talk. Sometimes I'm told not to talk not to trust. They are also very busy and don't have time to wait around for me to talk. I think I'm wasting their time.


When I quit meds it was amazing having my mind and my own thoughts back. Now that novelty has worn off I see the world how it really is. Voices tell me not to trust and they're right. They keep being right. People say don't listen to voices but they keep being right. They say people are screwing with me and they're right. They say people want me dead.


I can't live like this. I don't trust anybody, I'm cursed and my life is just a string of unfortunate 'coincidences' and mind games. I spent a long time trying to work out why things are like this but there's no answer. I like answers but there aren't any answers. I'm not even sure what the questions are.


My pros and cons list is irrelevant. I can't live like this.
