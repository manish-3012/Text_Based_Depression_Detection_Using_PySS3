The pain wont endI only now have negative feelings. Its either i feel dead inside, sad, down, worthless. I cant feel one positive feeling anymore. Not even from the things that gave me comfort before. Everyday it gets the point where i just feel like im better off killing myself. I just want it to stop.or stop feeling completely.
