I finally have the guts to do itIâ€™ve been struggling with an eating disorder and the sad thing is, Iâ€™m gaining weight. Gaining fucking weight when Iâ€™m supposed losing it. Iâ€™m never going to reach my goal weight. I fucking comfort eat for Christâ€™s sake. I look ugly, I look fat, and I feel sick. Iâ€™m too chicken to even make myself puke. 
Anyway, I decided to join a pro-Ana/thinspo subreddit and boy was that shitty. All these people with their bones sticking out and weights under 100 lbs. Iâ€™m never going to get there. Especially with the shitty quarantine. My grandma likes shoving food down my throat every minute of the day. Iâ€™m done. And Iâ€™m not scared to die anymore. Iâ€™m scared to fail. I need to die and not mess up. Iâ€™m going to do my research and make sure I do it right. I canâ€™t live with myself anymore.
