I feel lost and trapped, I don't know what to do.. please helpHello, I've never really been good at sharing my feelings but I'm begging for help as I plan to kill myself.. I have had this thought in my head for longer than I can remember. But recently the urge has been a lot stronger and I'm no longer scared of the idea. I think about being dead more than I think about being alive. I hate that my life has gotten to this point. I just want to be normal.. I feel so lost and trapped, the nasty thoughts won't leave my head.. please help..
