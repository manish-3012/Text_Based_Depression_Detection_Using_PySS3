It just feels like I can't get rid of it.I'm trying so hard, harder than I ever have before. I don't want to be like this anymore, I want to just feel like a normal person. I want to be happy and I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. For the first time in years, I felt happy, but it feels like I'm just not anymore. The past threeish weeks have been draining all energy from me and I feel like it's hopeless to keep trying.

I don't want to give up, but I'm feeling like I don't have any choice. I want hopek but I don't see anything to look forward to. I'm just weak. I feel so worthless and I could die and no one would miss me. I want to keep going, but I'm slowly going back to how everything was before. I don't want everything that I've done to try to make my life better be for nothing. I just want hope.
