Spin the Wheel, Take a RideHey there! You can call me EC.

I wanted to share with you all how my life is going currently, as well as some of the obstacles I am facing. I also hope that this may be of help to those of you out there that need it. I also talk about 

# About Myself

So, to start, I'd like to tell you a little about myself. I am 17, about to be 18. I skipped two years of high school to attend a well-known University Academy, where I am currently earning my Associate's degree for free. I want to be a theoretical physicist.

Another thing you should know about me is that I have a few different 'conditions' that make me who I am: Attention-Deficit-Disorder (ADD), Tourette's Syndrome (TS), and Asperger's Syndrome (AS) - also known as High-Functioning Autism (HFA). I have always been that 'odd' kind of kid - the one who would sit by himself and just daydream while all of the other kids played kickball.

I also *love* computers. It is an obsession of mine, and I have been programming ever since I was 7. I also love to make hacks for games - in fact, for a period of about 5 years, that's all I did when I got home after school. Every day, lmao...

# The Current Situation

When I get *way* too stressed, there's a good chance that I'll go into a depressive episode unless whatever is causing the stress is dealt with. Well, without going into the details, this is what happened in the middle of November 2018, and believe me - the stress that I was put under felt as heavy as a 2-ton truck, and there was no way I could continue performing at my best in such a chaotic environment. This is where the depressive episode starts to sink in...

I attempted to get the help of my parents (who were actually the ones who were causing the stress in the first place), but they were not willing to help me as they had once said they would if I ever needed anything. This came as a surprise, and it hurt to think that my parents didn't care about me as much as I had once thought. Nevertheless, it became apparent to me that I would need to take matters into my own hands, and quick, because by late November I was ready to kill myself.

To help prevent this from happening, I moved to my other parent's house (they are divorced, and the house is less stressful), and decided to make 'friends' there. However, by this time, the stress was still present (yet somewhat less than what it would have been at my other parent's house), and I realized that it was too late to prevent a depressive episode from occurring - I just had to deal with it, for however long it may take.

I went to the doctor around the start of December and was prescribed an anti-depressant. This anti-depressant has helped some, and I am glad that it has, though at times I still feel the depression, and am still suicidal. I have been taking this anti-depressant for about 5 weeks now.

This depressive episode affects a multitude of areas within my life. Academically, for example, I cannot perform anywhere near as well as I have in the past. My once-sharp focus has been dwindled down to the dull haze it is now. In addition, relationships between me and my family members have become weaker, giving way to a feeling of isolation. This, at first, did not help my depression, but after taking some time to think about it, I remembered something that I told myself long ago when I was dealing with my first time being depressed (a few years back)...

# Life: A Concept

What I remembered wasn't very complicated. It wasn't an equation full of symbols and funky-looking variables.

It was a realization. A concept. An idea; and a simple one at that.

Life, at least for me, is about enjoyment. The fun. The experience. And so, after remembering this basic - yet widely forgotten - concept, I decided that I would live my life having fun - and that I wouldn't let anyone prevent me from enjoying whatever adventures I seek.

Among the many lessons that I've learned over the years, if I had to choose the most important one, it would be the one that I learned during my first acid trip: you are free. Free to do what you want, when you want, how you want, with whomever you want, for whatever reason you want, and wherever you want. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't consequences for what you do, and that doesn't mean that you should go around doing just *anything* per-say, but if there's one thing it does mean, it's that you shouldn't let others dictate how you live, nor should you let others' judgments of you weigh as much as they do.

Perhaps for some, this isn't the best way to go about things, but it's the best that I can do in my situation, and that will just have to work.

# In Closing

So there you go: that's my story. Wherever you may be in *your* life, I wish you the best of luck.

Now, it's time that I have the fun that I deserve! :)

And as they say, "Spin the wheel, take a ride, and hold on tight because it's gonna get bumpy!"
