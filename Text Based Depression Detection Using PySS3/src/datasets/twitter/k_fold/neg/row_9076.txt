I can't stop hating who I am. I only want to be a normal woman.I am a late 20's woman and I have always hated myself. I wake up in the morning and hate my appearance, I hate how undisciplined I am, I hate my job, I hate my life, I hate how I speak, I hate where I live, everything. I hate everything about myself. This hatred of who I am has affected literally every aspect of my life. I don't try to get a nicer job because I think "hey they won't hire me". I don't ask out men that I'd like to because I know they would not find me attractive, I don't take any risk that would lead to a positive outcome because I know it will fail. I have been an insecure, depressed mess of a person since I was a teenager and things are not "getting better". Things did not change for me, they got worse. I want to improve but I physically cannot, my mind mentally blocks me all the fucking time. It's like there is a part of my soul that knows I can do better but the darkness of depression suffocates it and wins every battle. I'm sorry for ranting here but I wasted my youth being depressed and socially anxious and all I want to be is to be the type of woman to dress up and go out to fun parties, or go on dates, or be fun or flirty. I wish I could reset this all and have a do-over.
