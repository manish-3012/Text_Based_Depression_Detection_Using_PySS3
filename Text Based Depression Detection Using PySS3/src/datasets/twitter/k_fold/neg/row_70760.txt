I donâ€™t know how to get helpIâ€™m sitting here with a noose around my neck and tried hanging myself from my doorknob. I feel like Iâ€™m drowning in life, Iâ€™ve made some fuck ups in my internship and my uni grades are suffering from my neglect. I donâ€™t know how to get help. I donâ€™t know how I should ask my parents for help. I donâ€™t have friends close enough to talk to about how i feel. I donâ€™t even understand why I feel this way myself. Idk Iâ€™m tired and donâ€™t think I can keep going day to day anymore.
