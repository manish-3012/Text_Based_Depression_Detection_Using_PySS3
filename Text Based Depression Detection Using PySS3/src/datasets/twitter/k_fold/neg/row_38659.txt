About to fail all my uni classes, time to goI'm about to fail at least two of my classes, which means getting kicked out of school for 2 semesters. This has happened before, but I dropped out of the semester before it was too late and came back 1 semester later. 

When it happened the first time, I was sure I was going to end my life. Wrote a note and everything. When I didn't and came back, for a second things were actually getting better but clearly that's no longer the case.

I have nothing going for me anymore, and I'm about to get kicked out of my school (again), which probably means losing my summer internship. I go to an Ivy uni and the pressure to do good when I'm just a lazy horrible failure is immense.

I feel like I'm just one of those people who don't have what it takes to remain here on this Earth; I am not an enduring individual. I've been suicidal a lot of my life and self harm deliberately where no one can see. I've always thought that I'd die by suicide at some point.

So I'll finish this group project for Zoom University (can't leave the team hanging), bring my friend a housewarming gift, clean up my room so my parents don't have much to do, and then take every pill I can find with some vodka. There's just no feasible path forward from this failure (again).

I'm weirdly at peace with it all, almost happy. Like thank god I'm done. It was a good try!
