I feel like I'm drowning inside.Sorry if this doesn't make any sense at all.

For the past few months, I've been having increasingly violent and frequent suicidal thoughts. It's hard for me to get up during the day, and I'm honestly tired of putting on a charade that everything is fine to everyone.

I don't find life enjoyable anymore. I don't like spending time with people anymore. Work feels pointless, and my life feels like its stagnant with no clear sign of change coming. 

At first, I was kind of dismissive of killing myself because I had convinced myself that it's something that only crazy people did. But now it feels like I cannot go longer than five minutes without fantasizing about offing myself, and it feels like its only getting worse the more I'm alone.

I feel like I'm incapable of doing anything right. I ruin close relationships with people, and now I'm at a point in my life where family and what I thought were my best friends don't want anything to do with me anymore. Sometimes I think that I'm a poison that'll fuck up anything that I touch.

I honestly feel like just giving up, but I felt like I owed myself at least an attempt to talk to someone else who might understand what I'm feeling before I act on anything. I feel like I used to be normal and I don't know what happened or how to dig myself out of this pit I can't climb out of.

Thanks for spending the time to read this, and if you're going through something similar I sincerely hope everything works out for you.
