I can't take it anymoreWhat's the best way that's the least painful? I can't take it anymore, I almost jumped in front of a train today.... Something healed me back from doing it. Nothing has ever gotten better, and I never really feel happy... Not for long at least. I've felt like shit for over a month now. I've been to a doctor for this and I've been told there's nothing wrong with me. I'm 27 and I don't even think I can make it much longer. Life has tormented me for far too long. 

Lock this if you have too... I don't care more.
