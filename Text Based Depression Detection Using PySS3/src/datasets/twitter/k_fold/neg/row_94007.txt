What to do about suicidal thoughts in the wake of some else's suicide?My friend killed himself back in November, presumably after finding himself in a position where he felt like he couldn't continue living (mental illness, trouble holding down a relationship, trouble holding down employment etc.) It destroyed everyone who loved him, and we're all really having a hard time dealing with it even still.

My problem is that I find myself in a similar state. I'm 32, have been out of work since last summer and my partner is basically supporting me. I can't get an interview for anything that isn't a pyramid scheme/high-pressure, commission-only sales environment. I am constantly losing and I am finding impossible to get my life back on track. The temptation to kill myself is getting stronger and it calls out to me constantly... like an hour can't go by without me picturing killing myself or thinking about it. I have several ways in which I would go about doing it... I'd just leave a note and go missing.

My problem is that I've "survived" (I'm sorry, but I don't know a better word for this) a friend killing himself. I've seen what it does. I've felt it. I don't want to hurt anyone like that, but I'm starting to feel like it wouldn't matter because I won't be around to experience the guilt anyway... 

I'm stuck and I'm desperate. I'm scared. I don't know what to do anymore.
