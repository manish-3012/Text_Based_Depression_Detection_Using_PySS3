House mate has been acting manic lately and like clockwork he locked himself in the bathroom with a knife.J got drunk and instigated a fight with his partner, B. Things were bitchy and funny and then all of a sudden J goes into the other room and starts violently making out with B and bending over for him presenting himself and then slapping him when he refuses to have sex. They both leave separately and I am on the phone with my sister complaint about being in the middle of all this when J  returns to apologize very lucidly and mentions heâ€™s going to take a long bath. A very loooong bath. And then locks me out on the patio while I am smoking. 

Of course I know what this means. Last time he did this he took a knife with him and only made threats of harm. And this time again it was only the threat. I took away the block of knifes but there was still one missing. He ran to his car and I met him there first. Then he kept running. He returned again and things had calmed down. He was cancelling credit cards and ripping up bills. I figured whatever it takes to get him to go to bed. 

After J went to bed I called the suicide hotline for advice. Eventually referred to a local university. And because of his history and to my knowledge he has never gone to a therapist or doctor about this. He claims his family pediatrician said just to change his diet and make a work out journal. Anyways I was worried he would not make any appointments or actually keep them with a psychiatrist and they kind of worked me up into a panic and I decided to call an ambulance so they could asses his vital signs. 

But instead the police came and not an ambulance. J had gone to sleep. And the situation had calmed down. I wanted the paramedics to see him not the police. But eventually they actually convinced him to see the ambulance who took him to the hospital voluntarily. Heâ€™s drunk and canâ€™t be out on any kind of hold theyâ€™re told me. 

I just couldnâ€™t bear waking up to find him hurt or dead. I donâ€™t care if heâ€™s mad at me but I still want reassurance it was the right thing to do.
