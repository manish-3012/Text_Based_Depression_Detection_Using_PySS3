My 28th Birthday may very well be my last day.I'm giving myself an ultimatum. If I'm not feeling better by my 28th birthday I'm killing myself. That's another 1.5 years, so that's enough time for some improvement. Otherwise it'll be 3/4 years of turmoil with no hope, and all despair and dread. I refuse to live like that.
