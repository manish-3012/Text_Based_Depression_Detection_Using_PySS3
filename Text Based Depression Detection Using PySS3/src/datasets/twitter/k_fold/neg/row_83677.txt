Here's why Bohemian Rhapsody is my favorite song ever.Just for this line that echoes to me so fucking much :
Mama, I don't wanna die... I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

I feel like I hate my parents because it is their fault if I'm alive. I also feel sad because I feel this way about them.


I wish you the best. For real.
