My favorite singer committed suicide two days ago and I might tooMy favorite singer of all time, Jonghyun, committed suicide two days ago.

I canâ€™t believe this is happening. I canâ€™t believe this is happening. I canâ€™t breathe. I hate that he brought happiness to so many people and he wasnâ€™t happy himself. I canâ€™t believe this.

His smile got me through days that I couldnâ€™t find the motivation to get up and go to school. His songs made me feel better when nothing else could. I was a fan since I was twelve years old. I grew up listening to him.

I canâ€™t believe this is happening. I just want to rewind time. I donâ€™t want to be here, in this world, where Kim Jonghyun isnâ€™t alive. I wish he was happy. I wish someone had helped him.This isnâ€™t fair. I want to die too. Please someone talk to me Iâ€™m scared I might hurt myself...Iâ€™m 16f by the way
