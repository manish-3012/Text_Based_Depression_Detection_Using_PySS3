I can't do it anymore.So I don't really do this posting thing all to well. I am also not one to openly share my emotions or feelings but I have no where eles to go anymore.

I have just been removed from a five year realtionship with one of the best human beings in the world. They were the light of my life and the driving force behind everything I did. Somewhere along the lines I lost sight of that, I pushed them away and became cold and distant. Why I did this I cannot rightly say, part of me was curious if something else was out there, another part was terrified. I had never let someone get this close to me before. 

Now they are gone and I have nothing left to give, I can't eat, I can't sleep, everything that used to bring me joy in life is gone. All I want is to have them back in my life, if one could call what I have a life anymore.
