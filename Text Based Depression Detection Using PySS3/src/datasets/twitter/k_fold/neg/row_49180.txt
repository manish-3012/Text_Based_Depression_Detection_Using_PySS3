I just dont know that I have it in me to keep tryingI have been through so much this year. I got divorced, quit my job in hopes of a new one, moved away, lost touch with my friends and dont see my family. Yesterday I got fired... I cant tell you how empty  I feel. I've run out of resources.. and I'm tired of bothering everyone else with how I feel. Not sure what to do from here.
