Please don't ignore this, I am going through some stuff right now.I can't fucking stand looking at myself in the mirror, my face is round and my cheeks are too chubby. It's a fucking baby face and I see kids younger than me who are able to have defined jawlines, clear skin etc. But no, not me I have moderate acne and I have psoriasis which is starting to flare up. I try to look after myself, but it gets fucking hard getting out of bed and actually looking after myself when I wish that all of this would go away. 

They say I look like my Dad, as if it were a positive aspect, even though he left me when I was a baby. So what? I'm supposed to be grateful for looking like someone who not only was a deadbeat, but also that I should be grateful that I have to look bad for something I couldn't control. I just want to get plastic surgery ASAP. The only reason why I'm working so hard (or at least trying) is to get enough money to fix this shit. I feel so anxious that I feel like when people talk to me, it's out of pity. Why would you talk to someone who looks ugly? My personality doesn't match my body; I can be aspirational, confident at times (shocking right?) , and empathetic. But then I'm a 6'2, slightly chubby piece of shit and whilst that could potentially be fixed, why the fuck is it so hard for me. I swim about 1.5 - 2 miles a week and I eat okay and I can't lose weight. And if I were to get plastic surgery etc., I know that my family would disapprove it, despite that my siblings look so much better than me, seriously. It's not even my family, but my mum, how would she look at me.

But on the other hand this can't happen any longer. It's like my reputation is based on looks when I'm so much more. I want to cry but no one would care because *where's the reward when it isn't a cute "depressed" girl to help?* I get judged for being nice, as if I were trying to get some. Could any of you give me your thoughts on plastic surgery. It pisses me off how I would get criticised, like I'm forced to stay this way but others who are naturally fit get to have a good life. I just can't keep going on.

I remember one time I was talking to someone and felt like I wanted to cry because I was thinking "no one would ever see me like the way they see other people " (i.e. romantically). I wanted to die, like I always have. But I cannot for certain personal reasons. Hence I am trying to choose the other method: work really hard and if things don't change I **will kill myself regardless of my morals &amp; the consequences etc.** But please, don't comment the bullshit of "you'll find someone who loves you for your personality". That is pity and that fucking beats me to the ground. I had a mini panic attack but I tried to contain it to write this. Opinions would be appreciated. I just wanted to make my mum happy and I still managed to fuck it up, no stories about countless girls, popularity, just a sorry piece of shit that my mum has to love. I feel so bad for her.
