28 and patheticIâ€™ve had it.
By the end of this year I am going to end my life. 
Iâ€™m a loser who lives at home.
I have incurred 90,000 dollars in education debt.
I have not learned anything in college and graduate school in spite of being in school for 10 years, probably because I made the mistake of studying subjects I am not interested in. Also because I have adhd. Right now Iâ€™m struggling to get a masters in education. Iâ€™m probably going to fail my student teaching because I have never really studied properly for any of my classes. I still live with my mom who is close to retirement age. I am 28 and completely financially dependent on my mother. I have never been able to take college or graduate school seriously. If I am not going to change now when will I? Iâ€™m tired of being such a failure. There is no point to my life anymore. Iâ€™ve spent the last 28 years living off my mom working dead end jobs. I am not going to do that forever. If I cannot be a independent functioning adult than I am ending everything soon.
