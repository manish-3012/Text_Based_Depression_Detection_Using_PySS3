my boyfriend says heâ€™s done after summerhe says heâ€™s done and he canâ€™t take it anymore. heâ€™s in so much pain and heâ€™s convinced himself that it wonâ€™t get better. a while back his ex blamed him for her suicide and heâ€™s never been able to accept that it wasnâ€™t his fault. he says heâ€™s going in the fall, I thought he was getting better but heâ€™s not. he told me that he knows Iâ€™m going to call the police when he tries and heâ€™s going to unfairly hate me for it.  heâ€™s in therapy but he doesnâ€™t believe itâ€™ll work. I donâ€™t know how to help him. I donâ€™t know if I can at this point and I feel horrible asking him to keep going because things might get better. I hate seeing him in pain. heâ€™s told me that heâ€™s only held on this long because he doesnâ€™t want to hurt me. but I know you can only live for others for so long. I donâ€™t know what to do, I just know I donâ€™t want him to kill himself, if anybody has anything they think might help/has been in a similar situation, please let me know. appreciate it.
