I feel like suicide is inevitable for me, I just havenâ€™t found the courage to go through with it yet, the world wasnâ€™t made for everyoneItâ€™s been years since I knew I didnâ€™t want to be alive anymore, finding the courage to end it all is really fucking hard though, Iâ€™m just too much of a pussy to do it, I donâ€™t know why though, I have absolutely 0 reason to be alive but for some reason I canâ€™t pull myself to end it and just put up with this mental torture for years on end, itâ€™s super frustrating, sorry for ranting
