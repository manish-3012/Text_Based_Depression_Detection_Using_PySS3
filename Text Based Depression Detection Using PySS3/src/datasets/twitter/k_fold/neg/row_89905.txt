Apethetic, druggie mess.Fuck this!

Been using opiodes since 13 and ready to kill myself. I'm failing school, the teachers pull me to one side to ask "whats going on, you used to be good in lesson now all you do is mess around" i can't tell them I'm waiting for friday so i can do opioides. I'm apethetic as fuck, no one wants to be around me so i just haven't left the house in a month other than to go to school. Everyone around me just gets on with life, gets girlfriends go's out on the weekends not me I'm stuck between four walls. Your going to tell me its all ok and and i can talk to you just like the last time, but i don't want to talk to you but at the same time i do. My mind is fucked from the drugs. I'm ending it now
