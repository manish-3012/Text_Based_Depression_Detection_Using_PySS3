I have messed up my life and it just hit me.I cant say I ever thought I would be this low. Story as follows:

18 months ago I started dating this girl who I fell deeply in love with. She meant everything to me and I meant everything to her. In the last 6 months I started feeling low and could never figure out why. I wanted to tell her but didnt want to seem weak (Stupid logic, I know) But I eventually started doing things I never would have done. I started smoking (Which she hates) and I have always been good with computers so I figured a way to edit stocktake at work and accounts so I soon accumulated about 15k cash. None of this she knew.

I started to realising I was killing the relationship by keeping secrets so I decided to get rid of the money by putting it towards a university course. I pretty much quit smoking and I was feeling better but then my close uncle killed himself on christmas eve and it tore me apart. I then felt low again and told my girlfriend everything and we broke up. She says she loves me but I dont want to be with her when I am this low. So now I lie in bed everynight thinking about how to kill myself. I dont know who to talk to and cant see a way I can fix anything. I just dont want to be alive. Everything I have done in the last year has been a bad decision. I tried the "Give it a week" thing but I still feel the same. I'm so angry at myself and dont see a point anymore. I have punched holes in the wall to get my anger out. Posting for help on reddit is literally my last option and hope. Otherwise if I cant find a way to fix things...
