Nothing has meaning and suffering is real.I know for a fact that everything we do is meaningless. Work is meaningless, love is fake and meaningless, happiness is fleeting and meaningless, suffering is long and enduring but still meaningless. 

People say that I should aim for the highest possible good to give my life meaning, but I just don't think that anything "good" is worth pursuing, because I'll never get it anyways (and if I somehow magically do achieve it, it will still be meaningless)

Also, every day fucking sucks. I don't just enjoy time as it passes. It is painful. Every hour I'm alive is an hour that isn't worth living. I try to be thankful for the lack of suffering I sometimes have, but thankfulness is also fleeting and meaningless.

I'm taking psych drugs now and I saw a doctor for this. He just said I'm bipolar. Weird though, considering that the closest I get to becomming manic is when I can get out of bed without wishing I was never born.

Now, I don't feel as much negative emotion, but I can't logically come up with a reason to live besides dying might hurt.
