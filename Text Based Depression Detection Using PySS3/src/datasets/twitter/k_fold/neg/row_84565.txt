Tonight is my last night.I was kicked out at the end of January by my parents, who have been abusing me all my life. I had to crash on a friend's couch for a week until I moved into my own room in a shared apartment. During this time, I've been trying hard to look for a second job in addition to the one I have (only 8 hours a week). I had managed to find a job, but they let me go after less than 2 weeks, refusing to say why. I've also been trying to apply for welfare but thanks to my intake worker having a shitty phone, I couldn't contact her and they cancelled my application because it was considered "inactive." I tried applying again today and it didn't work because the system's changed, requiring a bunch of documents I don't have. I'm ashamed of being a homeless piece of shit. I'm ashamed of being abused. I'm ashamed of needing welfare. I'm ashamed of being fired. I'm ashamed of not being able to find a job. I'm pathetic, lonely, and too fucked up to live in this world anymore. I absolutely cannot stand how unfair my life is and I'm going to be ending it tonight. I don't have a supportive family, all my friends are shitty and clueless (assuming my life can't be that hard because they're all living comfortably), and I've proven that I can't take care of myself. There's no point in living anymore.
