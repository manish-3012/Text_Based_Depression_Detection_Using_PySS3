What's the point? It's hopeless.I'm losing my Trial. Neither phone company will respond to the subpoena since i'm a private party.

What's the point in living? It's pretty much hopeless. I don't have an exact suicide date, nor am i sure if i want to try again. My last two attempts got me into ICU. . . And Catheters are fucking horrible. It's likely that I will be found and saved before i can be successful.

I dislike the idea of a violent death. Because my family atleast should be able to have an open casket at my funeral.

But at this point, what is the point? At the moment i'm considering ODing on DPHM and going for a swim in the lake.

I just fail to see a reason to keep going. by the time the trial will be over i will effectively have lost my youth.
