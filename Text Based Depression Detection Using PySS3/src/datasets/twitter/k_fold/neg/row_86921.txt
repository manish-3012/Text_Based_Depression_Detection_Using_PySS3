I just scare myself with my thoughts.I find myself thinking about suicide at nearly all times.  I never thought I would really have the guts to do such a thing, but lately it seems easier than it has seemed before. I look back on my life and see nothing but things going wrong because of me or my actions. I don't want to be a burden to my family any longer, but I also understand the burden of me not being around and people missing me... I don't really know what to do. I also know that I can't live my life in fear of myself at all times. I understand that I'm a very privileged child and I always have been and that there are people that have it way worse than me with problems they have to deal with. It's still feels like a thousand pounds at all times. I don't know what to do and it's scares me that I don't. Please help.
