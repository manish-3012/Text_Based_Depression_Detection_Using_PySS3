I don't know how long I can be in pain every nightWeight on the chest, sometimes stabbing sometimes like little lightnings into the arms and fingers. The pain is purely mental, the body is fine physically. I am a medical student in my final year, I know that there is nothing that can help me. What I'd need would be to be held like a small child by a parent at night. But there is no one who could do that. I am alone and I just want to die.
