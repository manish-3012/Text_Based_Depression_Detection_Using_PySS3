Suicidal without a real reasonI have had suicidal toughts for a long time now. I had a breakup lats year, but after that at first it started to get better. But now I am totally hopeless, and I don't have a reason for it. I am 23 year old girl, doing well in school. I have friends who like me, I have a family, I have enough money to live. Okay, I don't have a relationship, but I should be okay by myself. But still, it hurts to exist... There are days when I cry a lot, can't breathe, like my bad mood causes real pain. I hate it, I don't know the reason and I can't sotp it. I am seeing a therapist, but it doesn't look like it helps. I am thinking of ways to die all day, I just can't do it myself. I feel like I need a final push, something to get the courage to do it.
