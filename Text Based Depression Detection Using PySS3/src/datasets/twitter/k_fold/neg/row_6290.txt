I just tried to hang myselfMy parents are very abusive. We had a fight and my mom hit me so I went to my room. I've had suicidal thoughts for about two years. Not thinking what I was doing, I got a rope and tried to hang myself but it slipped off the hook. I'm still in my room and no one knows about this. I think it has been 45 minutes now.

I don't want to die. I just want out of here. I have no idea what to do now. Am I going crazy? What should I do? Please don't think I'm a troll. I need help
