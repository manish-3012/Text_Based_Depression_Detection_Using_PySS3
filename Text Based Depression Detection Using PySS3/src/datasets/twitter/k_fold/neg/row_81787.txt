A rather comforting realisation...Im a 15 year old who's been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I take medication for both and have had a lot of shit with school and my wellbeing. 

I always used to hide away and think how pointless everything is and how it doesn't matter one way or the other. I still believe in that but i have a new perspective on it. The way i see it now is i am free to experience different aspects of life and see what I create of this. 

And the most comforting part of this stems from my fear of having a shit life. Which is that when all is over, nothing will matter either way...

Opinions on my ideas?
