Better to be honest with others and tell them the plans, or slowly disappear out of their lives and make it look like an accident.So, I'm done, no more questions asked.

I'm just wondering if I should just be 100% honest with everyone, not beat around the bush, and just let everyone know I am planning on killing myself, and that there really is nothing they can say or do to change anything, which will probably result in a few upset people... Or, if I should pretend like everything is fine, tell everyone I'm moving away for something different, slowly drift out of contact and then make it look like an accident. People will still be upset, just not as much in my opinion.

I'm not interested in hearing anyone say things get better, not to go through with it, or to get some help, so if that's all you've got to say, take it somewhere else.

Opinions?
