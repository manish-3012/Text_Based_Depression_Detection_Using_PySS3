I went from laughing everyday as a child to feeling numb as an adultI donâ€™t know anymore.... I canâ€™t feel anything, I canâ€™t connect with anyone.  Today I finally understood the reason I feel so numb, I realized people arenâ€™t there forever and everyone leaves. Iâ€™m a terrible person honestly.... I sleep with so many girls and cheat when Iâ€™m in a relationship. I donâ€™t want to be in my body anymore or on this planet. The one girl that was there I fucked up with her and she wonâ€™t ever talk to me again. Iâ€™m not writing this to throw a pity party for myself, just because I donâ€™t have anyone to say goodbye too. Whoever reads this please donâ€™t say it all gets better and stuff like that because life doesnâ€™t work that way..... At least I got to say goodbye to someone.
