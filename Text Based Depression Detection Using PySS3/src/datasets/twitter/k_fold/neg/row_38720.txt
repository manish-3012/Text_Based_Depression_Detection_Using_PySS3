i love my parents but life isnt fairno one told me life would be fair. hell, ive been shown quite the opposite of that matter. however, having thought about how my life has been for the past seven or eight years since moving to another state, its just been downright sucky. my parents are the kindest, most thoughtful people i know. my mom has been through fucking HELL and my dad just wants to make people happy. my mother gave up her dream to be a vet, then gave up her dream of finishing cosmetology because she needed to help our family when things got tough after losing our house. she got a housekeeping job at a hotel, where people were so fucking rude to her. she then got hired at a school where an unbelievably racist lady ruined her life and health, my mother's body is still suffering to this day from the hardships she endured there. i have seen my mom become the once happy, young lady she was to a woman who is struggling to stay awake. her childhood was hell, and after hearing so much about it i had only hoped that her adulthood could be better. my father worked for a company that ended up owing him money before we lost our house. i barely got to see him as a child, so him losing that job and spending more time with us when we moved was more than just an obstacle. i had to get used to seeing and speaking to a man i barely knew. he was so closed off, he couldn't trust much after we moved. at this point, you're probably wondering where i am getting at. my family has been the only thing there for me in the past seven years. i tried to kill myself two years ago and they were obviously the only ones who tried and cared. they are the only ones who truly teared up at the thought. even when i say the most selfish things and do shit that hurts them, they're still here. and, yet, people have the fucking audacity to think i should be worried about their opinion or the way they think of me. if i were to decide one day that laying in bed was what i needed to do for the next two weeks, my mom would be the first to notice, not some stupid little bitch on snapchat who decided that my message was "too dry" to reply to. if i were to cry in a corner and want to die again, my dad would be the first one to care, not some dumbass boy at school or work or fucking wherever who is too addicted to weed or sex to care about anyone else. this whole thing is gonna sound so motherfucking high and mighty and im sorry but ive just come to this realization late at night that i've been caring for the longest about others that don't matter when i should be caring about the people who raised me and wanted the best for me. i don't like hanging with people without my family, and i've always thought i was "childish" for that. but, fuck it, maybe i am. so what? i love my family and i want my focuses to be on them, on the people who wanted me to survive even if it meant disappointing them a little. i dont want to look back at my younger years and see the faces of people who didnt give a fuck whether i was suicidal or not. i dont want to look back and see people *questioning if my suicidal thoughts are suicidal enough to be taken seriously.* i wanna look back and remember that my mom worried about me. that my dad worried about me. that my brother had a nightmare the night before i tried to kill myself of me dying. i want to remember that the only people who ever really cared for me are my family and they are all i **fucking need.**

**TL;DR:** Life isn't fair, I love my family, and I don't need anyone else.
