I'm probably going to kill myself if my move doesn't work out.I moved out my city because my parents were causing me a lot of issues, including people in my smaller town making things harder for me too. I have been slandered by others to the point I am agoraphobic/anthropophobic and feel uncomfortable in most situations. I deal with a lot of self esteem issues where I believe anyone I meet already doesn't like me and that I'm not good enough for them; I feel unintelligent and ugly pretty much, even though everyone says otherwise. (I think it's petty, but it's hard to get over what I think about myself.)

Dealing with all this plus the loss of several family members has brought me to another depression that I'm having a hard time struggling through. Two gay online friends offered me a place to live while I find a job, I only have money for two months of food and I'm very scared, but I felt like it was the only way to break through what I have been dealing with. I have a hard time getting a job in public in my home town since I can't go out without the fear of someone going up to me and hitting me or embarrassing me on purpose. I know it isn't because I provoke it and with several other teen deaths due to them experiencing the same thing I am going through really scares me. I don't feel uncomfortable in other cities though, it's just mine that is really known for that.

The money I had to make my move was made selling nearly everything I own besides my phone and my computer, which kind of hurts. I feel like I'm ripping my arms and legs off to get to where I want to, but everything always seems to slip back to where it hurts. 

If this doesn't work, I would rather just end my life so I don't have to deal with struggling anymore. 

Edit: Had to edit this up, the first time I submitted this it came up really awkward.
