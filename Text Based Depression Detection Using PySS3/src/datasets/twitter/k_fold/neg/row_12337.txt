I lost herIâ€™m 16 sheâ€™s 16 weâ€™ve been dating for almost 7 months in a long distance relationship... yesterday her mom took her phone... I donâ€™t wana go into detail but it was normal teenager shit.... I donâ€™t know how long her phones gone... it could be for good... and... sheâ€™s taking away me seeing her this November.. meaning next time Iâ€™ll see her is April 2019.... Iâ€™ve lost everything I feel like... she was my world and... I have nothing to live for now... Iâ€™m not even exaggerating.... I donâ€™t have anything fucking left.... say what you want itâ€™s a high school relationship.... but... she was... ugh idek... my point is... cutting, painkillers, and starving myself no longer works. And as the days go on I feel more and more inclined to end it all....
