most painless way to die?i'm a failure to everyone, it's about time I go.  my long-time close friend betrayed me in unforgivable ways, and i tried to help someone i cared about but instead i probably ruined the friendship forever and scarred them for life, and my ex beated me up a couple days ago

so yea, that's a shitty summary of my week. i hope i die in my sleep.
