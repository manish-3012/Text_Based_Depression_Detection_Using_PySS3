Trying to stay strong. Im not sure how much i can take.Its a long story. I guess im just venting. But im not sure what to do anymore. 

Im an eighteen year old guy,whos had a rough life. 
Abandoned by my real father,stepfather abused me,closest thing i had to a dad committed suicide,family drug problems. 

Last April i met a girl. I cant even tell you how hard i fell for her. She told me i wouldnt stay with her because she was bipolar. I didnt care. She was sweet,caring and beautiful. The kind of person id spend my life with. Over time,she slowly changed. 
Weve been together for almost ten months. 
I dont have a job,but im going to college for radiology in the fall. I have no license,because i have no social security card. Which ive been trying to get but its hard. 

My girlfriend tears me down all the time. 
Shes told me she likes other guys,and other guys want to sleep with her. Shes told me im not a man. Shes told me my dad killed himself over me.
She tells me everyday that im a loser with no friends. That all my friends are pretending to like me. She constsntly makes me feel so small. Then after a while i yell at her. Because its so hard. Shes beautiful. Im average,at best. She said im annoying. No girl will ever love me and i should consider myself lucky to have her. 

I cant take much more. I just want her to love me. I want a life with her. Its just so hard...she wont message me back. She said she has no time for "broke niggas". How can she go from being perfect to hating me in just a few months...

I have no self worth anymore. I dont bother to shave or dress nice. I feel so low. I dont think i want to live anymore. Im useless as fuck and i cant take it.
