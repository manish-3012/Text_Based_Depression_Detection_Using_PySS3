I got caught with illegal xanax at school.I have been using drugs to fix me over the past few months. Weed and xanax were what I used. Now I know drugs are not the best thing for handling issues due to addiction, I've been very strong about it. Working hard not to be addicted. 

I would occasionally would take more that needed because well honestly it was fucking fun, but I wouldn't do it often because I wasn't stupid and wanted to just occasionally have fun.

Weed and xanax just saved me. I wanted to die. I wanted to not go on, but both of those finally let me talk to people and live a life where I don't feel like a huge piece of shit.

I got caught when or where I don't know, but all I knew at around 7:30 ish 3 deans came to my class and pulled me away. I just broke down explaining how it helped me feel normal. I couldn't stop crying I just let almost all of it all out. I was driven in a ambulance. Took me to a hospital. Btw my mom works at said hospital. The had me pee in a cup drew blood etc. Mom came there yadadayada.

They way everyone has been reacting just makes me want to die I dont wanna be hear anymore.
