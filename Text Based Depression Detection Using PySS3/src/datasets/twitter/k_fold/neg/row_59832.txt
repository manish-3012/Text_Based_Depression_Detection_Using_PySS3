and everytime i get drunk just to cope with everything (like today) that had happened so far i just thought to myself if ever i do end it now will i finally be happy ?trauma counselling and everything, i am still having a hard time moving on from from the abuse that my parents did and after explaining to old friends the reason why i pushed them away they finally understood me. 

before my grandparents finally succumbed to schizophrenia then died  they finally told me that what happened to me up to now can now be finally compared with theirs and they finally understood and they told me that the only way to forget such things is to just drink

and the only reason why i never liked my parents is that they made me go through such hardships and they even get to quote the bible to justify everything they did 

and they even got the audacity to listen in to my conversations up to now and i have been nothing but truthful to them till last 2 years ago, crazy cousins of mine asked me to go out with them and even told shit about my parents along the way  

and when parents found out they had me thrown under the bus for a good number of occasions 
what made me hate them even more is that 

accdg to friends who i really became close with, they have been telling stories about me including the ones that are suppose to stay within the family. 

they even got the courage to say it in front of my face in form of a joke and the reason why i became the laughing stock. 

i mean i was never the sociable type and i get picked on 
i finally became the sociable type and everything gets out and i finally became both a laughing stock and butt of jokes. 

including my part time work before with at&amp;t being a rep and all
