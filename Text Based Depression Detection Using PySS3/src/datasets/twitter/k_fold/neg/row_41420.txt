I can't think of a titleI'm 17 and this is my second time posting. I'm so scared. 
    I've been mentally sick since grade school and keep trying to fix it but can't keep it away. The voice in my head just doesn't shut up anymore. It will never stop telling me how I'm not good enough to deserve happiness.
   I'm in love with my best friend but she's in a healthy and happy relationship. I couldn't be happier for her because she's just glowing every time she sees him. But I'm alone. I have been for about a year and a half now after an emotionally abusive relationship. That relationship changed the way I view interactions with people and certainly not for the better. I'm constantly second guessing relations with others and probably overthinking what are nothing more than passing comments or a funny jokes.
    I've actually puked at the sight of my own appearance. Somewhere in my head I know I'm not that bad looking and only average at the least. But every time I look in the mirror I see a monster. A monster that lusts for intimacy despite knowing that'll I'll only hurt whoever I'm with with my depression, low self worth, and connection to my best friend.
     I just want it all to stop. I want to stop worrying about if I'll get into my dream college or if I'll even like it if I do get in. I want that stupid asshole in my head to shut up. I want to see a person in the mirror instead of this grotesque monster I wake up to every morning. I want to know what true love is.
     But it isn't going to stop. It isn't going to get better. There will always be some problem with me that I'm to much of a pussy to handle. I'll always see a monster in the mirror.
     I'm so scared to end it. But it's the only way to stop.
