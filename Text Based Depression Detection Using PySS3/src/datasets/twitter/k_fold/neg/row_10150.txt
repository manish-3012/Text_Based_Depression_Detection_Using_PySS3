Wow life can be toughSpent the last few months expending all my energy on trying to be fine. But its just getting too much now.

I'm scared of living but also scared of dying so caught in between.

It's just getting tiring to be alive now and I'm scared of what I might do. Pushed most of friends away so when I go they will be okay. 

Dunno why i am posting here. Last resort or something.
