I'm really sad tonightSorry, I just need to ramble and stop crying into my pillow for a bit. 

I'm 20 years old, I have no job and do not go to school, so I'm effectively a NEET. I don't have a driver's license. My daily routine is basically wake up, play video games and then go back to sleep. I do almost nothing else with my time. It's been this way since I graduated. When I'm not being some useless degenerate I talk to my best friend and she distracts me from how hollow I feel inside. I don't want to talk to her about any of this because she's already stressed enough in life and I don't want to burden her anymore with my stupid state of mind. I have great friends who genuinely do care about me, my parents love me and my life honestly doesn't seem too bad which makes me hate myself even more. I don't even have a real excuse to feel this way yet I do. I hate that I'm like this when others actually have real problems that make them feel this way. My life had so much potential and I did nothing with it. I'm just a waste of skin. I leech off of my dad and I don't contribute to society, much less our household. He deserves better. Everyone in my life deserves better. I don't want to call a hotline because I don't want them to come to my house and take me away and then have my dad foot the bill. I don't even want him to know I'm like this, it'd destroy him. He and my best friend are the only reasons I haven't done it yet. They deserve someone so much better than this sad little bitch. I wish I was never born and someone else took my place who could've lived my life better. But that didn't happen and I'm unfortunately here.
