Thank you to everyone who gave me kind words last week.Iâ€™m not sure if i am allowed to do this so please remove my post if there is any problems what so ever.
Last week i had posted that i felt hopeless, that i ruined my relationship and felt like i wouldnâ€™t be able to fix it... i feel extremely thankful to anyone who commented and validated my feelings. My love and i have been working to patch up our problems; and although it will take some time, things have been going so good now and it makes my heart warm. I got to meet his best friend from out of state this week for the first time since weâ€™ve been together. I get to meet his mother for the first time in less than two weeks. He just ordered me an early birthday gift, a couple ring engraved w/ our names and birth stones. On the inside he wrote â€œyou complete me,â€ and tomorrow we are going to pick out a fish (our first pet together, which he knows i have wanted.)
The bottom line is, iâ€™m grateful that this group gave me such caring advice. Iâ€™m grateful i pulled through even if i didnt want to. Iâ€™m forever grateful iâ€™m in love with my best friend. Thank you.
