my last vacationI planned a 7-days trip with my best friend a few months ago. I knew that by the time of the trip Iâ€™ll get another depressive episode. This was about 6 months ago. 

I had suicidal thoughts from the age of 10 bit in the back of my mind I always knew that Iâ€™ll never do it. Well a month ago I had two attempts. But still didnâ€™t really want to kill myself and thatâ€™s why I failed. But this trip changed everything. Iâ€™m dreaming about killing myself every single day of this trip in most serious way. 

I didnâ€™t have high hopes for this trip at all, thatâ€™s what years of depression taught me. To not get your hopes up for anything. And still this trip managed to disappoint me. 

Iâ€™m realizing that my best friend and I are completely different. That I donâ€™t like her. But somehow still love her. Sheâ€™s the only friend I have. And she says things that hurt a lot in a joking manner. It feels like I donâ€™t have a right to be offended cause it was just a â€˜jokeâ€™. She doesnâ€™t notice or care that those words hurt me. But then she says she loves me and starts being nice to me and i just forgive her until next time. Yeah I also have BPD

 Iâ€™m also constantly envious of her cause sheâ€™s pretty, funny and wants to live whereas Iâ€™ve complete given up. Iâ€™m not interested in anything anymore, not even in music, the only thing that was saving me. Now iâ€™m just numb and itâ€™s the worst. My life is falling apart and i donâ€™t care. I should be worried that Iâ€™m losing all the things that kept me alive but i donâ€™t care. And I know that she wonâ€™t understand, my parents wonâ€™t either. 

So I made a decision that as soon as i come home in 2 days Iâ€™ll kill myself. This sub is really great, I felt much better reading your experiences and understanding that iâ€™m not alone. But thatâ€™s not enough. Time to finish all of this mess. Guess this story was my goodbye to you guys and thank you, you all were great
