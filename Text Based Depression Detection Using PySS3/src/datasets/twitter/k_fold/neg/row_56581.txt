I hate livingNobody loves me, I decided to turn my life around and try and be friends with people starting with one of the nicest people I know and they just treated me like shit. Nobody at school cares for me except an old friend group that is just a reminder that I was a racist edgy piece of shit. My parents and a few friends care for me but they are annoying assholes who I know mean good but they are annoying soooo much and I just want to kill myself, each day I get up suffer, canâ€™t sleep till 1-3AM and repeat.
