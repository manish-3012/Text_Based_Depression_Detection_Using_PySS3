I need to get better before I can talk to people, but the loneliness is making it hardIt's so unbearable some days. How can I improve in life when I have no one to have a conversation with, let alone confide in.. The few family members I have are unstable and don't really care anyway. Is it fair to talk to people when I have so little to contribute? I know it's not, but I still need someone.
