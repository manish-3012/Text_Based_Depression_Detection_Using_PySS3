HELP!A best friend of mine is thinking suicidal, she had some problems with her family[they told her they hated her, etc] and just a lot of mean shit.

I don't know what to do since I'm overseas right now and I'm really scared. There is a good friend of hers who she also trusts, for now, I told her to speak with her.

P.S, One of my friends is also acting suicidal.
