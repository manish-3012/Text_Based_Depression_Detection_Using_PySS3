Mom compares me to people almost every single conversation for my whole lifeIt fucking drives me crazy, and she thinks she's motivating me to work my ass off. But in reality, it was a major factor of my basically non-existent self-esteem and extreme self-hatred. 
"Why can't you get a job?"
"Why can't you do as much schoolwork as x?"
"Look at him, he's such a good son. Why can't you be like him?"
"This is what this person did, and you should do better than her."

Every. Single. Fucking. Day.

It's like my mom expects me to be the perfect son. I know a lot of parents want their child to be their best but there are limits.
I can't live up to her expectations. At all. She wants me to be a billionaire when I grow up and give her most of my money. 
I can't do it. 
I don't even want to live another day. 
I grew to be extremely depressed, extremely suicidal, and bipolar.
One day, I just want to say, "Hey mom, did all these people ever do this?"
And just blow my fucking brains out with a shotgun.
