Sometimes...I don't know how to speak English, I will try to be very simple with my words

I am 23 years old

As a child I was sexually abused,But I never told my parents or brother Now they know and even know about my sexual preferences

More than feeling "helped" everything has gone from bad to worse.

First of all I must say I have no friends, for multiple reasons But the main one is that I am a very depressive person and I feel like I am a toxic person that drives people away So I feel so much better in my loneliness.

I'm fighting with my brother, he takes drugs and him use my abuse to make my parents feel bad simply because he doesn't want help, Separate point my mother has suicidal tendencies.

My father is the worst man I have ever met, he was abusive to my whole family, even abuse my mother,Even with all this my mother never reported it she even wants to come back with him.

I don't want to know anything about him, but my sister always wants to go with him and even forces me to visit him She constantly threatens me that she is going to kill herself, she is not going to do it, she just does it to blackmail me.

I was always suck at school so I don't think I can have Decent work to keep me.

I have panic attacks and I'm tired of This

I am very tired of everything, I cannot ask for help and even if I asked nothing changes...

I'm waiting for March 20 for animal crossing and after that I think I'll kill myself
