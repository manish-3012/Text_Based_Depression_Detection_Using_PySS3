I've been seriously considering suicide this week. Debt pilling up, legal actions against me, no friends, and working at a dead-end job...Reddit can someone help me out here, I feel trapped!I understand this may or may not be the best suited sub-reddit, but I didn't know where else to go guys...I've always used Reddit as a source of reason when I've been having issues, but this week has been bad.

Back Story:

After I broke up with my fiance last year I got it in my head that I needed to move away and start fresh. I had never previously lived outside of my parents house, so the entire process was very foreign to me. I ended up moving two hours away from my home-town to a major metropolitan area and found a job there.

Since taking the new job (traveling service technician), I've gotten lots of parking tickets which I fell behind on paying, so I took out a loan which I defaulted on because I wasn't able to get the income in from my job. Long story short I'm thousands of dollars in debt, all from taking this stupid job. I was never in debt before, and now I"m stuck...literally.

I live by myself with no friends outside of work because I literally can't afford to do anything...I can't even turn my lights on because I can't afford the electric bill. It has gotten even worse this week with letter threatening legal action unless I pay my bills...I'm in this endless pickle.

I've seriously contemplated suicide this week, and I'm running out of ways to talk myself out of it, I'm struggling to see the positives.
Reddit, can anyone help me here? I'm not looking for pity or karma...I'm seriously looking for genuine help here.

note: I've exhausted all my other options seemingly....setting up payment plants, debt consolidation, etc...I feel trapped...posting on here I feel is really my last ditch effort to get help.
