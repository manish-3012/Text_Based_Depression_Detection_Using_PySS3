It's happening, I know how - just not the when.I'm just tired. I keep getting told things get better, I put my energy into other things and always *always* it falls apart.

Recently I started watching streamers because my ex decided he wanted to be one, and on the day I was supposed to fly over to his country, after 18 months post breakup supporting and caring for him, tells me he wants to stop talking because being around me hurts him after all the bad he's done to me. That's the short version.

Met some nice streamers, was entertained, felt part of something, all was well - for 4 days. 

My birthday wasn't just awful, it was downright miserable. My parents didn't care about the smallest things I asked for (just wanted something I liked for lunch and to make a cake, but it was okay if they'd bought the cake). They bought a cake THEY liked from THEIR favourite bakery, not mine and made fish, something THEY like and I...don't really. So between feeling lonely, hurting from my ex and overall struggling every birthday - I broke into tears. I got insulted, degraded and told to leave the table. Later on they called me back down for the cake. Some quick photos and a 5 second happy birthday from mum. No effort. No love. 

Then today some asshole brother of the streamer I watched decided to get into my personal life and relationship, and cause drama, claiming I was "being a bully". I've been nothing but nice, and giving, to the community and especially her sister. I helped her get the last few followers for affiliate, subbed and gifted a sub to a lovely girl straight away - I was always really nice yet somehow I'm a "bully" and it justfies these assholes bugging my ex and butting into my life.

Fuck people. Fuck being nice. Fuck life. I'm fucking done. It's not worth it.
