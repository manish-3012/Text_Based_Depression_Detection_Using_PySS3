Iâ€™m a toxic personI am diagnosed with BPD and am currently in therapy that feels/felt like I was getting somewhere for the first time in...forever. My closest friend is my ex and heâ€™s very supportive in my recovery even though towards the end of our relationship I hurt him deeply and often, something Iâ€™m still remorseful about to this day.

Among those things were issues I caused within his friendship group due to me â€œsplittingâ€ and seeing those people as against me. I know I was wrong even though those feelings felt rational at the time but he worries Iâ€™ll never get along with them and I donâ€™t see the point in trying to when they already dislike me. We had a huge argument about it last night because I said I didnâ€™t regret acting on my feelings...only the fallout which isnâ€™t true because I regret both but itâ€™s hard for me to admit iâ€™m wrong when I feel attacked.. 

The reason this matters is because we both had planned to be with each other again in the future but I feel like now Iâ€™ve ruined everything. 

He told me last night I havenâ€™t changed which hurt because I feel like iâ€™ve been doing so much better and communicating better and not acting on impulse..I just made a mistake last night.

I hate hurting the people I love and I know they will be better off without me because Iâ€™m toxic and manipulative and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever recover. Suicide is almost an act of kindness when it comes to me...itâ€™s like putting an animal down so it canâ€™t hurt anyone else.

I have pills but not enough to be fatal. In the past what stopped me was not wanting to traumatise someone by jumping in front of a train or jumping from a building and Iâ€™m sorry if I do but I need the guarantee that I will not wake up. My mother lives in a high rise with fire escapes, Iâ€™m going to her house tomorrow for a family event and Iâ€™ll be staying the night and in the early hours of the morning Iâ€™ll take the codeine I have and jump. Hopefully Iâ€™ll be so high I wonâ€™t feel the fear or the pain as my body hits the ground. 

I donâ€™t know how to say goodbye to the people iâ€™m leaving behind but I think itâ€™s best if I donâ€™t because they will only try to stop me like they have in the past and this time I canâ€™t fail
