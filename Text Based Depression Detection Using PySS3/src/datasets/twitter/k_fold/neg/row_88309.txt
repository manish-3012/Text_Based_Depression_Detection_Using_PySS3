Want to end it all soonI can't stand life, I constantly feel like shit and  I'm extremely anxious. I'm 18 and also a poly-addict. I feel like a burden to my family and friends. I just don't see the point in life even though I used to be extremely motivated and disciplined. These feelings have been going for years and I'm not sure why but I have an strong urge to kill myself:( sorry for wasting your time
