I want my mum/mom to know how I feel but she isn't the most open minded person.i have been struggling for a reason to keep pushing on for quite some time now and all has gone to waste, im miserable and i want it all to end. However there is a small part of me that wants to tell my mother about my struggles. She was raised in the 80's though and has had no experience with mental issues (depression, anxiety etc.) how do i tell her? Also as an fyi I hate confrontation...
