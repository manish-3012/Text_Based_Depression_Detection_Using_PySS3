AdviceSo Iâ€™ve finally gotten to a point where in the near future my life could be on track but Iâ€™m just so unhappy. I think about the future and it just seems like a fairy tale. I really just cannot fathom myself living past 25 and it really sucks because I really want to but life is just so incredibly hard and Iâ€™m just so weak. My only reason for living right now is so that my dad doesnâ€™t have to deal with my death but itâ€™s just so hard. Just a couple of days ago I found my old sleeping medication and I wanted so much to just down the whole bottle and stop being here. I just donâ€™t know whatâ€™s the point I canâ€™t deal with this for my whole life, itâ€™s already crushed me
