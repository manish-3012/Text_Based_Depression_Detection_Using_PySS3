HiWhile in labor, a woman suddenly shouts, â€œShouldnâ€™t! Wouldnâ€™t! Couldnâ€™t! Didnâ€™t! Canâ€™t!â€

â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€ says the doctor. â€œThose are just contractions.â€ 

Zing! 

Iâ€™m actually in a great deal of pain. Jokes, no matter how dumb, sometimes make me feel better. Parents arguing is just never fun. My mom made fun of me for crying some because they were fighting. Theyâ€™ve been fighting all my life (a ~grand~ 17 years) so I guess it just kinda built up. My mom was screaming at my dad because he only got her some chocolates and a card for Valentineâ€™s Day. Shitâ€™s wild. Life isnâ€™t a box of chocolates after all? I guess you could say Iâ€™m a bit of an emotional marshmallow - I kinda cry pretty easily, but tonight was just a lot.  Not feeling the best, to put it mildly. Called the National Suicide Prevention Hotline - waited for a few minutes, decided to hang up for a tad bit. Will probably call back in a few, as I understand how they can be quite busy. Hope whoever is reading this is staying safe, even in dark times. Any and all virtual hugs are much appreciated.
