People are helping and not helping here.You are trying not to break the rules but also help a bit.

I ask my stuff. I have Xanax. I want to kill myself with overdosing that. I will do it, whatever you say,  so it just makes clearly what I will do with my life. But it won't kill me what you say.

So people say it can't kill anyone because this is made nowadays the way you can't overdose, even combined with alcohol.
