I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for thisWhat's the most painless, easiest way to kill yourself? I just tried hanging myself, but it hurt so bad, I ended up stopping. Am I doing it wrong? (This is my first time trying) I used two purse straps put together, but I think they were too thick or something, idk. Does anyone have any tips that could help me die almost painlessly? I don't have access to a gun, and last time I tried pills, I got freaked out and threw them up. I want something that will get the job done pretty quickly. 
 PLEASE don't leave bs comments like "your family will miss you" or "you're worth more than that". I've made my mind up years ago, I just haven't found the right way to do it. I'm just so scared of the physical pain that comes along with it. 
If this isnt the right subreddit for this kind of post, please point me to the correct one! 
Thank you!!
