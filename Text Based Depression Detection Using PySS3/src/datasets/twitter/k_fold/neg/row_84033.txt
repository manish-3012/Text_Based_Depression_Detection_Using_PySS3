Thank you reddit!Lately I have been having an existential crisis and could not stop thinking about killing myself. But thanks to some kind words, wisdom, and distraction of the continuously updated  blue links, I think it may have passed. Although some of the depression still lingers and I am still scared the bad thoughts will come back, I am hopeful for the first time in a long time.
