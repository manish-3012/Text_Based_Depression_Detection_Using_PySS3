Pointless.Received a hateful message today from my ex telling me that I should just kill myself since I'm worthless. Kinda makes me believe him. I'm not pretty. I'm moody. I'm insecure. I'm selfish. I'm too outgoing. I'm not the best mom. I'm too hard on myself. 

Just took a sleeping pill. Maybe it'll help. Probably not. I'll wake up alone again. Thought about crashing my car into a tree today. Chose not to because I didn't think it was a good idea unless it was in the country. Want to break into the gun cabinet and shoot myself with my boyfriend's pistol. Watching him right now sleeping away, unaware of my thoughts. 

I really am worthless.
