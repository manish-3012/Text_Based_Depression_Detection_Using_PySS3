How do you plan your life?I've been suicidal since I was 14. For 10 years I've always had it on my mind. For any given situation or setting that I'm in, I've developed an out, just in case. In my teens, I didn't think I'd make it to my 20s. Now, here I am in my 20s and without a plan. I didn't set myself up for success because I didn't think I'd make it this far. What do you do with your life when you don't think you'll live much longer?
