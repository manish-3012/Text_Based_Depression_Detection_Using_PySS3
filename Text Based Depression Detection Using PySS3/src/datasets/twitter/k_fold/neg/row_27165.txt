I am sick of failureI am sick of being a failure. I can't do anything right. Everyone in my family is so successful and brilliant and here I am, the useless black sheep of the family. I'm done with trying my best only to fail. I'm not only the most pathetic in my family but all my friends have their shit together an I struggle to act human. I couldn't even finish the job the first time I tried to end it all, the second attempt got a tad closer but I ended up being too weak to pull it off.
