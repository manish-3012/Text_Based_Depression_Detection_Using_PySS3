*Update* - No plans. Only suicidal ideation. I need advice please.Hi, I forgot the password to my previous throwaway account. Here's the previous submission: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/yjl00/no_plans_only_suicidal_ideation_i_need_advice/

First some good news. My wife and I found a place, and she has a job. My father sent me $2000. So, financially I have some breathing room. 

However, my wife's job isn't great, and it doesn't even begin to cover the depth of debt she accumulated - let alone our living expenses. The place we got is small and cheap. But my money will run out quickly. 

I need to get a job, but I'm an American citizen living in Canada. My student visa expires in November, and the baby is due in December. I cannot work because I didn't graduate, I was kicked out of the master's program I was in. My degree is in philosophy, so it's not like that's of any help.

My wife doesn't want to me to leave because she doesn't think she can handle being by herself in this situation. I'm not entirely sure what to do. 

Still things are okay now, but I see another huge storm coming my way. I don't know if I will be prepared for that. If anybody has any advice, I would gladly take it!
