Yeah, if I could go to sleep and not wake up, that'd be greatPosting from my main account, don't really care at this point. Not really sure why I'm posting this anyway. I've exhausted everyone I've talked to about it and need some kind of outlet for the turmoil in my head.
I recently had my 30th birthday, and it took a month for it to really hit me. We all have different goals or a vision of how we want our lives to be. My life has stagnated. My shy, awkward, self consciousness makes it difficult to make and keep friends. I inevitably bring up how I secretly feel and it scares people away, or they assume I'm looking for attention. After so many times, why bother?
I know people notice something is wrong, but they don't say or ask me anything. I wish I had someone I could pour my heart out to over a cup of coffee. What I would give for a friend who would actually listen.
I've tried dating in the past, to the point where it was almost a part time job. There's a person who floats in and out of my life. I've mentioned how I feel, and he brushes me off. Maybe it's gotten to the point where I've cried wolf so much that no one cares.
Every single day is unremarkable. I can't make enough money to pay the bills, so my debt keeps accumulating. I can't breathe.
I've given up the hope that I'll ever travel, have a healthy relationship, kids, a happy life whatsoever.
