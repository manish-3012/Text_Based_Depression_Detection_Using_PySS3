All SetI'm 53, female ... and just done, feel like I'm finished with life.  I have had a great career, have a wonderful adult daughter and no other relatives.  My daughter has made it very clear for several years that she will in no way have children.  I, obviously, will have no more children.  My genetic tree is dead.  I have no reason to go on ... I've done great things in my career, as a friend, mother, partner - but feel my work is done here.  I am ready for the transition.  I feel no joy anymore, or anything close to it.  I used to be a cheerleader of life, optimism, positivity for all around me - now I can barely go through the motions of life.  I do - but can hardly do so.  It's not that I don't think I can continue to do "good things", I just think my time is up.  I'm tired and "all set".  

I'm in the mental health field - am a licensed therapist.  I've been to a therapist myself, understand the brain chemicals involved in depression, etc.  I have been feeling this way for about a year.  I have felt worse - believe it or not - within the past six months - crying jags, suicidal ideation - but that's gone.  I'm just now ... all set.  Thinking of finishing up a few details, projects, updating my will, and then trying to figure out a non-traumatic way of slipping into the stream of warm impermanence. My daughter is more than strong enough, intelligent enough, independent enough to go on.  I'm unnecessary.  A dead branch.  The world is not holding its appeal anymore.  Beautiful in nature but I don't care to hold onto it anymore.  Thanks for listening.  Good to put it out there.
