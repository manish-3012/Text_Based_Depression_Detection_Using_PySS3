my life is emptyIâ€™ve had to drop out of school, finally. I started at a private school, moved to public because I couldnâ€™t handle the academic stress and lost my scholarship, as well as being bullied by peers. Left the public school because it was so huge and the crowds overwhelmed me and I was having panic attacks and meltdowns multiple times a day (I have anxiety and ASD). Went to an online school, and had to leave because I was terrified to contact teachers, didnâ€™t understand the work, had no teacher aide support and couldnâ€™t complete assessment. 

Now Iâ€™m home alone all day every day as both my parents work. Iâ€™m 17. I try visiting my grandmother, but it doesnâ€™t help. I just sit in her living room thinking of killing myself instead of sitting in my bedroom thinking of killing myself. Iâ€™ve gone to therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, occupational therapists, group therapy, everything. Iâ€™ve flat-out had three psychologists tell me they donâ€™t know how to help me (that was the point at which I changed psychologists). My parents are at a loss. Nobody knows how to deal with me anymore, or how to make things better. I have no friends. I donâ€™t mean this as an exaggeration - I have nobody who I can visit or talk to or hang out with. I canâ€™t make online friends because Iâ€™m terrified of messaging people, even if they message me first. Itâ€™s hard enough posting this. I have no way of leaving the house. The closest public transport stop is a 45min walk, and I canâ€™t drive. I have my Learnerâ€™s and have taken the Ps test twice, but keep failing due to depth perception issues from a lazy eye that I am too frightened to get fixed (I have to be given a high dose of valium to go anywhere near an optometrist, dentist, etc) and because I am a very unconfident driver - I failed my most recent test for hesitating too much along with depth perception problems. I also canâ€™t drive in traffic, noisy conditions, etc - I live rurally and Iâ€™m just not used to it, but the city has the closest test centres. 

I just donâ€™t see the point in going on. My parents spend thousands on medication and psychology which is making no difference. Iâ€™m too frightened to make friends. Iâ€™m unable to return to any type of schooling and a job is out of the question. I have no motivation to pursue any hobbies. I donâ€™t even know what I like. Iâ€™m at my witâ€™s end and Iâ€™m just miserable. Itâ€™s been like this for months.
