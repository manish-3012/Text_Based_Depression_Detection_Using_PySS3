Every time I make a friend they disappear.I'm 20/21 living in a college-sponsored apartment building and very lonely. I was assigned two roommates at random - one is obnoxious and the other doesn't talk at all, so I've managed to bring myself to talk to other students.

But every time I manage to make a new friend, they move away or find their own new friends and forget about me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 

It usually happens pretty quickly too: the longest I've kept a friend at this school is a month at most.

Is normally this hard? What's the point if I'll just be alone again after all this effort?

I'd kill for just one person to talk to at this point.
