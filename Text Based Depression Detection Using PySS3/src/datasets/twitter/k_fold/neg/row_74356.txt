Tough Love is not always the answerWhy do parents think that telling your child that they are pathetic is going to help them and snap them out of a funk? The last few days have been even more of a revelation of just how much of a screw up everyone thinks I am. I have always known I am not worth much, but I guess I was hoping that I was hiding it well. But being told repeatedly how useless and lazy you are, how little your parents think of you, I just cant breathe. I woke up to my dad throwing at my face every way in which I am a disappointment. I cant remember the last time I did something to make him proud.  I know I am a disappointment. But please dont throw it in my face every day. I am trying, even when it looks like I am not. 

I cant imagine a future that would make me happy. I dont look forward to any thing. Just oblivion, that is what I want. Hiding in oblivion. that would be nice.
