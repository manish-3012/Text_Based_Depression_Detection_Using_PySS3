I'm gonna call the local crisis line to be admitted. Wish me luck (and strength to even call, tbh). I'm fucking scared.So for one, I'm terrified of phone calls. So this is....really scary. Two, I'm scared of being trapped. I HATE being trapped. And if I sign in I might not be allowed to sign out bc of how bad I am feeling rn (I'm gonna be honest with them). Three, I'm super duper addicted to nicotine and if I'm not allowed smoke breaks or nicotine patches or something I'm gonna lose my damn mind.    
    
I'm really scared you guys. I tried to kill myself last night. I'm alive now. I regret not dying. But something is telling me to stay. It's not much but it's something. I just want someone to be proud of me. Please.
