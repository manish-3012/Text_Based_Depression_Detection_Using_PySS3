Another ConfirmationI have a super hard time verbalizing my thoughts and prefer written word. I tried to use the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline chat last night. The first time, I was 45th which isn't horrible, got down to 10th and page froze. I tried again and got a counselor to chat with, except that after 10 minutes in the individual chat, no one had messaged me at all.  I came back and the page wouldn't load. Finally got the page to load and went to bed 3 hours later after \*still\* not spoken to anyone.

I went and tried again, I mean, why not. This is part of the conversation:

(after discussing CPTSD)

Counselor: that must be really difficult to live with

Me: Yes. I'm sick of it. I'm done. I've been trying to advocate for myself for YEARS and it never gets me anywhere. Never.

Me: I've been suicidal in the past, but never quite to this point. Typically, I would get myself admitted for my safety, but that won't do any good either.

C: why wouldn't it do any good?

Me: They will just change my medication (which we've already tried numerous times), they wouldn't allow my medical marijuana (which will mess with what my psych is trying) and it would give my ex and abusive family the opportunity to try and get full custody of my kid.

C: I'm so sorry, I have to get going now. We'll be here later for you to reach out.

There is one more thing in the list of things I've tried and just points to the fact that this will never get better. I'm too much to handle and I really should kill myself.
