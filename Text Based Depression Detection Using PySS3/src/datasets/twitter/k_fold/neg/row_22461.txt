I'm thinking of killing myself soon and I'll bet that none of you can give me a good reason why I shouldn't.I cannot do this anymore.

I have had depression since 2015. As of now, it seems to have gotten much worse. 

Nearly every day for the past few months, I've been having suicidal thoughts. Whenever I tell my parents or grandparents, they lose their shit at me and we start arguing. Sometimes, when we argue, my mother/grandmother will make up reasons as to why I'm "having a tantrum". 


I have been to at least 7 different therapists, none of which have been able to help me. My parents won't let me see any more therapists (I don't blame them), and since I'm homeschooled, I can't see a school counselor. I have also taken countless different medicines (some of which I'm taking right now), which have only helped at least 5%.

Also, I'm not allowed to call any suicide hotlines or talk to anybody in any chatlines, since my parents are convinced that "CPS will take me away". I can't call the suicide hotline number behind their backs because my parents are so overprotective. 

Many people suggest watching a favorite show or listening to music to combat depression and/or suicidal thoughts. For whatever reason, I feel like I don't deserve to do these things.

My mother is thinking of putting me in a mental hospital, and I don't blame her. My family has done all they can to support me during this time, and nothing they do helps me. I've been nothing but a big burden to my family ever since the day I was born. They deserve MUCH better. Everyone I've ever met deserves much better.
