evrything just keeps getting worsei wanna first say thanks to ppl that have pmed me. im sorry i havent gotten back to you yet, it isn't personal, i just really dont have the energy lately. i promise i will get back to you.

i also wanna say i dont have a plan or intentions of harming myself.

last week was probably the best ive been mentally in a while, im still slowly recovering. but yesterday i met up with a friend and received really upsetting news involving my ex - i cant even talk about it with friends bc of how fucked it is, and im terrified to even talk about it hear for fear that he'll find this.

i was with my ex for a while, it was a rly intense and serious relationship. we were to move in together by next year and even talked abt marriage. then they broke up with me in febraury. then we became friends again. then they cut me off entirely out of nowhere in late june. my social life has been absolutely shattered. we have a lot of mutual friends, one of them has dropped me ever since my ex cut me off, for reasons he wont tell me.

ive pretty much gone incognito since then bc the friend i met up with also told me that my ex said they disliked that their friends were still friends with me, and also called me an abuser. which. is not true.

we have a lot of mutual friends irl. i fear i cant ever go to the arcade, or my friend's parties when he hosts them, because i know my ex will be there. and ive been incognito because im terrified my ex is spreading rumors about me  and that il be attacked as soon as i get back on.

im exhausted because i have to constantly keep my mind busy so im not thinkin about how fucked everything is and how much i wanna die. we used to get our friends together at their house and have parties for like valentines and christmas. now that theyve cut me off, we cant do that..i cant even remember when was the last time

i fear that ive already lived my best life when we werent broken up. i fear im not gonna find the one. i fear that thats the best that i was to ever experienced in my life. and i wanna die. 

i already had a lot of trauma before this, this just added on to it. im also coming to terms with that i have sexual trauma from the relationship, because my ex would guilt me and push me to do sexual things with them when i wasnt comfortable yet...and the upsetting thing i found out, is they asked the friend i mentioned to have sex with them. years ago when we were together, my ex asked this same friend to cuddle when i wouldnt come over bc we had an argument. i have a lot of trust issues related to this...

every day im so lonely, my friends don't get back to me quickly, sometimes just ghosting me, and im terrified to reach out to acquaintances for reasons i described earlier.

logically i know itd make people sad and worse if i were to die, but i just. canr help but feel like it would really make things better. i know my ex would love it for sure.
