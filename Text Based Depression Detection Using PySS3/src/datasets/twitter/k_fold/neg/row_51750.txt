I don't feel necessary in this world.Ive been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. the only people who know are my family. my life is all downhill and i havent even graduated yet. my friends constantly make fun of me about things that I cant bring myself to tell them that it pushes me towards suicide. I dont want my friends to feel bad for me, yet I dont want them to be mean to me. I Just need some help on what to do.
