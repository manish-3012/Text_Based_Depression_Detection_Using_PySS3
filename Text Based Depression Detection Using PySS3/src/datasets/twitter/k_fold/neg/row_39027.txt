I'm 15. I'm bisexual. Don't feel like I should've been born male. And my whole life is one fuck up after another.I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a Bisexual teenager born into a VERY devout Christian family. Along with that, I feel like me being born as a guy was a complete mistake on "god's" hands.

Anything I do, I fuck it up. I'm never successfull at anything I do. And to make matters worse, my depression is caused by me "not being a good Christian."

I just don't see the point of living anymore. I'm going through so much pain at the age of 15. It doesn't seem to be getting any better at all. I go to sleep every night crying and practically wishing, sometimes praying, that I would die.

I don't know why I'm posting this. Just... someone give me some reason to live on... anything.
