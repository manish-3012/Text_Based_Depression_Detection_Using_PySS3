Around early June I have planned to go to the Golden Gate Bridge and jump.Iâ€™ve been going through the worst inner turmoil that eats at me everyday. Itâ€™s cost me my relationship and it keeps my heart void of any good thoughts. I havenâ€™t felt any peace in forever and knowing I lost the one person who truly cared about me hurts me the most. My life Iâ€™ve realized Iâ€™ll probably never contribute much but if I go at least there will be one less mouth for the earth to feed. I wanted to be president when I was younger to save people in a sense of the word I guess I thought I could. However, I canâ€™t even save myself. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I hope the feeling passed but if not Iâ€™m going to get a plane ticket and make my one way trip.
