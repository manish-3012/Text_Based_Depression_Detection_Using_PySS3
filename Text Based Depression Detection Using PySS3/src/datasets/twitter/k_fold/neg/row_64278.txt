I've decided to die.My life has been circling the drain for a long while now. I've been under treatment for anxiety and it put such a stress on my relationship that I fucked that all up. I told him I was afraid I was falling out of love or incapable of feeling love. And he's leaving me now. 

I'm not young anymore. My friends are all getting married, having kids...I'm just left here in the dust. I hate myself. I cannot see a future anymore and honestly I don't want to try. I just want to stop the suffering. I don't want to be lonely, alone. I miss the warmth of someone holding me at night. I haven't felt that love in so long. 

I'm a hollow shell of a person. 

I've already begun with my final arrangements, where my things will go, I know my pets will be cared for...

I really wish things could have been different for me. I don't want to go on, going through the motions of life never being happy, never having Anyone love me.
