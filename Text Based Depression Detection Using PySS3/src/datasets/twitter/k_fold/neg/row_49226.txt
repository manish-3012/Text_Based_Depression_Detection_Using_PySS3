Why doesn't anyone want to help me until I'm in crisis mode?Like, I know that going for a walk makes me feel better. I have asked my boyfriend to go for even just a short walk with me every day as prevention. But he never seems to care until I'm crying, depressed on the floor! Of course I don't want to go for a walk anymore, I'm super depressed now! Why won't anybody help me until it's too late!
