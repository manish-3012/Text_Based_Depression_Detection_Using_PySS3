Alone.I've friends.  I've loved ones.  I've spent my entire life being what everyone wants me or needs me to be.

My fiancÃ©e left me in August.  I dig why she did.  She needed to do what made her happy and it wasn't me.

I have a job.  My life isn't bad.  I am just looking at a total descent.  Over the last year I've started feeling more and more like I am not quite sane.

I've been fighting to find someone who sees the way I do.  Now I'm wondering if I've just lost the edge and am falling.  I don't even care where I find the bottom anymore.
