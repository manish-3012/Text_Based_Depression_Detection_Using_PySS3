I sometimes wish I could live in the Psych WardWhen I was there I did miss people, but it was so calm. There were no responsibilities, people were watching my vitals, I didn't have to cook, I didn't have to think about cleaning, laundry, every little mundane thing that makes my life miserable. I actually slept through the night and felt rested. I could actually read a book without my brain getting too distracted. Even though I still wanted to die, I realized how much of life is what makes me miserable.
