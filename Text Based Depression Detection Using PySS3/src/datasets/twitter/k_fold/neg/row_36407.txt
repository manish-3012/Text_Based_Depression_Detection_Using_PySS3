I still hate myself and I'm all aloneBut how can i hate myself? I'll tell you. The ever intrusive blackness inside me. I mean Ffs I'm typing this in my room with blacked out curtains in the afternoon. I try to be brave and put on that mask of happiness but it gets harder and harder. I just want to hide in my room all day every day. I don't want to face the day or my family. I can't stand socializing. Hell I can't be bothered to not make this into a block of text and that's the thing. Caring... I don't care.. About myself or others. About living or dying. I just don't care.... Compared to others I have it easy but I have nothing. No one. And a fact that not only depresses me but angers me is that people only ever act out self interest. This place. This planet. These "people" make me wanna cut of just... End it all.. If I wasn't 100% sure there was life after death i would have done it a long time ago... I.. I just want to not be here anymore
