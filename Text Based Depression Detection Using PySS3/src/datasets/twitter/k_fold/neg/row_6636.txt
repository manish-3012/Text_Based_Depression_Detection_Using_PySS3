Hey, at the risk of sounding attention-seekingWell, I really need attention. 

Please just talk to me? It doesnâ€™t even have to be much. I donâ€™t care what you say? As long as I know Iâ€™m real? I feel like Iâ€™m not a person? Please help me. Even if you just want to say Iâ€™m a pretentious asshole. I feel like Iâ€™m not alive. Please say something?
