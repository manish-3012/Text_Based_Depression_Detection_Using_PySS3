may trigger :(ive been having rlly awful nightmares lately (its been on and off for the past 9 yrs). i was abused by my parents and stepparents as a child. iâ€™ve been so down while studying for lsats and finishing off my final year of uni as well. i keep wishing that i could just disappear, like just not exist at all. in the recent nightmare that i had, i slit my throat because i couldnt handle the pain. a few months ago i overdosed on nyquil and ended up puking it out, then i was unconscious for a day. i just feel horrible all the time and idk what to do... im just so unhappy.
