I need a temporary solutionTo start, I had just posted a small rant on the unavailability of mental health services [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3vymn7/are_mental_health_services_this_hard_to_come_by/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)

In short, I can't get mental health help if I tried, or at least how I percieve it. I have an infinite chest pain from stress that ultimately keeps me up at night, actually haven't slept more than 3 hours in over a month. I was able to cope with the lows of depression before this chest pain but now I don't know where to turn, or how to de-stress. The methods I previously used, usually physical activities, walks, etc, don't help. And smoking cigars or drinking only helps for such a small amount of time. I am in constant physical pain right now and can't seem to think of anything to get over this.
