Desperately need help, not sure if I can make it to the end of the day.I sincerely thought I would be the last person on earth posting here, but sudden happenings have made me more insane than I thought was possible. I live a normal life, great upbringing, happy girl, until recently.

It is my freshman year in college, and I met my boyfriend. Skip ahead a few months and I was diagnosed with herpes. He gave it to me; he's been my only one. A couple months later, he got me pregnant (I am 5 weeks along, planning an abortion which he is angry with, he wants adoption route). The relationship is unhealthy; he has cheated on me twice (without using a condom) and we are both physically and emotionally violent with each other.

Last night we got in a fight because I wouldn't go to bed and he started calling me a pig, a bitch, an idiot, a cunt, etc. I started to cut myself in the bathroom (for the first time ever) and he took the knife away and called me an idiot. He went to work and I have been crying to the point where I am screaming. I want to die very badly. These feelings are so unlike myself; I was an innocent, sweet girl one year ago. My parents wouldn't recognize me, neither would my friends. I have herpes, am pregnant, and now I'm cutting my wrists and having suicidal thoughts. I am very hormonal on a regular basis, but being pregnant makes it so much worse. My abusive relationship is just the cherry on top.

I used to laugh at the "emo" kids who are looking for attention, but I'm a normal girl who feels like I am absolutely suffering. Can anyone help?
