ehI just don't see why not, really. I have always hated my life to a certain extent no matter how things are because things have never really been great. I've been full of self doubt since 6th grade, and it's honestly starting to kill me. Whenever I think I have something good in my life, something better happens to something else, and they take that something good away (For instance, I asked out a girl that I really liked, she said yes, and took it back because she's going to school in LA next year. This is a pattern, not a single occurence.) It's not that I'm making a grand gesture or a cry for help or anything, and I'm not saying this for dramatic effect, but I find myself more sad than anything on a regular basis, and I've seeked help, but my doubt in myself has made me too afraid to tell my therapist that I am suicide prone. I have attempted suicide before a couple of years ago. I'm 6'7" and 200 lbs, so ODing didn't really work. I haven't told anyone about my suicidal thoughts or tendencies. So my only real point here is, if I'm going to be happier dead than alive about 75% of the time, I just don't see why not.
