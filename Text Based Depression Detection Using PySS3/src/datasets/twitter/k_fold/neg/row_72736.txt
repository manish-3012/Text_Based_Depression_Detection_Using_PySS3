Is it ok to say you want to die?I've struggled with this thought.
In the past few weeks I've thought a lot about my life and always seem to get to the thought of killing myself.
I haven't told anyone yet cause I'm afraid of the reaction. I think my friends would stay away from me or people will talk bad behind my back. I'm already struggling heavily with depression and social anxiety. I don't have a lot of friends to talk to anyway. I think I risk losing them if I tell them.

If you have any experience with such things I'd appreciate if you told how it went and felt for you or if you have any advice...
