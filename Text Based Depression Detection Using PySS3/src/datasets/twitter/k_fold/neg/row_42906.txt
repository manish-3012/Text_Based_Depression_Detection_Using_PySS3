The ThingEverything in my life is a chore because of my depression and suicidal thoughts. The thing about my depression is that it makes me feel so numb yet everything in this life brings me sadness or anger. I guess the numbness is my indifference part of myself. I truly feel terrible so itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m being purposely negative. Doing school work is a pain due to me being so depressed and having no outlet aside from listening to music. I just stall for the time being until the end. If there really is nothing after this then what a shitty time Iâ€™ve spent. If Iâ€™m wrong then I will suffer on this Earth until I suffer for eternity once Iâ€™m dead. Someday I just wish I was held or felt affection. I wonâ€™t heal me but at least I would feel.
