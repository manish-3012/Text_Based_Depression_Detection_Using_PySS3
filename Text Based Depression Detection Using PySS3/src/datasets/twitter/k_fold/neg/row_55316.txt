Iâ€™m curious to see how many people relate to how I feel and what Iâ€™m going through.I have suffered mental illness off and on since I was 15. Iâ€™m now 22 and this year has been really bad for me. Last year I went through an emotionally abusive relationship in which I was made to feel bad about my mental illness. I started seeing a psychiatrist because I started studying my symptoms and I had a good feeling I had bipolar. So I started seeing this psych to get a diagnosis and treatment because I wasnâ€™t coping very well. I was constantly up and down and angry. 
The psychiatrist said it wasnâ€™t bipolar but she wanted to keep seeing me to just talk about how I feel, plus she prescribed me Lexapro for the low moods. I stared taking the medication and I was confident it would help. Until I took a DNA test (having worked in pharmacy, I knew a bit about the possibility of finding out which drugs affect me differently). Turned out that lexapro wasnâ€™t effective for me, my body basically just absorbed it really quickly. Which explained my low moods at night when the meds wore off. 
I went back to the psych and asked to be prescribed a new medication. I suggested Lovan as it came up as a good option in my DNA test. So Iâ€™ve been on Lovan since. 
I started coping better and everything was fine, until July this year. I felt like the meds stopped working and all of a sudden, I felt the need to kill my self. Partially what triggered this, was the fact that I had to move and start a whole new job. But I think I had a lot of emotional trauma from childhood that had laid dormant in me and itâ€™s now affecting me really badly. 
One day I was at work, and I knew I had been a bit down, more than usual for the last week or so. But this day, I sat in my car on my lunch break, just sobbing. I couldnâ€™t cope any longer. I told my friends I was really bad and that I wanted to end it. 
The next morning, I went to the hospital to be admitted to the psychiatric ward, I felt unsafe at home and I had severe urges. I wasnâ€™t let in because after an assessment, they figured I was better dealt with by a psychologist. They didnâ€™t think I would benefit from a stay in the hospital. Once they sent me home, I started planning and I later attempted suicide. I took a cocktail of pain killers and sleeping tablets. I was rushed to the hospital once I told my partner what Iâ€™d done. That night was horrible. I spent it spewing my guts up in hospital. I spoke to a nurse who asked me what I wanted to do and eventually the decision was made to go home. 
I wonâ€™t go into too much detail, but I had another attempt after that one. And I also had two seperate hospital admissions into the psychiatric ward. 
It wasnâ€™t until I started seeing a new psychiatrist, that I was told I had cluster b personality traits. He told me I had traits that aligned with Borderline Personality Disorder. This shed a whole new light on my life. I started researching it and it started to make a lot more sense than bipolar. I could really relate to the symptoms and it explained how I felt better than any other illness. 
What I want to know, is what do people who feel suicidal and those who have attempted, what went through your mind at the time, what did it feel like? 
Iâ€™ve been working on trying to explain it in words exactly how it feels when I get suicidal. Over the last couple of weeks, Iâ€™ve been able to start fighting the urges. When I start getting suicidal, I stop and think and remember that this is what I go through and that it is only temporary. I tell myself to ride it out. Most of the time, I can sleep it off and feel better the next day. 
How Iâ€™ve managed to explain in words what happens to me when I get that way, is like this;
I get angry first, sometimes itâ€™s triggered by something, mostly itâ€™s not. The anger is really intense and hard to control. Then I start feeling sad, the anger makes me tired and I start feeling this heartbreak sensation. Once the sadness hits, itâ€™s a downhill slope. My mind gets really loud with thoughts, I basically have an argument with my mind. The world goes a weird shade of grey, things start seeking really bleak. Thereâ€™s a huge part inside me that wants to live. And this is what I try to explain to those who will listen. I do want to live. But thereâ€™s a sort of energy or entity inside me that wants to tear me apart, itâ€™s pushing me to the edge and it wants me to kill myself. It wants me to push away everyone I love and it wants me to spread hate. Itâ€™s a vicious voice in my head. It overwhelms and overpowers me sometimes. I get a sort of restless feeling in my body. Iâ€™m restless but when Iâ€™m like that, I canâ€™t move. I just sit and stare and feel frozen in place. Itâ€™s like the entity inside me wants me to sit and feel the negative and encourage me to do something to hurt myself. I lose all motivation to do anything but just sit there and just feel it. 
I want to know if anyone feels anything similar to this? Does anyone actually want to live but are constantly pushed by their mind to end it all?
