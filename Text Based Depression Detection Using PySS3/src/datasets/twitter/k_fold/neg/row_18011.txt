I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doingIâ€™m just gonna vent if thatâ€™s ok with you, I understand if you donâ€™t want to read this but I would appreciate it.

Iâ€™ve known for quite a while now that Iâ€™m bisexual.  Iâ€™m comfortable with this.  Iâ€™ve told some close friends and that was that.  They were supportive and I am glad that they took it well.  This isnâ€™t the problem though, I live in a conservative neighborhood in the Midwest filled with rich white people.  My entire family is Catholic and Iâ€™ve heard my aunt go on a rant about homosexuality.  Things wonâ€™t be the same after I come out.  They might say that they love and support me, but hate runs deep.

There hasnâ€™t been a single point in my life where I knew who I was.  Itâ€™s just one identity crisis after another.  I never feel comfortable In my own skin. Every time that I look in the mirror a stranger stares back at me.  That may seem cliche, but itâ€™s who I am.  I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because I hate how I look, have some mental illness, or something else.

Lately Iâ€™ve being thinking that I might be trans (MtF).  I hope thatâ€™s not the case.  I donâ€™t have anything against trans people, itâ€™s just they live incredibly difficult lives.  About half of all trans people attempt suicide, I have enough suicidal thoughts.  If it does turn out that Iâ€™m trans, I wonâ€™t know where to fucking start.  There is ONE trans person in my town of over ten thousand people.  Sheâ€™s treated like an outcast and I genuinely feel sorry for her.  I donâ€™t want to lose my friends.

I canâ€™t get out of bed sometimes, Iâ€™m sorry if that sounds cliche, but itâ€™s who I am.  Iâ€™ve been self harming for a while now.  I drive a thumb tack in to my arm and drag around the wound.  Iâ€™ve become addicted to it in a sick way, if I feel any emotional pain, all I have to do is replace it with physical pain.  The best part is it doesnâ€™t scar, nobody needs to worry.

I say all these things as I actually am going to commit suicide.  I donâ€™t have the guts to do that shit.  Instead Iâ€™ll just be miserable in silence, a prisoner to the human condition.  Iâ€™m so miserable that sometimes I wonder if itâ€™s justified.  There are people living in third world countries doing just fine, theyâ€™d kill to be where you are.  I know something is wrong with me, Iâ€™m posting about my depression instead of getting help.

For the longest time Iâ€™ve felt that my life is just a game with an impossibly stupid amount of obstacles.  One identity crisis after another, Iâ€™ve covered every topic under the sun yet I donâ€™t feel like I made any progress.  Race, sexuality, gender, everything that you could need to know to get a basic understanding of yourself.  Iâ€™m running dry, I feel trapped.  Nobody I know could possibly understand what Iâ€™m going through, let alone get me help.

Iâ€™m tired of fight the urge to break down and cry, Iâ€™m tired of telling everyone I know that Iâ€™m okay, and Iâ€™m tired of living.

Thank you for your time, I love you all.
