i feel like i dont existas i lay here, the night before school- ive come to realize that i dont exist and that everything does not feel real nor sane. i dont see the point in living. i have given. and i will never recieve in the way i need like i have given to others. i will either kill myself or continue wasting onwards as a mutual dissapointment to both my parents, boyfriend, and friends.

as to quote camus- 

"man is the only animal who refuses to be what he is."
