I don't want to die, but I don't know what to doHey guys, it's my first time posting here so forgive me if I'm doing anything wrong. I've been suicidal in the past, and tonight I'm feeling really low. I've been having a lot of trouble with my homework lately and I don't think I'm going to fail, but I can't get the thought out of my head. I tried emailing my teacher for help, but she's out of town this weekend and she said she might not respond. My homework's due on tuesday (which is the next time I see her in person) and I'm totally stumped. I've been really stressed and I can't help but think "if I fail even one class, I'm going to kill myself" I don't want to die though! I just want this to stop. Is there any way I can distract myself? I don't really have anyone to talk to right now and I'm trying to watch videos to take my mind off of this, but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. Any suggestions at all would be helpful.
