I feel like my emotional pain threshold is very low.Something inside me has been missing for a long time. Fucking depression, it makes me feel empty. But earlier today I was feeling like an excess of energy, which of course I just wasted. I sometimes feel so tired of living. Like I want to fast forward and get it over with. Or just stop existing. I get too easily overwhelmed by emotions.

I know probably I'll feel better tomorrow but right now... I've just been feeling vaguely panicked... like I want to cry, but I can't cough up the tears.

I fear that someday I may become too overwhelmed, and lose my grip on reality or hurt myself.

Just needed to vent.
