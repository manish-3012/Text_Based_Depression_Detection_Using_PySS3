Just want a bit of your time and thoughtsDear SW,
First, I would like to thank you for clicking and listening to a random stranger's troubles.  
Now, let us get to the point.  I am feeling borderline suicidal, but more apathetic than suicidal.  I do not care if my life ends now or soon, but some part of me does not want to end it myself, unless I feel like I have no other choice, or the pain is unbearable.  
I am feeling the way I do because of a girl that broke up with me as the past year ended.  Hopefully, that is enough to suffice.  Although more than two months have passed, I feel as if it is still last week.  For a while, there has been relative progress, as I forced myself to move on, but I can't help but grow weary after a period of no progress.  I do not know where to turn, as my family is distant, and I do not speak to them very much.  Friends are not very helpful at all, as I feel like they have their own problems.  They are not nearby, so it is not easy or possible to meet up.  My only option is to call.  Most have told me that if I'm feeling terrible, I can call them whenever, and we can talk.  However, a majority of the time, they do not pick up, or if they do, they say that they are busy and will call back, but they never do.  This just makes whatever I'm feeling worse.  So I am very reluctant to call anybody just in case I make myself feel worse as a result.  Whenever I do call them, they will talk for a bit and make â€œfalseâ€ promises, and after we hang up, I feel like they have completely forgotten about me.  Of course, I shouldn't feel like that I am their life, but I cannot help but wonder what I would do if I was in their situation.  To me, if a friend in need, I would take any situation like this very seriously, and not say anything I do not intend to do.  I know that sometimes, things slip in people's minds, but to me, it seems like that you really donâ€™t have to care about an issue for it to slip so many times.  So I have nowhere to go, but to help myself.
I have tried to do whatever daily life requires, but everyday is extremely disheartening.  I awake to memories of the past, and fall asleep thinking about the memories of the past as well.  Even dreams take me back to past.  I find part of the problem is I do not find many activities fun or happy.  I know that I just want to find someone whom I love and who loves me back, and together, we can be happy, but I understand that will not happen anytime soon probably.  I see everyone around me happy and carefree, and I wonder why I cannot be like them, which only furthers me into my hole.
I have been told to try and make friends meet new people, but I do not enjoy small talk nor do I like parties or anything that is superficial.  I simply do not ENJOY the process of sifting through hundreds of people who pretend to like you but in reality donâ€™t give a crap about you, or care only when they are interacting with you, just like my current â€œfriendsâ€ have shown.  I am losing motivation fast, and these past few weeks, Iâ€™m thinking more and more about suicide.  
Sorry for this wall of text, and Iâ€™m asking anyone who cares, or at least pretends to care to perhaps give me a different view, words of support, or anything else you think will help.  

EDIT: Thanks all for the replies and helpful advice.  I will read and look into the more tomorrow as I am calling it a day now.
