The love of my life left meHi i can't say much right now, as I'm freaking out, but my boyfriend left me. It was completely random and he blocked me on everything. There was no closure and I am so fucking confused. I kind of thought he was losing love but I had no idea it would come down to him leaving me without any warning. I am frozen and have no words. I have never loved somebody so much.. I honestly couldn't have asked for anyone better. I want to die but I'm afraid of the consequences. I want him back. I needed him. I'm heartbroken. I am never going to forget him.. Honestly at this point I don't know what to do with my life anymore, hence why death feels like my only option. I have absolutely no words and I miss him so fucking MUCH
