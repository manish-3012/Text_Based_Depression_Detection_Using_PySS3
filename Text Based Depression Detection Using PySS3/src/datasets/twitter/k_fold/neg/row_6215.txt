That's it, I'm doneI f*cking hate everyone, every single person. I disgust human beings. I study medicine and honestly, I don't give two fucks about people's lives. Why would I? Nobody gives a fuck about me. I hope all people burn to death. I am resentful. I deserve to die. I wasn't built for human society. Better to check myself out before I accidentally(?) kill someone.
