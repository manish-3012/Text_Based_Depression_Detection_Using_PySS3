I've wasted my lifeI didn't excel in school, I got by doing the bare minimum. When I went to college I smoked and partied and played Xbox.  When I dropped out of college a year later I went to community college and wasted a semester and a half doing poorly and not going to class.   Then I dropped out and got a shit part time job and found a girlfriend.   First girlfriend ever and I asked her to marry me after 6 months.  

Fast forward 11 years I have no friends.  A dead bedroom marriage, no hobbies, and I'm out of shape.  My time is spent working, sleeping, playing PlayStation and drinking.

Probably the only reason I haven't stuck the barrel of my ar-15 under my chin is my 7 year old daughter.   I couldn't do that to her.
