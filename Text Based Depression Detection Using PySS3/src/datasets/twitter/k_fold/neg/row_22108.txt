Planning to take 10 grams or 12 or more grams of ibuprofen I'm willing to take the riskHello I'm 17 I just been through hell all these years and i attempted to kill myself more than 2 times but last year I failed i just blackout this year few months back tried again but failed. But I'm willing to take  12 or 10 grams of ibuprofen to make the pain go away.  Just gonna live in the short run. I have a girlfriend she always tells me that she loves me and I do believe her but I just don't think I'm enough for her. I feel like she deserved someone better and I just hold her back from doing things I'm just a fuck up drinker and pill pop opener. and i promise her that wouldn't do any of that and so i kept the promise for 3-4 months but day by day i just grow more sadness everyday. And so god judge me if i live or die later on.
