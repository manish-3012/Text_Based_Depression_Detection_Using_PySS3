Iâ€™m just going to let it all outMy life is near perfect, i have everything I ever wanted, i have a good and loving family, and awesome and supportive friends. Sounds perfect right? Well I canâ€™t deny that im definitely in a better situation than many, but school is just fucking me up. We have 18 exams a week (they all count heavily on my average) and the material for just 1 exam is too much. You must be thinking Iâ€™m pathetic for wanting to kill myself for such reason, and you are probably right. I am pathetic, i preform really bad compared to everyone around me and the stress is just too high for me to bear. Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide for over a year now and what kept me going is knowing how devastated my parents would be. But right now Iâ€™m fed up, I donâ€™t wanna wake up the next day and have to worry about school work anymore. I havenâ€™t slept properly in 3 months now, Iâ€™ve been studying all day long every single day since the start of my school year. The stress is insane, i used to have many hobbies that I enjoyed and now I donâ€™t have time for them since I am always studying. The fact that my marks arenâ€™t improving proves my stupidity, and honestly I donâ€™t want to wake up for tomorrowâ€™s exam. Iâ€™ve thought about it and I think Iâ€™m going to attempt suicide any time this week. I feel like an asshole for trying to leave my parents like this but I just canâ€™t handle it anymore.
