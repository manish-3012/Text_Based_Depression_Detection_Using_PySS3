Suicidal thoughtsI'm 16 and I've been living with my mom for most of my life. I have appreciated all of the things she's done for me but I'm hesitant to tell her about my depression. When I got close to telling her how I feel, connecting back to how I've been feeling depressed in the 7th grade, she took away my phone for the day. Obviously that didn't help my situation at all and made me much more hesitant to tell her about my feelings. Another time we were arguing about something, and during that time I began to cry. She said stop making crocodile tears while giving me a stoic look. This made me cry harder than before and I felt heartbroken. I didn't want to believe it. There was also a time when she said she would take me to a therapist and she was being supportive overall, yet, when I reminded her of what she said, she says that she is a therapist because of her degree in psychology and how it would be extra money spent if I were to go to a real therapist. Is my mental health not important? She used to have depression herself yet she acts like I'm not supposed to have it. I can't focus in school and many of my teachers are setting unrealistic expectations. I've told my counselor about my stress but nothing helped. I can't keep up, I just want to start over.
