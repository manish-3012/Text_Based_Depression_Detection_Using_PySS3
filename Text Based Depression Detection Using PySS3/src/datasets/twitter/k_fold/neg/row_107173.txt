I think I'm in my end runI won't go into too much detail... but I've been homeless for 2 years... lost my wife and kids to divorce, all my fault... I've been trying to get my shit together but keep failing... I finally got a job and off the street.... but my boss tells me she's closing for like 2 weeks during Christmas.... the time of year where I mentally nosedive anyway.... so now I know I will have 2 weeks to do nothing....

I'm literally keeping this job to save money to buy the means to be done with this cycle.... part of me knows this is fucked up, but all the b/s about "it gets better" just isn't happening for me.... 2 years I haven't seen my boys, my health is failing, if ever there was a candidate for giving up, I'm it....

I've been to jail and can't legally purchase my preferred method to end it... so my options are pharmaceutical.... but in my region, it's tricky to locate the preferred substance.... so I know I need to save enough money to have time to find a dealer.

What's fucked up is that I am getting an eye exam and I'm thinking.... "why in the hell are you getting glasses when you know you don't want to be around anymore?"

OK... this is longer than I intended.... I'm lucky my job has long hours and keeps me occupied and gives me a little cash... but when that joint closes.... I've got nothing and noone.... that'll be it.... t-minus 6 months.....
