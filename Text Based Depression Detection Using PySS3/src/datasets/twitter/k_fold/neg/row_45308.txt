Unemployed, failed gender transition, and other reasons to dieI am currently in a mental health program and itâ€™s costing me 20 grand a month from my own trust fund. My uncle is the trustee and I have no choice but to stick around till I get a job and my independence back.

Unfortunately Iâ€™m unemployable and Iâ€™ve barely ever worked. Until I came out to Texas from LA to do this I had a stable job as an office assistant for a year and a half. Before that I held a long string of very short term menial jobs I have no references from. I also have to grapple with my failed gender transition. I present male day to day though I already changed my name and have to deal with the consequences of having been on HRT for a long time. I have to constantly explain my situation every time I present my ID. Itâ€™s embarrassing and at the moment there is nothing I can do about it.

My degree is in Art History and I canâ€™t really do anything with it. My uncle wonâ€™t support me going back to school so Iâ€™m forced to apply for menial jobs I am rejected from over and over again. Because I have to use my legal name to apply it is embarrassing to even get a call back. 

I really hope I donâ€™t live much longer. Iâ€™m realistic in believing I have no future and nobody cares, not even my family.
