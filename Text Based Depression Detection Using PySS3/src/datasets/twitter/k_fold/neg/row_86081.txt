I miss herWe were the best of friends. One fine day I got a text saying she's dead. That's it. When I found out futher,they say that she suicided. I wish that I told her what she meant to me. She was the world to me even though I never told her. She was my best friend,she was closer than my sister's to me.

Guys,even if u think that no one cares about you, somewhere,someone still cares about you. 



I really dunno y im posting this here. Just hope it helps someone
