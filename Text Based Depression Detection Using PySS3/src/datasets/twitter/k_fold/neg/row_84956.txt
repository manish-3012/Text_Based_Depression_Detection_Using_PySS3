I hate myself, and I've given up.I feel like I've constantly been making bad decisions. I hate myself for it. Everything I say and do makes me hate myself even more. Everyone that I've met has abandoned me. People act like they care, but they just abandon me when I actually need their help. I've been planning to commit suicide this summer, but a few hours ago I gave up on waiting and tried to kill myself. I failed, and now I hate myself even more. I just don't know what to do. It feels hopeless.
