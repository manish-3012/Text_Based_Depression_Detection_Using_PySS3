I told my boyfriend I needed space.But I think I'm going to do it. I just don't want him to be as hurt. I'd rather him be angry. I'm so tired of everything and I don't have anyone who cares besides him. But he just hurt me really badly and expects me to get over it. I just can't. I'm ready. Bye everyone.
