I'm home alone and I think I am going to try to overdose myselfI hate feeling helpless, too scared to slit my wrist so I think I am going to overdose myself with the medicines at home. I always felt that my presence is irrelevent, that's how I feel. I can't pursue my research because I don't have the brains for it and want to give up but cannot because my undergrad had cost too much already. I hope it doesnt hurt and it will end by passing me out first.
