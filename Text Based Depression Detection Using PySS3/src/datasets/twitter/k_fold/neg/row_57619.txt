Iâ€™m doing itThis is it. Good bye, good luck to all, if my parents dig this up I guess this is my suicide note-

Though I never say it, I love my family more than anything. This is not your fault, I am the reason that I am the failure that I am. I am the coward who canâ€™t face you guys and instead had to hurt you guys even more. Ily, if thereâ€™s a higher power  Iâ€™ll make sure to tell them how amazing you guys are. If not maybe in a billion years somewhere somehow there is another me who didnâ€™t fuck up. Good bye. Iâ€™m so sorry
