i want to end it.I've been wanting to end my life for a while now until i meet this girl in my class that was really beautiful and i wanted to give her everything i had left. I started texting her, i bought her things, asked her to go to the movie with me. We had a lot of fun at least when she was by my side i actually felt something and wanted to compliment her and make her feel loved. Unfortunately she didn't not like the compliments for some reason and i don't think she really enjoyed spending time with me. When ever i would text her she would respond like 20 min late, she would see my messages but still not respond etc. I just really wanted to tell her how pretty she was but she didn't appreciate the compliments. I messaged her signs that i really hated my life and i wanted to die blah blah and she didnt really care and complimented my decisions. I even told her that the only reason y im living is cuz of her and she didnt say anything and changed the subject. I told her i have no friends and yet she would never ask me when she went out with her friends but idc cuz all i wanted to do was make her feel loved as a friend and compliment her cuz she deserved it. Now that class is done i wanted to ask her to come out with me but i don't think theres a point. No one loves me, no one calls me to ask how i am , no one care and i dont care about my self either. idk what to do..
