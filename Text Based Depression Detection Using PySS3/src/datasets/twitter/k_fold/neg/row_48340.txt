Trying not to panic - COVID-19 is now in my city. Starting thinking of killing myself again.I've almost been having a meltdown for most of today. My hands have been shaking nearly all day. I haven't been thinking about self harm for a while. Until today.

COVID-19 has been found in my city. I am immunocompromised, I've had respiratory issues all of my life. I have underlying conditions. Iâ€™ve had MRSA in my lungs a few years ago. About two weeks of coughing up mucus and blood - every cough hurting so much narco was needed for the pain. I can't go through that again. I'm trying to not have a meltdown right now.

I can't make anyone understand this. They're not listening to me.

I'm thinking of ending things by my own hand quickly before the virus does. Not sure on what to do yet. Really trying not to panic. Stupid I know.
