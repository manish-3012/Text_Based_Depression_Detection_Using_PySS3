aaaaaaaaaaKay, so, I'm 19 and I'm pretty and I have a lovely boyfriend of 3 years who I love and I'm in University - away from home, from my toxic parents - studying a degree I'm passionate about and everything should be fine, and it's just not. It hasn't been for over 5 years of medication and therapy and bullshit. I can't see a way out of this.
I sleep all the time, because I'm always so tired, because I spend literally every waking moment battling intrusive, obsessive thoughts - usually related to stabbing myself in the neck with a shard of glass. I spend every sleeping moment enduring nightmares related to something which happened over a year ago.
I don't know what to do. I feel nothing. All I can reason, logically, is that, since I'm convinced there's no way I can get better, it's easier on everyone around me if I didn't exist. Even if I were to go see a doctor, I can't open up about this.
I'm sat in the shower currently, surrounded by shards of broken glass and I'm drinking rum and I have a pint glass of bleach staring at me. I just don't know what to do. I don't know what I want you to say, but this is the only place I can open up. Aaaaah. Thank you.
