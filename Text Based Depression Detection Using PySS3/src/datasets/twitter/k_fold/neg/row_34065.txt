Who will find you?Does anyone ever think about who will find your body?

Iâ€™ve been suicidal for about 10 years and I never thought about it till last year. I went with a friend  and his boyfriend to go do a house check on a friend of theirs that they hadnâ€™t heard from in a few days.

We found the friend dead in his bed, bag over his head, house locked up tight with the lights out. I saw what that did to my friend and even worse I saw how it broke his boyfriend.

So just consider who will find you.

Will your roommate find you 10 minutes after you pass out? Will your mom find you as youâ€™re still trying to swallow the pills?

Iâ€™ve changed my entire suicide plan because of this reason. I want to make sure nobody I knows finds me and not for a long time. So for anyone who wants to do it, just make sure to think things through before you do and plan out how youâ€™re gonna go. But if youâ€™re having doubts, just imagine the reaction of the person who finds you.
