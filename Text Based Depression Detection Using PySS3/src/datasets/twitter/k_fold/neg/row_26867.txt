I can't handle any kind of stressThe title sums it up really. Anything bad that happens, irrespective of magnitude or impact, really throws me into a downward spiral of anxiety and depression. I don't even want that bad thing to get better at this point cause I know I'm going to get back here when something else goes wrong in my life. And I keep fucking up so that's not too far away.

I have people who love me and that's guilting me into not doing it. I just don't know if it's worth my sanity anymore. 

There are kids who die of cancer man. They'd give anything to not die. And on the other hand there's me.. I have everything but not the will to live. I'm such an ungrateful pos.

I'm sorry for the poorly formatted rant. Just needed to say this to somebody.
