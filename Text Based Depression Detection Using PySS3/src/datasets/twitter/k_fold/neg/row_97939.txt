haven't heard from my suicidal friend in days, which makes me want to kill myselfidk man what's the point everyone hurts me or leaves me somehow at the end of the day I'm tired of fighting like anything is ever gonna be better I'm just a stupid ugly lonely person who doesn't deserve to be happy anyway. I'm too much of a coward to actually kill myself but maybe someday I'll work up to it, maybe if my friend is gone I'll lose any reason to care anymore..
