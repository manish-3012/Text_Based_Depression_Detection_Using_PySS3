I don't want to go through life alone. I'd rather be dead.I've been miserable for such a long time. And every time I think things will get better, they never do and I end up feeling even worse. I can't even do the things I enjoy anymore, because those few moments when I actually have fun become ruined when I get home and remember that I'm still alone and my happiness was just an illusion. I can't keep going through all of this. And no one seems to care about how I feel at all. I keep being thwarted at every turn when I try kill myself, but none of those same people want to do anything to help my situation. I get no say in anything and no control over my own life. I didn't get to choose whether I was born and now I'm trapped in a miserable existence that I can't do anything about. It's completely ridiculous. I'm not okay with this. I'm not okay with anything and I never will be and I don't want to be. I just want the small things that will make me happy and I don't want them to be taken away. I would rather die on my own terms then to be old and die alone with no one close to me. I refuse to let that be my future.
