Why try when I'm going to end up dying anyway?I could try, try and try in life, and I *might* succeed.



Or, I could die right now and never have to worry ever again.





And if I do become successful, I'm going to die at the end of it anyway. Both ways I'll get the same outcome.


So why bother trying?
