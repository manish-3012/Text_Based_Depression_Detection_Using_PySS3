Hello peoplehi, im too much of a pussy to kill myself so I don't think this is even a valid place to be but anyway. I've recently started with a new therapist after my last two quit. I was feeling better because of school ending but everytime I have an appointment I lose all my emotions. I just get anxious and easily  irritable. I want to talk about my problems but I always feel like they're not enough to actually make anyone care. The worst part is emptiness mixed with dissociation. I can sometimes feel a sweet "nothing"  and im out of my body , followed by feeling only anxiety or just generally negative. I feel like a bitch for wishing my depression was worse, but I just wish I had no motivation so that people would really care, or so that I would "need" antidepressants. Anyway, I partially look forward to things that might make me happy, and then partially wanna kill myself everyday.  It's not like I have the worst problems in the world, but I hate the fact that I can laugh my ass off over anything ever, but then not actually feel anything, or just be sad while I do it. It eooukd just be nice to talk to people who dont get tired of listening.
