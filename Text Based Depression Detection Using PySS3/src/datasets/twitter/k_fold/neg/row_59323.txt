I finally bought a handgun. GoodbyeI've had enough of feeling massively depressed and worthless so I bought a 9mm pistol. I have wasted my life away and can't live with myself. Since I can't become somebody else there's nothing else to do but kill myself. My note is written. Now I'm going to drive to the place where the biggest disappointment of my life took place and blow my brains out there at the exact time of day when it happened. I tried therapy and every other conceivable way of dealing with life. So this isn't a rash decision. People will quickly forget about me. Goodbye
