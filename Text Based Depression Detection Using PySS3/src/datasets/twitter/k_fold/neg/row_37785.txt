I need it to stopI'm laying in my bed right now, kind of feeling numb.
My mom just gave me a "fuck you" by the sign of a middlefinger. My little brother sticks up with her, because he has learned to do so. I'm so done with life. These small things that happen make it worse and worse. I'm at a point right now thinking if I'm not the bad guy. The problem. Everyone hates me, and that's a fact. Even I hate me. I just want do die. 

These thoughts are coming more and more, and it has become a daily thought at this point. I want to die, but I'm scared to end it. Life. I'm 14, I don't really have much ways and they all seem painful. It's like I'm trapped and either way I go I'll end up worse.
