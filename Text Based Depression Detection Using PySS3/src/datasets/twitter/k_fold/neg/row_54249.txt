I want to give inBut Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m such a disappointment to everyone around me. I can never do anything right anymore for anyone. Iâ€™m not good enough for my family. Iâ€™m not good enough for my boyfriend. Iâ€™m not good enough to be alive right now. We had to go on a 2 hour trip not too long ago and all I could do was sit there, looking out of the window, picturing myself opening the car door and getting ran over by every single one of the semis that were passing us. I think about dieing everyday but why canâ€™t I go through with it? Everyoneâ€™s lives would be so much better off if I did. Iâ€™d be doing the world a huge favor. Iâ€™d be doing my family and boyfriend a huge favor.
