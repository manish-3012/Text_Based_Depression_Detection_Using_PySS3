GoodbyeIâ€™ll keep this message brief and concise; bipolar disorder can severely affect the level of cognition that was present prior to the onset of the illness. Iâ€™ve had to experience a decline in my executive functioning that has left my mind in an absolutely unlivable state. Life isnâ€™t worth living if you canâ€™t function.

Iâ€™m going home early from work today to purchase a short barrel shotgun with 00 buckshot and kill myself. Iâ€™ll be sure to find a tranquil location in a wooded area to avoid traumatizing anyone. 

Best of luck to anyone that reads this or has similar struggles. Iâ€™ve just reached a point of exhaustion and donâ€™t wish to do this anymore.

Goodbye.
