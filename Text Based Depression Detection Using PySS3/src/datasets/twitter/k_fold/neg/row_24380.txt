I'm trying. I don't want to die.I tried to get help last night but she stopped me, took my phone. I told her I wanted to go back to hospital but she said I can't because she cant pay the bills by herself. Last night I had to sit in the living room by myself while she fucked a random guy from tinder in our bed. I could hear it all, not like I was trying to hear it though. I wish that was my only problem but I don't even want to talk about it anymore. I cant die though. I have people that need me. I just don't know if they're worth going through with continuing to live like this and I dont see a way out otherwise that isnt gonna just put me in an even more fucked up position. I dont have a plan yet though, so i guess thats good. I thought about just stopping eating and letting that do it but people would notice. I just dont want it to hurt or be messy.
