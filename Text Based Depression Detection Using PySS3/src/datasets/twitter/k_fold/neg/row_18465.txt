Pretty sure im gonnaSo like. When I am in a low I crave death. Its gotten rather bad. The lows that is. Its to the point that when I am regular or manic I just casually accept it. 

Like "yeah Im gonna commit. Not today though. Maybe when its sunny out" 

I don't want a funeral. Or fuss really. Just want it to be like I never existed.

Im not sad rn. Or on the edge of panic. I am just kinda stone faced about it. 

I know this isn't really good. I feel like this is a very bad sign. Gonna talk to my therapist about it tomorrow. God willing.

Thinking this summer. Wanna go somewhere pretty where I can hear the creek and birds. Away from everyone. Feel safe.
