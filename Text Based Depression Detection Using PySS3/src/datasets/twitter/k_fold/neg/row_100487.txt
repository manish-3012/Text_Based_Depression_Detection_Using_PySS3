Doubting that it'll ever last when it gets better...I dunno, like it's that feeling of "i can't care anymore".

Waking up is hard. Going to the gym is hard. Going to class is hard. I can't manage a day without thinking about it.

Everything just seems so pointless. I've been fighting suicidal thoughts for a few years now.

I met a girl a few months ago. We've been dating on-off and she's more than what I had ever hoped for. Finally, I felt like something bright came into my life. Finally all that "it gets better" bullshit made sense.

But she says we're not compatible... I don't understand... and it hurts, it hurts because she really enjoys me physically, but that's it. I never thought I would love someone like this post-puberty, and it burns that she doesn't see me the same way. That all I'm good for is her physical needs, not her emotional ones.

Even before we broke up, I could tell it was over. That's when these thoughts started again. A short few weeks of the best emotions I've ever felt.

Like Deadpool said, life is just a bunch of trainwrecks with some few nice commercial breaks.

That's all I can really see things now. I opened myself up for once in a really long time and now I believe that everything good in my life comes with a timer. The better it is, the shorter the timer.

I made $500 this weekend helping my friend write an app. I'm making $3000 more when I finishes. I'm interviewing at some really high-level tech companies these next few weeks.

But what's it all for? What's the money worth if it just sits in my bank, with nobody to spend it with? 

I told her about this, after she had let me know she had been through a dark time too. She told me to think about how she brightened up my life and that wouldn't have happened if she had gone through with it.

I dunno. She's right, but it's hard to believe it on an emotional level.
