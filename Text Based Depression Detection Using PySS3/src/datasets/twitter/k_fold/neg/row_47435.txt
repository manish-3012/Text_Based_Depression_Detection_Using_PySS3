Unloved? Unappreciated? Uneverything.I am a 53 yr old woman and my husband hates me but still says he loves me.  Everything that is wrong in our lives is because of me.  He works really hard but blames me for his failure to get ahead.  I am bipolar but still hold down a university teaching job which is pretty well paid but I can't do it full time.  He isn't even civil to me anymore and I really think he would see my suicide as an easy way out.  I honestly think that he's pushing me towards this.  I am on the verge.
