Should have killed myself back in 2016I only thought about it once in awhile back then but now itâ€™s all I think about. If the fascist becomes dictator again I donâ€™t see any way out. Iâ€™m a queer female who was told roe v wade would never be over turned by her republican political science professor. I saw what happened to Georgia and Alabama. I see the Supreme Court filled with snake talkers. I graduated college right before the pandemic. Iâ€™m stuck working a minimum wage job because nobody is hiring. Nobody wants me. I have no experience and everyone requires it. Iâ€™m going to be ruining my back working retail at Loweâ€™s for possibly the rest of my life. The only people giving me interviews are service work for less than what I make now. I recently had a mental breakdown and cannot work full time without coming home and crying myself to sleep, work, repeat. Thereâ€™s nothing left for me here if he becomes president again. It will take years to get into Canada. Thereâ€™s nothing left for me. Iâ€™m in debt for the rest of my life due to student loans. I cannot even pay them off because I canâ€™t even pay my bills. Iâ€™m going to lose health insurance at the end of the year. My bills will start to accrue interest. I assume after I defer my loans so much eventually they just come take your shit away. Idk. Hopefully Iâ€™ll be fucking dead before that happens.
