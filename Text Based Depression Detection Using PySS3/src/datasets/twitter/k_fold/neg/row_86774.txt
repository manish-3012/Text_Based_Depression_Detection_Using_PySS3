No one cares about me anymore. Iâ€™m living for nothingI feel like Iâ€™m going mad. My words are gonna sound funny Iâ€™m gonna crack jokes Iâ€™m just trying to cope really hard.

I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m doing. The friends I have I canâ€™t even vent to them. What does venting even do. I feel so fucking useless every time I breathe and walk and wake up, Iâ€™m just a burden on everyone a pure waste of space and I know that if I killer myself rn my siblings would be happy to get my bedroom, to get my clothes and my ukulele, and my egg chair. Theyâ€™d sell all my stuff and forget about me.

I feel valued by nobody. Nobody values me. I tried to talk to my mom and I canâ€™t even do that without being scared from fuckign childhood trauma. Every time I fail she threatens to take everything away from me. She threatens to sel my dog. And my dads even worse. All he does is yell. 

My friends are so happy. Liek they donâ€™t even talk to me anymore. No one talks to me anymore. I always have to intimate everything, they find problems in everything I say. And itâ€™s not as simple as find new friends because every time I do they just end up blocming me and I adding me and I donâ€™t get why Iâ€™m doing wrong. What am I doing wrong. Why is everything I do and say such a problem. Why am I just so repulsive that people donâ€™t even wanna talk to me. Why do I bomb every relationship romantic and platonic. 

I talk to my therapist but she always says the same thing and the same techniques arenâ€™t even working anymore Iâ€™m hitting a fucking road block. My mom doesnâ€™t respect me.
