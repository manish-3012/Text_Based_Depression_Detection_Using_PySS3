Apparently when people fuck you over it's just a part how "Life is unfair" and therefore you should deal with it and it's 'just life'. Does this mean all guilt I've had about wanting to kill myself (because it will hurt those around me) is just bull shit?If I kill myself that's "just life" ain't it?
