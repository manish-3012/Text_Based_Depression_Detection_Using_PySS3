Finding the strengthI have broke myself again. This is so repetitive. It seems as though I crush all the good in my life. I got a good job making decent money to being in over my head in debt. I can hardly afford the basics. If I were to pay my debts I couldn't eat. My car insurance double this month and I can't afford to change policies right now. Health insurance was cut from my expenses and the last of my furniture is going to be repossessed. All I have is an air mattress and a bed. My pet is going to a shelter and hopefully I will find the strength to kill myself next weekend.
