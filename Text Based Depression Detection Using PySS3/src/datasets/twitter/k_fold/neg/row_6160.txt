:')My life is literally a soap-opera at this point. It's a story full of abandonment, emotional manipulation/abuse (with some physical abuse w/ a  former step-father of mine), and I honestly don't remember having any long-term happiness. I got put on meds but those did shit, I had a therapist for like one day until we couldn't afford it anymore, and now I'm more depressed than I've ever been.

My parents were shit, therefore I was raised by my grandparents since I was about 6 or 7, but then covid came around and said fuck that. Now my grandfather might die and my grandmother is on oxygen (she *was* hospitalized but thankfully she's home now.) 

I've already promised myself that if my grandfather dies, I'm going with him. Because I've honestly run out of reasons to live. Hell, I might even end up doing it sooner if I keep having nights like this.

What's the point in living if it makes me miserable?
