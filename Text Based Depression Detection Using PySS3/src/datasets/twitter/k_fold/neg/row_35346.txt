The Struggle of the Suicidal HypochondriacCombat veteran and current hypochondriac here. Ive been going through a dark time and went to the doctor because I've been having some pretty negative thoughts. Of course, they prescribed by SSRI's. Here's the bitch of it; I'm a hypochondriac and deathly afraid to take any kind of new pill or eat a new food because I'm afraid I'll have some kind of serious reaction and die. I bought some new vitamins last month and had to take them for the first time in the parking lot of the emergency room...just in case. 

So I need to take this pill so I don't kill myself and die....but I'm afraid to take it because I think it might kill me. What a paradox. The shit nobody ever warns you about.
