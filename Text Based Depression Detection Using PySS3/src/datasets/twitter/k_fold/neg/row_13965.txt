Excited to finally exitI'm a 22 year old male. For the past 10 years, I've lived with lots of chronic pain, and fatigue that alone brings me to tears. It never goes away. Not for a second. I have no friends or means to make friends. I live alone. My parents drop off food probably once a week. The only people I ever see are my parents and doctors, when i get driven to appointments. The rest of the time, I just live silently in agony. No one knows I exist. My life is as though i'm the last man on earth. And i'm done living under the mindset that maybe someday i'll be able to make some friends and be meaningful to them. And that'll be what makes life worth it. Nope, that's bullshit. No one knows I exist and that's the best part. No one has to know i'm gone. When winter finally hits. I'm going to kill myself. And boy, I've never been so festive.
