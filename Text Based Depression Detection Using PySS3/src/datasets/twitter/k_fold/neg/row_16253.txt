i just want someone else to finish it for mei have been struggling for so long. ever since my father committed suicide when i was 6 ive been ready to make the same decision. in and out of my life ive been in these states so ready and so close to kill myself. ive abused drugs to try and numb the pain and then they turned into an effort to end my life. i abused heroin and overdosed a couple of times and coming back just made me want to die more. ive destroyed my entire family's viewpoint of me and have disgraced and dishonored anyone who has ever loved me. i just cant muster up the strength to do it. i wish someone would just walk into my room and tell me it is time. im posting this from my girlfriends account because she is the last person i have left and i want her to know that i have always loved her and that this isnt a reflection of her. i just dont have anything to keep me going. i have a date picked out where if things arent better im going to have to force myself. i just cant keep watching the people i love be hurt by me
