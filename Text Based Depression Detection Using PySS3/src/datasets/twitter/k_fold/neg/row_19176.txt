Delaying going to the psych ward.First of all, sorry to keep spamming all of these subs. I'm a mess.

I want to die. More than that, however, I want to have a happy life. But I don't see that happening, so I want to die. I am missing classes more frequently each week and I'm falling behind in all my studies. I have been actively suicidal twice this week and believe I need medical attention.

Here's the thing: if my university's PD gets called, I get kicked out of school. If I go to the emergency department right now, I will be on a 72-hour (voluntary) hold and and miss out on a Spring Break trip that thousands of dollars have already gone into. If I wait until after this trip, I don't know if I'd be able to keep myself straight while I'm away.

Maybe I'm just ranting, but I need some help or advice or something.
