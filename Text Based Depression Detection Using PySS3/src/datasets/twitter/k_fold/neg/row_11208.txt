The vast majority of people just don't give a shit or even promote itI'm a 24 year old guy living in New York. I was circumcised at birth. PART OF MY GENITALS WERE CUT OFF WITHOUT MY CONSENT OR MEDICAL REASON. If I was female this would be a serious crime. Why don't people see it. Its so clear to me. The people I'm suppose to trust the most betrayed me. And this is happening to millions of boys every year. And fuck your religion if it supports this. First do no harm. Doctors have to know what they are doing. Is it really just for a quick buck they are willing to ruin a life. I just want to be free of this pain.
