My family.I'm a person with High-Functioning autism, but that doesn't mean I'm not retarded. I'm very stupid when it comes to asking questions, being kind, or respect. I'm trying to disconnect myself from my family. I denied a trip back to my house and I am staying here, at my grandmas (I'm a minor) because my older brother kept screaming and I didn't have an answer. I'm very close to finding my fathers pistol and killing myself. I don't mind if I go to hell, this already is hell
