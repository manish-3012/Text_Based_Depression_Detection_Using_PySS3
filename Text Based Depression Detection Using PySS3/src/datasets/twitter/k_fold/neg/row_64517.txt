Lost in life and cannot find myselfI'm a 20 year old female who's an engineering major at a very large university. I hate being an engineering major. My dad expects me to graduate with an engineering degree but I hate it. I'd rather go into environmental policy but whenever I bring up switching my major, my dad gets very defensive and yells at me, threatening to cut off financial aid for my college education.

My parents are also in the midst of a divorce that I feel like I caused by going 4 hours away to school.

My best friend of 11 years chose her girlfriend (who does not like me) over me, ending that friendship.

My other very close guy friend at college and I decided to take a friendship break in mid June and he won't talk to me until late August. He's the only person that can calm me down in these types of situations and I miss him terribly.

I have a craniofacial deformity that has left me with scars on my face. I am stared at by strangers and am made fun of daily because of how I look.

I put on the happiest, brightest face for the people around me. I act like nothing can phase me and that I'm upbeat and positive all the time. Yet, I always feel down and in the dumps on the inside but I don't want anyone to know because I hate when people worry about me. I have a hard time expressing my true feelings to others and I bottle up all my emotions and keep them inside. It is killing me and I feel like right now, taking my own life would relieve all the stress I've put on my own back.
