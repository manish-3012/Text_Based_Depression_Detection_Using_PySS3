My last advice to the world So I am about to step into my garage and turn on the car. I got the music picked out and I am loaded with T3's and Crown royal to make it painless. I have been watching this subreddit for some time now and just want to tell my story. 
My parents divorced when I was 3 in 1980. My grandparents moved in , dad got custody because my mother is a drug addict and a slut. My grandfather sexually molested me and used to beat the crap out of me. He did it to my dad too. In school I was bullied non stop , called a fag. I always had bruises, the teachers always looked the other way. When I came home it was more shit. At least the bullies didn't make me suck them off. 
When I escaped home at 17 and went to the city I got a job and got on with my life. When I turned of age, I went to the bar for the first time, and got hooked video poker. I had so many issues already and got hooked the first night. Gambling took away the pain. At least at first. I blew all my money and started stealing , mostly fraud. Ended up stealing over a million, but they could only prove a little bit and did a year in jail. Got out of jail with the addiction , met a girl got married, had a kid , and still couldn't beat the addiction. She ended up leaving me, I started frauding again and have warrants for my arrest. I also discovered at 34 years old I am a gay male. I tried so hard to keep it in the closet and hoped those feelings went away. All my so called friends would flip out. I really havn't come out to anyone, but have had sex with guys. I don't have a job , I can't pay the rent, I can't see my kid because I am $1000 behind on child support and I have had enough. I can't do it anymore. 

My last advice is please don't bully others. If you are a teacher please , if you see it happening , stop it. 
I have seen gambling ruin so many lives. It isn't worth it. Please world, why can't people just work hard ? Gambling is such a scam and reprogrammed my brain. I know others who have ended it because of gambling. Please world, just ban this gambling shit already. 

Please stop the homophobia. Some of us are gay.

Don't molest kids. You don't understand the damage it causes. 
Please , do something about starving people , it is 2012 and people are still dying from hunger while we all enjoy our luxuries in North America. 

I will not be responding to anything else for obvious reasons. In fact I won't even be able to read your comments. 

Reddit has been great, I enjoyed the stories and everything. 
 I am sorry to my daughter, I am sorry for being so selfish but daddy can't take the pain anymore, I left you a note. Please forgive me and do something great with your life.
