Banned from 3 Twitch channels. Planning my suicide.Having Autism and Depression does not mix with the whole "inclusive" Twitch community that instead of helping you, would rather see you go away as you're a nuisance to the stream and bringing everyone down or annoying everyone, as most people with autism tend to have a natural ability to do.

3 channels have now deemed it necessary to take away my escape from my depressive thoughts because I was "who I currently am"

This is it. I have nothing left to live for because I've had all my friends bail on me, communities bail on me, Government help being completely worthless, and all my escapes telling me that "You deserve this ban, now shut up!"

I'm gonna head for a bridge to jump, get a knife to bleed out a main artery, or simply jump from my apartment. I can't take how my life has resulted in so much failure anymore. Death is sensible in this context.
