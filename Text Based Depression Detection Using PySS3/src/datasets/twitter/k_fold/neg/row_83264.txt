I'm not sure I can get betterI'm not sure I have what it takes, I'm not sure I have access to the right kind of care, I'm getting so tired of living like this. The only time it feels like I could have a life I enjoy and that isn't so stressful is when I'm dreaming. Everything feels like a colossal struggle and I pen myself in further and further. I barely leave my room, I go to class at college but I can't get myself to do all the work I'm assigned and my grades keep dipping lower. I'm a failure, my life is going down the drains and I can't stop it. I don't know what to do anymore, it feels like there's only one realistic option for me, I just need to pick the right time for it, but I don't want to do that. I just want this to stop.
