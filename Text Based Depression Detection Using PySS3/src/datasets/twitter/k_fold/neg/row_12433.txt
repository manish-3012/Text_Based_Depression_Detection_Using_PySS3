i am sadI feel guilty that I have a better life than a lot of people, but am still sad. I am selfish, lazy, obnoxious, and overall not very nice to be around. I feel like I don't deserve the support of anyone, yet oppressed that I was born lazy. I also feel like this is my punishment, and well deserved at that. I have less sympathy than average, selective mutism, and uncommon interests, so I am bad at making friends. I try not to cry for attention, yet I crave it. My craving for attention makes me feel evil, even though I try my best not to act on it. I am split, and I feel that everything I get is undeserved. Including the unconditional love of the people around me. I don't know what to do. I don't know why I'm writing this. Do whatever you want. I still feel like I'm guilt tripping anyone who may happen to read this, I don't know what I'm doing. My fingers have a mind of their own now. I don't want to sound like I'm looking for attention, and I don't know what this'll do for me. I'll feel selfish if I ask for help, so I'll just leave it that. Do what you will with whatever this is, and congratulations if you made it this far.
