unansweredevery time I speak to people I trust it's a cry for help. they've never shown that they care at all, I don't blame them.

they are busy leading their own lives they don't have time to care about how shitty mine is. I get it 

I want to get better but I don't think there's a point when no one around me gives one shit about how I feel.

Strongly considering hanging myself, if I'm going to do it it has to be soon.
