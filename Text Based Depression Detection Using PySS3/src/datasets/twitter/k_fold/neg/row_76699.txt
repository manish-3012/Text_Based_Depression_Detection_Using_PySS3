Where can I talk about suicidal ideation if I'm not actively suicidal and not willing to risk IRL disclosure?I'm not willing to risk telling anyone IRL - including by phone, short of some complex Tor VOIP relay setup - that I'm suicidal, because of the potential for someone having me committed or otherwise harming me. So I have never been comfortable even answering any questions about suicidality IRL; there's simply nobody I can trust with that kind of power over me.

Simultaneously, I'm not "actively" suicidal enough for things like chat.suicidepreventionlifeline.org. I have very frequent suicidal ideation, a plan worked out years ago, and readily available means, but generally when I'm suicidal I'm also very low on energy and spoons, and doing it without fucking up is more than I can manage to get the energy to do. So if it's just a question of "will I probably survive tonight", the answer is yes, but it's still a daily torture.

So ... where can I go to talk openly about severe depression and suicidal ideation, without risking IRL disclosure, and without being shooed off because I'm not suicidal *enough*?
