I just tried to kill myself, but I backed out at the last secondI'm 19, I've struggled with mental health issues my whole life, I think a lot of it stems from my mom abandoning me when I was younger. Around 7ish months ago I met a girl. I fell in love and I thought it was finally getting better. Two months ago we broke up. A week after that my grandma died. Around 30 mins ago I tied a bad around my head to off myself. I started to not be able to breath and at first I was okay with it. I was ready. But then I started to panic, I was scared and idk y. I cut the bag open what felt like right before I was about to pass out. I can't even off myself right. Maybe I'll use a gun next time. Why can't I even fucking kill my self right (this is a side account Bc one of my friends knows my main account)
