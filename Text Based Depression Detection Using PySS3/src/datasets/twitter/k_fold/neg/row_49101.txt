What is the point of living if you can't engage in normal conversation?Social anxiety can often ruin potentially good situations. And the chances of getting a partnee are even more slim. This definetly sounds like bitching, but it just gets annoying. I could have it SO much worse, but my life is essentially perfect other than this. I'm well aware that this is a bullshit reason, believe me.
