My life sucksI tried to kill myself about two weeks ago. Was helped and put on medication, and I still can't shake the feeling that I don't want to live.

I feel like I'm too dumb to live, I can't get a good job, can't seem to do well in school and Have no family. My electricity will probably get shut off tomorrow and I have no way to pay it, so I feel like it's a sign for me to just end it all. I can't even keep up with a stupid bill, how can I even manage life? The truth is I can't take it anymore.

I stumbled across this sub, and at least I know there are others out there like me.
