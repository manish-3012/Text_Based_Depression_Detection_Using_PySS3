I canâ€™t stand when people say theyâ€™re only still alive because of their parents.My parents are 95% of the reason I want to kill myself in the fucking first place. â€œOh, but donâ€™t do it! Mommy will miss you!!!â€ Screw that.

Iâ€™ll probably get downvoted on a fucking suicide subreddit for that though, so Iâ€™ll add that, rather obviously, itâ€™s great people have folks that care about them. But every fucking mention of it feels like theyâ€™re rubbing it in.
