I deserve itI've done many bad things in my life. Today I deeply regret all of them and don't act the same way anymore, but that doesn't matter to me. 

I used to be a horrible person and I'm pretty sure the majority of people would like to see me dead. That makes me walk around in shame and I get the feeling that no one would like me of they knew the things I did. 

I have a girlfriend who knows about everything and she insists that she loves me and that I'm a good person for showing remorse and learning from my mistakes but I think she is just blinded by love.

"The past doesn't matter" "We all make mistakes". That is bullshit and we all know it. People don't forgive that easily.

I hate myself and the only thing that brings me comfort is the thought of me dying.
