there is no point and i can't see things ever getting betteri know everyone's immediate reaction is to try and talk someone out of killing themselves, to try and convince that person that things will eventually improve and there are things to live for. it's hard for me to believe that these aren't just words. i know suicide is always sad, and i understand that it can be a selfish act, but is it really so bad if that person is in constant misery? 



i wouldn't say that i would try to kill myself anytime soon, but i can see it happening within the next year or two. i'm almost 20 and i can see the road i'm going down and it does not look good. i'm not self-sufficient at all, and i don't want to be a leech on my parents. i've never had a job and the idea of getting one is terrifying because of my stupid fucking social anxiety. i barely talk to anyone anymore because i avoid anything that makes me uncomfortable, which is most things. 



i wish i could rewind my life and avoid fucking myself up so bad, but i can't. i always wanted to become a business executive or an investment banker, but it's too late for that now. i know it sounds silly for someone with social anxiety, but i do think i had the qualities to be successful. i've gone and fucked it up and i'm too old to put myself on the path to success now, even if i were somehow able to immediately overcome my anxiety and depression. im so far behind everyone else my age and even if i manage to get an internship somewhere it will be years before i'll be able to move out and live on my own.



i just feel so pathetic because of how such basic things scare me now. i feel like i will be a child that my parents will have to look after forever. i'm attending community college at the moment but that's it, and i get anxious before every single class. i don't know how i can go on like this
