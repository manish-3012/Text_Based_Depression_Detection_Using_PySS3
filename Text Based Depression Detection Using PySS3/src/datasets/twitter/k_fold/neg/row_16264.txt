I just feel completely hopelessMy family problems will never end, it has been 22 years of them and the stress it has caused has aged me to the point I look and feel forty years old 

I have my dream boyfriend, but he was in love with someone else the whole first year of our relationship 

I have some good friends, but Iâ€™ll never be who they want me to be. Iâ€™ll never be the fun friend because I spend too much time depressed. 

I have no passions, no dream job, no life goals. It seems like the only thing Iâ€™m even good at is being sad. 

Thereâ€™s no hope for me. I feel like I know that in my bones. Iâ€™m a worthless person. I have no purpose. I feel like I only bring down the quality of life of those around me. I donâ€™t even like venting to my own boyfriend because I feel extreme guilt for making him feel any less happy knowing about all of my bullshit. 

Iâ€™m not about to kill myself, but god I understand why people do. I donâ€™t want any of this anymore.
