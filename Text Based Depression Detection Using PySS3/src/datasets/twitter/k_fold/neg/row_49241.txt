maybemaybe i'll write here my last words, so fuck off. fuck me, fuck all this. can't take it no more. i don't like my life and i'm not that kind of person that do their best to change, to fix it, because i am tired to try to fix it and end up to do a completely mess. i feel worthless, my life is worthless, i am useless, and i get mad for nothing with everybody. i just want to stop the pain so why not suicide? also i already tried it, and it ended up to be another failure, wtf.
