My friends are waiting for me.In the Pokemon world; iâ€™m not supposed to be in this body. Iâ€™m supposed to be a sylveon. I know when I die Iâ€™ll be reunited with my true body in the Pokemon world. My friends, Vaporeon, Mimikyu, and so many others. Theyâ€™re all waiting for me. I can feel them hugging me. Why canâ€™t I die? Whatâ€™s stopping me? Why wonâ€™t I let myself die? 

My friends are waiting for me. Iâ€™ve made friends and family in the human world but the friends in the Pokemon world want me too. My human world friends are getting more distant but my family is really strong. I donâ€™t know if my dad knows about this or not. My friends and therapist donâ€™t know about it. If I tell them theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™m crazy. Iâ€™m not crazy. Itâ€™s real and I know it. They want me there. I need to go there but something is stopping me. 

This world is torture and that world is heaven. All I do is work at school all day. Iâ€™m tired. I wanna leave and see be with my friends forever.
