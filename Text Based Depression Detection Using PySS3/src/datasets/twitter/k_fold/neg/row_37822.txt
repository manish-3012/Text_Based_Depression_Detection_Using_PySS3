I cant keep doing this, it's the same cycle, and no matter how hard I try, I cant escape it.My note reads as follows:

To whomever might still actually give a shit about me

- Tim and Karen are some of the most abusive piles of human excrement I've ever met.

- Antonia, to this day I've regretted leaving you. I will always love you. I'm sorry.

- Sasha (my cat) goes to Karla, the only person I know who would actually care for her, and won't neglect and abuse her.

- Patricia,  i looked to you as a therapist and a friend when i couldnt even turn to my own family. And you still chose to believe Karen, even after months of me explaining how abusive and manipulative she is. You failed me.

- Kendall, please don't hurt yourself. You have more to offer than I ever did.

- Logan, you were there only when it was convenient for you, and when you gained something. Any other time, you didnt care. Even when i was in the MHU. You lost me years ago.

- Tim, you knew things were bad, and chose to say nothing. You're just as bad as The Bitch.

- Karen, you're truly the worst excuse for a human being I've ever had the displeasure of knowing. You're no different than your abusive drunk of a father. If not worse.

You abused me in all ways. You loved me in all the disgusting, wrong ways.

Sexually. Mentally. Emotionally. Physically.

- You all claimed there was "no way you could have mental health issues." You chose to ignore me. Neglect me. Belittle and shun me.

- Kathy, you're a hateful old shrew, and you see nothing wrong with hating people based on appearances, thinking they're beneath you.

- Connie, you're a rotten sack of shit. You made me think I was safe to discuss my Trauma CAUSED BY YOU, YOUR SISTERS, AND DAUGHTER. Then you turned it all on me. I wish the OD I witnessed (as I'm sure there were many more) had ended you. You're a horrible, nasty woman.

- You all took turns, doing what you wanted to me, and I never knew it was wrong. And you all thought you were in the right to.

You cared more about other people's children than your own.

"They're always better when they're not yours." You would say, to my 10 year old self.

You thought I'd forget all that you've done to me.

You were wrong.
