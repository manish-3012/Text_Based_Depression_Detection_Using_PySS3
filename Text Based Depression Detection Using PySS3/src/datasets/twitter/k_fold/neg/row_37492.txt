I just found out that my girlfriend was considering suicide tonight. What do I do?Hello /r/suicidewatch,

I'm kind of uncomfortable with posting this, but I am really not sure what to do. 

I just found out that my girlfriend was seriously considering suicide tonight. She posted on her blog that she was debating on whether she should kill herself. I will do my best to summarize what she said: She said that she was fully aware of the fact that this would seriously impact her friends and family. She also said that she believed in an afterlife and that God would completely understand. She said that she just wants to go to heaven and be with her dead relatives and never feel this way ever again.

What really scares me is the fact that she said she fully understood the consequences and how this would impact her friends and family. The heaven part freaked me out a bit as well. I immediately talked to her good friend who already knew about this, and we were both extremely worried. After about 15 minutes my girlfriend finally replied to her friend and said she was with her mom and that she was okay. 

I am only in high school, and I have only been dating her for a little over a month, but I have known her for several years and have been friends with her for almost a year now. I didn't call her after I saw this because I don't feel like that post was meant for me to see. I don't think that I was the #1 person she wanted to hear from. Did I make an okay choice? I am really lost on what I should do. I decided to post here because the only thing I can really think of is to say that "everyone loves you, and I'm glad you are okay now" or something along those lines. 

What do I do reddit? Thank you for any help you can give me. I'm sorry that this is not a typical post, but I really have no idea what to do.

**Edit: I have completely forgotten to mention that she is currently taking Zoloft and has had issues with anxiety attacks for the past year now.**
