My Partner tried to kill himself, what should I do?Iâ€™ve been in a relationship with my partner for two plus years now and I am still very much attracted to and in love with them. However, my significant other struggles with serious self harm and even suicidal tendencies. It got so bad he had to be hospitalized. My partner goes to see a therapist weekly and is on medication but it doesnâ€™t seem to be helping. Iâ€™ve tried to be as supportive as possible but Iâ€™m incredibly emotionally drained. I can feel my self becoming more emotionally distant despite my attempts to be there as much as possible. My main question is, what can I do to relieve any stress on my partner and my self without hurting one of us? Thanks for reading.
