I don't know what keeps me goingGuys, I'm falling apart here.
I'm 23 with a history of extreme depression and bipolar disorder.

I live at home with my parents, and I struggle between going to college and going to work.

My life is a mess. I barely have the willpower to even type up this paragraph, I'm doing terrible in school and I'm on academic probation.

My parents are abusive, often telling me to just kill myself or that I'm a lazy slob. My mom often threatens to call the cops and tell them that I abuse her just to get me to do something for her. Its really fucken bad.

I have no place to go. My family is merciless and cold, I come from a cultural background that places someone's value and worth only on their success. If they aren't successful they are useless.

I have no one to talk to. I never want to wake up in the morning. I go to bed each night praying that I won't wake up.

The only reason I haven't killed myself is fear.
I'm scared that dying is worse than this. I hate the idea of losing what makes who I am, despite all that I've been through I'm scared of what lays in store after death.

Some of my family is religious and even though I'm not, the suicide stigma still scares me a bit.

I've been thinking of doing it in the most painless way possible, but I'm scared of failure and what might happen.
