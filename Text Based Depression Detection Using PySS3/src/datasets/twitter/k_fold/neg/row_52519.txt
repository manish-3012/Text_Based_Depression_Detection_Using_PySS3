End of my rope.A few years ago I was injured at work. I know have a lifelong crippling disability that leaves me in constant pain and have severely reduced mobility.

My employer dragged me through the dirt because I wouldn't sign away my rights. I haven't been able to find new work despite being immensly qualified and having had nothing but outstanding references all my working life.

I've been on over 15 typed of anti depressant. I started having panic attacks, insomnia and night terrors (in the 2 hours of broken sleep I might get every dsy or two.)

Diagnosed PTSD, anxiety, insomnia, severe depression.

The latest meds gave me auditory hallucinations and Neruoleptic Malignant Syndrome.

I've realized I have no hope. I hate my life and dread having to go through 60 years of this shit. The pain, the sleeplessness, the stress, the insults and stares if i dare leave my house.

After trying to sleep for fpur hours I got up so I wouldn't wake my wife and decided to go play a video game. I turned on the tv she bought me for christmas and it popped and smoked.

We have no money for a new one and I'll probably never get a job again.

This is this. The last straw. The final slap in the face and I just can't fucking take it anymore.
