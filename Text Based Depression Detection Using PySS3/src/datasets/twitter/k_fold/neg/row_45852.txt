I think Iâ€™m gonna do it tonightMy mum just left to stay up and look after my cousins and my dad is at work . I just donâ€™t think I want to live anymore, I have lied to the closest person in my life and I canâ€™t tell them. I feel so fucking isolated I have no one irl it hurts so much I just fucking donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to go on Iâ€™m so sorry
