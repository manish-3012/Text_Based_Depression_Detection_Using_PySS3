I need some help, please.I've been thinking of suicide for years, and it's worse than ever.

I know I will do it, but I know it won't be immediate.

I was anorexic about 3 years ago, getting down to 90 pounds. I was forced to get better and gained 70 pounds. This really messed with my brain.

Ever since then I have been up and down. I switch from job to job and give myself crazy work hours so I don't have to see my friends. I  feel like I'm too fat, stupid and worthless for everything.

Oddly enough, my eating disorder is now binge eating, and I feel so bloated and fat for weeks at a time, then I starve myself and loose the weight again, and then it happens again.

I know this isn't a horrible problem and everybody has shit to deal with, but for me, this is hell. I never wanted to turn out like this. I never wanted to starve myself and push away good friends.

I'm trying so hard, reddit. I run myself ragged and over work and over help to compensate for the fact that I'm shit.
