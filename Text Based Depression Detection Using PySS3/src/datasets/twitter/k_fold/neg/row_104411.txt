how to tell teacher about depression and suicidal thoughtsthis is my first post here iâ€™m sorry if i am breaking any rules anyway iâ€™m 16 years old and ive had depression for a few years now. nobody knows and i havenâ€™t told anybody. the suicidal thoughts didnâ€™t start until a year ago and i think about it everyday. somehow the thought of dying calms me down. recently the thoughts have increased and i nearly attempted suicide yesterday . iâ€™ve wanted to tell somebody for a while but i never really had the courage to. i would tell my parents but i know that it will break them (also the reason why iâ€™m still alive) so i would rather them not know. i know they love me and i love them both so much. iâ€™m kinda going off topic now so anyway i just wanted to know how i would even come across talking to a teacher about it. what am i supposed to say or do?
