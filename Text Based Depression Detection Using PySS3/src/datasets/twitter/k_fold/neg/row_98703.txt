TraumaI haven't been to school in 2 weeks. I can't ever bring myself to when I feel this way. The times I have tried, I end up crying in front of people or trying not to, and I zone out for the entire lecture and learn nothing. I'm 22 and I haven't been able to finish school or hold a job for more than a few months a save money because of my depression and trauma that still makes me suffer everyday. I've been in therapy and on meds since I was 15, nothing changes. As for the traumatic shit, things just seem to get worse no matter how hard I try. The only person who *kind* of makes me feel like staying alive is my ex gf/my friend, but not completely. I can't feel anything for anyone else and my family is abusive and toxic. I hate that I'm in pain everyday, for years and years. I often find myself daydreaming about restarting my life over or being able to rewind back in time. The past hurts me more than anything

Just wanted to get this off my chest.
