Close to giving upToday was a bad day. I needed my friends and none of them was there. I needed them because i'm applying for a masters degree and i can't write the damn motivational letter. I can't write "I need this spot at your university so i have a purpose for the next 2 years, i need this so i know what to do with my life and i need this because i'm actually interested in the topic even though my skills are probably not enough". I can't write that obviously, but it's the truth. 

So i have to lie. I have to pretend i'm a sane human being that has hopes and dreams and motivation and all the skills required. But lying and pretending costs me a lot of energy. And i have been pretending for years now. 

I don't know what happens should they reject me. I don't have that much energy left. And on a day like this, where i can't even count on my friends, i'm close to giving up.
