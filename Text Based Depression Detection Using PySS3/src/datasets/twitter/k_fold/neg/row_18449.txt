Wtf is the pointThis is my first time posting anywhere. I've been depressed for like 5/6 years, I'm 18 now, just graduated high school in the summer. My parents raised me by not giving me any attention, I'd just come home from school and sit on my computer or in bed, while they were drinking and pill popping. My whole childhood was me by myself or just at school miserable. My brother got me out of the house and I just I've been getting help for a couple months with a teen help center, nothing has changed. They put me on zoloft and I take it every day just to feel nothing and get drowsy.I just hate human beings, every friend group I ever been in I leave because I realize I just dont like anyone. I dont like human beings but hate being alone everything I do I hate. People say get a job like life will get better but like fuck human beings nothing is worth living for idk what to do. Another thing is that I'm asexual and I have never meet someone who I relate with so like the thought of getting into a relationship has never been there. I feel alone and also have the worst anxiety and depression.
