Need a reason...I don't know what to do anymore. I've been living in another province away from anyone I know for two months and I feel so isolated and worn out. I'm working in the field I want, but it's caused me to never have time to do anything outside of work, the area where I live (downtown) has nothing to do on the weekends aside from malls with a few open stores &amp; a couple bars (so I can awkwardly drink alone), I work ridiculous early mornings and I wake up like a zombie because I cannot sleep. 

I don't know anyone here and I'm at a loss as to how to meet people; I can socialize but when it comes to actively trying to meet people...no dice. And I feel so isolated and alone it's overwhelming. My family claims to miss me but then they criticize everything I do (and everyday at work people scapegoat me or constantly criticize me). The friend that once pulled me from my depressive tailspin three years ago has no patience or empathy for me anymore.

And I know it sounds pathetic, but the winters are notoriously cold here - I suck at winter driving and hate the cold. I am terrified.

I can't afford a psychiatrist, I can't go home and be a failure, I feel utterly hopeless while being here and see no reason for life. Really - I cannot see a downside. I know some people will think 'first world problems' or something like that but you cannot believe the mental hell I go through (well, some on here can).

I'm alone. All alone.
