Nothing to live for, am a functioning alcoholic.I have nothing to live for. Nothing feels rewarding to me at all. The one thing i had, my relationship is a disaster. Have been a functional alcoholic since. Here I am getting drunk for the third night in a row. And the only things I feel are overwhelming sadness and anger, and the desire to kill myself.
