7/12/15, my date.I plan on taking my life on 7/12/15, i'm tired of living. Everyday is constant torture due to the manic depression and Schizophrenia... it feels like no matter how hard i try i will always be broken, that's why i want to die. as days go by the hallucinations get worse and more vivid, they started out as shadows moving in the corner of my eye and faint whispers to actual figures, i can't take this anymore. I can't even sleep because i'm afraid to close my eyes because the nightmares are too much to bare. Lately i have been having Sleep paralysis and it's terrifying. I've been hospitalized, i have been to all kinds of therapy, and dozens of different medications, nothing works.  I want to die so bad but i want my body, to be donated in hopes to save another life even though i couldn't save mine..but i don't think my parents would allow it.
