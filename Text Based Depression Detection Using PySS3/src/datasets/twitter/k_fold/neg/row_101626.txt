I'm 25 and my life is crumbling before me. It hurts to even get out of bedThis is going to be a long story, but anyone who goes through it and reads it would be REALLY appreciated.

Okay. So at the age of 21 I was convicted of a felony and was sentenced to 3 years of probation, technically 4 years since 1 year was spent on bail. Because it was a computer fraud related crime, I wasn't allowed to get a job or anything working with computers unless it was approved by my PO, which it never was. I worked regular 9-5 jobs. One of which was a cashier, one was in food service, and my last job before I got off of probation I was a pizza delivery guy. At first, getting put on probation sucked, but towards the middle and end I was actually really happy. I had structured schedules, made lots of good friends, the whole 9 yards. Things were going great. Until I got off...

So a friend of mine who owns a company out in Houston, TX offered me a job out there making $800 a week with room/board doing regular IT stuff a few months after I got off probation. I got the job in November of 2014. The schedule was really laxed, and I could pretty much come and go as I pleased as long as work got done. A few months later (early March 2015), I was able to move back to my home state and work from there. Because I moved back home, I barely got any work done. They stopped giving me assignments and then stopped giving me my weekly payment. I'm a 10-99 so I can't really report it to the BBB. 

Oh yeah. And on top of that my best friends/roomates from my home city got another roomate while I was gone to TX for a few months, and when I moved back to my home state, I had to move back in with my parents. That's right, I'm 25 and living with my parents like a pathetic loser.

Losing my job, or at least seemingly losing it, happened today. Which that's what crushed my soul... But let's get on to something else that's making me feel like absolute shit...

So last year I met this girl through a mutual friend while hanging out at a buddy's house. We were really cool. In fact, later on she ended up asking me out. We hung out for a few months, then I stopped hearing from her. Then shortly before I got off probation, I heard from her again. Yay! And we even hung out a few times when we got back in touch. That was up until February. I had no idea where she went, or why she stopped contact. Oh well, whatever. Well, come to find out, she's in jail and has been locked up since February. I figured out because her mom randomly messaged me on Facebook saying that she wanted my address to write me. Then later told me about her heroin problem. (Details of that story is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/31l9jg/update_friend_of_mine_23f_seemingly_disappeared/)). That was over a week ago and I have yet to hear from her. Then again, she is in jail. I should be more patient. Either way, she was really cool and I really liked her company. We hung out quite a lot. But it seems like that is gone too. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't have anything to make me happy. I have no job, barely any friends. All my best friends have written me off because I'm too depressing and all of my new friends, well, i don't know that well. And that girl I was talking about, sure she's a new friend, but we had a really tight bond. Many people didn't like her or I for separate reasons. But we were always really close regardless of what our mutual friends thought of us. I honestly don't know what to feel anymore. I'm starting to think I'll forever be alone.
