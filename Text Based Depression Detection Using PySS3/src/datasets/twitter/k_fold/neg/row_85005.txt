I relapsed into self-harm. Need to vent, and I want someone to talk to...F/22 **[Prefacing this as a Trigger Warning for former cutters, just in case]**

I've had depression/anxiety since early tween/teen days and was a former cutter. I hadn't cut since 2008... up until about an hour ago.

 I just cut myself below my pelvic area on my thighs with a blunt household knife. I ran the blade under boiling water and attempted to sharpen the knife (to not much luck) and sliced into my skin. 

Tonight I was invited to my boyfriend's friend's party. All was going well until I began to dissapear, I knew no one there and had no one to talk to. I chatted with my boyfriend up until a point then he became absorbed into socializing, can hardly blame the fella, but during the night I sat on the floor and had people step on me, lean over me, talk over me etc. I felt more invisible than I ever have in my entire life. I escaped to the bathroom several times and I punched the tiled walls, I injured my right hand as a result of this.

As  soon as there was an opportunity, I got home as fast as I could. When I arrived, I went straight for the kitchen. 

I haven't felt this way since I was a teenager, and I still have scars on my arms and my legs from my darker past that I wish would just go away, and now I've just stumbled over everything I worked towards and made more.  

After tonight's events I almost want to drive the blade into my neck or wrists. I don't even want to be here anymore. I'm overcome with the sense of dread and only want to feel the relief of pain. I can't believe that I've gone back to this place. I thought I grew up.

If anyone is out there and is willing to talk, I want to talk with you, please.

**EDIT:** I've talked to some amazing people tonight. Thank you so much for sharing your insights and wisdom. I will try to reply to you when I can, but it's 1:30am where I am and I am feeling quite exhausted and I may try to get some sleep.  Your support has helped me so much already and I already feel more at peace. Thank you
