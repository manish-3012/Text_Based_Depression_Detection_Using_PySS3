Relationship problems are just amplifying my depression and pushing me closer to the edge each argument.I have trust issues that are causing me overthink everything and question every little thing that happens to the point where it's almost obsessive. I have no reason to question her and I do trust her but my family issues are out of my control and I think I'm transferring emotions from one thing and unloading them onto another just so I don't have to face the reality that my family is falling apart.

I wasn't like this before and I think she sees something is going on so she hangs around thinking things will get better? She's all I have and I don't know how long she can tolerate this and I don't know what I'll do if I lose her I want to fix things for her and go back to normal. Shes currently upset with me and I just want to talk with her I apologised multiple times and tried explaining I can't help how I feel sometimes and I need to vent and usually end up regretting what I say later. If I don't vent I find myself staying up all night thinking more and more about it and basically bottling it up till I say something I don't mean. 

I need someone who can help me, even listen to me when I'm being delusional and give me an honest opinion and stop me ruining my relationship.
