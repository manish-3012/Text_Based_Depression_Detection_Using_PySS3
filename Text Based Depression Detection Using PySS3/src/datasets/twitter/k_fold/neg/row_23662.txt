Iâ€™ve written all of the letters.And donâ€™t tell me itâ€™s just because I drank too much tonight. Donâ€™t tell me itâ€™s just because Iâ€™ve had a bad few days. 

My father walked in here and told me how much Iâ€™ve disappointed him. My sister told me that Iâ€™ve done nothing but use her and hurt her for months on end. My fiancÃ© told me that he thinks thereâ€™s something wrong, something missing, something deeply disturbed in me. My two year old son asked me to stop yelling at him today. My best friend, the person I loved more than anyone, with the exception of my child, told me he doesnâ€™t want me in my life. He doesnâ€™t need me, he doesnâ€™t care. 

Iâ€™ve tried for the past six months to be happy. Iâ€™ve tried to quit starving myself and be healthy. Iâ€™ve tried to quit cutting my wrists. Iâ€™ve gone to therapists. Iâ€™ve accepted that I was raped, I was mentally abused, i was assaulted, I was hurt, throughout my entire life. 

But through accepting all of that, Iâ€™ve also accepted the part I played in those unfortunate situations. Iâ€™m a liar. Iâ€™ve been a drug addict. I have manipulated and said horrible things to people I love. I drink too much, knowing that itâ€™s bad for me, knowing im destructive and hurtful when I do. Iâ€™ve lied to my father and my sister and my fiancÃ© and my best friend who I loved more than anyone. And Iâ€™ve yelled at my son, whoâ€™s too young to understand. Iâ€™ve cried in front of him when my heart was broken- he wasnâ€™t the one who broke my heart. He did not deserve to be yelled at or see his mother cry. 

I know theyâ€™ll miss me. I know that. But I canâ€™t help thinking that even through their pain, even through the longing and aching for me to come back- it canâ€™t be worse than what I have and what I will put them through in the future. 

I love my family. I love my son. I love *him*- my son and him I love more than anything. I love my friends. I love them and I am destructive and I am convinced that I will hurt them more by staying. Iâ€™ve thought this for months. Years. But looking over the past couple of days- what Iâ€™ve destroyed, the things Iâ€™ve said, the people Iâ€™ve let walk away (or rather- pushed away) within the past few days- I cannot see where Iâ€™m doing any of them a disservice. Theyâ€™ll heal when Iâ€™m gone. But when Iâ€™m here, I will continue breaking open wounds and creating more wounds. 

Itâ€™s just who I am. I hurt and take from people. Itâ€™s who I am. I have given up all hope of changing that. 

Wonâ€™t they be better off without new wounds? Without new ways for me to hurt them? I canâ€™t convince myself otherwise.
