I hope Iâ€™m dead by the end of the year.My mom died 3 weeks ago. Fuck cancer. It was aggressive and quick.  My dog isnâ€™t doing well. My dads mental health is all over. Iâ€™m the mediator between my dad and brothers fighting. Iâ€™m about to be in a long distance relationship due to work. I have zero friends where I live. Iâ€™ve already struggled with mental health before all of this. I am active in therapy, but I am struggling so much. Last September I wanted to die. But I clawed my way back to the top, and for what?!? For it all to god damn crumble again. I feel so alone.  I have been in bed all day, sobbing.  Fuck this year.
