So much has happened, I don't know what more to do.There's so much to say, and I don't want to type it all. My girlfriend doesn't want to be with me anymore, I feel like my future has been ripped away from me. I wanted to have kids with her, I wanted to support her, I wanted to give her everything, provide for her and show her how much I love her... But I fucked up, really bad. She doesn't want anything to do with me... I tried to kill myself last month, ended up getting twenty stitches on my arm, and I hurt myself again.. It's really really deep, I can see bone, I think... I can't tell anyone, or go to the doctor because I will go to a psychiatric hospital, and I need to be able to get a job... I don't know what to do... One side of me wants to do everything to fight for her, the other side of me wants to just end my life... You can probably tell which side is winning... 

There's so much to understand, I want to type it all, but I already feel like I've typed too much, and I haven't really explained anything...

I can't pick up anything with this arm without excruciating pain, I think it might be broke, I'm not sure. It definitely needs stitches... I just want this to all be over.
