I can feel the end comingIt gets worse and worse

I have no money.  I haven't eaten since the weekend.  I won't have anywhere to sleep tomorrow and Friday.  

The bad thoughts don't stay away ever now.  I can't function.  I can't believe this is me I used to be able to think.

I'm screaming at people I cut myself twice yesterday I picked a fight yesterday too.  horrible.  I scream at them putting these things in my head.

I tried the distress line but it's busy and wait on hold and wait

I try the crisis response numbers again and again and it's busy

i try to see a doctor I go to the hospital but I don't have ID anymore.  I don't have anything.

Need health card for anything, gotta get that so I try to get my birth certificate but I burn the forms a few days later when the bad thoughts are put back.  I don't think I can do this alone.

I picked a fight today.  I can't hurt people.  I will die before I let myself hurt someone.

There won't be any help until I really hurt myself or I hurt someone and then they won't help they will just lock up me and call it help.  That's what happened to my uncle they locked him up.

I won't let myself hurt people.   I won't be locked up.  I will die if I have to to stop it and to stop them from making me do it.  It's closer every day.  I don't want to die but I might have to.
