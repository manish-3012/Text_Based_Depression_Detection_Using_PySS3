how much ibuprofen will kill me?i donâ€™t want to die, at least not yet, if anyone understands. this is like my cry for help. iâ€™m too scared to actually tell anyone, so itâ€™s kind of like â€œactions say more than wordsâ€.
iâ€™m wondering if 3200mg of ibuprofen (taken in advil, if the info helps) will be enough to be hospitalized. if not, is there a higher dosage that would work without me actually dying yet? iâ€™ve looked it up, and some say 3200 isnâ€™t enough, but others say 3800 is enough for serious side effects, so iâ€™m kind of confused.
for reference, iâ€™m 15, about 5â€™4, 115lbs and female.
