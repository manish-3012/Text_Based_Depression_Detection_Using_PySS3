Quitting school or quitting my lifeI can't put up with the stress of college anymore. I'm an art student and I hoped majoring in what I love would give me the strength to overcome my struggles at least a bit. A year in I'm absolutely miserable. I might get kicked out. But I kind of want to be kicked out.

I have a boyfriend who's always there for me. He has no trouble with school and he's going to get a fantastic job later. I know if I would quit school he would still be there. If I didn't want to challenge myself anymore at all he'd be there for me. I know I'm supposed to work hard for my dreams but it's nothing but pain in the hope that one day I'll get a job I love. I thought I would love college, too. I don't even like it. Why would I love my job?

All I know is it's more tempting to let myself fall into the hands of my boyfriend then to let myself fall off a bridge, and that's what's keeping me alive. I just want to quit and fall into a life of comfort and happiness. A lot of people would kill for that opportunity. I know that makes me a coward, and useless, and a waste. But being with him and being taken care of is the only happiness I know. To know that you'll be able to keep eating, sleeping, being loved, day in day out. It's all I want right now. I know it's unhealthy for both me and my boyfriend to solely depend on him. But I'm at rock bottom and I'd prefer this over death. He'd probably prefer this over my death as well.
