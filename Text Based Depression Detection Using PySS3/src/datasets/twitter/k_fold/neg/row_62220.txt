Mike CallHey Mike remember that time you told me I had to call you before if I ever was going to kill myself.  I think about that phone call all the time but it's because I wish I could kill myself but I'll never have the courage to.  I hate my life so much and I wish I could text this to you mike I really do but I won't bc I love you and I don't want you to feel bad even though let's be honest how bad would you really feel for me.  I mean  you're a nice person so a little but come on in general like who cares and I don't blame them for not caring duh like people got to worry about their own life but I don't want to even moderately bug you.  So I want to send this to someone.  Maybe I'll post it on reddit.  Then I'll at least have the false hope of upvotes somehow linking to magical fixes.  Maybe I can make enough false hope to be ok again.  Nothing will every really be ok.  Im in pain, a waste, worth much less than everyone else, and people are trash a lot of the time so that is saying something.  Life is terrible and I feel like all my hope for a better future is gone.
