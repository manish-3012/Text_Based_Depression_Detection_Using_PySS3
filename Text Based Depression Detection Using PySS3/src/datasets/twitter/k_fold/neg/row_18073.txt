My best friend wonâ€™t forgive meThe other day my mother thought I was going to kill myself. She called my best friend who came right over. 

No I had not attempted to kill myself but I sure was feeling like I wanted to be gone from this world. 

My best friend told me that day. â€œSuicide is a selfish act and I will never forgive you if you do it.â€

I feel so alone.
