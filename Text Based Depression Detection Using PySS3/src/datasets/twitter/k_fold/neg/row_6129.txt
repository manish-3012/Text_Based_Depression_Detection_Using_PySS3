Not going to make it to my wedding.I'm 43 days away from marrying the greatest man. I'm less days away from taking his handgun to my temple. I've dealt with BPD and severe suicidal tendencies since I was little. There isn't one thing that makes me this way. I just want to cease to exist. I feel bad for everyone spending money on this wedding (at least I went the cheap route). I feel bad to leave him a widower. But I'm done. I know he is strong, and he will only grow better from mourning me. I'm surprised I made it this long. I was always the outcast. Believe me, I preferred it that way. I don't know why I'm posting on here. Maybe to have one person say something besides "please don't do it". Maybe to explain that sometimes suicide isn't because of a "temporary problem". Maybe to show that I'm not weak, in just not interested in life. Idk.
