I canâ€™t take it anymoreIâ€™m just a burden on everyone Iâ€™m around. 

Everyone thinks Iâ€™m lazy but Iâ€™m just in so much pain I canâ€™t walk most of the time and now my doctor thinks Iâ€™m a hypochondriac even when I have evidence that Iâ€™m not making it up. 

I want to keep a job but every time I get one I break down and they fire me for it. 

Life just isnâ€™t as good as I portray to everyone. I just canâ€™t be here anymore but my cat needs me. She hisses, growls and attacks anyone who isnâ€™t me but I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold on for her. I just need everything to stop.
