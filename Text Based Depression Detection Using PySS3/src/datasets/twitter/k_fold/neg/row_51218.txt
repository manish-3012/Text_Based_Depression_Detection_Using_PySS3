Halfway there and I crashed my carAbout two weeks ago I decided I was going to kill myself via opiate overdose (inb4 least effective method; weâ€™re talking heroin not tylenol, and I have no tolerance). I got a source, and I have just over half the money I need. I donâ€™t have a job so I have been doing food delivery to make money. Well, yesterday I crashed my car and honestly it was my fault. I wasnâ€™t intoxicated or looking at my phone or anything but I was just caught up in my head and rear ended the shit out of the guy in front of me at a stoplight. I felt bad at first (even though my car is fucked and his just had a dent) but then he flipped out like I had intentionally decided to run into him or something. And then I didnâ€™t feel bad anymore, because people like him arenâ€™t worth the air they breathe. I canâ€™t imagine getting mad at somebody for an accident/mistake. But that is the default response. Humans are disgusting and it was just another reminder that Iâ€™m not leaving anything of value behind. Anyways, my car is in the tow yard atm. I think it might be â€œdrivableâ€ but the air bags will need to be cut out, bumper replaced etc. Im so close. I need like 40 more dollars and then I can order my ticket out of hell. But now I have to wait even longer when I could have already made the money and had the shit by now. I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going with this. I guess I just want to say that this experience has really solidified my plans. And fuck American car culture so much. Every fucking week theres some car-related issue in my life and itâ€™s just a never ending nightmare. Seems pathetic but being forced into this American suburban life and constantly being told how â€œluckyâ€ I am for it has been a large factor in deciding to commit suicide.
