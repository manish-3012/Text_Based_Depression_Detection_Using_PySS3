Mom is going through menopause, tells me she wants to kill herself and is going through the process of getting a gunSo my mom is going through menopause, took steps to get a handgun last week. She sends me wierd 'im sorry to put you through this', 'I'm going away for a while' etc. she calms down then goes back into the same routine.

At this point i dont know what to do. I'm in California, i went down to the gun shop and apparently it's her right to buy a gun. I tried talking to her about it, and sometimes she just goes missing for some time. I was thinking of getting a gps on her car, but again i dont know what to do. If anybody has any experience in this please let me know.
