The only thing I want to know is: WHY?Today, I got another diagnosis. I just want to know why. Why the fuck does it never stop? It's like I'm fighting a current and all around me I see people, happy people. WHY can't I be one of those people? I just want to scream and punch something. Fucking why. I have genuinely not been happy in over 10 years. I have exactly one person in my life and even then I feel like a burden, unworthy, disgusting, stupid fucking loser. I can be so evil and so mean and I don't mean to, I don't want to be like this. I destroy and poison every thing and everyone within my reach. I can't deal with the new diagnosis, it's just too much. I'm going over the edge.
