Exam today but I can't even get out of bed (mild venting)I've been struggling with self-confidence for a while now but no matter how much I put I can never achieve it. I just don't want to do this anymore, I hate it and I hate myself. I'm just not good enough for this. Yesterday was okay the day before that I was fine, stressed but fine. 
I've been in a relationship for almost a year and I'm still a shit gf. I cant believe him when he says that I make him happy or cheer him up because all I ever remember doing is just pissing him off. Sometimes I don't even believe him when he says "I love you"
