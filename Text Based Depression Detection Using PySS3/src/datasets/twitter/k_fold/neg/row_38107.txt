I'm jumping off a bridge tonightGonna get trashed and jump. My life has always sucked ass. Girls aren't attracted to me, I'm a joke in social circles and I suck at my job. No one knows where I am and my family is totally distant so here it goes I guess. Thanks for sticking around for me as long as you could. I'm so fucking sick of seeing attractive couples driving around and having the best lives ever. I hate my stupid incelself. My life is so easy this is fucking bullshit. I'm so fucking dumb. I just admitted I liked this girl and she crushed me. I hate this dating life bullshit drama so much and who I am. Bye.
