It won't stop.My ex cheated on me. We tried to fix things. He couldn't let her go.
Ten years down down down the drain.
My life is ruined.

He promised he wouldn't bring her to what was supposed to be our home, our start of our lives together. He lied. He fucks her here. I'm stick here until January.

I wish he was dead.
I wish she was dead.
I want nothing more than to just slit my wrists right now.
Or go to the train and wait, but that's across from the fire station.

I want to stop hurting. I just want to stop feeling.
I hate myself.
I've never been good enough.
I never will be.
