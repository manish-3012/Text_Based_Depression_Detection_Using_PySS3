I cant live with myself anymore the regret has destroyed me I'm the worst kind of person. I have to end itMy ex and I talked today. I knew why she broke up with me..  and she confirmed it. I traumatized her I destroyed her.... 

I got drunk and she got drunk I took pictures of her while having sex and showed it to her then deleted it in the matter of minutes...
I broke everything she had her heart her soul her confidence 
But we kept dating until now

Why did I do that 

What kind of person what am I 

I forced my brain to forget about it until she confirmed what I forced myself to forget.
Tonight I truly feel pain
I can never forgive myself I can't. I just can't.
I'm torn into pieces I have nothing to live for 
I'm such a horrible person I don't deserve to live and breath 
I'm the devils servant I destroyed this girls heart 
I have to end it I have to.
I can't end it though I can't put this on my family I can't put this on her. 
GOD WHY DID I DO THAT
I'm so sorry 
I can't be forgiven 
I wish I could end my life god I beg that I could end my life I don't deserve to be here after the horrible thing I have done.

I'm so close to killing myself help please I'm dieing inside and I'm afraid I'll never come back from the regret and guilt that I have put on myself.  I feel my life fading from this.. 
My family im sorry I can't be here anymore 
To my ex im so sorry I put you through so much traumatic pain 
And to my friends I'm sorry I'm not the person you should be a friend to
I don't think I will make it I don't think I can anymore. Please don't be sad 
I'm far worse of a person than you knew me to be it's all a lie I even fooled myself so please forget about me....
