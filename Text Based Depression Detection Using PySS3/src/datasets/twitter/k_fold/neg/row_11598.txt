I just kinda feel that is unfair for me to be sad 24/7Iâ€™m not close to suicide or depression or anything but like Iâ€™m just always sad, I mean i donâ€™t really have anything actually bad to be sad about and thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t complain or tell anyone what I feel (except for this anonymous account :) ) but whenever I feel bad I think itâ€™s unfair for me to be sad and that makes me feel even worse, just writing this post makes me feel like sh*t
