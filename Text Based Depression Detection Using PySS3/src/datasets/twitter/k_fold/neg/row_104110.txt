Iâ€™m harming myself for attention, and I hate myself for itIâ€™ve been depressed for a while, few years I think. Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ve been officially diagnosed with depression/anxiety, but when I went to see the doctor about it they referred me to a therapist, so I think itâ€™s a fair assumption to make. Iâ€™ve never self harmed but I have bouts of suicidal ideation on occasion, never Anything too serious tho 

Recently, I feel like Iâ€™ve been feeling lonelier than usual. I have a great boyfriend, but very few friends.

I go to a very small school, friend groups are so tightly knit itâ€™s impossible to integrate yourself. Boyfriend goes to a different school, I see him one every 2-3 weeks. I want people to notice me. To talk to me. To like me. To feel for me. 

I just started harming myself, and I hate to admit it but I know thatâ€™s the reason Iâ€™m doing it.

Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to break skin. I just run the knife back and forth, denting the first layer of skin. It still hurts, and the pain is still good, but I know my ulterior motives. Iâ€™m so starved for attention. I want people to notice me. Someone, anyone. 

I know Iâ€™m a shitty person. I just crave the attention so much. Someone please notice me. Iâ€™ve never wanted to self harm. I canâ€™t even do it properly.
