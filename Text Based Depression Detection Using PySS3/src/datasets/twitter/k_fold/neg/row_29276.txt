keeps getting worse.every time i think it canâ€™t get worse it. just. does. 

i feel spent. i am exhausted. and i still donâ€™t have the resolve to do it. 

i spend almost every other moment thinking about not being here. and somehow the task itself? escapes me. 

i guess being depressed as well plays a part in that. 

i wish someone would just do it for me. 

kill me &amp; leave the note by my bed. bc I wouldnâ€™t like to be investigated for murder.
