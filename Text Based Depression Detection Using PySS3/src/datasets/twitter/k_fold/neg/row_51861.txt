I wake up everyday with the urge to dieEvery single day I wake up with the heavy feeling inside my chest. I would feel like I dont belong here, why am I even waking up, why am i trying? Fighting against all the pain I still get up and get myself going but the suicidal thoughts dont go away. It makes me feel miserable and stupid. 

Wouldnt it just be alot easier to die?
