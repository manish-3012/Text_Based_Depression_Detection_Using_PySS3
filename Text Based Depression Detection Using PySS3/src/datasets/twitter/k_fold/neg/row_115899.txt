Upcoming appointment with doctor(18 M) Okay so in about 20 days I have an appointment with my doctor. The appointment is an evaluation for setting up a meet with a psychiatrist. (It has to go through my doctor) Anyways, during this appointment I would have to address my problems and difficulties to see if im qualified of sort. Im worried how my honesty would affect this situation, and my bond with said doctor is not a strong one. I've been suicidal for several years, 1 attempt, several notes and its been a mess. Almost all of 2018 to today has been filled with suicidal and other intrusive thoughts on the daily. I won't bore you with details of my problems but im scared this will go south (hospital/mental health clinic) Basically what can I say and what should be left out ?. I dont want family finding out im severly suicidal. I have major trust problems so im looking for some feedback here if possible.

Note that im living in scandinavia.

feel free to ask me questions or vent.

Thanks for any feedback and/or questions.
