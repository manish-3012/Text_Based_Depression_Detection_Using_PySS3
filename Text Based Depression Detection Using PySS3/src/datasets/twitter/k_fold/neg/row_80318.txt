VentThe only reason i haven't killed myself is because of my dog. I don't care if that makes me a pussy or whatever, but i can't leave her alone. I just can't do that to her. I know my mom would give her away and it wouldn't be to a good place, and my dad wouldn't be able to care for her. I don't want to leave her, but i seriously don't know how much longer i can go on. My family wouldn't care if i was dead, my friends wouldn't care, and i'm almost certain i would be completely forgotten in a month. I really just want to die. I hate myself so much and have for so fucking long. It's literally impossible for me to have any positive emotions toward myself. I'm a fat, ugly, trans, gay, virgin who hasn't ever even held hands with another guy. The most physical contact i get from anyone is when they're sad and i offer to help them feel better. I know it sounds petty and rude, but it's honestly kinda upsetting that when my friends are hurt or sad i'll always offer to help, but when i'm hurt and sad they just tell me to stop being a pussy and shut the fuck up. I understand that, yes, it is annoying that i'm never happy and never have been. I hate it just as much as you, but i can't be properly medicated, go to therapy, go to a mental hospital, or do anything to help myself really. I've tried being positive. I've tried loving myself and all that shit, but it just makes me more upset because i realize there's nothing to love about me cause i'm a shitty douchebag. I hate myself for everything and try to change, but then i just become an annoying little bitch who is a fucking goody-goody. I hate myself so much jfc. I'm sure my dog hates me too. I'm not sure what for, but i'm sure she does. 
I'm sorry. I sound so selfish and petty, but i just needed to get this out. I'm sorry
