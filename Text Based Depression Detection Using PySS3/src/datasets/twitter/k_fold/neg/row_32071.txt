I have tried to get better. I just can't.Don't even read this.




My "friends" make plans in front of me and don't include me, they don't even feel like greeting me when they see me. This year it will be the 4th time I'm celebrating my birthday alone. I suck at English, I get insulted everyday and receive lots of backlash for my actions. I have the worst grades and I am a failure, it tells. I get reminded that I shouldn't exist every day. I can't wake up with 7 alarms. I would rather spend 30 minutes on a r / sbubby (Yes I know it's r/) edit than actually do something. I am the worst in PE. My body shape keeps getting worse. I am an ugly son of a bitch (no offense to my mother, I love her). The end of the school year is coming very soon and I haven't done anything to improve myself. And I can't. I'm not even seen as a last resort sometimes, I'm just totally excluded. Whenever I try to do something on my PC, I fail, even writing 3000 stuff in Terminal won't fix my issue/run the program (linux). I have no real friends, only online. Everyone is fucking me up IRL. 

A lot more shitty things happen to me everyday. This post is very unorganized, just like my life. 

I'm thinking of ending it all. There is absolutely *nothing* preventing me to do it, I am useless, worthless and super lazy. I don't know how to commit suicide tho, got any ideas?
