two weeks ago i was in the hospitalfuck i want to hurt myself. two weeks ago my boyfriend called the police on me for hurting myself. i was in a psychiatric hospital for 5 days. after that i was told by my mom and boyfriend i wasnâ€™t allowed to drink for awhile (drank two bottles of wine the night i was arrested/put in the hospital) but my mom let me drink with her because we had planned a trip together before all of this. my boyfriend is still not letting me drink. but today he worked all day so i walked to the gas station outside my apartment complex and got some drinks. im drunk now and i guess i see why he doesnâ€™t want me to drink. i just want to die and hurt myself. my mom was scared to let me go home because of this. my boyfriend doesnâ€™t know im drinking. i donâ€™t know what to do. i donâ€™t want to live. i dont want to be here. i dont want to go to the therapy i am being forced to go to tomorrow. i hate this. i hate everything. im just going to keep drinking.
