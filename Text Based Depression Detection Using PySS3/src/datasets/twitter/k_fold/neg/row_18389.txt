I called the police on my friendMy friend has been talking to me about suicide the entire 4 months Iâ€™ve known him and this past month alone there have been 5 or 6 times where I believe he would have actually done it had I not been on the phone with him. 
He has been depressed for years and used to take medication and see a therapist. He recently moved closer to where I live and now lives on his own with no help from his parents. Heâ€™s 18 years old. Tonight things got really bad and he started seriously taking about hanging himself. I asked him to tell me what I could do for him. He said to come see him. Iâ€™m in college and go to school 2 hours away from him by train. I have midterms this week and if I continue to do poorly Iâ€™m school I lose my scholarship and will have to drop out. I told him I could come see him this weekend and that I could stay on the phone with him all night  or text him all night because I have class in the morning. I see him every weekend sometimes for the entire weekend and when Iâ€™m there he feels okay and happy as he tells me. However because of my schooling I canâ€™t spend more than weekends with him and I think this hurts him. 
Tonight it when I told him I couldnâ€™t come, he got mire upset, said he had no reason to live. Iâ€™ve never heard him sound as angry or serious as tonight. After talking to him for an hour he didnâ€™t get any less serious so I had my friend call the police to his house because I was scared for his safety. I stayed on the phone with him to keep him talking because he told me if I called the police he would throw himself out the window. 

Im just wondering if I did the right thing. He has a terrible relationship with his family who live out of state, he works three jobs to stay afloat. He was just about to rent a new, better apartment. But other than me heâ€™s on his own, is broke and canâ€™t afford the care he needs. I donâ€™t know if by involving the police I could have made his life unnecessarily more difficult. 
Im sorry if this isnâ€™t the best place to put it but I just want to know if my actions were the most appropriate given the circumstances. 

Also, I was updated by the 911 operator, he was transported to the hospital. So he is safe.
