Picked my date, wrote my letters, and I'm ecstatic I got my first boyfriend. Things going good. Then, oh, what is this? Why is your hand near my crouch? I told you not to. Oh, you're sorry? Well that's okay. I'm sorry, you want me to put what in my mouth?! Well.. Okay. Wait, no. Stop. I don't want to do this. This is the line. I told you I would but no. I don't want to... No. Please stop crying. Ok, fine. You're leaving me? No. Why. I hate you. I'm telling all my friends what you did so they ignore you for using me. *months later* oh. You're so nice. Wanna try again?.. Oh ok! Wait. I'm guilty. No I'm sorry for telling. No, please they don't think youre some kind of rapist.. im sorry.lYou forgive me?? Oh alrighty! No you're leaving me now? Oh... Okay... Well at least it's all behind us. 
No. No it's not. Everyone knows. I feel their stares and their judgment. I'm a bad person. I want to die. I know how I'll do it, I know when, and I know where. I'm feel bad for my family, but they'll get over it, I mean they aren't losing much. They only spent 14 years raising me.
