Just graduated and canâ€™t find a job along with high expectations from familyI just want to walk into a welding shop, buy a tank of nitrogen and just go on a road trip and kill myself in a random state no one would ever think to find me. 

Itâ€™s been 3 months since i graduated with a degree in accounting and I messed up. I wasnâ€™t able to get recruited into a public accounting firm because I was busy working a job unrelated to accounting and couldnâ€™t attend events hosted at my university. I canâ€™t get into private industry accounting jobs because they only want to hire those who has experience. On top of that Iâ€™m very shy and have terrible communication skills so the few interviews I did get I completely bomb them. 

Iâ€™m pretty much fucked. And my family keep pestering me about getting a job. They think I am not doing anything about it. I been fantasizing about just ending it because I donâ€™t see how I can get employed.
