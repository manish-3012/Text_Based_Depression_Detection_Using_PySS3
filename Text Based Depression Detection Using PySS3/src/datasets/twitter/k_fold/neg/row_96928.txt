Iâ€™m a fuck upIâ€™ve never felt so down and empty then I do right now. My boss died in my arms.   Her death was my fault  if maybe I wasnâ€™t such a fuck up I could have been faster . My uncle told me I was the reason my dad killed himself . Iâ€™m starting to believe that. I feel like if I just ended it all no one would have to deal with such a fuck up . If Iâ€™m gone maybe the death will s to p. I wish I wouldâ€™ve died that  night instead of her.
