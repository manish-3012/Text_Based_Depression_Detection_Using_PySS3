I self-harmed again for the first time in almost three years (would have been three years in two weeks)Oddly enough, my self-hatred has seemed to have ebbed since cutting myself. I know that was a pretty angsty sentence, but do excuse it.

The issue is that cutting again made me... rationalize killing myself once again? Like, everything good that has happened in my life since my only suicide attempt (\~5y ago) hasn't really been worth it. I should be happy and I'm not, and I don't think I will be, honestly

The past few months should have made me feel better. I lost a lot of weight, I did incredibly well in my classes, and I started dating someone, but... nothing I do makes me feel better about myself. I do self-compassion meditations, I go to therapy, and I'm on medication, and I still don't like who I am.

The thing is, the past few months, while good in a general sense, taught me that I'm not the sort of person people enjoy being around. No matter how hard I try, I'm not... good.. at being someone people like, and I'm not sure why.

I feel like I'd feel better if I got a hug. Which is so pathetic to say.

Obviously it wouldn't solve everything, but I think it would help?

i'm just so sad, and I don't know how long it'll be till i actually end up killing myself

God knows I should have gotten it over with earlier
