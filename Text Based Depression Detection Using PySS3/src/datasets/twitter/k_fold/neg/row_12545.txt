Going to visit an internet friend who just attempted suicide. Need some helpI have a close friend that I've known for some time over the internet, never actually met them irl though. They just attempted suicide (I think they're stable but i don't know for certain).

I live several states away, I'm taking time off work to ride my bike and visit them.

I work offshore in a very tough environment. I'm not a comforting person, my usual MO to people complaining or showing weakness is to tell them to quit fucking around and suck it up. I've also been told that I may have aspergers  (a mild form of autism that inhibits one's social abilities), but I'm not sure of that.

I really don't know what I'm going to do when I get there. I'm partially afraid they'll be too ashamed to even see me.

Any advice is welcome
