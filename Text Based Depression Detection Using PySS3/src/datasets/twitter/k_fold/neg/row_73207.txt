An interesting titleI opened up brokerage accounts for my kids, emptied my retirement and put the money in for them. I've been selling whatever household items I can and will also put that money in their accounts.

My life has been a raging dumpster fire this year with no end in sight. I have an ex that's likely a sociopath and is focused on herself and intent on destroying me that I'm trapped. There's  literally no way out for me. I'm  fucked every direction I look. I've stopped caring about everything.

The day is coming soon when I can't back out. November 7 most likely. Maybe evening of November 6. I have a bottle of wine to drink first. God fucking damnit what did my life become?
