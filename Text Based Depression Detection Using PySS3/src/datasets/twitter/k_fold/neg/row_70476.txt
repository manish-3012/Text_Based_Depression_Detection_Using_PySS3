I cant stop crying, i want it overI am 25 I have been depressed as long as i can remember but its getting worse the last few days i find myself randomaly breaking down crying alot and Suicide is on my mind at all time, this isnt new i have thought about if for years but i am thinking about it more and more.
I have no friends what so ever my only friends i ever had were online but they have grown up and have real lives now and arnt on the computer anymore so i am completely alone now, i used to have a dog that gave me some sense of companionship but she is gone and i cant get another one.
I am asexual a virgin never been on a date in my life never will since i am not interested in men or women, I live with my mother we dont get along, we basically share no interests what so ever so if she ever talks to me its to tell me to do something or when she gets drunk its to yell at me, which happens quite a bit.
I have nothing at all as far as career prospects go no education besides high school, and i have severe test anxiety i tried to take an EMR once which is Emergency Medical Responder i studied was doing well in the day to day classes i got to the mid term of sorts froze and flunked out wasting $2000
I feel so alone and i cant stop crying, i want the pain to end and i dont feel like this will ever change, i hear the BS that it will but i dont see how, i have been in the pain for years and death would be a relief that i feel i deserve.
