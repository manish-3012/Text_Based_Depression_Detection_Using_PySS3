Endless rageI hate being alive, I hate being consensus,I hate having thoughts, I hate having feelings, I hate feeling needs of others, I hate myself, I hate others, I hate our society, I hate being broke all the time, I hate my looks, I hate walking around with an injury all the time, I hate how dumb people are around me, I hate how following your heart is a bad thing, I hate basic human behavior, I fucking hate everything.

All the time I just hate hate hate. I can't fucking stand this shit anymore. Recently I went to the gym and did some hard sessions, and even after that, even after I could barely walk, I was still fucking furious. This shit never, ever, fucking stops.

I don't know what to do.
