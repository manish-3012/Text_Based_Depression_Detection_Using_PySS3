Why is suicide considered wrongI have been severely depressed for as long as I can remember. I am constantly on the verge of suicide. I hate life, I hate MY life. I can't fucking stand it.
  Who decided that suicide is wrong? And why is it wrong? 
   If I want to go out and kill myself, or at least try again, it should be my choice and my choice alone.
