Iâ€™ve had A bad night.I tried to kill myself. I took 80 sleeping pills and lay on my bed and waited to die. 

My fiancÃ© saw what I had done and called an ambulance. 

There was more that that happened in between waiting to die and going to the hospital but I canâ€™t remember it. 

I donâ€™t remember anything snout the ambulance or actually getting into my room at the hospital. Itâ€™s s scary feeling to miss chunks of your life. 

My fiancÃ© and the paramedics apparently had to fight with me to get off the floor of the bathroom where Iâ€™d been throwing up. 

Cut to a few hours later and I keep trying to get out of the bed to go to the bathroom. They wouldnâ€™t let me go after I tried again and again only managing to fall on my face they strapped my arms and legs to the bed. 

I cried and begged them to take them off but they kept saying it was for my own safety. That level of treatment only made everything worse. Bring restrained like that makes me crazy. 

During the night I called members of my family and went off on weird tangents about absolutely nothing. I made up people and things that never happened to me. I did it to the nurses too. Iâ€™d wake up from a half sleep and mumble about nothing. I felt like the nurses hated me. 

Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s more I donâ€™t remember. And much more weird.

It was an awful experience all around and I have to agree with the thing people say that once you do attempt suicide you almost always regret it. 

I guess I just want to say suicide is still a huge part of my mindset but this experience has changed my likelihood of doing it again to 0.
