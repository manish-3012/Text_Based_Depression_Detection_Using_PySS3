I 16m contemplated suicide since the age of 13 but itâ€™s at its peak nowI stress over everything of life I told my parents almost 2 years ago that I was going to kill myself they acted liked they care but than the next day everything was okay I think they just thought I did that to not go to school the next day but I was seriously about jumped head first out of that window than I talk about to my dad a lot never takes me serious.My stress is terrible itâ€™s not even worth living anymore know one would even fucking care if I was dead Thinking of killing myself tonight.
