I need help being more social..Hi, I am and have been depressed for a long time now. To the point where I cant sleep well and I cant stand being awake. I also noticed that I am starting to be short with people and talk quieter and quieter. My teachers in school talk to me and I just kind of pass it off with "yea.." or "just getting through school".  But I noticed one thing that really hurts is that on the outside im introverted and shy but on the inside I am extroverted and want to talk to people so badly and just be myself but im so scared. It hurts that I cant talk to anyone and that I cant get through a conversation normally. I just wish I could talk to people and have friends like other people. So does anyone have any tips or advice to think about when im trying to talk to people? Anything would be helpful, I dont really know what im even asking for or wanting here. Im just in a really weird place and would love any help cause I want to get better and I dont want to be depressed or suicidal anymore and I want to be a better person.
