Waking up to Ativan cravings and suicidal ideationMy depression and anxiety is at an all time high since my last suicide attempt 3.5 years ago. I was doing alright for a few years, would experience the occasional mental breakdown but nothing too serious. But this morning I woke up craving Ativan, which I haven't taken in about 3 years. And then I started thinking about setting a date for another suicide attempt. I just feel like a waste of space and want to erase myself from this world. I graduated college, got a full-time job, quit said full-time job because I was unbelievably miserable and the pay sucked. I look at my former classmates and they have great full-time jobs and it makes me feel like complete shit. My personal life is in shambles. I still fuck my ex/close friend as a form of escapism and out of sheer loneliness and it provides a false sense of intimacy. What really triggered my depression/anxiety as of late was an event that occurred at my ex's. I got shitfaced drunk and told him (as I broke down in tears) that I cared about him so much and I wasn't sure why I cared. And now I'm worried that he doesn't want to see me or talk to me. I value his opinion so much, and I don't know why. I'm so depressed and anxious and for the first time in a while, I truly feel like I want to die.
