I'm always cold... LiterallyI am always cold, particularly my back and arms. Even when I wear warm cloths I'm cold. Is this normal does anyone else experience this? Is this a part of depression? I looked it up and got no straight answers. Why am I always cold? 

It feels more like my insides are cold then skin. What is this?
