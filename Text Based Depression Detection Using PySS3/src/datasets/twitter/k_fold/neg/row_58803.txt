living a joyless life is exhaustingIâ€™m not necessarily suicidal but life is feeling overwhelming and Iâ€™m having a lot of moments where I just want to burry my head beneath blankets and scream â€œfuâ€” itâ€ to life in general.

Iâ€™m dysthymia, have add and am drowning in student loan debt.  I have a graduate degree and a child with special needs (single mom).  I feel that Iâ€™ve ruined my life by going to grad school at an older age.  I owe 70k and wonâ€™t be able to pay off student loans until Iâ€™m 55 even if Iâ€™m paying as much as I humanly can.  Iâ€™ve been single for twelve years since I left my ex.  We will likely lose our rental in the new year due to the landlord bringing in family.

I own nothing.  My car will likely fall apart within six months and I canâ€™t even save money for a replacement due to huge loan payments, sonâ€™s specialists, and living in one of the most expensive cities in the world. 

I feel like Iâ€™ve accomplished nothing on my life.  My life consists of waking up and talking to myself for 1-2 hours in order to get up, working 40-50 hours weekly, crying on the way home, putting all my energy into my lovely teen child, then eating chocolate to make myself  feel better and then passing out in bed.  Nothing that I used to enjoy gives me any pleasure or joyful feelings.  And I donâ€™t see any way to make my life better.  Itâ€™s been like this for years.

Iâ€™m not going to off myself tomorrow as I have a child I love immensely, though I do feel like he lost the parenting jackpot.  But maybe in a few years when heâ€™s an adult.
