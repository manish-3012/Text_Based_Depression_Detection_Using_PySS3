Just another post.I don't think I'm suicidal. I do keep having reoccurring visions of blowing my brain out through the top of my head. If I owned a gun, I would probably surrender it somewhere, get it out of the house.

I'm pretty sure that I will die a violent death. Maybe crash my car. Maybe drown in a hot tub. Maybe collapse on a burning stove while frying up some eggs, then flop around on the ground while my clothes are on fire. Maybe smother myself in bed. I don't know what it will be and I won't even realize that it happened.

Ultimately, I'm too selfish to actually go through with anything.
