Can't carry on anymoreI've literally just made this account, because I really don't know what else to do with myself and I need a distraction.
Today was so horrible I feel like my outbursts of anger are getting worse and worse and today was probably the closest I've come to either running away or killing myself. Everything is going wrong this year already, lost my job, broke af and my depression I've had since I was 14 has returned 100 times worse than ever. I've always contemplated suicide more times than I can count but today I think I actually scared myself in realising that it's something I'm eventually gonna do. I snapped at my mom again today this time it ended with her saying don't come here ever again, and at the time I don't give a fuck and will happily agree to never see her again, but it's when I return home and start crying to myself that I need my mom so much and that the whole argument was caused by me, I just don't know what to do anymore, leaving work has only made me realise how depressed I actually am, it's rare I come out of bed until it's past afternoon, the loneliness is creeping in again and I know I have literally no one to turn to now because I've pushed everyone away, and I'm terrified of what I might do ðŸ˜ª
Sorry I've never posted on here before so I don't know what to do
