Suicide attempt - what now?This post is not about me. I'm not really suicidal or anything. But today I heard someone I know attempted suicide. Fortunately, she survived and it's a miracle but her injuries aren't permanent. This person is not my friend it's just someone I know, but my friends were often hanging out with this person. And even I'm quite deeply affected by this event and don't know what to do. This whole time I can't do anything because I feel like I don't deserve to watch a movie, I don't have any right to read a book. I was eating lunch when I heard it, so I can't seem to finish it. What should I do in this situation? I don't want to ask questions, because it may be rude. But I'm worried about my friends... And... I seriously don't know how to react to such news. It seems so unreal to me...
