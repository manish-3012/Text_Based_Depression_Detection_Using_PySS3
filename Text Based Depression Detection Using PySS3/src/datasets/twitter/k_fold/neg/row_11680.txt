Hindsight?Say yoy are 70 years old and your life was miserable.  I mean horribly unfulfilled and sad.  Would that make you wish you had killed yourself when you saw it coming?  No don't give me any bull crap about it gets better.  I want to know if you had already lived life and it was horrible would you feel like suicide before the suffering was a better option.  Because honestly for some people it does not ever get better, so is years of suffering better than suicide?
