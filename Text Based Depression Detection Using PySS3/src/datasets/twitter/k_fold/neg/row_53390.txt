If you've had a parent commit suicide...Do you think it's had a negative impact on your life or future? Do you think of what it would be like if they were in your life today? If so, why is this important to you?

On a personal note, it is unfortunate I have a inclusive lack of understanding for anything emotional or objectifiable. I reflect upon the actions of myself and others that are impelled by this impulse of the human nature and notice only greed. Only an idealist can find merit in this covetous behavior; clinging to the subconscious hope that this will propel themselves further into their reward ideology. I consider myself not depressive; simply, without logical understanding of this adventure we call destiny. I do not look forward to survival, money, a relationship, personal satisfaction and sadly my beloved daughter. I firmly believe the experiences in life are merely stepping stones to gain a full understanding and appreciance for the last moments before sentience is lost. In those moments, the purpose of your life will proudly show itself.

tl;dr maybe I'm just crazy..
