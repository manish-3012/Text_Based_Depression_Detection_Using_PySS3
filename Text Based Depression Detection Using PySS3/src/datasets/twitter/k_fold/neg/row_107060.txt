(x-post r/depression) this year is supposed to be the light at the end of the tunnel, but the universe is telling me not to carry onHi everyone. I just posted this elsewhere, but I wasn't sure if this subreddit would be more helpful since it's specifically for suicidal thoughts.

I've dealt with abuse all my life from my mother. It's been rough. I have faced physical and sexual abuse at home. She even put my father in urgent care. Last year was the worst, I ran away for eight days straight in the middle of winter. I couldn't deal with it anymore. Some other subreddits were very helpful in dealing with that.

Then, I survived junior year. Finally. Senior year starts in just about a week, I've already gone through so much, and I'll be graduated and off on my own. What's one lousy year compared to 17? It'll be a breeze and I can just enjoy it, right?

First, I started off my summer shedding hair from my head and finding little strands on my neck and chin. My periods were really irregular. I went to a doctor and was diagnosed with PCOS. I have been on birth control for that, and it has only lessened the symptoms.

Then, I started to get migraines. Real, actual migraines. I have never experienced them before, but it is the worst pain of my life and they can last for 48 hours. There is still fighting going on at home, so it's rough.

My spoiled, almost 27 year old sister who has been living at home for 14 months told me I was lying when I tried to confide in her about a suicide attempt. I told nobody before her and nobody after her. I have always been there to listen to her petty problems with guys or problems she thinks are more severe. I have never called her a liar. I've always been supportive. The one person in this house I thought would be supportive of me is actually evil and vindictive. I wouldn't speak to her for two weeks after this happened. This was around the time of my PCOS diagnosis, and she was starting to convince my parents that I should find my own treatment since I'm too "immature" to talk to her. She cries the loudest, so they listen. Apparently, it's more immature to ignore someone than it is to cry to mommy and daddy when you're having a problem with your then 17 year old sister.

And now, today, I woke up feeling this sharp pain in my neck. It's awful. I feel it to find that there is a lump on my throat. I'm so fucking scared. I know that self-diagnosis isn't the healthiest thing to do but knowing my luck it's probably really serious. 

I've been through so many obstacles already. It should have been obvious to me before. I'm not supposed to be alive. Life isn't for me. I'm a glitch. My parents weren't even expecting to have me at 43 and 44 years old. I should just end it. 


TL;dr: I've faced a life of abuse and now that it's all about to be over, I keep getting really sick
