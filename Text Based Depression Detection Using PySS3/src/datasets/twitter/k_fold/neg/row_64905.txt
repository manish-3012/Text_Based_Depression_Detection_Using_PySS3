I canâ€™t see the point in lifeI just runned out of all my energies. I donâ€™t see anything clear about my future, because nothing really matters to me. Im not important to my parents, and I think that wouldnâ€™t change anything about my thoughts if they care. 
Im just too exhausted to kill myself but I think that is the last and only effort that I need to do.
