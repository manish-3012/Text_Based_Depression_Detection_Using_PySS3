Being told to seek out a doctor is condescending. Especially after I already explained my problems. Its hopeless. I'm killing myself in a few days.So therapy and/or medication can cure my chronic severe nausea, fatigue, body pains, rage, hopelessness, agoraphobia, panic attacks, daily anxiety and paranoia? I don't believe that. There is *so fucking much* wrong with me, I don't see how anything could possibly help at this point. I haven't even left my house in 7 months, and I mean that literally. I dropped out of school at 13, and lost all my friends at 14.

I spend my days online trying to distract myself from the living hell i'm in. 

I'm lonely. Everyone else in my family has a life. Even my parents have tried to get me help, but they've been told theres nothing that can be done for me anymore. Apparently while I was hospitalized a year ago, I was declared a lost cause. I thought doctors were there to help and dig as deep as they can to find out whats wrong with you.

I can't take it anymore.
