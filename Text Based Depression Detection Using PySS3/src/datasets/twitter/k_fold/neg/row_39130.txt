Not suicidal but no reason to liveI don't know what it is about me, but I just don't care to live my life. I'm 17 and my life is fine. Great family, good in school, and everyone tells me that I'll do great things in my life. But I just don't care to go through the rest of life. I have one year of high school left and afterwards, I don't see any happiness forthcoming. I don't want to go through a whole lifetime's worth of studying/working and then eventually dying slowly and probably painfully. I just feel that if I ended it now it would be easier then sinking into a depressed state later on. When I go to sleep I hope that I don't wake up. I don't think I could ever kill myself forcefully by my own hand, but I'm always hoping for something else to kill me, like a drunk driver hitting me while I'm on a walk or something. I don't know if I'm depressed, but all I know is that I don't have true happiness anymore. I'll have moments, mainly with my parents or siblings, but in general, I'm not happy. I'm feel dead inside and I don't know what to do.
