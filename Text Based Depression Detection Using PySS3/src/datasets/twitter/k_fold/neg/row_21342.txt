Burnout. Distraught. Making my own light at the end of the tunnel.Sometimes thatâ€™s all you can do.

Iâ€™ve got a date picked out. I need to get some affairs in order and have my will notarized, but I will stop being a burden to everyone around me soon enough.

I am so sorry it has to be like this.
