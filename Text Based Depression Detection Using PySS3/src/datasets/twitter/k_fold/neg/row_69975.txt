i wish my brother didnt exist so i could kill myself guilt freeI know its a horrible thought. I love my little brother with all my heart.He's only 9 and our parents are abusive. I live in a different country now to which my mother has moved too and she is aiming to move my brother over this summer, with which I am supposed to help. Over the last few months, I have discovered more ways in which my abuse has affected me/my ingrained behaviours which has just left me feeling weak and horrible. I find it all overwhelming and I dont feel that I can change it all in time for me to be a successful adult, I just want to die. But I feel responsible for my brother. I know if i attempt anything, even if I don't succeed it will affect my brothers chances. Im not even talking about the emotional damage, but financially, my parents arent very well off so its all about money. I just hate feeling responsible to stay alive just so that he has a chance of having a slightly better life. Im barely functional and im supposed to be a model to him and be a good sister. I dont know how to do any of that, I just want to die.
