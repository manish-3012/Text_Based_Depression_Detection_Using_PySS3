Ten yearsItâ€™s been ten years since I tried to kill myself. 

Nothing seems any better, I try to improve myself, to find some shred of happiness but Iâ€™m still not good at anything. 

Sitting at work right now just contemplating giving it another try but knowing me Iâ€™ll just get it wrong again. 

It sucks being absolute shit at everything and other people just telling you to â€œkeep trying! Practice makes perfectâ€ 

Iâ€™ve been trying, Iâ€™ve been practicing, for ten long years and Iâ€™m still not happy. 

Looking at job applications and knowing full well that I will suck at them even worse than this one. 

Iâ€™ve failed upward and am now stuck in an industry that I hate with more responsibility than I can handle. 

Just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
