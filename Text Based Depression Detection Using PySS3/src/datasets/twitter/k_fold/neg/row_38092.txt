There is no point.Iâ€™ve tried with life so many times just for it to give me nothing back ever, My friends donâ€™t fucking care about me. Iâ€™m always the one that has to initiate conversation or they wonâ€™t talk to me so like what the fuck why am I the one that always puts in effort, They donâ€™t give a shit and this is how it is with everyone when I even try make friends people just stop replying to me. There are too many battles in life that Iâ€™m struggling to keep up with and Iâ€™m so done with it all, Why stick around for anyone when no one cares.
