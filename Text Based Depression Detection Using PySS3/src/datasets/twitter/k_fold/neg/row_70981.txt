I want to stop existing, but I'm worried that if I fail I'll have made my life even worse.I want to stop existing, have done for a while but tonight its just unbearable and I don't want to do it anymore.

I'm just worried that if I don't do it right, which I'm almost certain I won't, I don't have balls of steel or anything, I'll have made my life worse. My friends and family will hate me for it, i'll probably loose my job, my progress at university will slow down because of it. I don't want to deal with those things anymore but I'm worried if I don't do it right I'll have to deal with them so much more.
