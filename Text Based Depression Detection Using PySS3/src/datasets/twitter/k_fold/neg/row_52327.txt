I can't do thisI really can't do this. 

I am a trans man on hormones and I have been menstruating for six months and the doctors can't figure out why or how to stop it. It's been getting progressively worse - heavier and longer - by the month. 

I am in agonizing pain and experiencing dysphoria that I thought I had left behind years ago. (Until this happened I was dysphoria free for more than three years.) My husband, who was my rock and promised to help me get through this, is dead. If I were with him I would not be dealing with this and I would be with him. 

I am emailing my therapist after I post this and I don't have a plan but I really want to be dead right now.
