Everyone is so oblivious it makes me laugh.You'd think the constant self deprecation and hatred would be some inkling that I'm hurting.
But nah. "I'm here for you" doesn't mean shit if you don't prove it when I need it most.
I've heard way too much about people having their best friends leave them when they need it most.. and I can see myself being on both sides of the coin. It hurts me just as much as it hurts them.

Even after me making it painfully obvious I don't want to die tonight I still barely get anything back, so maybe it's a sign it's my time.
