Suicidal thirteen year old. hey r/suicidewatch, this past year i've been feeling pretty depressed and suicidal because i lost all of my friends. 
i have kidney issues and i would constantly miss school to go to my doctor appointments and would come back to school and my "friends" would try not to talk to me and constantly tell me to shut up or go away, but i always thought they were joking, because that's how our friendship was. i came back after missing two days and they wouldn't even acknowledge my presence. i stopped trying to put in effort to talk to them or sit with them, and in return, they started spreading rumors and giving me dirty looks.
now, school makes me want to bawl and run away because i sit in the bathroom stall for lunch, sometimes even skipping classes because i've been crying. but i have to go because i miss so much already because of my kidneys.
my mom noticed i was sleeping a lot and told me that she was going to take me to therapy, she even forced me to fill out the forms, but ended up not taking me. i remind her sometimes and she'll say okay, then won't do anything.
i guess i just needed to let this out or get advice on what to do.
