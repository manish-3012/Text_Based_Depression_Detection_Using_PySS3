The stinging never stopsI dated this girl about two years who I immediately fell really hard for.  I've been alone most of my life and the only thing I've ever wanted in life was someone to love who loves me back.  After about two months I was really starting to let my guard down and I was ready for things to get more serious.  I thought she felt the same.  Then out of nowhere she broke up with me.  She is a very successful attorney and I am...nobody.  She said she needed someone "further along" etc, which has been ringing in my ears for two years now.  I'm a failure, basically, who never had the ambition to achieve something like she did.  I haven't dated anyone else since.  I never meet anyone I actually like and want to spend time with who isn't already taken.  I'm on Bumble, and today at work I was just flipping through, and probably for the 4th time since she dumped me she;'s back on bumble. "I have a busy life but I'll make space for you if we are a good fit."  Why am I not a good fit?  Just because I'm not rich and successful?  I know that's not the full story, obviously she felt we just weren't meant to be together, but it never stops stinging for me.  I still like her so much.  I don't know how to stop.  I feel like even if I do meet someone else I'll still always wish I had been able to make it work with Her.  Just so tired.  And now I'm working hard to get life back on track and become someone (not for her, for me) but sometimes its just too much. I'd be much rather be dead.  I'm not going to do it, if I was going to it wouldve happened in my 20s.  But everyday is just such a dull, pointless drag.  I have no one to love and no one who loves me.  The girl I like doesn't want anything to do with me.  My days are so depressing.  I just want it all to be over.
