No Friends, No Relationship, No Good Grades. I quit.I am a 16 year old male student attending sixth form and this is not new for me to be feeling terrible like this, For some brief backstory, i'm a depressed guy, i've never had many friends, i'm bad with relationships and no matter how i try i cannot acheive good grades. 

It is not new for me to be feeling like this, i've felt like this daily at multiple different points in my life, on and off it started around 5 years ago, i've never had many friends and i can't bring myself to talk to anyone easily, it's too hard, i can't just get confidence, it's impossible for me, it always has been but this last week has been the worst for me, my longest relationship i beieve has just ended, literally my last friend has told me they're done, they hate me and once again i'm failing in all of my subjects.

This last one never used to bother me as much, i was younger but i'm getting older, i'm expected to survive in 'the real world' soon but how, i won't be able to work like this or with my grades in thw world, no matter how i look at it, i'll likely end up homeless and starving until i die, my family hates me they won't take me in that's for sure and i just want to try again, i want to try and end it all again, I just wish i never failed before, how i am expected to live this life, I have no-one and nothing and i just don't want to do this anymore, i think i'm going to decide to end it all once and for all.
