Struggling to commit suicide.Iâ€™m 14 and donâ€™t have access to go out much so Iâ€™m struggling to end my life. I donâ€™t know which method is the quickest, and I canâ€™t get access to what I need. I seek death because there is no one solid scientific reason for life. I just donâ€™t want to live. Iâ€™m not sad, Iâ€™m really happy, and Iâ€™m worried my parents will find out.
