Pondering Suicideiâ€™ve been contemplating ending all since i was in 3rd grade, and now that i actually have access to the materials i am feel as i am a danger to myself. Iâ€™m going through an emotional roller coaster, with new meds, friend relationships spiraling out of control, and my parents incessant need to bombard my life. It feels like they donâ€™t want me anymore, it feels like iâ€™m not wanted by anyone, some times i donâ€™t even want myself. iâ€™ve created several plans, but iâ€™m not sure if i want to cause that kind of pain in my â€˜loved onesâ€™. i donâ€™t think iâ€™m ready to leave, but i donâ€™t think iâ€™m willing to continue this pain fest.
