Today seems like the right dayIt's my birthday. I'm just so tired of trying to to okay. I accomplished so much of what I wanted to do. I moved out and got away from my parents abuse. I transitioned female over the last 2 years and finally felt comfortable in my body and in general socially. I got to coach a high school swim team and be there for the kids over the last two years. It was nice to be there for the kids like I needed someone years ago. 

I should be okay, but I'm not okay. Ultimately, my brain feels ruined from the years of physical and emotional abuse I dealt with. I was excited to live the rest of my life as the gender I really am, but now that I no longer get misgendered and the hard parts of transitioning are over, I have a void. I have nothing I'm working towards. Nothing to distract from the deep pain I carry. 

For a while it was college, then working, moving out, transitioning, but what is it now? What is so monumental that it can take me away from these shitty feelings. Everyone tells me I did it - time to relax... but I'm just so sad. My emotions are hard to control. I think back to the years of having awful things said to me, being blamed for my parents almost divorcing, ect.

Why have kids if you aren't going to love them unconditionally? Like what the fuck is wrong with people. 

Today seems like the right day to end things. My dad will try to find me and confront me at some point today. I was rude to my roommate yesterday because I was in an emotional flashback - she's upset. I took another coaching job for the summer I'm not emtionally ready for and it starts in a few weeks. I just don't know anymore
