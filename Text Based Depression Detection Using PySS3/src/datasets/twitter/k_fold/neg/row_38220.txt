planning to just die in an alleywayive been lied to my whole life, abused and neglected, and i feel so useless and alone in a dirty part of a city that my whole "family" is stuck in.

i have money to grab a ticket to a nearby city. i just want to run away, find an alleyway to stay in, and let myself die in the cold winter night. i want to let them know that they fucked up, they hit me too many times, they got drunk too many times, and this is the consequence of it all.

~~i just wish i could feel the same emptiness as i did in my previous suicide attempt. that's the icing on this cake.~~
