I have never felt so violentI am a 20 year old Irish female and I'm struggling to find the words.

I mean... I cry if I accidentally kill a butterfly. If anyone's paired up with me in a university tutorial I'm mute and terrified. I blush if anyone looks near me. I'm not aggressive, I'm a goddamn fucking gentle as fuck person (see?).

I more and more frequently wish to scream, tear off my skin and punch myself to death

I feel a little calmer now actually having just written this. I think I'd just like to cry and hug now. I don't expect a reply to this as my post doesn't really *say* anything, and how can you help someone like that, but thank you for reading if you did.

EDIT: nahh man I feel bad again. Want to cry and run infront of a car. I'm so sorry for taking up space here with such bullshit, I just don't know where else to go.
