Just tired of being sadI don't really have a good reason but I just don't want to be here anymore. I tried to get help before but they just took my shoelaces for 2 weeks and that was the end of the "help". I'm in the national guard and when my squad leader found out he made my life a fucking nightmare for a year till he transferred. So that's what I get to look forward to if I reach out again. I don't know what else to say..... I'm a grown ass man and I'm trying to cry myself to sleep an hour before I have to get up for work.
