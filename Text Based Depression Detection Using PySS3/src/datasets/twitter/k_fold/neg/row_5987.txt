is it selfish for others to tell me to stay?i donâ€™t want to be here anymore. i have been depressed since i was 14, iâ€™m 20 now. actually yesterday was my birthday and i asked everyone i could think of to spend some time with me. instead i sat in my bed and slept until it wasnâ€™t my birthday anymore. iâ€™m tired all the time. i have no motivation. i didnâ€™t graduate high school because i didnâ€™t have any motivation. i still canâ€™t seem to finish school because i donâ€™t have any motivation. i try. the last six months have been too much for me and everything is just getting worse. i had a terrible christmas,  i spent new years sobbing by myself because i felt so out of place, i lost my job the next day, my ex broke up with me a week later, he asked to see me valentineâ€™s day but just wanted to hook up, my â€œfriendsâ€ all said they would go out with me on my birthday and only one showed up. there is a deep, deep longing for complete silence and emptiness within me. i donâ€™t want to feel anything anymore. iâ€™ve tried antidepressants. iâ€™ve tried therapy. iâ€™ve tried meditation and every day i wake up and i still donâ€™t want to be here anymore. iâ€™ve never tried to kill myself but i know i want to die. the only reason i am still here is because everyone else tells me i have to be. for this person or that person or whatever the reason may be. why should i have to live a life i donâ€™t want to live anymore because other people tell me to? isnâ€™t it selfish to tell someone to keep going and then leave them to their own devices? everyone tells me they donâ€™t want me to kill myself when i say iâ€™m going to or i try to. and then i donâ€™t kill myself and thereâ€™s no one there anymore? i try to reach out to everyone and they always have some excuse why they canâ€™t see me. or they ignore me and do something without me. i feel so alone. all the time. even in a room full of people i still feel alone. i was hoping that this slump would end on my birthday, that everyone would tell me how much they care about me but most people didnâ€™t bother to. 
are they selfish for keeping me here? or am i wrong to want to leave a life i donâ€™t at all enjoy?
