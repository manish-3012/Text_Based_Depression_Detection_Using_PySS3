I donâ€™t have anything else to giveThis depression thingy has really done a number on my loved ones, Iâ€™ve expressed how I feel to one person and theyâ€™ve taken offence. This is why I should leave sooner rather than later. Iâ€™ve been praying since I was younger to die but action needs to be taken now.
