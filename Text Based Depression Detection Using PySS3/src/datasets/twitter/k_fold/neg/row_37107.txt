Please help me. Talk to me.
There are just too many issues with me to begin the explaining. To put it simply I fucked up my life. I'm a 24 y/o who have been on-and-off attending uni. And still haven't been able to graduate, also doesn't have experience of a proper, long term job. I don't get how it happened. I probably aimed too high and thought too highly of myself (have transfered twice to a higher up uni each time, and I was living alone abroad ) that I'm now having a really hard time accepting the fact I'll have to do things I probably won't like as long as I'm being a productive member of society just like what everybody does. I went to college by the requirement of my family and also cause it's almost a must to my cultural background. But I hate the academic enviroment and tasks so, so, so much. I used to have firm belief that in my field of study/work(art related) it's not a requirment to have a degree, what's valued is your actual skill. But after so many years I've been brain washed into thinking no one will take a second look at my CV simply because I'm not a uni graduate. I dont have any courage and energy left to return to school system at this moment but it feels like I'm loosing something huge. I know I still have some chance to get a job that does not completely waste what I learned but at this low point of mine I'm just too scared and have zero confidence to show my profolio to anyone. I feel like Im losing my mind and I don't know what to do. I think I'll either be killing myself very soon(have been fighting with depression for many years and record of one failed suicide) or in less a year or so. Please help me. Talk to me about anything. Any experience or story you've heared of how one got out of this kind of situation. I just don't want to feel like trash and not feel scared for a few moments.
