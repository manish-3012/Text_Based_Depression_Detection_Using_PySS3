Don't know what to doI've come to the conclusion that I need help, I've been having suicidal thoughts for years, Now they are pretty much constant. In the mornings I think about how much easier it would be to shoot myself rather then get out of bed. even when nothings wrong the voice in my head repeats "kill yourself" or "I want to kill myself" (I don't hear voices, I mean my internal monologue.) 

Im in a new town, I don't know anybody here, I came to get a job, but my dog will bark constantly when I leave him alone, and that will get me kicked out of the trailer park I'm staying in.

I think I need to see a doctor, but I don't know where to start. Its especially hard because I can't leave my dog alone. Can somebody point me in the right path? What should I do?
