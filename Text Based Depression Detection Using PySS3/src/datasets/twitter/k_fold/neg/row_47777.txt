i can't push myself to finish the jobI tried to hang myself but i can't go through with it. I've been searching for the final push to make me end my life but it still wasn't enough. I tried to tie a belt to the railings on my window but i pulled myself back up. I want to die but i can't push myself to just let myself be free.  I don't know if I'm a coward or what but i can't follow up. I always stop half way into it. I've tried cutting myself but it hurt too much. I've tried to hang myself but i always grab onto the rails. I can't find a bridge to jump off because i can't leave the house, neither can I have an excuse to leave on my own.
