in a year of two i'll be able to be what i've never been. Useful. in other word ill be dead (ow the edge) (and i will feed microrganismes... this counts as being useful right?). why? because i am an agent of ruin and hurt everything that comes in contact with me (but to be fair it's kind of my legacy when you look at it. My mother(her eldest is a junkie her youngest wants to die and and im a mix of these two). Unfortunately i have people i somewhat care about and do not want to hurt more than I already did. But it's fine because i devised the perfect plan to get rid of 'em so i can go out in "peace". That plan is being (more of) an asshole (than i already am) to all of em so they wont talk to me anymore. Quite simple really. And as of why im doing this, well... lets just say thats just how i fuckin' am how bout dat. i havent had a bad life (or a life for that matter). i have a loving mother and sisters which i hate (for valid reasons, actually). i dont have depression or schizophrenia, i don't have a borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder... ive got nothing. No pain no happiness. Just a quiet life and a (somewhat) quiet mind. i never understood why i've felt this way (for 16 years) but i does not matter anymore. it'll be over soon. and no medication or psychologist can undo that. thats just the kind of person i am in the end. i wasntnt't supposed to post anything here actually because people tend to reply dumb stuff like "talk to me", "its not over yet" "nooo, don't do it" or stupid shit like that. i am not seeking help or advice or complicity and whatnot. i just wanted to expess... also i'm drunk.
