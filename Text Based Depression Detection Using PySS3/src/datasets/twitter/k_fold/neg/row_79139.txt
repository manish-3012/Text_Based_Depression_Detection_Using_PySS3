Iâ€™m just a parasiteI wake up and weigh the pros and cons of killing myself every day.

I turned 31 years old in October. After several start and stops for various reasons, I finally received my degree in Creative Writing in 2018. Iâ€™m immensely lucky to have had that opportunity, but what did it get me? Years with no job, silence from recruiters, broken promises, and not even retail gives me a call back for an interview when theyâ€™re urgently hiring. I knew going in there would be few open doors for this degree, but writing really is the only thing Iâ€™m good at, and I couldnâ€™t even pass a math class beyond its entry level. I tried. 

Iâ€™m lucky enough to have a place with my grandmother for now, but after that? Who knows.

I just feel like thereâ€™s no other path my life is going to go down except suicide. Iâ€™m too old now to be considered as full of opportunities, especially when my work history is so sporadic. I donâ€™t see a way out of this downward spiral but Iâ€™m still too scared to do anything to myself. 

My mother was here tonight. Her advice, knowing Iâ€™m struggling and have anxiety around this to begin with? To just get a job! That itâ€™s my fault for getting such a useless degree! That she doesnâ€™t feel sorry for me because at least I have a completed education! All said like it was a funny observation!

And honestly? Iâ€™ve thought all of this already. So maybe sheâ€™s right, and sheâ€™s just saying what everyone else thinks. That Iâ€™m a parasite who only sucks everyone dry. So what even is the point of sticking around? 

My list gets more unbalanced by the day.
