DoneI don't know if I'm actually going to kill myself or not, but I don't want to be here anymore.

I don't talk about these thoughts with anyone because it's literally pointless. I don't really have anyone in my life anymore who I'm close to.

I have been suicidal before. Sometimes I do get a little better - I can feel happiness sometimes. But it just never seems to stay and I'm so tired of the pain. I know people say that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but it's not in my case. I have been in therapy for four years now, I have taken medication and nothing helps. It feels like if I keep going I'm basically living the rest of my life as a hospice patient anyway. Every low just seems to get lower, happiness is never permanent but I struggle to make peace with the fact that I can't hold onto it, I'll never hold onto it. Things get better, then they get dark.

I don't see the point of this world anymore, except to just suffer. That's what it always comes back to. I've posted on here before and I always try to justify why I feel the way I feel. But there's no justification, except that I'm tired. And no, this isn't getting better and this isn't going away. I don't relate to others beyond superficial things, but I try. I just don't. I don't have a place here, my own family doesn't even want the real me, just the image of something I'm not. 

I hate myself at this point. Part of me wants to believe there is somewhere in existence where I won't feel this way, but that rug always gets pulled out from under me and all I'm left with is the reality that I am a subpar human, any effort to improve myself is ultimately a waste because everytime I think I have made progress my life gets worse. I might as well be a piece of shit if I keep on living but I can't live with that either. So what am I left with?

So there it is, that's how I feel. I don't know what else is worth saying. Honestly, probably none of this was worth saying.
