I'm ready to kill myself. I tried to reach out to r/depression but I don't think anyone really understood my situation. It's really just a reminder that I'm just as alone online as I am in real life. 

I ready to kill myself. I didn't go to bed last night and I've reasoned it out. I'm fortunate that I leave no one behind that cares about me. I don't want to live anymore. It's impossible to get out of the rut I'm in. I've worried about it so much for the past couple of decades that I've made myself physically ill. 

I'm out.
