I tried killing myself yesterday and I don't know who to talk to about it (UK)Hi just for a bit of context, I have been going to therapy for 7 months, I have been on antidepressants for 6 weeks. I am a 21 year old student and I have told my university I've been having suicidal thoughts and have been getting some support from there and obviously I've told my GP.

I don't know who to talk to about this. Am I just going to have to sit on this all weekend before my GP opens up again? Am I supposed to sit on this until my next therapy session? I don't know if I'm going to feel like I did yesterday again. I don't feel I'm going to attempt it again currently so it's not exactly a crisis so I can't call 999 but at the same time this is really weighing down on my mind. I don't feel comfortable reaching out to my friends and family about it because I don't want their sympathy; I just want to feel better.
