I'm so tired of fightingI've wanted to kill myself for a long time. I'm okay with that, I'm ready to go, I think. As ready as I ever can be. It's lonely though, to know I'm so close to suicide and have to act like everything is fine. I tried talking about it but every time I do, people just try to encourage me that things will get better and I shouldn't do it. I honestly don't believe that and I can't think of anything that will change my mind. I don't know where I'm going with this or what my point is, I'm just sad and alone at 5am so I figured I'd make a reddit post. Idk. Thanks for listening to me vent, if you bothered to read this.
