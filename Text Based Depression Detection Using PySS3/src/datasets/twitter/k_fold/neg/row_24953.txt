Help PleaseI'm a self harmer that has managed to stay "sobre" for a bit over a year and out of seemingly nowhere, I did it again.. Twice in two days.  I have depression and anxiety, and these things have convinced me that I am meant to be dead, my emotions are telling me this, my instincts, to the point that all the plans that extend beyond a year, and the things I need to complete to get there, are too painful to think of.  My usual support system has been unavailable to me, the forums I have tried to post on have rejected my last post because it is apparently potentially distressing to others like me (I understand), but...I feel so worthless, so empty, and there is no crisis hotline where I live (I have checked).  The only thing that convinces me that I am not a ghost in my own life is the pain and anguish I consistently feel.  Like my soul (or whatever) is hurting.  The energy that powers me is laced with it.
