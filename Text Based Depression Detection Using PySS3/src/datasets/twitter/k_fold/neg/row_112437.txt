Help, Gf's mom and grandma withholding her medicationsMy girlfriend is not allowed to keep her own meds because of an earlier suicide attempt, but now her mom and grandma are not giving her her anxiety and depression meds. This is making my gf very suicidal... she is 19 years old btw. Her case worker attempted to call her house to talk to her mom and grandma but to no avail. is there any way for her to get meds on her own or force her mom and grandma to give her them? please, any help would be appreciated...
