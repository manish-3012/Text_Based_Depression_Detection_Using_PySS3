Failed againI quit again, another job after one week, I'm 26/m and I just I can't deal with this anymore... money in the house is tight and I wanted to help but couldn't I am a failure, I've been looking for ways to end my life for the past months, I just wanna hang myself but it would destroy both my sister and my dad who is already depressed. My mom passed away 4 years ago and I don't think they could bare another loss.

But I can't bare this sadness, this disapointemnt in myself, I just want to cry, I've cried in front of my sister twice already and talked to her about what I'm going through but I don't dare open up about my suicidal thoughts and I know She's got Her own issues and I don't wanna burdeb Hee with mine.
My dad isn't mad at me but I know He's dissapointed, I let everybody down, I'm a failure and just want out
