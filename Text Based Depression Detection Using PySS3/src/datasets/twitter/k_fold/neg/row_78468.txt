I worry a family member is considering suicide what do I doAn elderly family member with a history of depression, alcoholism and suicide attempt has been making inappropriate suicide jokes the past two days. Today they drank a little too much and been acting weird ever since. Itâ€™s midnight and they have been just laying in bed staring blankly when I checked twice. I worry they are considering suicide and I donâ€™t know what to do. I thought about hiding keys to the outside but they have a patio going out right from their room so that wouldnâ€™t help. What do I do? I have a pretty bad childhood trauma because of what happened in the past with them and I donâ€™t think I can talk to them. Iâ€™m not in the US there is no such thing as calling ambulance on them or a suicide prevention hotline here.
