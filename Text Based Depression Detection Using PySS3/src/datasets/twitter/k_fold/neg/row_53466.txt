Iâ€™m not sure which one to pickThose are pretty much my options for the future. 

1- live with my mom for the next ~50 years so I can take care of her when sheâ€™s old
2- kill myself now because life sucks 
3- move out to get a taste of real life, and then kill myself because life will still suck and I will be lonely 
4- move out and enjoy life, and try to make it through life with the usual (get married-have kids-retire-die). The thing is, Iâ€™ll probably fail at finding a partner. And Iâ€™m too humble which people see as a weakness and they try to walk all over me at work. People have walked all over me in life and I hate that. I canâ€™t stand up for myself and I hate my name, my family,  my living situation. Whatâ€™s the point of enjoying life if I already know I wonâ€™t be happy? And Iâ€™m consumed with guilt if I try to change any of the things I hate because of my narcissistic parents, yay.
