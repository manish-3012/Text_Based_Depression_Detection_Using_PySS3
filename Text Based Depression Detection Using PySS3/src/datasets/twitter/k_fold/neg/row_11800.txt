If I were to die, I wouldn't want anybody to fucking say anything about itIt's all fake. All of the "I should've talked to him", "But I care!!!", and all of that garbage that will try to memorialize me. It's all fucking fake and said to make themselves feel better about their own lives. 

I would just want my body to be dumped and forgotten and that be the end of it rather than all these fake crocodile tears so they go back to sucking their own dicks and be these advocates when they don't fucking care.
