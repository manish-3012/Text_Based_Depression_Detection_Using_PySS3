I'm such a fucking idiotso I ended up cutting myself today after being clean for a while and I'm so fucking stupid I hate the fact I'm either going through bouts of depression or anxiety and it's to the point where I'd rather feel depressed and nothing rather than feel constant pain and anxiety weighing down on my chest. I don't feel like I belong in my body. I hate not knowing what to do or where to start. dissociation is getting the best of me and I hate the fact that I care too much about other people to kill myself. I'm always in physical pain from this shit and I'm always tired but I hate sleeping for some reason probably because I know I'm gonna have to wake up at some point and do this all over again every fucking day. nothing is even wrong in my life really and I feel like such a pussy for complaining but everything just fucking sucks. I wish I could kill myself because  tired of feeling so useless and empty. I'm always just being used for sex or for money or anything for that matter and I let it happen because I know I'm a piece of shit and deserve all of the crap that comes at me. none of this even makes sense I'm sorry.
