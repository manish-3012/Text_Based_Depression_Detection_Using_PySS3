I despise sounding so pathetically melodramatic, but I'm just tired.I apologize in advance for this being so long. I just couldn't stop typing.

I want to die.

Iâ€™ve done nothing, and Iâ€™m going nowhere. I know Iâ€™m going nowhere because the second Iâ€™m put under pressure, I crack and fall apart at the seams.

Everyone thinks Iâ€™m this wonderful person and all I can do is hate myself. All I can feel is that they must be lying to me. Iâ€™m not smart, Iâ€™m not athletic, the only thing I would even consider myself remotely talented in is art, and we all know how far that shit takes you in life. I love science, but Iâ€™m probably just throwing myself into a field that Iâ€™m going to drown. The study I love, Virology, means likely trying to go for a PHD. Iâ€™m fooling myself if I think I can get that far. Just last year I nearly committed suicide from pushing myself to try to be in AP classes. I needed to keep improving myself, I needed to be smarter. Instead all I did was fall apart and had to be taken out of all of them half-way through the year and put into honors classes. My GPA was ruined, I failed one of my classes, and the thought of doing a problem on the board in front of everyone sends me into panic attacks. 

Instead I watched as my smart, well-adjusted friends were able to pull through and do well. Now it feels like Iâ€™m in a different world. All I can think is that they must see me pass in the hallway and think, â€œRemember her? She used to have such a promising future.â€

All I can think is that they must feel I didnâ€™t try hard enough. After all, if they could do it, why shouldnâ€™t I be able to? 

I have lost over the years my best friend. My first real friend. She lied to me twice- the first time it hurt, but I accepted it and tried to forgive. The second time was over the same issue, and felt like a knife in my stomach. And she knows I have trust issues ever since my parents divorced. She apologized for it once, and proceeded to try to act as though it never happened. If I even mentioned that I had been hurt by it, she would get sulky and say she *had* apologized, even if I barely remember it. So then I would feel guilty. When I tried to open up about how I felt when I was sad, it would immediately turn into essentially a dick-measuring contest of whoâ€™s sadder. But I still remember the nights we would spend watching LOST and stay up late talking about philosophy and books and, well, anything. 

I miss her so much, but I donâ€™t even recognize her anymore. I feel I could never trust her again. We havenâ€™t talked in months. And I know if I was to go to her and tell her all of this- she would immediately get defensive and deny everything. So I would shut up. Again.

Like every fucking day.

I hate my body. I hate it so much. The sponginess, the softness of it, the roundness- itâ€™s absolutely sick and disgusting. My grandpa keeps acting as though calling me an attractive young woman is a compliment, despite knowing full well Iâ€™m attending therapy for transgender issues. When I point this out to him, he simply says, â€œWell, YOU ARE. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m going to LIE to you.â€ I suppose Iâ€™m lucky Iâ€™m afraid of pain, else I would have started self-harming years ago. The thought is tempting though. Sometimes I fantasize that my breasts are like large, disgusting zits and I can pop them like one. Or if I take a knife and make a slit from the underside, Iâ€™ll be able to just squeeze out pus and blood until itâ€™s all out and I have a flat chest. When no one is around I try to move my chest in front of the microwave as much as possible in the hopes that itâ€™s not an urban myth and that I can give myself breast cancer. 

Other times Iâ€™m convinced I can cut off my own skin. Just peel it off like a wetsuit. More than once Iâ€™ve considered actually trying it, peeling off this female skin and being able to see the real me underneath it. Thereâ€™s nothing underneath though but blood, sinew and bone.

Then thereâ€™s the fact that though I feel like a man, I am not very manly. At all. I am such a fucking girl itâ€™s downright pathetic. How could anyone take me seriously when lately I cry at the drop of a hat? Iâ€™m weak, into arts and drama and know nothing about fishing, cars, sports, and my emotions swing back and forth like a pendulum. 

The moment I even start to feel confidant and as though that doesnâ€™t really matterâ€¦ well, let me just try to quote my grandfather on that. 

â€œDramatic_pause, you donâ€™t know *what* you want yet. Your grandfather has been around and gays and transgenders-â€œ disclaimer, heâ€™s the type that predates a sexist remark with, â€˜I have nothing against women!â€™ â€œ- and worked with them before, and Iâ€™ve talked to doctors too. If you were reallyâ€¦ *like that*, we would have seen signs earlier. I havenâ€™t seen anything like that, and your grandfather is a smart whip.â€

Great. As if I didnâ€™t doubt myself enough.
