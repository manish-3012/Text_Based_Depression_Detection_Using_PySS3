At what point is thinking about suicide "suicidal thougts"?I've been wondering because I first got my big self diagnosed "depression" hit about 3 years ago and I've never felt continously happy ever since but as far back as I remember I've always been fascinated by death, what happens after death, how could I kill myself in the best way without having an actual intent on doing it but now I think I'm experiencing more defined suicidal thougts. If I were to date when I started to feel depresse should I say 3 years ago of for long as I can remember?
