21. Cystic Fibrosis, alone. I'm 21. I should be having the time of my life. I'm not. I've had depression since I was quite young- around 12 or 13, and I started medication when I was around 16. I have cystic fibrosis, and over the years my health problems have just gotten worse and worse. I'm pre-diabetic thanks to the CF, I have the obvious lung problems, my pancreas doesn't secrete the digestive enzymes I need to absorb nutrients in my food, my heart is enlarged from the irritation produced in my lungs, and over the past year or so, I've developed joint pain that nothing seems to help. I feel very alone in the world. I can't really talk about this with my friends, and unlike most CF patients, I'm not religious, so I don't like to talk to them either. I don't see the point in making friends with someone I could never meet [because I have MRSA, I can't get within six feet of another CF patient]. 

I've also started to realize that the older I get, the harder dating will be. I want someone to love me and understand my health problems, but I don't think that will ever actually happen, and I think it's asking too much of someone to do that for me. My past boyfriends have been scared off by it, and all the problems I have associated with my CF. 

I honestly don't think I have anything to live for anymore.
