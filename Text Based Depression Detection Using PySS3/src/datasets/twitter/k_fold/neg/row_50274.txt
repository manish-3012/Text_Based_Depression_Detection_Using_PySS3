Trying to hide itIt's been a year since my first attempt and I regret not properly hanging myself the first time. Times were good and bad. But all my closest friends are gone for university and I'm stuck doing a victory lap because I'm a shit student and I'm just shit at everything. I feel so ashamed of being alive. I wasted my summer trying to pretend like it wasn't back or trying to hide it from others and myself. I want to just end it all. I feel so broken.
