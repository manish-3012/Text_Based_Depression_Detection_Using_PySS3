I spent my whole life lying about being happy and now I just want to be honestI pretended to be happy because someone once told me to just pretend being happy and then the happiness will follow. I spent high school and some college doing this. Honestly it worked sometimes, I even told other people to do it. Sometimes I genuinely forgot how sad I was. But its just a temporary solution. I stopped pretending, and now I have no friends or family to tolerate me. I'm willing to bet they'll "care" as soon as someone finds my corpse. So I'll be gone soon. I just wanted to be honest without posting this on my main reddit profile. I'm sitting in front of a noose made from my favorite pink tie here's hoping I'll be somewhere else.
