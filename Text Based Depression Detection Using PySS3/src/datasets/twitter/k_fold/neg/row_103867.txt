Thanks to my porn addicion i exposed myself to 16-17 old teens on omegle and men(im straight) last year, wasnt thinking crearly,had a lapse judgement, feel guilty,wasnt my intention. Hello,im close to 30 years old,i used to be exbicionist,i have depression,some autism i think and other mental issues, and last year i was using omegle looking for adult women to expose myself to,i always watched porn before to help me get excited. i always ask their age, but in 4 situations the girls were aged 16-17, i was too horny and focused, had lapse of judgement and overlooked their age and continue to show myself for some seconds to a minute until they skiped. in my mind i thought to use age of consent to justify the exposure, but then i searched on internet that society disaprove this in general, i was ignorant and stupid. I realized  i was wrong. it was consensual i didnt see they naked and they wanted to see me. however it is still wrong to girls in that age look for naked men online. God i dont even attracted for this age group and im not some kind of p3do. i feel so gulty and need some closure, i think i need a therapist. everytime i read something about p3dophilia on the news it reminds me of those events. im also not gay and exposed to some men because i was too excited,but this is not serious to me. Is it realy bad what happened about the girls? i feel so ashamed and disguted with myself, i even quit to exhibit and never had relationship before. i have suffered from depression since i was younger and im impulsive. can someone please give me an opinions about this? please i fell awful and sometimes i cry. Tell me im  just immature and this common but in a different context.
