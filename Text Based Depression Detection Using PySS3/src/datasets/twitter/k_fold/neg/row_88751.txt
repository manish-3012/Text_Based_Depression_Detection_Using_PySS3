I have good days, and bad days.I'm a regular redditor but I'm using a throwaway. I don't want my SO to know how bad things are for me. I also don't want people tracking me down and doing MHA. Last fucking thing I need, trust me. 

I've been taking meds for years. In middle of switching therapists. I've struggled with bad depression over half of my life, even before it was "cool" to have it. Fuck those people...it really hurts. 

On my good days, I think "if I had some pentolbarbital in front of me, I wouldn't take it today but I'd save it for later in case." on my bad days, I feel that if I had some, I'd definitely swallow it and go lay down. I just want to end the pain and go into a painless sleep. I know that it is biological and not situational but that does not help. I am tired of being wired this way. My family, particularly my mom's side, has a 100+ year history of severe depression and anxiety. No drug use, but I'm talking, a woman who stayed in bed for 10 years straight, and women who needed a little barbs or Valium just to get through the day without panic attacks. 

I know people who can get me illegal drugs easily, including barbs, discreetly, and could deliver to me. I wouldn't get caught, I know that. On my bad days, I think about getting some in powder or liquid form, mixing it into pudding and downing it wirh some alcohol and then curling up in bed. Have my phone send an automatic text 3 hours later to my SO and family so they can find me, I'll be dead. 

I think about suicide on a near daily basis and it's been that way for over a year, although I have had suicidal tendencies since age 13. Maybe someday, I can finally let go.
