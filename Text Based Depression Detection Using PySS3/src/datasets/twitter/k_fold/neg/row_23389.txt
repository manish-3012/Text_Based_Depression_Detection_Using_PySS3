I'm gone.I love you so much and i am so sorry to you. I love you.

This isn't the first time I've written a note. I wrote my first when i was thirteen years old. The most recent one note was last summer. I cried when I wrote it. It didn't take. I erased it and got back up. I am not crying now. I've suffered too much. I can not feel anything anymore. I've left this open on my computer and you'll find me.

To my parents - I love you so much and this is so horrible but I love you and im so sorry. Ive been unhappy for so long this is not your fault you were perfect and such amazing people. I want you to be happy and not give up. I love you so much, my happiest memories in my life are of being a kid and being with you. Im sorry that ive been such a peice of shit son, these past years have been tough on me and i wish i could show you how much you mean to me

Laura - I worry about you sometimes. I am so sorry. You are so grown now and you are going to have an amazing life. Please take care of yourself.

To my friends - You were amazing to me. I didn't deserve the patience and kindness you gave. You were so unconditional, putting up with me. I am sure I didn't deserve it now. I hope nobody blames themselves. You were amazing. I hope you great life. I love you. 

I have a lot of writing tucked away in one of my drawers. Just for mom and dad.
