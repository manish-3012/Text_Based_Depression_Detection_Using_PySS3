Parents mistreat me and i feel like i'm aloneI'm a 16/m in my junior year of high school. I have never dated anyone my grades are slipping and I have no real friends. I'm sitting in my room right now alone with my parents screaming at my through my locked door and i just feel worthless and unwanted. I've started thinking about killing myself again... at least then my parents won't have to hide their son anymore at family events. I just need help please.
