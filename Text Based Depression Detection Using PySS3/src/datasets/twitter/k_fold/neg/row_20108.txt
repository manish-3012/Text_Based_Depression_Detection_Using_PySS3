I had a good dream last night, but it made everything worse.I finally stopped caring, I hadnâ€™t cried in a few days nor felt anything sad. I was ready to die, and still am. 
In my dream I was okay, I had a better job, friends, I was just invited to get my hand fitted for a ring for some reason. I gave birth to my first kid.

Then I woke up.. to the total opposite. 
Now I justâ€”I am begging to die. 
That was the cruelest thing Iâ€™ve ever done to myself, I donâ€™t think I can take it anymore.
