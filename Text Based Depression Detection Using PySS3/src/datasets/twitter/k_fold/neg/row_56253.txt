Hey, reddit, I need your opinion on something.I attempted suicide a couple months back by suspension hanging, and ever since I failed, I haven't tried again since. I have been depressed since I was 11 years old, now that I just turned 22 a few days back, I was wondering if I should reveal to my family that I have been depressed and suicidal? I've been trying to cope with nobody's help but my own ever since, and it's to the point where I am about to crack.
