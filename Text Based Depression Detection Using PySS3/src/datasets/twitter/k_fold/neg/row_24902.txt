it came back.i was doing so well. for months i have distracted myself and found a new hobby that i enjoy.

i was doing great. i was so proud of myself. i have no idea why im being like this. im having a breakdown in my bed rn as im typing this. 

for months, i was so happy and satisfied with what i was doing. earlier it just came running to me with no absolute reason at all.

i was happy and laughing yet when the night came, sadness slowly started creeping up on me. i tried to brush it off but it slowly ate me. i have no idea why. i don't want to get back to my old self again.
