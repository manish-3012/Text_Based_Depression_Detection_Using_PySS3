I get overwhelmed with thoughts.I hate thinking, I can't separate my thoughts. It's always about stupid shit and I can't seem to focus on what matters. I can't deal with it. Please can someone make suicide legal. I just want to die. People die all the time, let me die. I don't like the way I think and I've tried changing it. The only escape is death.
