Im sick of livingEveryday i feel like it would have been better if i just didnt live anymore.About a few months ago my mom told me that when she gave birth to me she almost died and so did i.And i thought about it ever since i always felt like i had no reason to live,or even felt like anyone was giving me any empathy.I feel empty and sad i play videogames just so i can stop thinking about this.I dont have the courage to take my own life because of how sad and broken my parents will be.I just want to know if theres any point in doing anything i want a reason to live to not feel like i dont belong anywhere(srry if my english is bad im not a native english speaker).
