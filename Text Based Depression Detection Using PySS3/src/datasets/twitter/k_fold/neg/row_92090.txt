ShinjuI like the idea of dying together with a close friend. None of us want to live without the other and if there really is no other way we'd rather die together. We would take away each other's fear, be there to talk about all kind of things in our last moments of life and feel safe and calm. Our families don't know each other, I'm scared that my family would blame him for "dragging me down" and "convincing me to die" which isn't true. He actually saved me from attempting a few months ago.
