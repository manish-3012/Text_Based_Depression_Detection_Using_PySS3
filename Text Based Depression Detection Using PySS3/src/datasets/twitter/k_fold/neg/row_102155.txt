I got it all figured outFound out a month ago I was getting laid off. Last day of work is tonight. Once that's done, I get my severance. Use some of that to buy a gun, God Bless America, and leave the rest of it to my mom. 

Jobless, in poor health, in massive debt. Fuck it, now's a good a time as any. How long are you supposed to fight this? Is this what the rest of my life has in store for me? Waking up every day completely numb? No enjoyment, no feelings, just emptiness. I don't want to go on if this is all I can feel. I've done all I can to help myself. I've fixed my bad habits, I've taken up new and productive hobbies, I went to school, I surrounded myself with great friends, I sought out and received professional treatment. None of it had an impact. None. Im so god damn sick and tired of this shit man. Im tired of pretending like I'm okay, that my brain isn't completely fucked. Im tired of fighting all day every day for years now just to be worse off than I was before. This shit ain't worth it
