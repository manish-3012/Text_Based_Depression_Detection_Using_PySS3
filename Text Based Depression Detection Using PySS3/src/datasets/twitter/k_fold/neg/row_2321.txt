DerelizationI'm not mentally sane.
Where can I find help?
Can it be cured?
I have absolutely no reason to live atm.
Derealization and depersonalisation.
I'm high.
There is no external reality.
It's just my imagination.
I don't exist.
Life is absolutely pointless.
Sex, successful,a career,a future.
All of them seem pointless.
I can't enjoy life
