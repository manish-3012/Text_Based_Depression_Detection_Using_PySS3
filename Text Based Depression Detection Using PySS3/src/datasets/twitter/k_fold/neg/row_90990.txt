I still have 11 days to make it to the 27 clubI lost all hopes. Last year, I was close to giving up. Then i met this guy. He is the first person to always make me happy. Seeing him every day was amazing. I was longing for the time he would come in at work.

He is married. Nothing will ever be possible. I always get too attached to the wrong person. Is it some elaborate self-harming method?

We still got into some extra-marital shit. I felt terrible but happy. He felt only terrible. He told me he wants us to stay friends. I told him I wanted to kill myself. I've wanted it for almost a decade now. I have 11 days to go through with it and be part of the cool club... I don't think I will but it crosses my mind every minute of every day.

I don't look forward to anything now. I just feel empty, worthless and stupid.
