It economically doesnt make sense to be aliveI don't want anything out of life. There's nothing worth living for. 

I've been working to move out lately and crunching the numbers of expenses and its just too much work for zero benefit. The work required for nothing that I value just doesn't add up. 

The things that feel good like food, drugs, and alcohol kill you. Half the stuff that feels good is illegal or some scheme to trick you out of money. Our political leaders are corrupt, the rich get away with everything when we go to jail if we can't pay child support or parking tickets. Everyone only cares about themselves and instant gratification. We spend money on dates and cars (guys) makeup and clothes (ladies) for people who we'll forget about or hate eventually. And all the people who do care are silenced or die too young. 

We are slaves to money to live these meaningless lives, it really just makes more sense for us to die if we can't go on. At least then we have a choice. 

I just really can't understand what there is to live for that justifies slaving away everyday.
