Does anyone think theyâ€™re destined you kill themselves?Sorry if this is a bit of a downer.

Iâ€™ve been battling suicidal thoughts for years and thereâ€™s been a few times Iâ€™ve been in the high risk stage where I was close to making attempts.

I have a family history of suicide and I feel Iâ€™m just destined to do it one day. That Iâ€™ll just have that day where a simple thing pushes me over.

Anyone feel the same? Like I just feel that itâ€™s not a matter of if, but when I do it.
