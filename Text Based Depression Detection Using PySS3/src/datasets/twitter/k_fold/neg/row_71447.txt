Last Sunday NightI drank an entire bottle of 40% alcohol liquor in 10 mins and went to bed hoping I wake up dead. Nope. I woke up beside a pile of my own vomit which I had to clean up myself. I'm pretty sure I was poisoned but was too ashamed to get help as I felt it was pathetic attempt. So I suffered through it while still wondering why even the doors of hell wouldn't even welcome me in.
