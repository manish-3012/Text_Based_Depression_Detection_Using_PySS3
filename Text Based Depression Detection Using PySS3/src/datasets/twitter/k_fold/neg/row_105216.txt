30 minutes after I submit this, I will put a 9mm FMJ through my skull.Hey everyone. 

All things considered, it hasn't been that bad. I lived to be 31. I don't have the energy to write all this out again. I have a 9mm semi auto with a FMJ in the chamber. I'm drunk and I took some Xanax. No, I'm not calling any hotlines. I've set a timer. So long.
