Anxiety triggering suicidal thoughtsSee my previous post to /r/anxiety . 

I'm in so much pain. Not physical pain, it doesn't hurt so bad. Just tiny little problems in my body making me so fucking awful.

I can't stop shaking, my arms and chest hurt a little, I'm afraid and stressed and angry. 

I can't be bothered to put up with this pain anymore, I just want to die and have it over with. I don't want pain, I just want it over. Help.
