Love hurts enough to make me consider a way to end it.After being together for almost 2 years, we broke up two weeks ago. However, we still maintained contact. He's decided against it now. So, now, it is really over and the pain hurts way too much. I want to numb it. Not exactly kill myself but kill the pain. Kill the love. I can't stop crying. The past 2 weeks, I was able to fool myself. I knew it was over but was glad we were still talking and hanging out in the same social scene. Now, he's gone. Reality is kicking my ass. My defense instincts wants me to numb it. I have the means to do so but am trying to fight it. I don't know what to do.
