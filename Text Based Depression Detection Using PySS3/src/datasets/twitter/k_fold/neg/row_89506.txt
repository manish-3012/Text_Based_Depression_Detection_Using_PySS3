Ready to flySince January I have been feeling inadequate with life. I had trips planned and was steady getting on track, however I felt it wasnâ€™t good enough. I had two jobs and was going to school. It took a mental toll on me and I flunked school and decided to do a no call no show at both jobs. Iâ€™ve been a shut in for 4 months and recently got a job. Now I donâ€™t have it anymore cause I just stopped randomly going. When Iâ€™m there Iâ€™m nervous, I feel out of touch, Iâ€™m paranoid and lonely. I didnâ€™t expect my life to be like this at 24. I have my own place, I donâ€™t have to worry about food, money for bills is something I should be worried about but I just donâ€™t care. Iâ€™ve been told to go see a therapist but Iâ€™ve been through that cycle and the feeling is temporary and it comes back once you leave the room. Also, the things I want to genuinely talk about I know Iâ€™ll be admitted for it. The only thing I am connected to is anime and reading mangas. Everything else is just plain and boring. I donâ€™t have friends, I donâ€™t have any family, I donâ€™t have anyone genuine where I can cry my feelings to. Instead I listen to Lana Del Rey or Cigarettes After Sex and some anime openings to make me feel like someoneâ€™s there. I wanted to kill myself by summer, hoping that Iâ€™ll find something I can get aquatinted with but peopleâ€™s presence are a bit annoying to me. I truly donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s going on with me. This is the first place I vented to and hoping someone can give some advice. Thank You.
