It's been a rough 6 yearsI'm 22, F, and for as long as I can remember, I have thought about killing myself.

(Currently drinking, please excuse any and all spelling mistakes)

I always thought having suicidal thoughts and tedencies was normal, because of the people I hung out with, but as I got older, I realise that is no longer the case.

I've been on and off medication for about a year and a bit, ad the first batch on meds I was on, was the worst thing ever (sertralie 50mg), I took that for about 6 months on an off, just to have a bit of normalcy in my lif. Recently, I've been put on a lower dose (Citalopram 20mg) which has started out great. I didn't feel like a zobie, i didn't feel weak walking, or even sitting up. I could keep food down. I felt like a normal huan being. That was about 5 weeks ago. I've always been suicidal, from a very young age, but I never told my family about it. Now that my family knws about it, they keep sayibg I have no reason to feel or be suicidal, just like m=I have no reason to be depressed. I took a day off from work today, and I got told, I'm throwing everyone in the shit for today, which ust piled on to how I was feeling.

I'm currently drining wine, and may drink another bottle, and see if I am coscious enough to take some pills. Ive never really used this place, but it seemed like a good place to just kind f let things go. I dont expect any sort or form of response on this. I guess I just wanted to see if it would get posted or whatever.

I apologise if this was a wste of time. But I feel like a waste of space.

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this. 

I always thought I'd join the 27 club, but I'm not famous enough for it, but I've got a drug habit anyway that I' not proud of.
Thank you.

I love you, stranger
