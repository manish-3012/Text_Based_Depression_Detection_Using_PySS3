I went into a philosophy hole.The thing about being alive is that it's completely normal to feel pain. It doesn't matter if you feel happiness, content, or pain. They are just there. That has got me thinking that pain does exist and has no reason not to. The universe/human body has allowed pain to exist normally. If that is the case, I logically want out of this life. If I was smart enough to know a way to change properties of nature that would cause me to live. I'm smart enough to know that I'm not that smart. I don't want to experience that pain anymore. Experience is pretty much key to understanding. I need out.
