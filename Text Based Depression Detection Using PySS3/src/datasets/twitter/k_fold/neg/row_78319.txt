My motherSo last year I saved my mom from attempting suicide, a year later I don't know anymore.  She's still depressed, she's bipolar, she's a liar, she loves playing the victim card, makes everything about her with her constant guilt trip. She's become this new person that I don't know how to stay around.  We live in the same house , but it's not the same anymore.  I used to have so much communication with but now it's just hard to be around.  Maybe I'm being a selfish kid maybe not, but things in the house are different.  Her new "self" is creating distance between everyone in the family.  My dad, me, my sister and her.  Crazy how things change within some time.
