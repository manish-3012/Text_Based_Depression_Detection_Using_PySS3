Feel like an outsiderThe person i most related to just blocked me and I understand why and respect their decision as having a negative person in your life isn't good. I just want to die really I feel like an outsider who can't be normal. I'm alone as well, almost always I just feel completely alone with no one to talk to. I have to act like I'm ok and everything is fine to keep others happy. There's just this part of me that wants to live, some hope but it gets crushed so often.
