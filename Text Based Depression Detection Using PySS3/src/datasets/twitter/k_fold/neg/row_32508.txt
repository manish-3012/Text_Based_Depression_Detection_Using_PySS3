So I found an old poetry book my wife wrote when we first datedFor context read my other r/sw post.  She left it here with me, in this empty house that I now own.  A whole lot of signs tell me the easy way out.  I think the reason I'm still here is because I'm waiting on someone in the real world to tell me otherwise.  Why I shouldn't be dead.  I haven't seen it yet and I've been planning this since early August.  The only thing that's stopped me was family obligations.  My birthday, my grandfather dies.  I'm planning my death, but there is no 'right' time to do it.
