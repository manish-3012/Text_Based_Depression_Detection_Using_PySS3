I'm so tiredAll my life, I've grappled with suicidal ideation, whether passive or active fantasizing. I keep pretending that I'm not having these thoughts around everyone. I was almost successful in an attempt once before and spent three days in a coma from it, so I can't talk to anyone without freaking them out.

I'm struggling massively right now, and it has nothing to do with being stuck inside or having nothing to do. I'm normally a shut-in anyway, so that doesn't bug me. What is actually killing me is the selfishness I see everywhere right now. People buying up essential supplies from those who need them most, hoarding shit they don't need, and actually trying to profit from a fucking crisis. I want to scream at all of them to stop being such selfish assholes, but I know nothing will work.

I'm so tired of struggling and trying to breathe through the smog of selfish, inconsiderate behavior that sits over the world like a blanket. I've tried everything to help alleviate this suffocating feeling, but any time I have to interact with other people, I'm reminded of how little people actually care about each other. Not even enough to consider someone other than themselves for one minute.

A perfect example of this: the fucking Nintendo Switch shortage. I've been saving what little I can to afford one, and finally can, but they're all sold out. Why? Because people are using a bot to buy them immediately when they're restocked at retailers, so they can resell them at almost 200% the MSRP. I'm sick to death of this kind of shittiness toward others. I'm really considering just giving up and letting it all go. I know my boyfriend and cats would be crushed, but every day of my life I continue to live, I'm suffering horribly.
