I add nothing of value to this world, so I may as well dieI'm an unemployed loser living with my mom and I can't even hold down fast food jobs without getting overwhelmed and quitting. I've been out of work for over a year now. I've got nothing and I'm going nowhere. The only girl I've ever loved ghosted me and is now being engaged with some other guy, so now that I lost her I really have nothing to lose so I may as well just end it.

Everything is just so damn unfair. I try my best to treat others with kindness and I get these shitty cards dealt to me. I can't deal with this anymore. I always tell myself that things will get better but it's been years and things haven't gotten better. I just want someone to talk to about this shit but nobody seems to care. They'll only "care" after I end it. I don't see the point anymore. I don't even know why I'm typing this out so I guess I'll end it within the hour. That's all really.
