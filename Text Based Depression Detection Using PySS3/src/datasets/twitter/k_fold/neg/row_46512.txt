Where to go?I'm an American ex-pat who was working in Japan for a subsidiary/partner of Google.  


While I was fairly well to-do professionally, I was drugged and raped during a business trip to CES in January 2018. I was subsequently fired from my job (because while drugged, I apparently gave the key card to our show room to the rapists which resulted in stolen demo devices). Since then, there were other employment opportunities, but I haven't really recovered at all and just feel nothing. I don't even necessarily feel depressed. Just nothingness.  


For the past year, I hardly left my apartment. I couldn't bring myself to admit how bad my situation is to family or friends. 

I was googling painless suicide methods and it recommended I first call a hotline number, but I don't even have a phone any more. It recommended that I first reach out in some manner before making a final decision, and I agree with the logic that time wasted won't matter much if I do commit to this decision.

Right now, my primary thought process is that humanity will be better off in the long run if I -- as a single person without any off spring -- don't contribute further to the problem of over population if I'm not making a true difference in society.

I would appreciate outside input, as I realize that my experience may be affecting my judgment. I also would appreciate if anyone knows a way to contact a suicide hotline without being able to afford a phone.
