Is it considered suicide?I have a friend who is really depressed. She has a genetic disease that is basically a ticking time bomb. She just wants to let the disease the course because she doesn't have the heart to do it herself. I've been trying to talk her into going back to the doctor and trying to manage her disease but she won't listen. I want to help her. She has three kids, and she's basically setting herself up to die sooner.
