School just makes me want to kill myselfI canâ€™t fucking do math. I canâ€™t. Itâ€™s literally impossible. So instead of trying to help students, schools just punish the students who donâ€™t know how the fuck polynomials work (like me). The only thing school has taught me is that Iâ€™m the reason I canâ€™t do math and I should just get rid of the problem.

And the stuff I am good at (mainly drumming) gets taken away when I fail a class, so I canâ€™t even do that. All of the problems in my life are my fault.
