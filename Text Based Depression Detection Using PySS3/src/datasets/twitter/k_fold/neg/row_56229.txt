Canâ€™t kill myself but I want to so muchIâ€™m 18 currently and donâ€™t want to live anymore. Itâ€™s been like this for a few years but it seems everyday I want to snap more and more. Iâ€™m fat and ugly. Everyone I talk to about it doesnâ€™t take me seriously. Itâ€™s like I have to do it for them to believe me. Iâ€™m pretty smart but wasted my high school career and not going to college. Canâ€™t afford it anyway. No girl wants to talk to me at all. Everyone says I have a lot of friends that care about me but it all seems so fake. I canâ€™t talk to any of the guys cuz they all think everything is fine and would just call me a pussy and move on. Nobody truly cares about me. I want to die but I canâ€™t because I donâ€™t want to leave my mom ,grandmother and about 2-3 friends that donâ€™t even care about me anyway. Iâ€™ve already decided to kill my self when my mom and grandmother are gone but everyday I want to do it more and more because I canâ€™t wait. I drive myself fucking crazy sitting in my room alone all day everyday. Anyone got some advice on how to just get it over with ?
