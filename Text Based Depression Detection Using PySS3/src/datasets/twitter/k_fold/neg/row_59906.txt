How do people get over the guilt?Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s keeping me from killing myself today. The guilt. Usually itâ€™s fear but today itâ€™s the guilt. I can get over the fear sometimes but I can never get over the guilt of what itâ€™ll cause.

How do you think people get over that? I guess they just think about how none of it will matter in 100 years anyhow?
