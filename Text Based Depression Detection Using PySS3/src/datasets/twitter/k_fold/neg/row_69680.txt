ending it before i turn 17planning on ending it sometime this month before i turn 17, itâ€™s been a rough 4 years of constant gender dysphoria, crippling loneliness and my mind being plagued with my abuser so iâ€™m at my limit. i donâ€™t really give a shit anymore and iâ€™m ready to go. 

fed up with the bullshit surrounding my age and how my feelings arenâ€™t as important because iâ€™m an ignorant teenager, donâ€™t see why that changes anything considering iâ€™ve felt suicidal since the age of 10. i donâ€™t normally vent or talk about my feelings &amp; i donâ€™t have anywhere else to say this. 

have a good one lads
