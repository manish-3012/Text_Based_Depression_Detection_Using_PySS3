Why canâ€™t I pull the trigger?Iâ€™ve put a loaded gun to my head that bought specifically for killing myself yet I never can find the courage to pull the trigger. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s stopping me. maybe because I think itâ€™ll be painful? Will it be painful? I just need the strength to do it. I want it to be quick
