Looks like I'm packing a bag tomorro &amp; sleeping in the woodsI can't do this. For months I've done everything in my ability to help my parent as they prepare buy/sell/move house &amp; everything I do to help I am shouted at all the time.

I do the work silently but whenever they have to lift a finger they shout &amp; throw things and create such a toxic atmosphere.

I told them the shouting and banging things makes me anxious &amp; that I'm already struggling today with depression &amp; they just didn't acknowledge it.

If you don't like it then leave they said.

I'm done. I get the feeling that my own parent hates my guts. 

I've worked so hard for years. I got my degree. Then I got sick &amp; now I'm never good enough.

So I'm moving to the woods alone. I've been thinking about this for weeks. Its probably a bad idea but I don't have a choice anymore. I'm going to try and survive as best as I can but if I die I'll be doing myself a favour. Today I've never felt so empty. I have nobody.

Please don't tell me to talk to my parent. I have tried that for 6/7 months now. They will not admit their behaviour is wrong. They lie about everything. I have to get away from here.

I feel so alone. So so alone. I just can't believe I've broken down today &amp; they showed no compassion just more shouting.

Fuck.
