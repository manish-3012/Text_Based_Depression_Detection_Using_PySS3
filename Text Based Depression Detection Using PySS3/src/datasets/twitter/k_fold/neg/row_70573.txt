Thinking of dyingI feel like shit. School is hell. My anxiety is out of control. I hate myself. Lashed out at my sister today. She was basically telling me all the ways I suck at caring for my pets and how her anxiety and depression is worse and how she still cares for her pets when she gets depressed. Went to my room, started cutting myself. Currently thinking of ending it all. I feel like I just make everyone around me miserable. Things might get better, but it will take so long and I don't think I can take it. Thinking about ODing or cutting myself deep enough.
