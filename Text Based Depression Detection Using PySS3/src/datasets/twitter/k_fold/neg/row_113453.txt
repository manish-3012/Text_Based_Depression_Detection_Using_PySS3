I'm Over It20. Female. A senior at one of the best public universities in the country. Working a position at a billion-dollar company that many need a degree plus experience for. And that's all I have. That's all I am. I still live paycheck to paycheck. Every day is a true struggle. All the yoga, weed, good vibes, and antidepressants can't keep the suicidal thoughts away for long. Today I cleaned off my desk and clocked out of work early. Tomorrow morning after I take my dog to my mom's, I won't be here much longer. And I'm just bitter as hell about it. Like, if there is a god or if there are gods, what the actual fuck was that? Also, why do people say "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger???" A combination of cptsd, codependency, mdd, anxiety, and an eating disorder has ruined me. I have no friends because I feel like my worth is tied into my weight and/or what I can do for other people. Every other person says I'm pretty, but no one has ever loved me romantically. I encounter nothing but road blocks *every single fucking time* I try to get into therapy (or stay in it). I just hear "oh, your bpm's too low," or, "oh there's marijuana in your system," or fucking "your ekg doesn't look right so i will just fucking abandon you." Fuck everyone who has ever fucked me over. Fuck religion. Fuck psychiatrist. Fuck my abusive father and my "i'll turn a blind eye to the abuse because that's what makes me comfortable" mother. I'm done.
