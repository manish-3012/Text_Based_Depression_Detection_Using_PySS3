I'm going to live. For family. For friends.I've lost \[everything I worked for over my entire life on Friday\]( [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fqa9uc/i\_lost\_my\_future\_today\_i\_apologise\_in\_advance\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fqa9uc/i_lost_my_future_today_i_apologise_in_advance_for/) ) and I was feeling suicidal to the point of action. However, I have talked with my family and friends who were all worried about my well-being.

In particular, my mother was moving. She was tearful. She pleaded me not to kill myself. She endured considerable pain because of her strong empathy towards me and my situation. My father, someone of fewer words, must have felt the same; during extreme hardship, he would remain stoic and bear the burden of pain so that the rest of the family could live in safety.

I won't die. I can't die. My battle isn't over yet and I will keep going.
