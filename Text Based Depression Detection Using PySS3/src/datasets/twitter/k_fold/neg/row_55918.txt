Long time reader, few time replyer.I donâ€™t feel better than anybody else, so I feel like I canâ€™t save anybody else, so I never reply to people reaching out. It feels bad because I want to save everyone;but I know Iâ€™m not better than anyone. So I donâ€™t feel like I can give advice or save anyone.. but let me just say; I have been molested by three family members, I was a drug addict, I was an alcoholic, I was abused physically and emotionally.
But HERE I AM!!! 
I hope that everyone of you is able to find somebody that you can confide in, trust in, Believe in.. but if you canâ€™t, like I couldnâ€™t.. Believe in yourself. Take one goddamn moment at a time. And if you live through one moment you can live through the next. Through all of the things I have lived through, I am now 25, I make a decent living, I have a partner I trust and Iâ€™m able to be myself. And if anybody needs any kind of support, please do message me. I can give financial advice to the best of my ability, I can try to help somebody survive. We might not have the same story, But I can relate to a lot of things. At the end of the day all you have to do is believe in yourself. And the rest will follow.
