My sister talks about killing herself every dayI suffer with suicidal thoughts too. You folks know, the word "suffer" is not being hyperbolic. It's a physical hurt that brings you into a mental and emotional deep pit you can't figure out how to escape. It's like you've forgotten where your limbs are. It's the most helpless feeling and you feel so alone, which is why I feel like the "pit" metaphor is perfect. It's a dark and lonely pit.

I'm starting to notice that people who suffer with suicidal thoughts tend to be visual learners and visual types. Not always. Anyway, it's really hard for me when my sister threatens suicide daily because when I'm feeling suicidal, I don't feel like it's my place to tell anyone in the family. I just want to kill myself even more because I feel even more insignificant.

My therapist tells me to first try to think about stuff I can visualize that I think is beautiful. It's difficult at first, especially when I'm deliriously sad. But then I think about my dog's eyes or something like biking in the summer and I try to hold onto that. If I can try to miss those things enough to not want to die, I'm a little ok. She also says most people don't want to die, they just don't want to live like this. I agree. I don't want to live with my sister talking like this and I have a lot of shit in my life I don't like.

One other thing she has me visualize is my dark pit. If I can visualize it and stop being so afraid of it, maybe I can overcome it and imagine myself taking a small step out of it and into a brighter area. This, I'm still working on but it's worked one time. One is a start.

I'm always going to have to deal with these thoughts, it's how I've been coping with life since I was 9. I used it to escape the trauma. Therapy helps though.

I am just trying to offer a little hope as I'm having a decent day. Tomorrow might be terrible and I might need to read someone else's post. Much love to you all.
