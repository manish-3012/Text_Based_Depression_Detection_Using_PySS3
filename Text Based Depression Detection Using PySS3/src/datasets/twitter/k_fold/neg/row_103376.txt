Should I tell my therapist I've been extremely suicidal?I attempted suicide a day after our last appointment two weeks ago (not related). Pretty much everyday since then, I've had attempt after attempt and have not been reaching out to hotlines like I normally do. I want to tell my therapist, but what is the best way to go about it without getting hospitalized?
