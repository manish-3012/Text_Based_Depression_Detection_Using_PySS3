I am scared I might do something stupid.Yesterday I held a gun against my forehead, I wanted to watch me decide if I should live or die. I just don't know what to do, in the past I wouldn't even think about killing myself but I know I am getting closer to it everyday. I don't even know if I want to pull the trigger or not, but I do know that its getting harder to reason to myself every day.  I am scared and I can't tell my family if I did their reaction would push me over the edge and I would do it. I feel pushed against a corner, and I don't think I can handle it.
