A small rant you shouldn't read.Only a select few get attention. Such is the personality of the internet. If it doesnt POP, then who the F*** cares? If you don't have a blade to you throat drawling the first droplets of blood from an artery, then oh well. Unentertaining. I've seen many poor people post on here, begging to no avail. Noone reaches out a hand. Noone really cares. And why would they. They dont know you. Not really. And certainly not enough to make a difference. I have kept myself alive by sheer fucking will power. This world is a disease and I will gladly accept being rid of it when my "time comes". Killing yourself just makes a mess of things.
