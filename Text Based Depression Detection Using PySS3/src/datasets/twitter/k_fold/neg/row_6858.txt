make the most of itHow do i make the most of it? no matter how much i decide "okay x months from now" or on a certain date to plan my departure, it still doesn't make me want to do anything.  I can't improve in anything no matter how much i try so i decide to just "make the most of it"... i don't know how i would even do that tho.  Is there any way i can force myself to "fix"?
