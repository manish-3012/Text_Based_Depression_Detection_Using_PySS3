Frustration of growing adultHi guys,

im a male citizen of some where in south asia my age is nearly 21 from coming September. im here living with my father, mother and my young sister. Soon ill complete my bachelor (BCA  computer application) degree in there during covid crisis my exams has been extended . i dont even know about a basic script of java,c/c++... but im good at story/screenplay writing and also i have passion to make films, but here talent ain't matter only a influencer can get all opportunities!  my father working here as a car driver more than 25 years he is a hard worker but still he can't even buy a new house we were still living here in a same room truth is i dont even have private room he invests all of his money to our education, may be if i get a job that can only provide me intialy 10,000 rupees per month it takes 3 to 4years for increment. Atleast i need a job that should cover all of my expenses or else that give me enough food, i just wanted to live my life peacefully like everyone, Here only rich gets richer! i need to exit from this loop, i had enough of this shit! Being stuck it really sucks u knowðŸ˜–
