What's the point, really, as a guy?The more men that sexually assault people, the more men in general are just lumped in with these fucking monsters that abuse people. I don't even mean to get on a soapbox of "not all men" or anything like that. Like, what can we do as guys to not be guilty by association? It's probably the reason I never really talk to people anymore anyway. Why shouldn't I rid the world of one less man?
