Friend of mine has a plan and the means to do it.Some of our mutual friends told a teacher (we're in high school, the suicidal friend is a freshman) who told the school counselor and they're recommending hospitalization because the suicidal friend has a plan and the means to kill herself and the only reason she didn't last night is because her parents were home. What do I do? How do I help her? Is hospitalization really the right thing to do here? I'd rather have her angry at me than dead, but is it the right move?
