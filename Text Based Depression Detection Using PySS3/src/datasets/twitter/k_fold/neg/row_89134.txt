Is something wrong with me?My sister had an emotional break down after she offered me some gum and I took more than I was allowed to. I left the room, totally careless (I did apologize) but I'm not into having these childish arguments.

Later on my sister spammed me on whats app and confessed that she was raped several times and that what happened between me and her reminded her of that.

I told her that I way sorry for what happened to her and that I didn't intend on hurting her.

I do feel empathy for what happened to her but I also don't care at all and I don't know why.

She only talked about it once but we got over it cause we didn't know whether she was exaggerating or not (emotional breakdown because of my mom) and since she rarely talks about these things I don't understand why she gets so mad over such small things and mentions her past like we knew about it but we mostly don't.

I'm confused. We ended the conversation but I still don't know why I have very little empathy for such tragic things.
