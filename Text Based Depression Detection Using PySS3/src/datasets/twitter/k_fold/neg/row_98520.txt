Coward?No, I'm not a coward. Actually I'm the opposite. I face everyday feeling like a burden and I'm still here, surviving, even when every breath hurts. 

No, I'm not selfish either. You are. Why do you want me to keep living? So you don't feel guilty? I do hope you remember me when I'm dead, because you don't even notice me now that I'm alive. You don't mind if I'm in hell if that means I could save you a couple of tears.

No, I'm not angry either. I don't even have the energy for that. I'm just tired. Of everything. Of myself. Of this feeling. 

I just want to go.

Please, let me.
