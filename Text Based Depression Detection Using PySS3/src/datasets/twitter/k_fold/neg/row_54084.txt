I've been dead enough for awhile now.After about a year of health problems that completely remain unexplainable by any doctor, after piles upon piles of medical bills, dropping out of college due to the pain and cognitive impairment, the loss of my personality, I've realized just how pointless it is now.

It's unlikely my cognitive capacities will return, or that the headache I've been experiencing for the past 9 months will ever subside.

The difference between myself a year ago and now is so stark, I do not see it as being possible that I will be able to return to that.

I used to be effortlessly creative, outgoing, happy-go-lucky, and was a great student and just overall a nice dude.

I feel like that guy, that guy whom I cannot even claim myself to be, is dead.

With my body failing, the constant physical pain accompanied by the loss of my soul, I've decided that I no longer have anything to live for, as I can no longer experience it.

I don't see the sense in it all when the me I knew has been dead for so long already, and is medically impossible to revive. Without a memory, I have no past, without cognition and drive, I have no future, without being able to detect reality, I have no present.

There is nothing left for me but continued pain, and at 21 years old, my life didn't even get to start.
