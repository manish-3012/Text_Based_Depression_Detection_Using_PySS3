A promise I madeI have, for the past month and a half, been depressed for no discernable reason. Masturbating doesn't help, being with friends doesn't help. Food doesn't help, and my therapist no longer seems to help either. I actually had to cut our session short 10 minutes in last week because it was too much to be there.

It is now too much to be alive. I've dealt with suicidal tendencies in the past and have even attempted a few times... The last time I attempted, it was because the person that is my entire world lashed out and made me think he hated me... I was inconsolable. We had a very long conversation, where he apologized (though I made it clear that forgiveness wasn't going to be easy) and we talked about what we meant to one another. I told him I thought I had lost him forever, and he promised he'd never leave me without saying goodbye. That he'd always come back to me if he didn't say goodbye. I promised the same, which is where my problem lies. 

I want to die. Quite frankly I could do it right now with the pills in my cabinet, but I wouldn't be able to bring myself to swallow without letting him know I'm leaving. I simply can't have that conversation and it's so frustrating and damning to have that be the promise I can't help but stick to. I am so so so fucking tired of waking up every day to this bleak and dreary world in the shitty city in which I live to continue my pointless life, but that promise keeps me tethered here. I can't bear to break it.
