What does it matter if I choose euthanasia?I'm 25 and nothing crushes my soul more than the thought of aging.

The other day I went for a walk and men all over kept making fools of themselves trying to make it known that they think I'm beautiful. It's stupid as shit. But I think about how that will only last until I'm 40 or 50 and then I will be wrinkly and repulsive.

I can't identify myself as somebody that age. I feel better facing my life when I think that 49 will be my last full year. Either on my 50th birthday or in the middle of that year, I'll be 110% ready to peacefully go to the physical negation zone, so my spirit never has to be mudded with the inclusion of decay years.

I will be happier for having accepted, I am halfway through my lifespan. It's good.
