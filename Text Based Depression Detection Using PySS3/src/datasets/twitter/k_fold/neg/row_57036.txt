Can suicidal thoughts a cop-out to avoid the work that needs to be done?It occurred to me my suicidal thoughts may ne a way of giving myself permission to do less--not meeting my expectations of myself. I mean that by always making suicide a plan b, I give myself an out from experiencing the consequences of not doing what I need to do to make life worth living.

At some intuitive level I get that there are things I could try that have a good chance of making my existence better, but I cannot seem (so far) to become the person that does those things.

I'm worried my suicidal thoughts and possibly suicide itself provides a way to escape the work that needs to be done to improve my primary relationship and my career, and also to avoid the inner work required to patch up (or at least accept) my spirit.

I am worried I destroyed my brain during 10 years of severe opiate addiction, and can't make it in this world anymore. I'm 37, in heavy debt, have $1000 of child support, and a turbulent relationship with my 26f partner, who I've become kind of subservient to.

But now I'm just rambling about my sad life when I wanted to kind of pose this philosophical/psychological question.

I've been thinking about suicide constantly but feel like I just need to somehow my myself stop instead of giving myself to those thoughts. Like maybe the thoughts are just a product of learned helplesness but that I do have the capacity to make my life better.

A few weeks ago I went to a high place and looked down. I gave myself the opportunity. Yet I couldn't do it. Some part of me wants to live but I need to figure out why and make that my purpose.

Thanks for listening. I have no one I can talk to about this IRL.
