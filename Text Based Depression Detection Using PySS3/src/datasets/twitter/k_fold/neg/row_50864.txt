helplessi just hate everything. i hate myself, i hate my life and i hate everything revolving around it. iâ€™m 15 and iâ€™ve spoken to my mom about my feelings. she started to say that i was privileged and that i wasnâ€™t allowed to be depressed or suicidal. she also said that â€˜realâ€™ depressed people donâ€™t say they need help. WELL IM SORRY FOR TRYING TO GET HELP. iâ€™m very aware that iâ€™m really privileged but i feel so suicidal and iâ€™m ALWAYS sad. then she started to insult me and making fun of me. so my chance of getting help is now gone. and i know that if i donâ€™t get help then i will probably end up dead. oh well. at this point iâ€™m just done. i donâ€™t know how i will do it or when. also iâ€™ve given everyone around me enough signs and they just insulted me instead of trying to understand. i donâ€™t even feel guilty anymore because they donâ€™t care. no one does. i know that i need help but i wonâ€™t get it, so why am i still here? iâ€™ve been feeling suicidal since i was around 9, iâ€™m just messed up and i feel like the only way to prove to my mom that iâ€™m suffering is to end my life.
