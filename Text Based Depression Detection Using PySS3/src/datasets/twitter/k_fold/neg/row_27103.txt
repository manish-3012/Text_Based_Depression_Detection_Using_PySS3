All of these innocent people are dying from COVID, and honestly the world just seems like an awful place to be.My heart is broken over this whole pandemic. I canâ€™t tolerate nor accept the fact that a ridiculous number of people are dying from COVID every day. I refuse to accept the fact that people are dying terrible deaths, scared and alone. Iâ€™m sorry but I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t just be expected to sit here and be okay with the fact that the number of deaths are going up every day. People are grieving and not getting closure. Theyâ€™re not allowed to properly say goodbye.

This pandemic has fucked me up. Iâ€™ve experienced many odd symptoms since this started, some of which Iâ€™ve always had but have worsened, or new ones. Shock. Denial. Rage. Desperately looking for someone to blame. Suicidal thoughts. Self harm urges. Profound sadness. Numbness. An inability to cry OR random inconsolable crying fits. Anxiety. Extreme irritability. Dissociation. Confusion. Paranoia. Hopelessness. Helplessness. Sleeping issues. Constant nightmares.

Iâ€™ve developed severe agoraphobia. I refuse to step outside the house. My friends will hang out but I canâ€™t hang out with them. The world is too much of a scary place. The virus is there, just waiting to take me out.

I wanna self harm right now (I wonâ€™t). Iâ€™m feeling anxious and paranoid. I feel sick to my stomach. The fact that people are dying every fucking day from this awful virus is something Iâ€™ll never get over. Iâ€™ll always remember this. Iâ€™ll always remember the pure horror, shock, fear and helplessness. When will I be comfortable going out again? Probably never, honestly.

Life just doesnâ€™t seem worth it. Iâ€™m experiencing suicidal thoughts, but I donâ€™t wanna die and, no, Iâ€™m not gonna act on them, but they really get me sometimes. If I become so distressed at the thought of people I donâ€™t even know dying, how am I gonna get through life? Iâ€™m such a pussy.
