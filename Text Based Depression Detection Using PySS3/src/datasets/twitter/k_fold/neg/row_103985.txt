need some help with ending iti'm not gonna bother going into why i'm doing this, cuz that's prolly not gonna help me get the answers i want.

so i've pried the plastic off one of those shitty ass disposable razors and extracted the blades. after "locating" my radial artery (air quotes because i think i've maybe got the wrong spot), i cut vertically using the corner.

unfortunately, the cuts closed within minutes.


to say i'm stumped would be an understatement. so i've compiled this list of questions. doesn't matter if you can't answer em all, any little bit helps.

1) where the fuck exactly is the radial artery to begin with? diagrams don't help, i'm retarded.

2) how deep is it? i've read things varying from 3mm to half an inch. 

3) is this razor i'm using right now gonna be any good? or should i wait till my mom buys a proper surgical scalpel for me?

4) some of the shit i've read says that i'll only know i've successfully sliced into the artery if blood "spurts out".  is this true? or will it be less dramatic?

5) do i actually need to be in a bathtub with warm water? idk how the presence of water will do anything to help me bleed out.

thanks for reading i guess.

also sorry if this is a common query on this sub, i genuinely couldn't find any definitive guides that weren't full of, to use the technical term here, horseshit.
