Things are bad and I don't have the energy to unfuck my life even though the opportunity is thereIt's been 10 years of depression already and everything has been terrible for a very long time. I don't think things will ever get better. 

There's this one place that is offering me a job that's actually relevant to my degree and is work-from-home-whenever-you-have-time for 20 hours a week but I don't have the energy to take it. I currently do about 55 hours a week and 8 hours of commuting total. If I could handle that extra load for just 3 months, things will probably get better because then I'd have relevant work experience and be able to have the proper dose of antidepressants.

I really need money to sustain the cost of antidepressants. It's already a lot on the 1-pill/day routine even though the recommended dose is 2-pills/day. But I'm just so tired all the time. I guess it's saving me money on food because I have less of an appetite, but now I'm cold all the time.

If I jumped out my window on this very tall apartment like my parents told me to 10 years ago, I'd never have to deal with this miserable life again. But that's kind of permanent and I'm still holding out and waiting for something to get better. But I don't know if anything will change.
