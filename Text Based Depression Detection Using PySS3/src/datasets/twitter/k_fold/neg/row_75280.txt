Iâ€™m killing myself soon.Iâ€™m a 15F, there is a good chance that I will be dead in 6 days. Im scared of death to some extent, and I feel like I wasted my life. I could have made something out of myself if I wasnâ€™t so fucked up. I belong in jail for what my friends and I have done, and maybe Iâ€™m doing the world a favor by offing myself. I feel sorry for my family and I know that whatever happens, will probably effect them. I know that none of my online â€œfriendsâ€ will miss me or even notice Iâ€™m gone and my real life friends will probably get over it in about a day. Iâ€™m not sure if this is what I want, but I know I will regret not going through with it if I back out.
