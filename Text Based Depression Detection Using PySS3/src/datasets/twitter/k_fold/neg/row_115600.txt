Hi guysWell, im drunk and i feel like this is the point and place where i can lift off some steam.


I have thought about suicide since my ex broke up with me two and a half year ago. she was my fucking everything.
I had plans for my proposal, i had figured that she was the one i could share my life with. It ended so suddenly, i hade no idea. when she told me i just got mute. A fucking million thoughts went through my mind. nothing made sense, I loved her, the day before she had asked her parents how they met again, she knew they where like us. Young and inlove. Like nothing could stop us..


And still now i feel like i cant move on, she is one of the two people i think about everyday.


and i know that many of my friends is like, there is plenty of fish in the sea. and like when you are young is the age when you should have fun and fool around.


I dont want that.
I want someone to keep close and cuddle with. someone who is there for me and who makes ME feel good about myself. 

Still every one thinks im justnother "player"
