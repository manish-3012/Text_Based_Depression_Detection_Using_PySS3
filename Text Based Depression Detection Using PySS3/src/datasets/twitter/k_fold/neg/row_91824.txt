What is the point of life ?Background: Had laser eye surgery around 2 months ago, after being a glasses wearer for 20 years (am 25 now).

The results of the surgery have been very poor. I miss what it's like to see clearly to be honest.....

Through this whole ordeal, I have begun to question the meaning of our existence. I think partly because I am faced with seeing the world through these damaged eyes for the rest of my life. Why bother doing well at my job, in my personal relationships, taking care of my health, getting married, buying a house, having kids, travelling. What's it all for if we just die one day? Why not just die now, since we are all going to anyway...

To me, I just feel life isnt worth living anymore if I am going to see floaters, triple at night, rainbows around lights. All of this compared to the crystal clear vision I had two months prior with glasses... 

I dont want to live my life full of regret. Regret when I see anyone in glasses; I think to myself, glasses were good enough for him//her, but I had to be the one for whom they just werent good enough. What a stupid decision. 

I dont know what I wanted to achieve out of this post. Mainly just to vent and express some thoughts....
