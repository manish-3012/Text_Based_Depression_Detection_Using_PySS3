My ex told my family Iâ€™m planning on killing myself, and now I donâ€™t know what to doI was going to do it on the 28th. I told him I was actively suicidal, and I wanted to say goodbye. I went to bed and woke up to my parents at my place demanding to know whatâ€™s going on. Now they donâ€™t want me alone. They basically begged me to not give up. They said theyâ€™re not going to lose me and stuff like that. I want to end it so fucking bad. Iâ€™ve already given up. I gave up long ago. I literally just wanted to say goodbye to the man I love and he fucked me over. Idek what to do now.
