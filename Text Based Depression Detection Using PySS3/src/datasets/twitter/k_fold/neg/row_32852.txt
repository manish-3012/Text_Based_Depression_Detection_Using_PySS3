as we sway with the rhythm.I've been thinking of what the title of this post should be and I can't come up with anything. after a bit of thinking, I think, if i had to come up with at least one word, it would be exhaustion. I'm just tired. I've drank a lot and taken a lot of my anti-depressants. I'm not afraid to die. If anything I welcome it. Is this a desperate cry? A reach for someone's hand? who knows. To reiterate, I'm just tired. Contrary to popular belief, suicide isn't a weakness. It's an ending to a means. I'm not selfish. The people who want me to dredge through my anguish are.
