I think Iâ€™m really gonna do it tonight.I think this is the end. Hopefully by midnight tonight I wonâ€™t be here to bother people anymore. Iâ€™ll go get some pizza first just to enjoy one last thing and then drive to my quiet area I like to hangout at and hopefully find peace. 

I just have no one. The only person who I could ever talk to and trust was my dad and he died almost 9 years ago. Then a person came into my life a little over a year ago who said they would always be there and care about me and now sheâ€™s not. She wonâ€™t even answer a text when I say Iâ€™m panicking. Just because sheâ€™s like everyone else and everyone doesnâ€™t care about me. Iâ€™m thankful for this sub for letting me know Iâ€™m not completely alone in my sadness. I wish I could of made more people proud.
