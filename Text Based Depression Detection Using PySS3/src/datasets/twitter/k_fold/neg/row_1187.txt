RelapseIâ€™ve been ok for a one and a half years but today I thought of suicide three times.

The last few days have been rough, iâ€™ve been betrayed by people closest to me. 

Some relatives came over and more are coming tomorrow, oneâ€™s that remind me how dark and alone the world can be.

Iâ€™ve been struggling to find a job and feel trapped. Everything is against me. 

I feel like Iâ€™ll always attract the worst the lowest frequency. 

Iâ€™m fed up. To make matters worse I have alot of parent issues. My father is a rich pric whoâ€™s abandoned us.
