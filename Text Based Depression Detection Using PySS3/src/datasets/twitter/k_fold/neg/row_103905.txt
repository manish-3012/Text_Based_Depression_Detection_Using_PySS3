I donâ€™t want to hurt myself but I canâ€™t afford to go to the hospitalI called the hotline, and said exactly that. And honestly I donâ€™t know what I was expecting. But what I got was a dude who read off a bunch of questions. I answered. Then I got transferred to a sassy lady who informed me that she could either send out a team to collect me and take me to the hospital, or she could call 911. 

I repeated myself. I canâ€™t afford the hospital. The lady told me those are my options.

Iâ€™ve been dealing with some mental health issues since I was a kid, but theyâ€™ve really exploded in the last 2-3 years. I get why people with depression kill themselves. 

I donâ€™t want to die because Iâ€™m sad. I want to die because this is going to happen for the rest of my life, and I cannot agree to that. I never thought Iâ€™d be a person who would do this, but Iâ€™ve been strongly considering it even when Iâ€™m not sad.

Help. I donâ€™t want to hurt myself, but I canâ€™t do this again and again. I canâ€™t.
