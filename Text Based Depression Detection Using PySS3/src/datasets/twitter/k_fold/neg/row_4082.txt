Exit bagI cant get out of bed for days at a time. When I do, I go out and drink/use to numb myself, and feel like I'm not wasting away in a room, which I am, basically. 2 months ago, my sister was murdered, and since then, I've lost myself. I've switched off. My family wont go near me because I'm an addict, and they dont know how to be there for someone like me. My daughters mother wont let me see her. I just take my meds, and lay in bed in the dark, and sleep. When I'm awake, I sit alone. Nobody calls. Nobody answers when I reach out. I'm broke and there is no work in this town, and nobody has money to buy my art (I'm an artist). I've been reading about painless ways to die, and have found that an exit bag seems the best way. It just feels like it's time. Its felt like its time. No more meds. No more loneliness. I cant get better. This world gets worse. I'm ready.
