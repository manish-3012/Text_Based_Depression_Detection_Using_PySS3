I think I'm almost doneSo this is how I've been feeling recently. I'm 20 ive never had sex never had a girlfriend. I don't get hungry anymore eating makes me sick I don't have a libido my hair is already thinning there are  no video games or movies that excite me even in the slightest anymore. Death is inevitable any way I just want to fade into nothing
