why the hell does anything matter anymorei hate myself. i think part of me really, really wants to die. i would call a hotline if anyone could really help me. i know all they're going to say is "oh, that's tough" with no real hope of telling me anything that will actually help me. i desperately need money but i am paid by my state and they somehow think it's cool to leave professionals unpaid for their work during a pandemic. and they were behind on payments before the pandemic started. now they are using this time to be even less accountable to us. as someone still living paycheck to paycheck, life really sucks right now. i have no idea when the money i am owed will be coming to me. the uncertainty makes me sick. i will still be waiting weeks for any kind of financial support from the government to come through. i am doing everything i can but nothing is panning out.

i don't think i have anything going for me. i'm in therapy but that can't help with the money situation either. home life is not good. i don't want to ask my family for help because things are still not good with them. i don't know. nothing is good. i'm never going to be the person i want to be or get to do what i want to. i just feel like giving up.
