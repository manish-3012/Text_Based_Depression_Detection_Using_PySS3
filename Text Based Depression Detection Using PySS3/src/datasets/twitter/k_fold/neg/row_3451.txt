I'm drunk, I have the drugs, why not?Hey All,

I'm drunk and kind of happy/buzzed. I have enough mgs of oxy to kill myself. Why should I not do it? 

Honestly, I kind of feel like it doesn't matter whether I live or die, so why not just die and finally put an end to all the bulllshit? Perhaps even writing this is a testament that I really want to live, but I don't consciously believe that, and if this is just a cry for help, then "help"! Why shouldn't I do it? Why should I decide to live instead of finally put an end to it all? Or should I just do it and be done?
