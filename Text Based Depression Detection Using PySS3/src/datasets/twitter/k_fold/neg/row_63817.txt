I'm I faking depression?I do things like cut myself and think about suicide. Sometimes I'll even get to the point where I'm strangling myself with a belt or I have a time/place and a method. I don't constantly feel like dying or numb or sad. Sometimes I feel okay and that makes me feel like shit. I'm I faking this? For attention or something?  I'm I making a big deal out of nothing? Nothing in my life is bad. I make it bad. I spit the face of opportunity and, instead of working hard, just play videogames or sleep.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I say I'm depressed but i've never been diagnosed. I have no proof of depression besides the cuts on my arms and legs. I feel like such a faker.
