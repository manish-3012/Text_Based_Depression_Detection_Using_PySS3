A midlife crisis I'm not prepared forWhen I was 12, I experienced a sexual trauma. It should not have been this significant. Many others have endured far worse and emerged stronger than before. But it is starting to dawn on me that I did not.

I've always hated my own body and my own sexuality. It's obviously fun for a lot of people, but not for me. My relationship history is a wreckage of impotence and disappointment. To say the anger has affected all other aspects of my life would be accurate.

Six years ago, I got married to a woman I loved, whom I thought supported me, and I believed I had found the peace I wanted. [Now that's blown up in my face](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/f0bqi8/dropping_the_bomb_on_super_bowl_sunday/), in an ugly and dramatic fashion I don't think I have the constitution to handle. I am tortured by all my memories of those "good" years.

I feel bad for that little boy. If I saw him, I would have to tell him it's almost 30 years later and nothing got any better.

I'm not going to become a bitter hermit who whines and blames others. I'm not going to Take The Red Pill. I'm going to go into the desert and end this with the dignity I have left.
