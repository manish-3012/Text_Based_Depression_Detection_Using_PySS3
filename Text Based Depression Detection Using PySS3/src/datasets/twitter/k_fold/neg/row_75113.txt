Blood thinners, booze, and a razor.A culmination of teen angst, melodrama and depression has lead me to my bed, crying for the first time in years, while listening to Brand New, because *gosh* I'm so deep and different. 

This is your run of the mill "i got broken up with im sad" post. My SO called my buddy today to tell him she's still in love with her long past ex, and how they've still been fucking around. Being used and lied to isn't what hurts. Her specifically cheating isn't what hurts. It's that this is the fifth (**5th**) relationship I've been cheated on in.

The first one stung, that was the very first person I was ever with. That one pushed me down dope road, which I've since gotten off of unfortunately. Second one hurt, but not as much. By the third one, it started to get comical, raising questions such as "haha fuck what's wrong with me". When the fourth happened I was entirely numb, but this fifth has really instilled a new sense of absolute hopelessness.

Of course that's not the only issue. A childhood filled with mental abuse and crippling mental illness have obviously made their contributions. Wanting to commit suicide since twelve, and three failed attempts at that. The complete lack of close friends I could speak to about my problems, not that it would help because I'd never be able to vocalize them, find the right words to explain what is going on in my head. No motivation to seek a professional.

Either way, I'm not here to spill my whole life story. I, like most, just wanted a soapbox to stand on, and groan a few vain last words. Leave a mark, as small as it may be. And if I have any regrets, it's that I hadn't left a large enough mark. Nothing of value created, no book written, no painting finished, no drawings built. Of all the things I've wanted to do in life, there's nothing to show for any of them. But, accomplishments don't exactly mean much dead.
