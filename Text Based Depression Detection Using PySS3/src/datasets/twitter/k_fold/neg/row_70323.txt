I'm going through with it this SundayFor the last few months, I've been planning my suicide. My depression has gotten really bad lately, and I can't take it anymore. I fucked up my life so hard, I can't fix it.Â 


The funniest part is that I've been so miserable these last few months and yet nobody has noticed. My parents, my youngest brother, my friends, none of them have the slightest inkling of what I've been going through. They think I'm your regular sweet fifteen year old girl, doing well in school and pursuing her dreams. What a joke. I'm an utter failure and the only reason no one knows is because I lie about everything these days.Â 


My parents are blissfully ignorant. They might even be in denial. When I was around twelve, I was severely depressed and cut myself daily. They caught me, punished me, and I stopped for a few months. I never got any help, professional or otherwise, just punishment and shame. Rinse and repeat for a couple of years, until I learned how to hide my cuts and emotions well enough to pass. They ignore all my symptoms. I could tell them that I'm going to kill myself and they wouldn't do a thing.Â 


Maybe they want me to die. They have my brother and my step-brothers. They have their own little families now with their perfect sons. They don't need me.


I'm through with being exhausted and miserable everyday. The world will be just the same without me. Hopefully death is just nothingness, like a never-ending dreamless sleep. I don't care if I have to go through hours of pain or only twenty minutes, I'm going for the home run. My method will be fatal. I refuse to be stitched back together and forced to live the rest of my life trapped in a shell of my former self.Â 


Basically what I'm saying is, I'm done with trying to live for others. Maybe I'm okay with being selfish for once. So I'm going through with it.Â
