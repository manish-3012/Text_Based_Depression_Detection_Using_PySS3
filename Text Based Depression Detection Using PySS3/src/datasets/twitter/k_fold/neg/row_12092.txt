i don't know what will helpbecause i dont have the balls to ask for help

ive posted here before. i've attempted twice. but i still can't admit to my friends or family whats going on. 

now i'm sitting here with a knife to my wrist. i dont know how far i'll go. i dont know if i'll end up drunk tonight. i've got painkillers too. and a beautifully high bridge over a rocky hillside not 3 blocks from me. 

i've got a note too. maybe tonight's the night. 3rd times the charm, right?
