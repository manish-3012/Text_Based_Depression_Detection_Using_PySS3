Intrusive thoughts and stuck in thought patterns.This is a throwaway account because of reasons.

Hello.
I have intrusive thoughts of disgusting and violent behaviour, I can hinder myself from acting on these thoughts but it's overwhelming at times so I resort to self-harm.

I don't know what to do anymore, it has come to that point where everything I think about ends up resulting in thinking about suicide and just ending it all. How do I change myself, how do I stop?
