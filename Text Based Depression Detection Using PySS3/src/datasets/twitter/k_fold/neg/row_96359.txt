Every conversation I've had in the last 3 years"Hey OP what you been up to?"
"Nothing"
...
"Any news?"
"No"
...
"You watched x?"
"Yeah good show"
"Yeah"
...
"Welp okay OP seeya next time when we repeat this exchange, over &amp; over again"

Literally just going through a fucking scripted event over &amp; over again, it's the same every time.

I don't understand other people anymore, I don't understand what people get out of conversation.

I don't want to talk to you, I don't want to be talked at, I'm never doing anything but even if I was I wouldn't want to talk about it &amp; any topic you bring up I've already heard about because I spend all my time on the internet.

What's the point?

It's just another facet of life that I don't want, I don't want to work, I don't want to go through these scripted conversations, there's just nothing for me here.
