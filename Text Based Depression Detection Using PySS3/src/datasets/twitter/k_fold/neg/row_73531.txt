21 and doneI think I'm going to kill myself soon after my dads birthday so around mid September. I don't know how yet but I've accepted that I'm going to already. I hate myself I absolutely fucking hate myself. I'm 21 and my boyfriend of nearly 3 years left me and he was the first thing in my life since I was very very young who made me happy, from the age of 9-10 until I was almost 19 I was completely miserable and I never knew what happiness what then I met him and I wasn't "happy" but I was content and he made my depression slip away and I fucking ruined him and I ruined us and now he is gone. I have no friends, I got fired from my job of 6 years. I just don't want to be alive anymore I can't. I see absolutely no point
