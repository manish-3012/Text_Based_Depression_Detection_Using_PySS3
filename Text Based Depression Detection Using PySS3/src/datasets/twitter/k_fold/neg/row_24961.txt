I have a family. A teenage boy. A partner. Parents. I don't want to be on this earth any longer. I want to be done tonight.I know I'm a terrible person for merely entertaining the thought. I know it's the absolute height of selfishness. I know there is something fundamentally wrong with me. I know  nothing excuses me. I know the absolute worst thing I could ever do is pass this on to loved ones. And yet, it's the only answer that works for me. I think I have to make it look like an accident.
