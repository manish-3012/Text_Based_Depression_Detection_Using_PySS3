Just feel like I am trapped...I am surrounded by friends who love me and family who supports me, yet I feel constantly sad and I just don't know if I can carry on. The world feels like it is crashing down and I just want all this pain to be over. I don't know what to do and I just want some help please anyone I just need to talk to someone
