I've thought about it before, and I am losing my mind.So lets get to the point about somethings. 

1. Here recently I have just found out that my father took photos of me when I was sleeping, and taken photos of my ass when I was younger. With these facts and the fact that he is always trying to give me things. Makes me think that there was a good chance that something has happened. I have completely cut my father out of my life. 

2. My grandmother, that is more of a mother, is dying. She has dementia.

3. I just recently lost my job to Sexual harassment,  Which by all means I was joking around with another guy, and he knew that I was. Which doesn't matter, I am fired, and now have a black mark on my record in the work industry. 

3. I completely hate most, myself being the most hated. 

4. All of my friends have moved away, their in the military. I was in but got discharged for medical reasons, It was my dream and it got ripped away.

5. I still live at home with my parents (age 22), I don't get any respect from my mother, or her husband.

I know its not the answer, but I am utterly alone where I am at. I try to call my best friends for help, and they are busy so I don't bother them with it. I am asking for help. I hate asking for help. I am losing my mind. I know that my life isn't hard by any means.
