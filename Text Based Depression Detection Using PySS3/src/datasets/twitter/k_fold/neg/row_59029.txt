I have posted here so many times and no one ever responds.I've been suicidal off and on for about 6 months now. The only thing that was keeping me on track was my husband. 

I don't trust him anymore. I'll be honest, most of the times I've thought about doing it it was partly hoping I would survive or that someone would notice that I had done it and then would actually pay attention - whether I died or not.

Today, I am actually convinced that I want to die. If I fail in my attempt, my family will just have more shit to use against me. And this world is too fucked up anyway.

The most fucked up thing is I'm really religious. I've prayed a bunch of times and god has made things better, but i know I need to die. Plenty of good people kill themselves, I"m not even worried about going to Hell anymore. The only thing that matters is that other people are not inconvenienced by me and my pain anymore.

I've had so many betrayals, and my husband's betrayal is the last straw.  I'm fucked for how I'm going to do it because i live in a country where it's hard to get a hold of an exit kit. i also kind of want to do it so that they don't know it's a suicide. I know that's kind of a holy grail, not making it look like a suicide. Hard to do. especially here, the police will not give me a proper burial if it's suicide so I'm kind of stuck.  I could go back to my home country and do it there, but i don't really want to lie to any of my friends and give them the bother of having to deal with the aftermath.

if someone picked me up from the airport i probably wouldn't be convincing enough that i wasn't going to do anything 'stupid.'

I'm finally done with the pain. Nothing will get better, i trusted my husband, he betrayed me, he has no time for me and i'm a burden to him.

i'm going to get a small cord and put it around my neck. i can do this. i have a cord and a plastic bag. 

i'm finished.
