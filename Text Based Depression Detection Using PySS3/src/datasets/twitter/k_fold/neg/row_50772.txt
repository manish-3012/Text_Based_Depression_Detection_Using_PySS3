Hi, well, i need help...Hi guys and galls,
lemme tell you the story that is my shit life, so here it is:

I was struggling with obesity from a very young age. 
In kindergarten everybody was making fun of me every single day.
This carried on to school where this happened again.
I just finished eighth grade with a pretty bad score. I dont think i will get into the highschool that i want.
I have no friends. My mom hates me, my dad left when i was 12 because of me and my only living relative that is left on this stupid earth is my grandmom witch thinks im evil because im gay and says i will go to hell for that.

I really dont know what to do. 
Help me...
