I'm ending it in less than a week.I want to end things Saturday night, once I've fulfilled all my social obligations for the weekend.

Feelings of loneliness and self-loathing have gotten to a really bad point and I feel like it's my only option. I've tried being a good person and to be kind to others, thinking it will make me feel better. Unfortunately it doesn't. No matter what I've done or who I help out, I will never see myself as good. I will never feel like I did good enough in school or in life. To put it simply, I absolutely hate myself and I think other people dislike me as well. 

The only thing I see in the cards for me is a future of scrambling to build my reputation in the corporate world, living alone in an apartment with very little sleep and company/friends. This idea scares the living shit out of me and I am less than 2 years away from this reality.

The only thing keeping me somewhat in check is going to the gym and video games, but those are giving back diminishing returns now. 

I'm going to write some letters to friends, family, etc to explain that it isn't their fault. Hopefully this won't be too big of a hassle for my roommates, I'm pretty replaceable.

Had to get this off my chest before actually doing anything, so thanks for reading. 

P.S. I wish you all the best in the fight with your own personal demons, there are many of you who are strong, even if you don't know it.
