If I had one person in my life I could tell I wanted to kill myself, I probably wouldnâ€™t need to do itI wish there was someone in my life I could relate to. Iâ€™m not close to anyone. All of today Iâ€™ve thought about killing myself, but also how much I want someone to talk to me so I wonâ€™t. 

I turned my phone off and asked god/the universe to help me. If Iâ€™m meant to live, you have an hour for someone to contact me. I turned it on an hour later, and, no surprise, no one had said a thing. 

I just wish there was someone I could go to.
