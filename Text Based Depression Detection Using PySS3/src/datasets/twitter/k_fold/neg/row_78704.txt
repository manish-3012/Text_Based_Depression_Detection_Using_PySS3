Not feeling too good...I honestly just think it'd be better if I wasn't here. The racing thoughts, the confusion, the heartache. It would all be gone. And it would be so easy. I just wanted a break and I never got it. I need one and it seems like this may be the only way I'm going to get it. In the end, it will be for the best.
