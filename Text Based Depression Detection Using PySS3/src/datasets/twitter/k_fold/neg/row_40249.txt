I didnâ€™t want to post because I didnâ€™t want to seem like I was looking for attention. I really just wanted a place to talk where I wasnâ€™t known. I really only see suicide as the answer. Iâ€™m 18 and I feel like itâ€™s the only solution. My mum is an alcoholic and he only reason Iâ€™m still here isbecause I have to take care of my little sister which is rly the own thing keeping me here.
