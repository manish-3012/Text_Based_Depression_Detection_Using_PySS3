went to therapy for the first time this morning, yet tonight has been the worst night yetidk what to expect out of posting here right now, but i just need someone to tell about how i'm feeling. today has been such an emotional rollercoaster that i know is going to continue for several weeks ahead, and at this rate, i dont see myself being able to cope with this for much longer. my family is a mess and i wish there was just an easy way out of my shitty situation, but there's not. i've always been too afraid to kill myself, but tonight has been on an entirely different level. i'm genuinely fearing for my own life, yet the other option is becoming increasingly more welcoming at this point, and i know that is a contradiction, but i dont know how else to describe it.
