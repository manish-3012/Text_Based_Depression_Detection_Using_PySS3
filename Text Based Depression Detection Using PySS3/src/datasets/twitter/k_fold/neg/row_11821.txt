Just saying goodbye I guess...to anyone who will listen. Too alone for too longSo I'm probably going to take a large mixture of pills (trying to get some sleeping pills so fingers crossed) and wash it down with either alcohol or a bottle of nyquil. I have the letter I'm just trying to pick a date now. 

Anyways, I have never had a long-term relationship (23M) and it doesn't seem like it's gonna happen. My longest one was 6 months and she dumped me. Thought I had another girl who was into me, she dumped me after two months. It's been a year since I've been in a relationship and before you say anything, I know it won't solve all my problems. I get it. 

I feel like I'm getting older and I already feel so old at 23 and everybody around me seems happy and they're pairing off and making plans and I'm just here cutting myself and mourning over a girl who lost her feelings for me. The pain is just too much, guys. I feel like if it doesn't happen now, it will never happen. I'm a loser and seeing other people in couples and my friends with bf/gf makes me more depressed. I'm on dating sites but I get like no matches. Plus, the girl that wants nothing to do with me after a few dates? We met on Tinder. My heart is just fucking done. 
There's a bridge in my town I may choose instead but I'm debating that (water vs. pavement). 

Just thought I'd get this off my chest. 6 months is just pathetic. I'm pathetic. I just feel so alone. Love I guess was never meant for me but for other people. 

See you on the other side.
