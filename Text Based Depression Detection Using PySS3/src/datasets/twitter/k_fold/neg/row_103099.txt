Should I tell my new girlfriend about my suicide attempts?Met a girl, we hit it off and we've been officially going out for about a week. Now I hate sharing my mental health issues (depression, suicidal thoughts, 2 attempts) because they always kill the mood, present me as weak and change people's opinions of me. I'd say I'm in a better place now - good habits, healthy ways to cope,  so I haven't had an urge to kill myself in more than 2 months. I've mentioned to her that when left alone for too long I become depressed, but that's it. Should I sit her down and tell her the entire deal or? I'm scared of scaring her away.
