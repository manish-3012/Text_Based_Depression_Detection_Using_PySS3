When I look at how badly my hair is thinking, it really pushes me towards suicideLike just before I wasn't thinking about it at all, but then after I showered and saw how much hair fell out and how thin it looks when it's wet, I really just have a feeling that I can't deal with this. The thought of no longer being physically attractive to anyone anymore and no longer even looking like my youthful self is soul crushing. I can't take this, really. And what makes it worse is how pathetic everyone else thinks I am for being so affected by something like this. The idea that a guy past the age of 30 still wants and expects to feel physically attractive is so bizzare to everyone and that is why I get not sympathy, even from my closest friends. Nothing recently has pushed me into it as hard as this is right now.
