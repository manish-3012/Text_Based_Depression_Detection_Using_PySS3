I want to let go.Ive always had a good resilience when it comes to my emotions. But this past month, Im becoming more and more insecure about my career and life choices. To the point where everyday I wake up with anxiety that Ill never be capable of fixing things or its too late to fix things. Btw Im 23M turning 24 in Jan. Its become a constantly me talking to myself like "You can still fix your life its either, this, that but if nothing goes well end your life".

Ending my life has come up so many times since September that its become almost my end goal. At one point I decided to end my live on Oct 5. I had everything ready, from notes for each of my family, method to a video of me explaining why I did. But everytime my friends and brother would ask me out and it makes me appreciate them and life more. But once its over those thoughts return and remind me that those are just temporary relief. Ever since Ive been on and off about it because my close friends and brother and mutual friends keep pulling me in. Since meeting them they know me as someone who has a clear and strong mind, in control of my emotions and incapable of suicide. But when I am left on my own with my thoughts, I cant help but feel little, useless and insecure. I want to let go of myself from my inner troubles but at the same time I feel theyre so involved with my life that itll feel betrayal. Like where did all this come from.

I feel like they wasted their time getting to know me and getting involved with me. Its becoming this cycle where I need to push them away for a couple weeks so I can kill myself and they wont have to go through the trouble of being "involved" or like think about what they did or would have done you know. Letting go just seems like the only right answer for me. Waiting for a better day is just so much trouble. I dont know where to start.
