Iâ€™m going to end it soonI talked my boyfriend down from suicide today for the fourth or fifth time. He wants to hang himself, he told me he hates me and that heâ€™s leaving me forever. He tries to push me away so I wonâ€™t care about him when heâ€™s dead but I wonâ€™t let him hurt himself. I talk him down and tell him life will get better for us, we moved across the country and we have no friends and both work dead end jobs with debt. Iâ€™m struggling to get through school iâ€™m too much of an anxious mess. It amazes me how well I talk my boyfriend down when I want to kill myself more than anything in the world. I lie to him and tell him everythingâ€™s going to be ok but really I know weâ€™re both probably fucked. Heâ€™s laying next to me asleep, I got him to come home and I comforted him and cuddled him until he fell asleep. Iâ€™m not going to sleep all night and iâ€™m tempted to go jump off a bridge or hang myself. I probably wonâ€™t do it tonight but I have plans to do it soon. I pretend to be strong all the time but itâ€™s all fake, i was put on earth to suffer. I know my death will be suicide
