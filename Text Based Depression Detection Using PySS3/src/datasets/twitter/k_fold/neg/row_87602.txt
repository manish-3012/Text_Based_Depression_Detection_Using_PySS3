I am probably killing myself tomorrowJust like the title says. I'm done, I've failed in every possible way and every time I tried to reach for help, it went worse. People deserve to not have me around being shit. I don't want to keep going and suffering like that. Nothing works. I've tried so many things and nothing worked. I'm done. I already have a plan and I'm executing it tomorrow.

I don't want to say goodbye to the few people who care about me, I've bothered them too much. It's not and tomorrow, I'll stop living and suffering. This will be for the best.
