I just want to die so bad.The only thing I ever think about these days is suicide. I just don't even care about living anymore. I feel so amazing just thinking about ending the neverending pain and just being done with it all. I almost attempted it yesterday and feel so disappointed after finding out that there was no ammo in the gun I was gonna use. I want to die in a fairly painless and instant way but I am all out of ideas on how I can. And no, I'm not going to rethink this I've already made up my mind.
