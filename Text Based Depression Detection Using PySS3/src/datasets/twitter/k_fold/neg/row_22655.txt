I can't do this anymoreI'm an outcast no matter how much I improve. Nobody likes me for who I am. Nobody even supports me to continue living life. I've been told to kill myself intentionally multiple times and I honestly believe it's true at this point. I can't make friends or even get a girlfriend and that lead to my social anxiety being developed. I get bullied based on my appearance, on my personality, and people just despise me in general. I can't keep living when all I ever did was try to be nice. I've tried turning the other cheek and people still despise me. I guess I honestly am that terrible. I try making friends and people just ignore me as if I don't exist. Life gets in my way intentionally to stop me from having a good life. I can't survive any longer. I'm about ready to go through with it and no one is there to stop me.
