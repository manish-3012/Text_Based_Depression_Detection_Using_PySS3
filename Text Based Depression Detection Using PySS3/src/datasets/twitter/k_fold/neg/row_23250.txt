I don't really know what to say anymoreI want to vent, I want to rant, but I have no idea what about. I don't really have much to say. I don't even know how to feel, or if I'm even feeling at all.

At this point it'd be obscure to even call me alive. It took me a while to notice, but I died a long time ago. I'm basically just a walking corpse waiting to be cast out of existence. Or at least that's the best way I can explain it.
