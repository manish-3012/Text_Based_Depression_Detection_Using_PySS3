It can get better.Hi all. My name is Dan, and I have posted here before.
On my way home today I thought it may be a good idea to help others and explain my story.

I had posted here around 9 months ago, with the following post:

I felt really awful about things going on in my life, and didn't really feel like doing much about it. I just felt like I was going nowhere and I behaved as such. Isolating myself from everyone, not talking to people, acting mopey etc.

After some talking with someone from SW and others. I had then taken the step to visit a councillor and try to see if it would help with my problems. Also around this time, I took up doing my favourite sports again (something I had stopped a long time ago) and began talking to a friend of a friend.

As time went on, that friend become an important part in helping me feel better and be able to put that smile back on my face.

On reflection on things. They have gotten significantly better in the time since I had spoken to the councillor and taken the steps to improve myself, even if before that, I felt like it was going to be a useless waste of time and that I couldn't pull myself from it.

Next time you think that things can't get better for you, they really can, and your life can be significantly better for you if you take the time and the steps to help yourself! I cannot stress this enough. It was hard enough for me to just "take a night off" from work, as I was just using it as a shield for my own unhappiness even though it was killing me to keep working.

Since all of those events had occurred, things have picked up so much. From talking to that friend, things between us have sprouted, and now we're currently in a rather happy

She wants to be a councillor when she graduates so I had the suggestion to her to help out the people in this and the /r/depression subreddit so that she can help people. She frequently checks this and the /r/ depression subreddit.

I thank her, and everyone here, for all the great and amazing work you all do. It helps improve peoples lives, as it definitely helped me! Keep fighting the good fight! 

For everyone struggling at the moment, I have to say this:

It gets better. You may not see it now. You may not even see it in the near future, but you WILL see it. Just keep fighting. You'll be all the better for it when you find that happiness. We all love you. &lt;3
