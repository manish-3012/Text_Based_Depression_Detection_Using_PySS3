I went From Having an Amazing Life To NothingMy life was amazing, i had everything someone could have wished for, i was completely content, sure i wasnt perfect but it worked and i was so happy.

i'm 17 at the moment soon to be 18. 

I had so many friends, i was popular, i hung out with my friends, school was great, i was good at sports, had great family relationship, i was strong, i had everything.

I would hangout with my friends, i was going to the gym, i was making lots of money ( even at 16! ) i was just so happy, nothing could make me upset. I was untouchable, or so i thought.

In 2 months that went to absolutely nothing ( happened in December for 2016 ), it's been the same thing for 20months and counting(sadly) 

When i was 16, in school we had a lesson on depression, at the time i didnt understand what depression was since NOTHING would make me upset, i was ontop of the world. 

The last 20months have been the worst, i havent seen anyone apart from my mum, dad and my doctor in 20months. I havent been outside of the house apart from doctors appointments

I literally have nothing, i dont speak to any of my friends, i CANT go out, i cant do sports, i speak to my mum and dad for 30seconds a day 

I went from having the perfect life anyone could have asked for, to cutting myself and hoping to die. I wish there was an easy way out of life, but sadly it's hard. Wow, life changes fast. 

Sad thing is, all of this is unchangable and it CANT get better, people say "it gets better" well for my case it cant sadly. 

Please don't take you're life for granted, i wish i hadn't.
