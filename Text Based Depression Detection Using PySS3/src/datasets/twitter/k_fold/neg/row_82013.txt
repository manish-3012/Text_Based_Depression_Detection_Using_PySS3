I'm going to do it tomorrow.Hi, I can't beleive i'm even writing this, but I am doing this so people in my posistion understand that it gets no better...I am 16 years of age, and have been miserable for years. Why? For various reasons, I have never had a girlfriend...

and even if I did have one, my dick is too small, I would be far too terrified to get in bed with her, which is sad because all of my friends have girlfriends and have sex constantly, it shows no signs of growing larger either...I do have a lot of friends, but all of them better looking than me, I am fat and ugly, have bad hair but I spend Â£500+  a month on clothes just in hopes some girl will notice and love me. I am lonely...all thought I go out I feel detached from the world, and i'm so self conscious and anxious its absolutely ridiculous, I walk around hiding my face. 

I don't know what to do anymore, everything I do ends miserably, there is no happiness, my parents don't have a clue either, and they are the only reasons I havent killed myself, until now...I will write a note for my mother to read so she knows it was for the better.

And even with all the anxiety aside, there is guilt, I have done something horrible, something I cannot tell anybody...I haven't harmed or affected anybody, just saying...but I can't live with the guilt of what i've done either, it eats away at me.

Who ever is reading this right now even thinks i'm a fucking scumbag, attention seeker etc...but we'll see. Everybody has always called me a coward, but i'll show them tommorow I promise that.


So I have no body to love, I feel like my family dislikes me, I have serious guilt, I have no qualifications and am going no where in life, it's time I did it, i'm fucking terrified of dying, but I can gain eternal peace for only a few moments of suffering, sounds like a bargain.
