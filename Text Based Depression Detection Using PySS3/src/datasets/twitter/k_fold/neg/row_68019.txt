Just need to let it out.These past few weeks my have been terrible. Something just feels off. My mind feels foggy and every day I feel like I wake up with a new ache somewhere in my body. I canâ€™t sleep. Iâ€™m constantly tired. The things that used to excite me and give me a special feeling inside just feel like tasks now. I donâ€™t play video games anymore and I love video games. I donâ€™t even like talking to girls anymore. I just sit on my phone mindlessly scrolling. My head just doesnâ€™t feel right. I feel like thereâ€™s something wrong with me physically and mentally. I have no confidence in anything I do anymore. I have no passion and no drive. I canâ€™t focus. Iâ€™m just fighting through everyday trying to get to the next. The worst part is Iâ€™m starting my junior year of high school, my most important year and Iâ€™m not starting it off very good because I donâ€™t feel any reason to try, even though I know there is. Thereâ€™s so much pressure and it just makes everything worse. I want to be successful and I think about it in my mind but I can never bring myself to really try. I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone about it because Iâ€™m always smiling and joking on the outside and I donâ€™t think anyone will believe me. I just want a break from everything because I donâ€™t know if I can do this anymore. I feel like my world is crumbling around me and Iâ€™m not doing anything about it. I used to always think suicide was stupid and selfish but right now the idea of a break from this pain is really appealing. Iâ€™m not planning to kill myself but everyday I think about it a little more.
