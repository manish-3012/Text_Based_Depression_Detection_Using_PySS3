FantasyIâ€™ve had this very specific fantasy for quite awhile now, even before my life was shit honestly, but lately I find myself imagining it and yearning for it more and more: 

I have a very average day. Nothing really happens, good or bad. The most forgettable day possible. In the late afternoon I get in my car and just pick a direction and drive. It might be deep into a desert, or far into a forest, or up to the top of a mountain. Just somewhere far away from all other people, away from lights and sounds and â€œthe world.â€ I roll to a stop at some point, I donâ€™t even really notice that Iâ€™ve done it but Iâ€™m just there alone wherever Iâ€™ve gone. The windows are rolled down and I can hear the quietness all around. I just sit and escape into that subtle nothing for awhile. And as the sun goes below the horizon just before it gets too dark, I put on a specific playlist Iâ€™ve made (I have it and listen to it a lot when I fantasize). I put a needle in my arm and give myself enough opiate to never wake up and I drift away right there and then. Not because Iâ€™m hurt, or sad, or angry. 
Just because I want to.
