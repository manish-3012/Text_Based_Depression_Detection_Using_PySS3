I donâ€™t feel right, I have it good but it feels terribleI just graduated from high school almost a year from now and I feel like absolute shit, I was a average Grade level student  and I have a very small friend group (edgy kids), I also have autism but Iâ€™m not some window licker,I canâ€™t find a job either because Iâ€™m too lazy or no one wants me-I have four best friends and they mean the world to me Iâ€™d do anything for them-but Iâ€™m the butt of every joke and my jokes arenâ€™t funny to any of them(at least they lead me to believe) we talk on messenger but sometimes we get together-but Jesus Christ I feel like absolute shit. I have a girlfriend and itâ€™s been 2 years (anniversary was like a month ago) and she comforts me but nothing feels right. Iâ€™m not the best at describing stuff since my way of thinking is different and shit but itâ€™s agonizing thinking that my friend pool either hates me or only puts up with me due to pity. Sometimes i wonder ( Ik original words ) how much do I impact people on their lives, Ik the memes â€œmom would be sadâ€ â€œdog wouldnâ€™t understandâ€ I donâ€™t want to be a edgelord, but I wonder who really cares about me-every time I go back and think about the events I do it seems melancholy, i wonâ€™t kill myself I have it too good to do it, only things keeping me afloat is JoJos Bizarre Adventure, my girlfriend, and my friend pool. 


Long story short: Autismo feels like shit for no reason
