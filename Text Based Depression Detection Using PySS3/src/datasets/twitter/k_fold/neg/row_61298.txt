I want to die because I'm not successfulAnd I blame it on my parents. I was an honor student back in high school. Managed to pass the entrance exams to the most prestigious university in my country! Too bad my parents can't afford my college. In my country, it is part of the culture that the parents pay for the child's education. We have no student loans here like in first world countries.

So, I was stuck on minimum wage jobs since I have no college education. Add to that, I wasn't able to save money to go back to college because I have to give most of my minimum wage salary to my mother since my father died. 31 years old now, still a loser. Whenever I think of how it would have been if I had been able to enter that university, if only my parents didn't decide to have four children who they cannot provide for (by the way, all of their children they weren't able to send to college), I just want to end it. It'll be my "fuck you, this is your fault" to my mom and to my dead dad.

I realize I sound even more of a loser for blaming my parents for my misfortunes but that's just how I feel. And I don't mind being called a loser. Heck, I call myself a loser. I have no pride left in me after all these years of being broke, doing minimum wage work while all my former classmates are now managers, supervisors, department heads. If I had done anything worthwhile in this life, it is that I had been there for my friends in times of need. However, I have no hope of reaching my potential now, society gives opportunities to the young, not to people like me.
