If none of us actually gave a fuck, I think we'd all be fine.Wouldn't it be awesome if we could all just say fuck it and move on from what was bothering us or making us feel that bad that we actually frequent this subreddit?

I honestly feel for everyone on here, every time I feel like I'm close to crawling out my god damn reality / fucked up brain drags me back in. I really hope that one day, we can all be selfish bastards and live for ourselves and have the fucking best time ever. Keep fighting the good fight people, take each day as it comes and just keep going. If you get the chance to do something you want to do, just say fuck it and do it. Think that's what I'm going to do, it's getting to that point where I'm past giving a shit.
