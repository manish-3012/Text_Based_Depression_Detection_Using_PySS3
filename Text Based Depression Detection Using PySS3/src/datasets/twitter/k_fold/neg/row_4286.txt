I'm doing my best to hold onto life, but feel I'm losing grip.I posted a couple of days ago, so I feel awkward for making another one, but my mood is spinning out of control, it's completely insane. I keep hurting myself by getting into these arguments on reddit, and expressing these controversial opinions, but I don't know how to make myself stop, I've lost all self control.

I get so angry at myself, the people I argue with, and just the whole world in general, that I get into these episodes of self harm and temptation to kill myself. I feel like I have to hold myself back, like holding back a dog trying to attack someone.

I'm so tired of this shit I do to myself, and the world that is beginning to look so ugly, I try to be a nice person, and be positive to those around me, but I can't take it because I'm just so exhausted of the crap.

I don't think I can last another day like this, it might end up going bad really soon.
