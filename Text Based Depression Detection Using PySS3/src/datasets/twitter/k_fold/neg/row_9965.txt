Throwaway because I deserve to die.I a 24 year old male was raped by an attractive woman in my university my sophomore year. 


After it happened I dropped out of school and couldnâ€™t explain to my parents why I came home why I was so unmotivated. 

the people I told my story to couldnâ€™t believe a black guy in the military could be taken advantage of by a petite white woman.

Today while getting out the shower I noticed a single red bump in my genital area I had shaved the area a few days ago so I figured it couldâ€™ve been a razor bump.

Iâ€™ve been disgusted with my body since the assault happened so Iâ€™ve avoided sex since &amp; Iâ€™ve gone from weighing 130 pounds to weighing 162.8 lbs and ordering takeout nearly every night eating the pain away.

After a drunk night and letting my anxiety get the best of me I decided to become a webmd doctor and self diagnose myself and the bump on my penis looks like it could be herpes.

Iâ€™m so afraid to get myself checked because if itâ€™s herpes my life will be ruined Iâ€™ll never have a normal life again no man or woman will want me &amp; Iâ€™ll be forced to be alone.

Iâ€™m already a college dropout on the way to 25 years old unemployed 

At this point Iâ€™m a failure in life and when I get the balls to get checked out if it turns out he herpes or something incurable I believe the best course of action is to immediately remove myself from the gene pool and get rid of this disease the only way I know possible and kill myself.

No one deserves to live like this &amp; no one deserves to get this.
