If i fail im gonna kill myselfIm currently in a fairly prestigious college, paying my own tuition and basically being compeltely independant because my family fucking sucks. I used my perfectionism to get into the school, but my financial situation might force me to have to drop out. I look at my peers from hs who didnt even bother in hs and now live with their parents and do nothing and I wonder how they deal with themselves. If i have to drop out of school i think i will kill myself. I've been depressed and dealing with ocd and anorexia for years. College is my last attempt at obtaining a better future for myself, and if i fail at that i'm scared at the thought of what i would do.
