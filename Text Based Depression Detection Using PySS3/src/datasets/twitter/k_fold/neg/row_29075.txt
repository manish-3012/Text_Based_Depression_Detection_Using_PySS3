I hate how I lookI have horrible body dis morphia or what ever it's called I'm guessing. 
I can't afford therapy and I going to the ER does not help. 
How do people get over this without therapy? 
I'm doing really bad. The past 2-3 days have been like before when I try to kill myself. 
How do people get over the way they look? People just tell me to stop caring. How? I can't just stop breathing if you tell me to. I know it will take years and years of therapy and I would do that if I could. If you don't have that option what else is there to do. I don't want to kill myself over this but it's all I can think about.
