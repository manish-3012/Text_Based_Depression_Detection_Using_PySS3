My life sucksI just turned 20 and I still feel like a teenager. I have severe social anxiety so many things that should be simple is hard for me. I donâ€™t have a job and I stay in my house all day. I donâ€™t really have friends anymore. I havenâ€™t hung out with my friends since January. (No one makes an effort to hang out anyway) 

I stay up late every night (itâ€™s 4am) and I cry about life. I truly have no purpose. I am just living but for what???

No one would care if I died. Iâ€™m getting older and it sucks. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Iâ€™m behind in college because of my social anxiety and Iâ€™m dreading this upcoming school year.  I should be working and hanging out with friends all the time but no. I am just in my house all day. I just want to give up. No one cares about me anyway besides my family. I donâ€™t know why I was born like this, social anxiety is a CURSE
