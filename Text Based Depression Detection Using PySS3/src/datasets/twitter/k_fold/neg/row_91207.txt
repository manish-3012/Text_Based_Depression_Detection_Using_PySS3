Close to the endI don't want to die. I've tried so many medications, exercise, mindfulness, in patient admission, rTMS. None of them work and I'm getting worse all the time. I'm still working. I can function with even severe depression but it's now beyond severe, it's in another realm entirely.

It's so easy for people to tell you to hang in there. Somebody told me to be patient once. I asked if they'd submit themselves to a small experiment and they agreed. I bent their thumb back, not too hard but hard enough to cause a reasonable amount of pain (of course making sure I didn't cause any damage). I asked them what they would do if I told them they had to endure that indefinitely. They told me they couldn't.

Severe depression isn't physical pain but I've experienced both and it's no easier to tolerate. But there are no painkillers for depression. Antidepressants? Don't work for me. Exercise? Helps a bit for a short while. There are things which alleviate depression without fail. Benzos, opiates, alcohol. None are viable in the long term.

I just can't keep going. Time to call it quits I think. All I look forward to is going to sleep and the worst part of my day is waking up. I hope that death is as I imagine, an eternal dreamless sleep. It doesn't seem good but doesn't seem so bad either.
