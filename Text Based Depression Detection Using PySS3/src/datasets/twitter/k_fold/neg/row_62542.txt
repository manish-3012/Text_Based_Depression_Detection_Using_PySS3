ConfusedHi. It's easier to say this through a phone than to my therapist so thanks for reading if anyone does. Sorry if this doesn't belong here.

I'm really confused lately. I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder a few months ago once I was finally able to admit that I'm not normal and my life was affecting the things and people I love. I've been on medicine for a couple months now and things had been going great.

This last week has been a nightmare. I'm so easy to.set off and I don't even know why. I try to stop myself from getting angry but I can't and I hate it.

Lately I've been thinking about how if I were to just end it it would be better for him because he could come home to peace and quiet and not being screamed at and my dogs could play without me getting annoyed over nothing.

I know I have my good moments but those bad ones are so awful I hate making anyone live with them.

I just hate myself and wish my medicine was working better and that I could give people better lives with me even if it means it's without me.

Thanks for letting me vent...
