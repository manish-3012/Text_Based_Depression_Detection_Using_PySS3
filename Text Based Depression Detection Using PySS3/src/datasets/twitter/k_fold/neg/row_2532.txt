I Fucked UpI fucked up, I am failing my classes, my gf might be pregnant and no real future ahead of me. I am thinking about ending it. I keep having the thought that everything will be over once I do it and I wont have to worry about anything else. I keep thinking that it'd be so easy, just one pull of the trigger and all the pain is gone. I don't know what to do and I am running out of hope.
