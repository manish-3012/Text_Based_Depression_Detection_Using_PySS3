Itâ€™s all a stupid jokeIâ€™m at a point where I really donâ€™t see anything in life worth living for. All of it is so pathetic. A society full of fake people trying to step on each other to get ahead. Families where abuse runs rampant because they can get away with it. Every relationship regardless of the kind, consists of a parasitic taker and a sad pathetic pushover giver. Itâ€™s a world full of sadistic predators and weak prey. And worst of all everyone likes to lie about our reality because it makes us feel good to think of ourselves as a species as better, to give people the benefit of the doubt because we like that delusion. I know that when I die, people wonâ€™t give a shit, the narcissists in my family will use this as a golden opportunity to suck pity out of everyone around and gain attention. They will bad mouth me to elevate themselves, they will say I was mentally unstable and deny all theyâ€™re sadistic abuse, all the while cry about it and pretend theyâ€™re good people. My abusive ex will get the ultimate ego hard on from it, â€œoh wow she was so crazy over my godliness she committed suicide, I must be amazingâ€ But I cant even bring myself to care about any of that. Existence is such a gross pathetic joke. Why are we all even here
