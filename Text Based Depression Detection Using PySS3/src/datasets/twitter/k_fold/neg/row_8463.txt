overwhelmed, mostly.Iâ€™m so tired. Lately, it hurts more than it did on the beginning. The first week, then the first month, it all felt like a horrible mistake. But now I know itâ€™s real, that heâ€™ll never come back. The realization of that has been hitting me so hard right now, itâ€™s like another layer of shock melted away. It feels so raw, the grief is driving me insane. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m so unstable right now but I donâ€™t really have anywhere to go.
