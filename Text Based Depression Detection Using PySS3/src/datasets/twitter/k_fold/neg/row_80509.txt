I don't know what to do anymore.My life the past few years has been like some fucked up sad movie. My parents both had cancer at the same time when I was sixteen. I have no siblings and my extended family is basically non-existent. After a year of chemotherapy and surgery, my mom went into remission for few months, and then she died. 

It's been nearly two years since she passed and I'm still not okay. I've failed so many college classes that I know I should be able to pass. I'm angry, bitter, and so incredibly exhausted all the time. If I killed myself, I would kill my dad too. I'm all he has left and I feel so guilty for even thinking about suicide.
