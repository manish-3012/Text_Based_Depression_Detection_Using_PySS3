hi.so this is the subreddit where you write when you wanna kill yourself. so hi.
i'm 15 and i live in japan. i don't have abusive parents, but my dad passed away a couple years ago. but i don't think i was close enough to him to feel sad about it. I just felt numb. I don't get bullied, or anything, so i have no reason to feel this empty. i know! it's pathetic. 
i've always felt so....sad. like, for fucks sake, people are dying and in war and all i can think about is how sad i feel. i've always hated about how selfish i am. and how I just make it harder for everyone around me. yes, i know i'm 15, and it's someday gonna get better. let's be real, there's no certainty that it will. i'm so tired. i feel like there's no point in doing anything anymore. i could just leave in the middle of class and walk to a station and jump in front of a train tomorrow. the only think that's stopping me is my mom. and sometimes, i'm not sure she even cares. but i'm not that cruel of a person to do that to her. and that's all i've been thinking about the past couple of months. and before that, the drawer full of pills. i sound pathetic. I'm sorry
