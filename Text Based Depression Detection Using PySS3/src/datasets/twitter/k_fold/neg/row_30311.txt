I should have ended years ago. I could have solved so many problems.I realized if I killed myself, in a sick way, family would come closer and maybe the friends I used to have would have realized my isolation. Maybe I couldâ€™ve brought out tensions with family, solves shit with my own death. But no, I couldnâ€™t do it because I kept thinking about the ones who look up to me. 
I canâ€™t imagine the pain they wouldâ€™ve felt if I killed myself. 

But Iâ€™m sick, and I still feel that my death can solve these tensions. I was ready to meet my maker. But I was also weak.

I donâ€™t feel strong for posting any of this, I am here because I am weak.
