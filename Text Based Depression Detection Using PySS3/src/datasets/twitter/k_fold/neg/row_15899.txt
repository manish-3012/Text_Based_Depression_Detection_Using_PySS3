what's the less "suicidy" way to commit suicide?like refusing cancer treatment. or that pastor who gave up his oxygen tank to a young kid who needed it. or eating a certain food that they pulled back because they discovered some cancer causing stuff in it. what else you got?

i'm scared to commit direct blatant suicide.
