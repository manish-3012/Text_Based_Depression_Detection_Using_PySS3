My best friends brother killed himself last night. How do I help herLast night one of my closest friends older brother killed himself. She was at college and went back home to her parents and the rest of her family (9hrs) . I feel for her and her pain as I've lost a classmate to suicide before but this felt way more personal. I want to help her and all anyone tells me is I just have to be there for her but I feel like I want to do more. She's one of the few people I've truly connected with at college and I just don't even know what to say. I managed to find her this morning before she left and hugged her while she cried. She was normally such a strong person I've never seen her even get close to a year let alone this. And all I could do is listen and dry her tears. How am I supposed to say things will be okay? What do I say to her to help? I hate seeing my friends like this. Any advice would be appreciated
