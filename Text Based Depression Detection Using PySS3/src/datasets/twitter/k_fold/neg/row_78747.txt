helpiam having strong suicidal urges for over 2 years now. my family doesnt know about it and this depressed mindset is preventing me from doing anything productive in life. iam currently looking for a fulltime job but that doesn't work out im also doing webdevolopment on the side(making website for small businesses etc). Every night there are strong negative emotions and those give me a feeling of shame, disgust and self-hatred. through out the day my mind is wandering and im daydreaming heavily. One week im feeling great and the other week i want to just end my life because i dont see any meaning or progress in it. I know that when i will be having a fulltime job this urges won't disappear because i had them when my life was "normal". I had friends and lost contact to all of them. I've recently met a girl but that is making the situation worse. Im reading much and trying to learn new things but that doesnt help me neither. I have problem focusing on tasks that are important for me im straight up a mess. there is alot more. if this keeps going im going to end my life. I just wanted to put this out. thanks for reading.
