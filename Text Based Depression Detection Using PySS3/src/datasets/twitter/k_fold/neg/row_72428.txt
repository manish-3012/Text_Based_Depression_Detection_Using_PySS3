Im just waiting for the right timeIm sick of having ocd. Its making my life a living hell. I cannot take one more day of it. I cry every day because of my intrusive thoughts. Logically I know its just ocd but it doesnt make it any easier. I have a foolproof method and its just a matter of time. My husband hates me. My kids don't need me. Im ready to die. Yeah I've posted here before so idk what I expect from posting again. No one gives a shit.
