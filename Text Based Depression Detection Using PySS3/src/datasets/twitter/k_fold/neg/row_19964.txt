Fucked up everything good in my lifeMy depression/anxiety has really been getting in my way the past few years. Itâ€™s gotten much worse recently and I donâ€™t think I can take it anymore. I feel so terribly alone, I donâ€™t have my best friend/gf to talk to anymore bc I fucked everything up with her. She was the only person I truly opened up to. Now it seems like Iâ€™m all on my own when I desperately need someone. I spent my whole life trying to handle all my problems on my own when people tried to help, and now I donâ€™t even have anyone. I constantly think about how much easier things would be if I didnâ€™t have such bad mental health issues. I wouldnâ€™t have hurt anyone, I would have been able to lighten the mood instead of killing it, I would have had the one thing Iâ€™ve wanted all my life: happiness. I had it, but I fucked it all up. I really tried, but I donâ€™t think I can do it anymore.
