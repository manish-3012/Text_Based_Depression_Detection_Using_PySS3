I know there are good things about me but i feel worthless...I'm a 25 year old guy and I've knowingly had depression since I was 17.

As a child I was pretty smart and gifted and then gave up at school aged 8 when my parents divorced. I lived with my mum and step-dad, who she left my dad for, and used to be beaten if i ever disagreed. Throughout school i was bullied and didn't ever really have many friends. I somehow managed to be really successful at school and went to uni without ever trying.

I went to uni and instantly it hit me. I was alone in a hall of 12 people who were mostly foreign exchange students who had no interest in doing anything and stuck to their close groups. Two people in my flat tried to kill themselves and i did too. I tried to go out on my own and meet people but I got harassed and touched up by a guy the first time and felt so low that nobody would talk to me the second time. After trying to kill myself and being unable to sleep for five days, i had help through a psychiatrist, doctor, counsellor and early intervention team. But it didnt change how i felt. I ended up quitting uni.

I've had three relationships. All three cheated on me and broke me. I still have nightmares about one of them. In the last two years nobody has been interested in me because I'm average attractiveness and I've been interested in one person and that's only because ive had to work with them...

I have no friends anymore. The handful of friends i have are in relationships or have moved abroad and don't respond to my messages.

I have such low self esteem but i know that i am a great person. I have lots of talents, im lucky to be fairly intelligent, i work out and have a decent paying job, but i feel so worthless.

My family are just there. My friends don't exist anymore. I'm not an option to any girls. I'm just a tool at work. I feel like a ghost and i know that i can get through this because i have done already, but i don't see the point in life when I'm forever miserable. I want to die.

I'm sorry for the long post/walls of text/too much information...
