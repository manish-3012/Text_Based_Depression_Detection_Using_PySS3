I used to live off self pity, but there's nothing less to pityMy 23rd Birthday is a few days away, and I feel more and more sick about it everyday. A few years ago I accepted I was a very unattractive person. I have a very weird face. It still hurt as I was the only one of my friends who had never had any kind of relationship with anyone. But it was bearable, because I could fall back on the 'It's not my fault I'm ugly, I'm a nice person inside.' and I could cry for an hour or so and move on, but I can't do that anymore. I've been told by lots of people I'm an aggressive, argumentative person. I have both a shitty appearance and a shitty personality. There's no 'but what about' thing to lean on. I spend most of my free time doing absolutely nothing. It just feels like there's no escape. Music is now just noise, nothing else. My old interest, History, has been sucked out of me. I have to force myself to pretend to be interested. I just want everything to reset and to let me figure out what went wrong. I haven't had a conversation with another person in nearly 3 weeks now. I just want to be alone, while also being lonely. I don't know how to describe it. I used to take long walks to clear my head, but they don't do anything, so I now just walk for 2 or 3 hours to exhaust myself so I can sleep. And I know this sounds pathetic, but the worst is when I see a couple while I'm walking, I don't feel angry or jealous, just sad. I don't even think I want to kill myself. The thought of my family's reaction to it means I'd never. I just want to sort of disappear. If the post isn't okay for this sub because of that, say and I'll remove it.
