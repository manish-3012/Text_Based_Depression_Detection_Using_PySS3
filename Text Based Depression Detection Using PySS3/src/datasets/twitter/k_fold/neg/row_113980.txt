Not sure if I should end it or not...First post on new account; been a lurker for quite a while. I feel like my life has been going to shit and it isn't getting better. I've had depression that has become moderately worse since 4th grade (bullying and exclusion caused it mostly). I'm a freshman now in college and this first semester has gone from seeming like a fresh start to a hopeless dead end. My parents went through a really messy divorce that was in process through all my high school years. My dad had an affair with a much younger woman from Colombia and she is very verbally abusive and manipulative. I have also had many fights with my parents and switched homes a lot. She tore my family apart further and turned my dad against a lot of us. I have had terrible social anxiety since middle school. I have always had great grades and excelled in school despite the many pressures on me to have friends and do well in sports (I sucked at both). I spent the last 2 and a half years before college dating an amazing girl who I was set on marrying. She left me right when college started and is seeing other people. She tore my heart out almost 4 months ago and I don't know how I will ever get over her. I don't relate very well to people and feel like if I continue living I will die alone and unhappy. College has not been good to me; My roommate is amazing but all of his friends hate me (They all went to high school in Iowa City, while I lived in NW Iowa and we are all at U of Iowa now). I can't really afford to have severe depression right now because I'm in biomed engineering and my focus and motivation is just gone. I used to love learning. I also hate my body and obsessively lift weights and eat a lot because in high school I worked at a hardware store and was teased by my managers for being 140 pounds (skinny jokes hurt too!) I am almost 160 pounds now but I still feel inferior. I have tried killing myself multiple times since college started and sometimes I wish I had succeeded. I hardly have anyone to actually talk to and I feel so hopeless. People just say "get over it". I am on the fence to just drink a shit ton of antifreeze because I can't take it back without going to a hospital. Suicidal thoughts are the only thing that even calms me down anymore. I want to be happy but I just don't know how to get over everything.
