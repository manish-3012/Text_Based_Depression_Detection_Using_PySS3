The person is really suicidal, it's not just empty treats, she already do a few attempt. We live in the same street.  


The fact is, I don't like the person at-all. I start helping her out of obligation and because for some reason I'm the only one in her circle who know what to say to someone suicidal. (her family said stuff like "you don't have the gut to do it , or "there is people who have less than you who are still happy"). So I start listening to her by obligation, and am stuck in it now.

Over the years, dispite my patient listening,  gentle advices , warning of danger , This person trash various aspect of her life; basicly her job, her financial stability, her heath, and her relationship with other ( it's not just "cutting the bridge". It's things like black listing and restriction order )

Currently her situation is really desperate. No job, debt, no money, no friends nor family, in an abusive and violent relationship, unable to work for the rest of her life because of her health.. Yet she continue her destructive pattern.   
She is actually in an inextricable situation which she is partialy responsable. 

The only positive things which I accomplich with her was making  her continue to see her shrink. Who is very bad and unhelpfull, but the only one she accept to see because she don't want to take public transportation to see one.

for her deserve, she didn't had an easy life at all. She suffer more than all of us reuinited. A lot of bad parenting and badly managed mental health and abusive relationship.  It's fuck up a lot of her life (by example she wasn't allowed to follow an usefull for work scholarship, and had marry in an abusive mariage in order to escape her parent).

But also some stuff  (harrassing a client so badly she lose her job, buying thing she can't afford to throwing them just after, not following some (free) physical therapy to recover after one of her TS, refusing to gain some money she was entitled to because the bank will take half of it to pay one of her debt) are on  her own

&amp;#x200B;

If I don't answer to her in the 10 min she harass me at work and become verbally abusive.

All of that make me grow to dispite her. Which I have never expressed, because half the time I meet her she is on the verge of suicidal because of the consequence of her last crap.

&amp;#x200B;

I've follow the whole guide of how to listening and what to say to someone depressed/suicidal, but the whole "don't get mad if they don't try to fix their life " is hard when you can witness them trashing their life then coming back to cry on your shoulder or become abusif if your are not available

&amp;#x200B;

Also my own social circle which I explain my issue with her things that I'm an awfull person because I didn't succeed to help her getting back on her fit ( There is some sort of pressure on my country for women to be able to do as good as a professional psychotherapist for free)

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't have the strength to help her or support this person anymore.   
If it was a standard toxic relationship I would stop it here. But the combo suicidal + desperate situation make me hesitate.

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue : we live in the same street, so I would have to move out ( which I will do this year anyway), but stopping every relationship with  her will either be a very slow process , or a "I don't want you to call me ever again " then disapear.

How can I announce her than I'm moving? (there is never a good moment for that. She is alway crisis under crisis)

How can I stop relationship with her without making her kill herself?  
How can I forbid her to call me every day once I have move out ( I'm under the impression she will make a TS if I blacklist her)
