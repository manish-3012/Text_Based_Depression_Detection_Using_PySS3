Need someone to talk toEvery morning when I get woke up think about killing myself because getting out of bed is jus so hard for me now &amp; the thought of having a productive day &amp; socialising just kills me. I have no motivation to do anything I just cba anymore. I canâ€™t talk to anyone because no one gives a shit and I donâ€™t want to burden my family by telling them I want to die.. if anything, people say Iâ€™m faking depression cus Iâ€™m always posting suicidal memes (on my priv Sc story) but thatâ€™s just a cry for help cus I canâ€™t just start a conversation with someone like â€˜hey Im fucked up &amp; wanna dieâ€™ So I can only really talk about it when people ask but they never do and when they do i just push them away and say Iâ€™m fine.  I go to sleep every night fantasising about how Iâ€™m gonna kill myself  but I canâ€™t do it yet cus of my family.  This post probably makes no sense Iâ€™m just rambling.  

I Really neeed someone to talk to about all this, Iâ€™m so alone lmao Iâ€™m going crazy. Alsooo, Iâ€™m self medicating with weed and alcohol (literally every day) which probably doesnâ€™t help but I canâ€™t stop. 

Sorry for the layout, Iâ€™m on mobile
