My attemptSaturday night, that's when it happened. The whole process was very impulsive, I had no last thoughts; nothing serious. I took maybe 9  or so anti seizure pills. The last thing I remember was laying on my stairs, looking at my cat and thinking how amazing he looks, how nature is beautiful. Suddenly I have obscured flashes of consciousness. I saw an IV needle in my arm, I saw my dad, with long hair and a purple plaid sweater. Darkness, then light again. The nurse walks in and informs my parents that they had found marijuana in my system, it was no surprise to them. For whatever reason, it didn't worry me. I'd say it's because I was about to fucking die. Suddenly I wake up in my bed, the familiar room in which I've spent so much time becoming who I am. This room
Is me, and I am this room. The familiarity of such a setting, along with my mother and step dad around, gave me enough comfort to forget what had just happened. As I ate my breakfast, I convinced them to leave me alone, slowly coming to. By the time it had been noon, I was myself again. But this time, I was much happier. I was who I really wanted to be - Monday, September 18th, 2017
