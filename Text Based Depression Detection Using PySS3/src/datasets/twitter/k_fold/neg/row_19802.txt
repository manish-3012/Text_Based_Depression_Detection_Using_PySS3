I'm alone, starting to drink, wanting to take pillshi, 19yo girl, i'm lonely, I had to move out from my girlfriends place, I had to break up with the other girlfriend we shared, I've spent the past year and a half trying to find friends in a new city, I failed many times to kill myself, succeeded in many ways to maim myself, I'm just tired and hopeless, this is probably selfish but, convince me to stop, I know I've run out of things to say to myself.
