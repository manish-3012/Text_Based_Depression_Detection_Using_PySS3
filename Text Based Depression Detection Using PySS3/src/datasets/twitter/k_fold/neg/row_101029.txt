I'm trying to be happy knowing I'll be dead soonIt's not worth trying to get help anymore man. I'm not rushing my suicide, but I will do it eventually. I'll just run it down for you: I grew up kinda normally. Mom and dad divorced when I was like 12 and I became an asshole. I hurt people and broke things and just hated everything and I lived in and out of mental hospitals for about 2 years, basically till I was 14-15. Around that time, I learned some family secrets, my dad wasn't my biological father and my mom rightfully hates me. At 16, I got sent to a boot camp and basically lived like a fucking animal in a zoo. The fat, nerdy ginger kid who was always fucking up. At 17, I got out and started having these violent outbursts that didn't happen since I was 13. At 18, I got rejected by both of my friends, a guy and a girl. I knew I was bi when I turned 15 but couldn't be open because of my family's beliefs. Also at 18, I tried to kill myself for real. I always made weak attempts for attention, but this one was to actually take my life. I also never stayed in school and was bullied a lot. I used my failed attempt to try and get help but nobody cared. Here I am at 19. Everything hurts. I tried to warn everyone about me killing myself, but I guess I was just the boy who cried wolf for so long it just lost it's effect.

 I'm not gonna worry, wrinkles in my brow
'cuz nothing's ever gonna be alright no how
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive
