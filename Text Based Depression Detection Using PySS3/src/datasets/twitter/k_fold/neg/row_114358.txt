lost friend after she fell pregnanti have been friends with this girl since 2014 and for the past few years we have been super close, spoke all day everyday about literally everything, then a few weeks ago we had a fight that i wasnâ€™t aware we were even having over a single dollar...after that sheâ€™s started being really distant, saying sheâ€™s not seeing or speaking to ANYONE rn because sheâ€™s so tired and stressed all the time and i 100% backed off, only messaged to ask if she was okay with the occasional memes, but now we donâ€™t talk at all (bar a â€œhey you alright?â€ with a reply of â€œyeah iâ€™m goodâ€and nothing more every few days) we are in a group chat together with some old work colleagues that she talks in often with anyone BUT me, sheâ€™s been making plans to see the other people in the chat, had breakfast with someone else out the chat so itâ€™s very clear sheâ€™s out and about seeing people, i feel so gutted sheâ€™s pushing me away like this...she was my ONLY friend and  not a very good one but sheâ€™s all i had in the world that i felt was worth living for. i havenâ€™t spoken to or seen anyone in weeks i feel so alone but i donâ€™t know where to go from here.
i have no social skills.
a broken mind and body. 
i canâ€™t work. 
i canâ€™t go anywhere new.
i feel so lost
iâ€™m tired
iâ€™m older than i ever thought iâ€™d be, iâ€™m proud of that but i think my time is coming to an end.
