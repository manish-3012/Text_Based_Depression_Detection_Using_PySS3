Is it normal for schoolwork to make me want to commit suicide?Before quarantine, my school didn't give me too much work. But now, they're piling got on like there's not tomorrow. I just can't cope anymore. This may seem insignificant, and it probably is, and I'm just being selfish, but I really would rather die than cope with the work. I want to actually do stuff in life, rather than wake up to do work that I couldn't complete the day before because there was so much work the day before that, etc, etc. I just don't see a reason to live anymore. I hate myself, I hate being this way, and I hate the work being piled on. I just want to end it all.
