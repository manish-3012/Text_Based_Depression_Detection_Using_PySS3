Failed again and ready to throw in the towelWell, it's about time I threw in the towel.  I quit my old job back in April and started a new job at a furniture store with the promise of making anywhere between $60,000 to $100,000 a year based on commission.  To make a long story short, someone ran to human resources and snitched on me.  They said I said something inappropriate.  I was hauled into the office and fired on the spot with very little in the way of an explanation.  So now I'm driving a taxi cab (also commission) and make less than minimum wage doing this.

I'm about to turn 34 years old and I can't believe I've let my life become such a mess.  I don't really see the point in going on.  Life is just a farce, as so many have pointed out before.  Everyone is so consumed with materialism that they don't stop to think about the real problems of the world.  And everyone is afraid of being labelled a "loser" if they don't say all the right things and get the right jobs and wear the right clothes and tasteful wristwatches.  

You know something?  We're all losers.  Every single person.  Because we all die at some point.  And all our accomplishments and accolades fade into oblivion as though they never happened at all.

I really wish I was aborted before birth.  It would have saved me a lot of grief.  Yes, I've had many good experiences, but many bad ones too.  And I don't really want to continue on this earth where there is all this fighting and hostility.  It's exhausting.  Even in the small town I live in, drugs are rampant, cars are getting broken into at night so crackheads can steal enough coins or valuables to obtain their next fix.  It's ridiculous.  

I think I'll drive my car into a bridge support at 120 MPH or something.  I don't want to hurt anyone else though, so I may just drive into the harbour here instead.
