My final words.I'm overdosing right after this is posted. I have 150 sertraline pills and a whole lot of sleeping pills. I should be out of this miserable life in just a few minutes now! I'm going to hopefully lose consciousness, and slowly drift out of this sick world. This is it, this is finally it. I hope you all live a better life than I did. I'm so sorry everyone, but this is my final goodbye. I just can't continue on living like this anymore. I'm so glad to finally be leaving this messed up world. 

Goodbye everyone!
