How do i get the help i needI (21M) have dealt with suicidal tendencies all my life but i never got any help with it. Ive never been diagnosed but i know im bi polar and have anger issues. I think i need to be put on some sort of medicine but i dont know who to go to, to get diagnosed. Im on the tail-end of a shitty break up and the woman i love is convinced i hate her, no matter what i say or do. I know my brain isnt healthy but i cant change how im wired without help. I feel like putting a big metal spike on my steering wheel and driving into a wall. I dont want to think that way anymore. I just need help. I dont want to hurt myself or anybody else, but every part of my brain is screaming at me to hurt myself. Please i just need help. Im so tired of fighting myself and people i care about
