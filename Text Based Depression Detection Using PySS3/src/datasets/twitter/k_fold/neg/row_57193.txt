Bottom of a bottomless hole?I want to kill myself. I think I am closer now than ever...

I lied and cheated for 5 years with my partner. Betrayed her and stole her dignity and sense of self, stole nearly 6 years from her. 

She found out about everything and ended things. We have 2 young children who need to be looked after every day while she goes to work so I have to see her and spend time with her almost every day. Sometimes we seem to be on the up and enjoy each others company and even have tenderness and compassion between us. But sometimes, like now it is very very bad. So much hatred and despite everything I am doing, no trust. I understand why she would feel this way but it is so hard living when you have to take the hatred and the hurtful things. 

I know she's seeing other people already and that kills me because I don't think there will ever be anyone else for me. I have so much guilt and shame inside of me and so much sickness at what I've done and I just don't know how someone can survive when all that's inside them is black, toxic sickness. 

If I do it then my children will have to live with it but I know their mother will be a great mother and see them through life with everything they need. 

I'm at the bottom of a hole and it just seems to be getting deeper. There is no way out for me. Maybe it's best for the world to just remove the negative energy altogether.
