I'm about to lose my job and insurance and purpose. Again.There aren't any resources for adult women in the autistic spectrum. I'm reaching out for help but there isn't any. 

There is no help for me. I already did the inpatient thing. They can't help people with my problems. Just give me sad little puppy dog eyes and say they wish they could help.

I never wanted to be alive in the first place. I'm going to lose my health insurance. I have chronic pain and mental issues. I can't take care of myself anymore. I'm not even middle aged. There's no hope.
