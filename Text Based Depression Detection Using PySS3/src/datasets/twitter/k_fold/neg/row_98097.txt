I'm failing, I have no friends, and my parents hate me.Just got away from my mother calling me a loser because I'm failing algebra. Fuck algebra honestly, I'll never use it. She also thinks taking things away for me and not letting me go to work is gonna fucking help. I can't take it anymore. I hate being alone. Goodbye.
