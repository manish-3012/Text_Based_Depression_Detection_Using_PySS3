Worthless history, bleak futureI have failed at everything I've tried to do. I tried the military and failed miserably. I tried raising a child and having a family and I failed miserably. I've tried school, I've tried working. Now I'm facing chronic depression and an auto immune disease, a future even more bleak than I imagined the first several times I tried to end my life and stayed in the hospital. I'm hopelessly in debt due to medical bills and student loans and I can't pay them because I can't work due to disability - and my law firm says it could take years to see any money from a disability claim. Nothing makes me happy and when I find a hobby that might be interesting, everyone always makes fun of me or I feel unwelcome and unwanted for participating in it.

My entire family thinks I'm worthless. The one friend I have is so sick of hearing about how sad I am all the time, and that person lives states away anyway. Things aren't going to get better. I think I'm going to try again next month, while I'm on vacation. 

I've called hotlines and I've been to hospitals - and now my only option is dealing with the VA, and when I reached out to their suicide prevention person, my phone calls went unanswered and unreturned. I'm too tired to deal with it anymore.
