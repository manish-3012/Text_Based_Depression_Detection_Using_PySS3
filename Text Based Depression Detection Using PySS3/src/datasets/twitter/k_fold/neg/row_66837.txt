May not see my golden birthday, the big 30I want to be a productive member of society but im unemployed, disabled and have a few garnishments that make it next to impossible to even begin to make enough money to survive. Not only that but my friend/roommate group has unfortunately, and begrudgingly, told me that without a steadier income I won't be able to move into a new place with them, because of the financial, and potentially legal, strain of having me come with them... I want to just be done with it because I don't even have anywhere else to go, especially when I dont have a steady income..
