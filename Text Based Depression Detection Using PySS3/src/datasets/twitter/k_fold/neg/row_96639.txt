I can't stop getting angry and aggressive at the people I am surrounded withThis sounds so fucking stupid to type to myself at this time of night but still. Every time I see someone whether they're important to me like my mum or just some random person who I barely know I think in my mind how I can have a pleasant conversation and talk nicely to them and be a positive person. Then when we start talking I get so angry and snap at them or start frustrating what they say or chiding them. Other times I just deliberately try and make them feel stupid or miserable. Sometimes its like I go into a conversation with the full intention of being pleasant and am just absolutely miserable and horrible. Of course then it only gets worse rather than better, I want to make it worse.

The result being I now talk less and less to people and feel less like I need to make an effort in friendship. All the effort I've put in the past 4 years into making myself a likable person feels like its going down the drain all because I'm too lazy to put in the effort again. I have no idea why I've typed, or rather what I hope to gain from it, but I think the best thing would be if anyone had the same experience as me and has any idea what they might do about it. Thanks. Peace.
