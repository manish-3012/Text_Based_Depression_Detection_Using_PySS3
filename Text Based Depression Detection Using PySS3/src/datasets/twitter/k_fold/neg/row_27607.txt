I'm so tired.I don't feel like typing up my sob story again so here's a [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x6yef/reddits_had_a_few_threads_about_sexual_assault/c5k9wni).

I've been in therapy for several weeks now and it's been helping a lot with guilt issues, depression, and self-hatred, but today is just...one of those days. We all have them. Maybe we just don't want to talk about them.

But I'm just so very tired. I'm tired of life. I don't even have the energy to kill myself. I don't even have the energy to have the desire to kill myself. Today, I just want to fall asleep and never wake up. One of those days. Maybe it's stress, maybe fatigue, but I have a very big hunch its loneliness. 

I'm incredibly glad a place like this exists, so thank you to all the mods and such. Just needed to let it out.

EDIT: You guys are awesome. Makes me wish SW had a (moderated) chatroom so I wouldn't have to PM people...
