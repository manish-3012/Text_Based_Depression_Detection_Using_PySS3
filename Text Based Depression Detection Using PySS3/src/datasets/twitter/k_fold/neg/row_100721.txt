I cant think of a single reason to live anymoreI make everyone miserable 
My existence serves zero purpose
I contribute absolutely nothing to this world
My health is going to make me die young
Bettering my self is pointless
I have no hobbies
I find joy in nothing
I have no friends
No one 
I'm a mooch
Unlovable 
Just get left and cheated on
I'll never have children 
Everyday is me dwelling on my traumas
I cant get help
I'm not getting better
Everyone says it gets better and it hasn't 
It's just a repeat cycle if me loving other people and watching my existence make them miserable until I'm alone again 
I cant fucking do it anymore
Given the circumstances I think 25 years was a good fucking run
