I'm tired of my life, I'm killing myself very soonTired of how women treat me, no girlfriend, the only sex with hot girls I can get is through prostitutes and i'm tired of paying for sex.
Paying for a basic human need and right is downright retarded.

Tired of how my parents don't understand the magnitude of my issue. 

I can't get hot girls because I'm ugly to them (just like 80% of the male population according to women, studies). I am not rich and I don't have the money to do whatever I want and live comfortably. I'm poor and I haven't enjoyed life for the past 10 years, not a single day. 

I've dropped out of university because money can't buy happiness so why bother getting a degree for a highly-paid job since I'm gonna end up alone anyway.
