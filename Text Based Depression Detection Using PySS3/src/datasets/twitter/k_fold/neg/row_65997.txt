Lost another job. I think I am out.I've been out of work for three years and six months ago I finally got a job working retail. It wasn't much but I could at least attempt to pay off my credit cards and student loans. I work pay check to pay check and yesterday I got canned. A customer accused me of swearing in front of their child and management immediately sided with the customer. I can't take this again. I don't want to be homeless again. I have nothing saved and collectors will once again start harassing me. I think I am going to end it and then all of my problems will go away.
