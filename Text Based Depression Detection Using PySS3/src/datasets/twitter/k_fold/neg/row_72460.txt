I've never been good with people, but its just gotten to be too much now.I have a party to go to later today, so I have to calm down. The thing is, I donâ€™t want to go. I donâ€™t want to stand around awkwardly in a bathing suit; hating my body and fearing people looking at me. Chances are I wonâ€™t come out of the pool unless Iâ€™m stuffing myself because thatâ€™s the only thing Iâ€™m looking forward to; swimming and free food. Itâ€™s my oldest friend's birthday party and I canâ€™t stop thinking about how disconnected I feel from him and his friends. I still think I care about him, but I just donâ€™t know. 


Iâ€™m too busy trying, and failing, to come to terms with my stupidity to hold a conversation with anyone. Itâ€™s hard realizing that youâ€™re an idiot. Every time I even think about it, I want to cry. And my poor conversational skills just remind me how dumb and inept I am. I feel like Iâ€™m lagging when I talk. My words get jumbled and I sound like Iâ€™m on drugs because I just canâ€™t remember the words that I need in that moment. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me but I canâ€™t do it anymore. I canâ€™t be afraid of talking to people. I just canâ€™t do it anymore.
