I always feel like I want to try againMy life is just stagnant- Iâ€™ve attempted 2 times this year to no avail and idk I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. 

I donâ€™t feel like anyone understands. Seemingly minor things to others are bug things to me. Why canâ€™t I adult. Why did my ex abuse me? Why did my dad rip my teeth out as a kid when he got frustrated? Why did they throw my art away?  I donâ€™t want to leave my boyfriend because he loves me very much- but The pain; Iâ€™m hurting. They said it was Fibromyalgia but idk anymore it just hurts. 

I want to this time cut myself open then hang myself from the door knob again (we have no good poles or fixtures here) I think that will feel better. Yes. Make it stop make it stop make it stop..
