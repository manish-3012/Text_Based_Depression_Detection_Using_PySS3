Whatâ€™s the pointI donâ€™t give a fuck about society and all of the shit youâ€™re forced to do in this world. Life is fucking empty. Thatâ€™s the truth that I realized. At the end of the day thereâ€™s just nothing left. I play video games and the emptiness always returns. I talk to people and it always returns. Whatâ€™s even the point of living if you get no enjoyment from this stupid trial? Even if I did get some enjoyment it would be so minuscule while the bullshit would be the majority of life. Life is fucking stupid. Itâ€™s not worth it.
