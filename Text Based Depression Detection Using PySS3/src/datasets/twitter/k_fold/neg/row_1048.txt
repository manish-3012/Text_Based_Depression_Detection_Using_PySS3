Hi, I think I'm suicidal. More details inside, just need to vent and tell someone. Why not strangers on the internet? Hi. I'm an eighteen year old male, and I think I'm suicidal. 

I've had the urge to kill myself for a couple years now. It's just that recently the idea pops up in my head more often. 

I feel like my whole life I've been abandoned, my parents, friends, and others have left me in the dust for something better. I've had girls tell me they love me, think I'm perfect, and want to be with me. But they'll date someone else while leading me on. It's come to the point that I'm desensitized to things like that. I don't think I can love someone without worrying it's going to end abruptly. 

It's just that sometimes I'll think 'hmm, oblivion, no emotions, no pain, peace.' And I'll contemplate just killing myself. I mean, once I'm dead I won't have to worry about anything. I'll be free. Nothing to cause me pain. 

So, yeah, I guess you could call me suicidal. I see no happy future for me, and all my happy memories have something bad attached.
