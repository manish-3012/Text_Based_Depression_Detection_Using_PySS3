I need help but I dont want to disappoint my familyI want to try calling a suicide prevention line because I really feel like I might hurt myself, but I know my family would see me different. I'm not sure how it really works but I know that if my parents every found out they would treat me different. I want to break from school because I know I would get overwhelmed and hurt myself if I went, but I know that everyone would hate me if I didnt. Everyone already hates me, and nobody would miss me if I was gone. I just want time to be alone but I live with so many people, it will never get better. What do I do.
