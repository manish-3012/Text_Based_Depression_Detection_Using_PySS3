Valar MorghulisWell, I don't even know where to start. I'm not here for you to say me "Don't do it", "We will miss you" and all that crap. After an extensive analysis of the pros/cons of living I decided to put it an end, as a matter of fact while I write this I'm smoking a "poisoned cigarette".

My reasons? I have no future, I fucked up two Careers because I'm just not interested. When I dropped the first one I had the chance to study a new thing in the same university, but I recently screwed that too. I don't know, I'm just lazy, I prefer playing PC games even through I know is wrong, I just can't help it and it's killing me... Basically wasted my parents money and they will be very dissapointed.

I know they love me, I love them and I'm sorry they'll have to suffer my death. But I just can't stand it, here in my country without a degree you'll never win over 400 dollars/month (half the money to survive).

Just wanted to share my story with you guys. Keep helping the people who needs it, you are all awesome.

Farewell.

PS: Sorry about my english, spanish is my first language.
