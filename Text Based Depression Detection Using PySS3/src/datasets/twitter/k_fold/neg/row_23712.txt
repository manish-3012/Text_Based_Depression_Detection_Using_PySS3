a note about the past. about what used to be and what never will.iâ€™m thinking about everything. iâ€™m thinking about sandy point and the memories i made there. about the feeling of the sand between my toes. the water crashing on my shins and onto my jeans as my friends went further in the water and i stayed back. iâ€™m thinking about walking along that road. it hurt but honestly, i never wanted to stop walking down it. i wish it would go on forever. and i would make jokes and talk with my friends forever. iâ€™m thinking about walking on the beach during the storm. about the wind, the laughs we had. the fireplace afterwards. iâ€™m thinking about the sand dunes, the shop, the bunk beds, the laughter, the memories. and how i will never experience something like that ever again. how they are leaving and how that road did end. iâ€™m thinking about choosing to stop walking down that road now and just stop moving.

and i canâ€™t handle everything changing. im not ready. i want to travel back in time. i want everything to stay constant.


they are gone, and iâ€™m alone. iâ€™m too scared to sleep and my head is spinning. the lights in my room seem to be turning into an unknown darkness and my reflection doesnâ€™t look the same. everyone leaves me while they walk into the new day. while iâ€™m stuck in a past that can not be recreated, unable to move on. iâ€™m not ready. maybe when i am finally dead, i will be back at sandy point.
