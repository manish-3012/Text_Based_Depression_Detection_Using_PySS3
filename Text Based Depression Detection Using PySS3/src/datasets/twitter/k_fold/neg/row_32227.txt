Nothing specialYou know, it feels really pathetic that I feel this shit for no apparent reason, when there are people living lives that are so much worse and they're happy, whilst I arguably live a decent life. I'm 17 and live a normal mid-upper class life whilst going to school. I've not undergone any parental abuse and no real bullying. Even though my life seems fine I'm at this state of not being sad enough to kill myself, but not happy enough to enjoy life. I barely sleep at night (last 4 days i've slept about 6 hours in total) and when I'm not sleeping I just look at my roof and hate myself in most ways and contemplate why I think like I do etc. My parents have no clue what's going on and they just think I'm a normal, nerdy teen.
