Failing my study and deleted Facebook to not have a memory pageI guess i've finally made the choice, the thought of ending my own life. I have slowly been cutting contact with People, so that they wouldnt need to see me at my worst. I deleted Facebook so that i wouldnt have a memory Page. Never really cut myself, before today, but it felt good, even though i defnitly need a sharper knife to make things go faster. I told my parents that i am failing my studies, and opened up about it all, not because i want help, Just dont want her to think she did anything wrong, its Just me being fucked up and incompetent. In other Words yes i am planning to take my life "Just" because i dont seem to be smart enough for my own dream.
This post is probably so badly written a 12 year old could write better.
