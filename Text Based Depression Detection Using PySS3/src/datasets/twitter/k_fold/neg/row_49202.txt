End of the lineI keep trying. Every fucking day I keep trying. I get up and go to work and joke around and come home to an empty apartment. An empty, filthy apartment and every time I try to clean it up I just go back to bed. I used to have friends and a life, then I threw my back out and couldn't work for months and now I've sold everything worth any money at all just to pay bills and every time I think "ok, this week I can afford groceries" something else comes along. I can't even afford to go to the laundromat. I walked around town for two hours yesterday trying to find loose change in the street so I could afford the subway ride home from work. I don't know how I'm going to afford to get to work next week. I miss my friends but they don't understand how things got this bad and it's hard to explain to them so I don't bother. 

And I'm just tired of trying. There's no one to try for any more. Nobody gives a shit what I do or if I live or die. You all seem like nice people but at the end of the day you're just words on a screen. 

I have a few bottles of pills here that I got when I threw my back out. I think it'll help everybody. Someone out there needs a job, they can have mine. My apartment is in a decent neighborhood and in a convenient location so I'm sure someone else will be glad to live here. It won't be hard to clean out, I've sold everything that isn't basically trash. I'm just a waste of space anymore and I don't see any way out but this.
