Going home as soon as the bus can get me thereSix months ago i attempted to commit suicide via carbon monoxide. I don't know what happened. My memory is fucked. In the 6 months that has passed since then.. All i can think about is my wife amd kids. I live on the couch at my moms, i dont do shit cause why bother. Im looking at a felony for attempted tresspass (trying to see my kids after 4 months) and i find out my daughter is in the hospital and i cant even be there for here. I dont know what went wrong the first time. But i wont fail this time. Im going home. Hopefully you guys find peace in this life.
