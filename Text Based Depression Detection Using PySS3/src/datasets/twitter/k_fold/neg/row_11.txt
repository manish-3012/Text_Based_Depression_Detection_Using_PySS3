Iâ€™m scared.   Everything just seems to be getting worse and worse. Iâ€™m young and I think Iâ€™m transgender but Iâ€™m not even sure about that. I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m just lying to myself or if Iâ€™m actually trans, I feel so overwhelmed with thoughts and emotions and I canâ€™t just take it anymore.
    I just wish I could at least know for sure if I was trans, and even then I have to worry about if my (religious) family will be accepting and if I can actually do anything to alleviate my pain a bit.
   I cut myself for the first time yesterday, I barely even drew blood so I canâ€™t even fucking hurt myself correctly. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be able to do anything correctly, I want to pursue music but I know thereâ€™s no money to be found in that field unless I become famous but thatâ€™s not happening. 
   Currently Iâ€™m not seriously debating suicide but the thoughts keep coming back and they just keep getting worse. Iâ€™m not sure if I can really take this much longer, I just wish I was born a girl. I want to cry.
