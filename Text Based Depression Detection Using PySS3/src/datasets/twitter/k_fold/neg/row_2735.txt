I'm out of weed and I don't think I can make it till morning.It started to go downhill in the beginning of January, my best friend blocked me on everything and refused to talk to me. I started failing school, my friends started to hate me, I checked myself into the hospital (terrible idea, stayed there for a week and all I could think about was getting out.) when I got out I thought everything was going to be fine. My teachers were understanding and gave me a lot of extensions on missed work, a guy that I've liked for ages finally asked me out, my friend unblocked me and started speaking to me again, just...things were okay. And then they weren't. The guy broke up with me in a week, complaining I was never happy, my friends ditched me for talking to someone "who wasn't good for me", I have fourteen thousand standardized tests I need to take to graduate, and my friend blocked me on everything again (when I needed to talk to him most.) The loneliness is what's killing me the most, I feel like I can never have anyone solid in my life. I just want to be unconditionally loved. I want people to notice when I'm not around. I want to fucking mean something to someone, but I don't.
