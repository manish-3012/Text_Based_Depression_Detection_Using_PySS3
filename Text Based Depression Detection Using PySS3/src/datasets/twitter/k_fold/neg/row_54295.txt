I donâ€™t think I can handle having a mental disorder like thisI found out today that schizophrenia runs fairly commonly in my family along my motherâ€™s bloodline, and I donâ€™t know if I can handle being schizophrenic, I think I would rather take myself out of this world than find out what evil things my mind can come up with to torment me moreso than I already am. Iâ€™ve got the knife ready and everything, I just have to psych myself up to go from the papercuts I usually give myself with it to ending my torment finally. Iâ€™ve been depressed for most likely four or five years now, but Iâ€™ve never been formally diagnosed due to my complete fear of what my parents would do if they found out, as I still live with them, and whenever I tried to bring it up from the past my parents just made me guilty for my thoughts, â€œIf you killed yourself, I would too, just so you knowâ€, shit like that, didnâ€™t make it better, only worse. I was looking up the formal symptoms for schizophrenia tonight, and too many of them made sense for it to be a fluke, I exhibited an extreme air of self importance before and I have always â€œseen connections between things others canâ€™tâ€. I just.... I donâ€™t want to end up like the TempleOS guy or ChrisChan, or anyone like them, Iâ€™ve seen what mental disorders can do to someone through them, and I canâ€™t let it happen to me, I would much rather die, no matter how fucking scared of it I am. Iâ€™m so so scared, but I canâ€™t end up like them, I canâ€™t do that to my family, Iâ€™ve always been called the schizo in my family and I canâ€™t let that prophecy come true, I canâ€™t go out and kill someone like I see in my dreams and like I always see myself doing. Reddit is the only place I feel truly welcome, itâ€™s the only place I belong, so it might as well be the only place I explain myself and say goodbye. Iâ€™ll leave this post open on my computer, hopefully theyâ€™ll find it so they can get an understanding. I donâ€™t know anymore, goodbye, Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m like this and Iâ€™m too pathetic to fix myself, that my pride is too much for me to let someone fix me
