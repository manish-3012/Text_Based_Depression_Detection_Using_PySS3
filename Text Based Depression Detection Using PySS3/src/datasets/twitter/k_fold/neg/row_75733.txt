My ex boyfriend killed himself.(Please ignore the spelling and grammar mistakes)

Hereâ€™s a little back ground, I had a boyfriend last year in college. We started out as drinking buddies but it eventually led to more. We developed a very close relationship as he was there for me when my father died. We spent every day for months together until I decided to drop out. I started dating a new guy not to long after I left. College boyfriend would still try to snap chat me every once in a while but I would usually ignore them since my current boyfriend wouldnâ€™t feel comfortable with me talking to him. Well he hasnâ€™t snap chatted me in a while but I didnâ€™t think much of it. Side note: He is actually from the town over from where I live now. Only about 20min away and are towns are so small everyone knows everyone. 

I work at the convenience store in town and his brother walked in. After his brother left I was talking to my co worker about it and explained I used to date his brother and how we where really close. She knew exactly how  was talking about and got real quiet. She told me he killed himself a few months ago. I looked up his obituary to make sure itâ€™s true and sure enough it is. The last snap chat I got from him was November 12th and I ignored it. He passed November 12th. I know itâ€™s not my fault. He didnâ€™t say anything but â€œhiâ€ but somehow I still fell like I could have stopped it if I just responded maybe he would have told me how he was feeling and I could have helped.
