I'm going to commit suicide tonight.I've had a soul sucking headache since I tripped on acid and have dealt with it for a year. I can't be around people and have lost all my friends. I have no reason to live, I feel broken. I tried to wait it away but it didn't work. I am waiting till tonight so my family is asleep. I don't know why I posted this maybe advice.

Edit: I just spent 10 minutes crying and screaming I WANT TO LIVE at the top of my lungs. This has helped boost my morale somehow.

Edit: I am feeling better with some Lyrica I had forgotten about though it'll only pull me through 1 day.
