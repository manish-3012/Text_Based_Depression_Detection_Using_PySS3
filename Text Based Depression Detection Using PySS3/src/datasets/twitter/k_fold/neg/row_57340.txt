I'm just tired.Suicide is on my mind, constantly. 

Things are getting worse... I can feel it. I'm trying my absolute hardest to fight it, but I can't help but feel that I'll eventually succumb to this feeling soon. 

Bipolar is ruining my life. Completely. I no longer feel functional, or a part of society anymore. 

I'm just tired. A type of tired that seeps into my bones, and refuses to leave. 

I'll surrender to my demons eventually.
