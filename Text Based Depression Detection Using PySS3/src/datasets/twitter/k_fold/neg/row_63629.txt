If Only, If Only The Scarred Boy CriedIf only, if only I could be like the rest    
Confident and strong, open to help and ready to take the world like the best    
If only, if only my bark wasn't soft like the sky    
All I do is sit alone in my room and cry    
If only, if only my mind worked right    
For I am exhausted from this perpetual fight    
If only, if only I had another choice but this blade    
It shows me love all while showing me hate    
If only if only that noose hadn't hugged me so tight    
It wrapped around my neck and made everything all right    
If only if only I had one last stand    
But I *finally* hear my funeral band
