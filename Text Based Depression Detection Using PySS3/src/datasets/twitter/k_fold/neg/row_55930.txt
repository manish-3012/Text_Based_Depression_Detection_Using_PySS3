My sister told me to kill myself just like people used to tell me at school and I'm considering it.I've never been lucky, disappointment has been part of my life since I was little; had been to a doctor more times in my life than I can count, been suffering with chronic pain, so much that the only reason for not trying suicide with other things than pills is because it's going to be painful and it could not kill me, giving me more pain; today, after a little disagreement between me and my sister, she said "you should kill yourself" and at first I started crying a lot because I've heard that many times in my life while growing up, but from people that were in my school so, as soon as I got out of there, I didn't had to hear that again, yet I heard it from my own sister.
I'm starting to consider it because it could be a moment of pain for an eternity without pain; I have no pills that could cause a lethal reaction, only those that give you a stomachache if you take too much, I have some friends that try to dissuade me from the idea (unfortunately only virtual ones) but it has been hunting me since I was 8 because that's when all the pain started to get worse and it keeps getting worse.
I'm 19 and I know I have a whole life to live, I also know that all the pain that I feel won't be getting any better now, physically and mentally; I'm feeling more and more that I should follow that piece of advice for one last time.
