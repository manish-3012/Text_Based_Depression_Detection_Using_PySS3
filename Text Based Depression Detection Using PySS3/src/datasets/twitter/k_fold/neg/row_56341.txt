How can I prevent my friend from the progression of her suicidal thoughts?So my friend at school told me in class the other day that she wants to kill herself. I could tell this wasn't a joke. To clarify Iâ€™m a male and a really close friend to her. 

I don't know what to do. I have a reasonable idea of what's going on in her life but I think that if I tell the school counselor it could blow out of proportions and it will be worse on her than it started out. What do I do? 

One thing in specific, is there a phone number I can text to get professional help with this?
