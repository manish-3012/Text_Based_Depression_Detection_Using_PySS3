I can't do it anymore. I have no future.My life has been a constant struggle, while my other siblings strolled through life, I've had to fight every fucking step of the way. I am tired and can't do this anymore.

I am a christian, but after years of praying and nothing changing, I am done. I have a wife and a baby, I am in the final 2 month of a course that I planned to feature my career round and make a decent living. But I have no confidence that I can complete my assignments and gain the qualification. I've been off work for the last 4 days with the objective to get as much work done as possible, and I've wasted them, probably got about max 6 hours work done, because I'm stupid and sat here procrastinating and saying to myself "I can't do this". 

All I want to do is be able to support my family and provide for them, I feel like they deserve someone better.
Whats the point in living if I'm going to be angry at myself. FUCK.
