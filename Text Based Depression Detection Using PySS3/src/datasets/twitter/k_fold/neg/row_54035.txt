I've never felt suicidal but now it seems like I'm backing myself into a corner and it's the only option I have left, would love to talk to someoneBasically 6 months ago I dropped out of college because I was extremely depressed, stressed, and anxious. After 3 months of spending every day in bed I started seeing a therapist but things weren't improving, and I spent about a month in outpatient care before realizing that wasn't helping either. Nothing helps because at the end of the day I go back home to my parents who I've learned to distrust and hate, and it seems impossible to get out of the environment I'm in. An hour a week of talking to someone, and then waiting a week doing absolutely nothing except waiting to talk to them again is all my life has been. So now I've stopped seeing my therapist, am off my medication, and have started self harming. I just left my house for the first time in about a week to go and visit my friend at school thinking that getting away would make me feel better. Instead it just made me feel like more of a failure seeing where he is and how happy he is. I stopped caring about myself, I'm not worth the effort needed to make me feel better, if it's even possible. I'm just waiting for the point when I finally think there's nothing left worth being here for so I can kill myself.
