sorry.thanks to everyone who has been commenting on my posts here the last 2 months. now i can't take it anymore. going out around in 2,5 hours to somewhere ive been before. 

i can't deal with these constant thoughts. 
how it feels. 
how everything feels meaningless and pointless all the time. 

i don't want to leave my parents and it'll hurt them i know but i can't take it. 

please forgive me. im sorry
