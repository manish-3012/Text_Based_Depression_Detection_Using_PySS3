I just want to dieI am 19 yo from India.

I took a gap year for college but due to lockdown couldn't do anything.

My father verbally abuses me everyday. He calls me a big disappointed.

I was very good in studies till 10th but everything went downhill from there.

I realised I am gay and I fear that someone will know about it.

I just can't take it anymore.

Everyone in family sees me as a big disappointment.

Step-Mother treats me very harshly.
