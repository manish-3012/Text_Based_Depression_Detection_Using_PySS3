Whatâ€™s the point in living if Iâ€™m always going to be alone?The title says it all. I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I feel like my life is just constant rejection from women, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m fundamentally unable to make deeper relationships happen to me. All of my best friends have been in/are currently in relationships with people whom they care for and are cared for by. I donâ€™t get what about me is so fundamentally unlovable. I take care of myself, I maintain good hygiene, Iâ€™ve lost  quite a bit of weight, and people have even started to tell me I look good for the first time in my life. Yet I have friends who donâ€™t do any of that stuff who still have had girlfriends/boyfriends in their life. 

And before you write me off saying my standards too high, or that I need to look in more places, itâ€™s not even that. Itâ€™s that literally every girl Iâ€™ve ever pursued romantically has rejected me, or said they werenâ€™t interested, or said â€œI know youâ€™ll find someone/you deserve to find someone/youâ€™re a great guy, but I just donâ€™t like you that wayâ€. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m a â€œnice guyâ€ or anything like that, I have an active social life, and I still keep in touch with several of the girls Iâ€™ve liked in the past. Itâ€™s just that, I donâ€™t get what about me is repulsive that not a single person would want to be with me. And furthermore, is a life like that even worth living? I have hobbies, I love film collecting and reading, and Iâ€™m very strongly pursuing a career in the performing arts (which is how I meet many of the girls who Iâ€™ve liked in the past), yet, sometimes I feel like itâ€™s all just bullshit without anyone in my life to share it with. 

I donâ€™t wanna be that desperate but itâ€™s getting to the point where Iâ€™ll accept that form of companionship any way I could. Iâ€™d buy an escort or a similar service if I was old enough, but even then Iâ€™m sure sheâ€™d still feel disgusted by me. I just donâ€™t get why Iâ€™m apparently so greatly unlikeable that not a single person has entered my life intimately. Î‘m I just that awful to be around? Iâ€™ve thought about killing myself several times in my life but each time, part of me says â€œhang in there, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll find someone, Iâ€™m sure some development in your life will come alongâ€ but it never fucking happens. I donâ€™t think it ever will.
