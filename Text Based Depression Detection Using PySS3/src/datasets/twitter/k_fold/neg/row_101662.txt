I'm drunk for the first time as I'm writing thisIt's nkt better  everything's loopy and my head hurts. My parents went out dor a walk forgetting about my existence completly. I talked to my 8maginary friends a while ago. I'll kill myself soon, just the thought about it majes me happy. It only hurts for a moment. I hope if there's afterlife than it's better than whatever THIS is. I love yall, you deserve the best
