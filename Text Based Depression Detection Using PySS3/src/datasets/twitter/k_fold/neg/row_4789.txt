I don't know how to stopI don't know why I am typing this, I should be fine by all accounts, while I struggle a little I have a fine life and people around me who love me. I shouldn't be like this all the time, it's such bull shit that I am. I have opportunities, I got to go to the best school in my country, have a mostly supportive family, a good boyfriend and still I can't help it. I am so fucking enraged at myself that I'm itching all over, twitching and picking at my hands. And yet I can't stop myself. WHy should I be so fucking lucky? Why should I be born with opportunity when all I do is waste it. Why should I be allowed to roam the streets free when I can't even stop hysterically crying and picking at my hands late at night even when my boyfriend is lying right next to me. If he isn't exasperated yet he will be soon. In between these times I tell myself they are dwindling and becoming few and far between, but then why when they happen do I revert? WHy do I fall into the same traps and why does it feel right? I hate it, I hate it so much but it feels less forced than anything else. I know it's just a negative rumination cycle but I can't quit the feeling that it's right.


I'm sorry if you've read this, there's nothing here. Please have a nice day.
