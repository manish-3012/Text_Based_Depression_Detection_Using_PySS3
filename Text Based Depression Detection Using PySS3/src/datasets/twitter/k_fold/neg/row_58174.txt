Don't Know How To Keep GoingI'm tired , I'm frustrated , I'm angry , and mostly just a whole horrible amalgamation of shitty feelings . I've had to accept a failure of a class for the first time since second grade . I've gained 35 pounds in like 4 months after stopping working out . I haven't been able to motivate myself to do anything of significant importance in like a year or two . I just don't know how to fix this problem that's been getting worse . I have medication , I've been getting therapy . I've been doing everything possible for me to keep going but I just want to kill myself . And I'm starting to not care which way it is . I used to want something painless but I don't care anymore I just want an embrace of darkness that only comes with death .
