I can't stop wanting a girlfriend and it's making my life miserable.I'm 25 years old and I can't help but think why my time hasn't come yet. Every girl I've talked too either didn't like me or already had a boyfriend. Every single one of my friends have a girlfriend except me. It doesn't help that I was left out on a lot of things growing up, like getting picked last in sports or not getting picked at all and working alone when it's suppose to be a group project, and now the same nightmares still haunt me as an adult. I'm left out again on something that everyone wants. I guess maybe I only want one because everyone else has a girlfriend. If everyone had a Lamborghini but you didn't, wouldn't you want one too?

Any free time I get is spent thinking about what went wrong growing up and why I havn't found anyone yet. It's making me depressed and suicidal. It's making my outlook on life boring and bland and pointless. This just means that I have to keep myself busying from thinking about all this but it's already hard enough going out on public and seeing all these couples.

I'm watching everyone else live my dreams. I guess I could just accept it but then what? Am I suppose to sit and watch everyone else live my dream that doesn't require a degree or specific training? I don't even know how to accept this. I don't know where to start. I've read so many stories of people who stayed single their whole life and it wasn't their decision too. I just can't believe this is actually happening to me. I don't want to wait until I'm 30 years old or 35,40,50, 60... to finally find love and experience sex that people half my age are already doing. This kind of thinking makes me want to end it all. I wish I was asexual. I don't want to want women anymore. They don't want me.


I just needed to type this out and get my head straight again.
