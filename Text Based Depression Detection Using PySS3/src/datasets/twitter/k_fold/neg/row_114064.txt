I hate my life and I don't see any reason to keep on goingIve been depressed since I was 16 and I never have let anyone know because I don't want to scare them or cause a burden. Currently I'm 24 I have 3 daughters(1 of them is actually mine but I see them all as mine) my relationship with my girlfriend feels fake I caught her cheating a couple of times already (she says she never fucked but I don't believe it even though I want to) the children are a pain in the ass actually even tho I love them my parents think I'm almost graduated from school even though I'm not going at school I tried to hang myself about a week ago and ofcourse the rope snapped and I woke up on the floor. I just wish I had a gun because I know it would be very easy for me to pull the trigger and I'm also kind of sick and tired for needing to live my life because of other people I don't have the feeling at all that I live my life for myself. All that holds me back a bit is my daughter because I don't want her to grow old without me but still I also think now is my best shot while I'm still erasable out of her memory(she is a year and a half) anyway I just wanted to ask if someone knows a way without making it look like suicide I'm begging you please help me ending this misery I know it sounds selfish but I never chose for being born
