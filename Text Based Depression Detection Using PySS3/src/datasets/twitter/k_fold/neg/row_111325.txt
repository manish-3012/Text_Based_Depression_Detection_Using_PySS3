The loneliness makes me want to kill myselfEveryone just wants me to blend in and be like them. They donâ€™t want abandonment issues, mass amounts of baggage, self destructive behaviors and tendencies. They donâ€™t want to deal with my crap. Fuck this world. Itâ€™s all one big joke where we get lied and deceived with hope only to have our god damn spirits crushed and end up right back to being fucking nothing. Fuck this joke
