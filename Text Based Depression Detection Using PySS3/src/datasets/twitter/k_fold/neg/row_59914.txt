Waves of suicidal thoughtsHello there.
I've been having rather severe suicidal thoughts for the past 2-3 weeks or so. Not constantly, they're like.. waves. 
They come and go and every and each time I am afraid I might collapse under them.. 
I don't know how I am holding on. 
I don't know how much longer I will. 

I consider myself safe. 
I am not harming myself. 
And I don't want to.. for now. 

But at times I feel absolutely overwhelmed by these awful thoughts.. 
I have talked with my parents to see a psychologist. 

Do you think it'll be of any help? 

I just pray every minute that I'll survive the next one. 

I really just... Needed to get this off my chest. 

I love you all.
Stay safe!
