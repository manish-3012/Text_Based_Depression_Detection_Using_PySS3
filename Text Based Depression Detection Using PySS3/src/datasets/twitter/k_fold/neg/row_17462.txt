I could do my homework. Or I could kill myself.I could go for a run. Or I could kill myself. I could talk to my friends. Or I could kill myself. I could brush my teeth. Or I could kill myself. I could get out of bed. Or I could kill myself. I could kill myself. I could kill myself. I could end everything. I would never have to do anything stupid or meaningless again. I could kill myself. I could do it right now. I could just never breath again. Never see again. Never feel again. I could just fucking die and leave this awful place. I could.
