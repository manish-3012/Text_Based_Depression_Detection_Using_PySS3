How long have you considered Suicide? What keeps you going?I had my first suicidal thought at the age of seven. I lived in an abusive religious family, and was suffering the effects of isolation and low self esteem even then. 

Since then, it has been an on and off thing. I had a very suicidal teens and early twenties.

I find myself running out of reasons to live. I don't really have family, money, a plan, or a future. 

I was curious about others here.
