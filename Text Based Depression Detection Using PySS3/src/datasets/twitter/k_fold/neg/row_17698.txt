Just sad, don't know why life is worth living anymore.My life's gotten continually worse no matter how strong I stay. I feel alone, and like life isn't worth living. I usually work through these things very well but tonight is different. My life's really slowly getting worse every day. And I thought it was bad as a little kid. I wish I never had let people in close just to get hurt all the time. I'm not going to kill Myself right now but I just can't see the point of living such a bad life.
