I have been wrestling with myself all week.Im so tired. Im exhausted from thr pain in my head, thr ringing in my ear. The constant nausea that threatens to make me roar in frustration.

Do you know what its like to not want to die. To be so close to freedom but all you can feel is the insane anger that threatens to overwhelm you? To smart smashing everything you have left in this world so you will stop be a coward and simply pull the trigger.

My whole life has been this. And i just want it to be other. My life has bee the life of a bird trapped in a nice, cozy cage. But I am a raven. I am death borne on wings and blood calls to me. Nothing excites me more than destruction. I feel as is I must explode into my fiery fury to allow the calm embers of civility to glow.

I have tried to tell thr doctors what I am, but carefully trying to stay out of a cell.

Incarceration would be the worst. The cage of my mind is insanity with so much noise.

Help me. I tossed on a sea of rage and sorrow. I would have made an excellent soldier in days past.

I would have been a warrior. And now I suffocate in netflix and shitty food.


Save me. Give me a soldiers death. A clean death.

I am buying thr shot gun tomorrow and the. Im going to meet my end. Without ever truly living and it makes me sad. But at least the pain will stop.
