Its incredible how long the human soul will hold on to hope.I need a miracle, and I know it wont come. On the eve of the last day, even as I've lost everything I'm struggling to pull the trigger. I know theres nothing left for me, I lost. But still I'm holding on by the thinnest and most fragile of hairs. The human soul is so unrelenting, and perseverant. It will do everything in its power to hold on to hope. Even when there is none left. It rubs its hands together, and generates a pathetic amount of heat. Just enough so in order to scrape the barrel and lift up even the stalest, and least useful residues of hope.

Maybe its an old dream from years ago, or day dreams about reunions with an old flame. Maybe its the memories of a day when things were okay, or the idea that those little things did matter. Maybe its the idea that things can go back to the way they were.

You think about how you can get back to eating okay food, or its possible for your body to feel stable, or you can genuinely look in the mirror and feel neutral. Not even proud, just neutral.

The soul will synthesize and prolong the growth of the smallest molecules of hope, when you are at the end.
