This is bullshitEveryone says the same dumb shit all the time. Youâ€™re either not trying hard enough or you donâ€™t appreciate anything. You have to set stupid small goals that have nothing to do with the actual reason youâ€™re unhappy. Letâ€™s just face it, in this life some of us are dealt with the shittiest hand possible, and sadly thereâ€™s many different ways your struggles can be impossible to overcome. Some of us are not gonna make it. A lot of us will kill ourselves, people can act like thereâ€™s some other way out, people can say â€œkeep pushing, youâ€™ll get there somedayâ€ itâ€™s all a bunch of bullshit to make them feel better. Nobody knows what itâ€™s like to have crippling social anxiety, and then a fucking pandemic hits America and you have to stay home in your tiny little room EVERY FUCKING DAY for a year. With your little dog that you love so much, but for some reason he just wonâ€™t fucking listen, and your family treats you like all you do is make their lives harder because you have so many problems, to the point where they literally think you like to be sad and depressed and lonely. But you canâ€™t afford mental health programs that ACTUALLY WORK, because you are fucking broke and your mom makes you stress out about how youâ€™re gonna pay rent on top of that. I do not give a fucking shit anymore. One of these days Iâ€™m gonna snap and itâ€™s gonna be over. I donâ€™t even care anymore, there is no pain worse than the pain I feel everyday when I wake up. I will slit my wrists and slit my own throat if I have to. My mother tried to kill herself too. And they just threw her in a crazy hospital and drugged her up for a week until one day they just sent her back out without any help, they didnâ€™t help her at all, they just threw her in a room for a week and then threw her back out.
