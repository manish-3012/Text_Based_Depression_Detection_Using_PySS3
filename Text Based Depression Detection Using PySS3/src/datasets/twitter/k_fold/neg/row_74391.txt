very unstable, need something to do in this momentmy emotions are changing very rapidly.   work has had me stressed lately and thinking about a new job is scary.  im letting work run my life and interfere with me somehow.  AND im home sick today.  which is making me worry about what is happening without me, if people hate me or worse.  my body is sick with some kind of cold.  has been for a week.  i havent been able to rest and get better.  my emotions are fluctuating between extreme states every 15 minutes or so.  i have a boyfriend who loves me but i worry im wearing on him.  how do i care for myself so im stressed and freaking out and being a burden to others?  is it possible?  in some of these moments today i feel sad and it makes me want to od.
