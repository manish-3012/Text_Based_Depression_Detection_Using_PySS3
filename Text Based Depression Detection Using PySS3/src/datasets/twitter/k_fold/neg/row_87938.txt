StrugglingI'm struggling to remember why living is worth it. I've been under the care of a psychologist for about two years, have been on Lexapro, have done therapy. But something changed in the last week. I've been doing ok up until then, haven't been actively suicidal since my ER trip in 2017. But last monday my mom told me one of the biggest regrets is being my mother, and though she told me that wasn't what she meant it has been blaring in my head since. Since that day, a lot of things have been a struggle. I've been reaching out to friends but they are ignoring my texts, I am trying to set up times to hang out for a little bit and they say yes and say they will text me when they are free that night but never text...

I just feel like I'm not sure I want to be here anymore. I'm a nurse, and we had a rough weekend at the mental hospital I work at, and by yesterday morning I was sitting on the floor of the med room thinking about just swallowing a bottle of pills and ending it all. I mentioned this to my friend at work, and she was concerned and had kept in contact. I was going to overdose on my new bottle of Trazadone, but thankfully I came to this sub first and learned it most likely would not kill me, so it was not worth it. But it scares me that when I thought I had a means that would let me just fall asleep, I was ready and willing. I did not realize I was that low until that moment.

But I just dont want to do this anymore. I am sick of feeling like it's never enough. As someone who works in healthcare, I know the stigma on mental illness. I know that it's so so easy to assume someone isn't that serious when their attempt fails, but I also know as a fellow person with depression and suicidal thoughts all the time that access to successful means is difficult.

TLDR: I want to kill myself but learned the means I wanted to use probably would not work. Don't want to burden my friends, and they are ignoring my attempts to reach out anyways for the most part. Don't want to deal with the ER trips or the med changes. Just want it to be over.
