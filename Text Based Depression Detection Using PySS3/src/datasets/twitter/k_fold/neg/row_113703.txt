Thereâ€™s no reason to live after being diagnosed bipolarMy brain is the bane of my existence and I didnâ€™t deserve to have this fucking brain that makes me insane and depressed on and off constantly thereâ€™s no balance in this fucking life and everyone would be better off not having to deal with me 

This is it for me. I will wait until after the holidays but after that itâ€™s game over for me. I donâ€™t want to be here and everyone is selfish for wanting me to stay
