Not sure how to title this one.I just donâ€™t care anymore. I quit my job to go to school because they wouldnâ€™t work with my school schedule. (The first time I risked anything and did something for myself) But I cant get another decent job and Iâ€™m flat fucking broke. I also had to drop out of school. I donâ€™t have any hope at all, I donâ€™t even try with job interviews anymore because I know I wonâ€™t get it(Iâ€™ve been rejected a fair amount because Iâ€™m too anxious all the fucking time) and I donâ€™t want to get my hopes up and spiral into a deeper depression. So Iâ€™ve become numb? I go from being numb to my bipolar acting up and all the fucking symptoms that come with that shit. I canâ€™t kill myself because family and shit. But I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I keep fucking up and I just donâ€™t want to try anymore. Itâ€™s just fucked and I canâ€™t talk about because I donâ€™t want to bring people down and I know it wonâ€™t help. Idk I just had to let it out, maybe someone will relate.
