Going to kill myself this weekendI had it all, a well paying job that I enjoyed, a loving mother who cared a lot about me, a bright future, but I had utterly devastating self esteem. 

I was just on my last internship abroad and schizophrenia hit, I was hearing a lot of negative voices. I kept ignoring my mother's emails because I held resent against her for no reason other than that my father raised me to hate her. I was so rude to ignore her. It's only fair that she didn't have room for me back at the house, so I had to move in with my brother and become even more isolated.

I damaged my brain with trying to self medicate the voices, by abusing anxiolytics. I committed an internet crime. I broke my own morals. When I snapped out of all the voices and everything I'm left with a damaged brain and a haunting past. I'm currently employed but I really can't do it. I can't write code anymore. I'm mentally incapable and I don't want to live in a dark place anymore. 

This is not a temporary problem. This is a permanent problem. I hate myself for what I did. I went crazy and fucked up bad. It ends this weekend.
