How the fuck do you do it?I don't want to die, which is why I am posting here. So, how do you do it? How the fuck do you live? Been depressed for pretty much my lifetime. Been on meds for nearly a decade... until now because I am unemployed and lost my medical for me being lazy stupid and careless. Anyhow, I'd call the suicide hotline but I dont want to wake anybody. I am here because I dont trust myself.
