Iâ€™m not sure what to do.   As a child Iâ€™ve experienced things that I wouldnâ€™t wish on anyone that young. People around me still say Iâ€™m young (Turned 16 in April) but I really donâ€™t feel like it. My life circumstances forced me to grow up pretty young, leaving my childhood wonder and innocence before I hit double digits. 

     I have also made some horrible choices as a coping mechanism of previous traumatic memories in my past. In doing said stupid choices Iâ€™ve fucked my future, my happiness and brought on too much shame and guilt to handle. I canâ€™t tell anyone about my charges cause Iâ€™m too embarrassed. It feels like shit having no one to talk to. Iâ€™m currently on house arrest for child pornography. Yes I know fucked up, you can judge me all you want as Iâ€™ve shamed and humiliated my self to no end anyway.

   That charge was in May of 2017 when I was 14 and I am a changed person for the most part. Iâ€™m still horribly depressed and suicidal but I have changed and I cannot get it across to the system. I just feel so powerless, I want to regain control of my life but thatâ€™s literally impossible being that Iâ€™m in the Canadian Youth Justice System. Only way I can think of is fucking off from this life. 

 
  Iâ€™m just so sick of being myself and waking up to my miserable life every day, and the only comfort people who know me and my charge can say is â€œyou coulda got it worseâ€
