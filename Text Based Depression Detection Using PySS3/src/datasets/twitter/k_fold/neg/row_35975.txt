I'm looking at the gun right now that will end my life. Over the past couple of decades I've grown tired of human interaction. I find people impossible to deal with. Due to my lack of social skills I was unable to keep a job. Even the lowest of goals cannot be reached due to my mental condition. When I go outside and look up at the sky, all I see is a prison. A gravity well that traps me on a dirt ball with others I'm incapable to interacting with. I've tried drugs and therapy, I've tried volunteering and just finding hobbies. None of it interests me anymore. I've even reached out to reddit before with my problem. I know that was a futile to try. It's not like anyone here has the magic bullet of reasoning and linguistic skills to solve my problem. The only bullet that will solve this problem sits in the chamber of this .38 revolver. Looking down it's barrel reminds me of a tunnel a prisoner would dig to escape though. Salvation lies on the other end of this hammer. Before the sound of it hitting the primer, I'll be free of the bars inside my head. Understanding that is first time I've felt relief in years or maybe ever. It slows my breathing and can feel the muscles in my face relaxing. This is the greatest feeling knowing that I can end it all now. 

Peace comes through a .38 inch hole in my pallet.
