Nothing feels like it's going rightI feel like my husband and I do not communicate well with one another anymore. We both have very different hobbies, and seem to run out of things to talk about that won't bore the tears of the other person, so we often spend time at home alone in separate rooms now. He's gained a lot of weight, and honestly I'm not sexually attracted to him anymore. He knows it's a problem, but he is doing very little about it and I'm wondering if it's because he might be unhappy with me. When he's stressed out it makes me stressed out. 

I'm currently going back to college switching career paths and don't feel like I could support myself if things with my husband end up not working out right now before I get my degree. Even with my degree I know it might take a little while for me to get a job afterward and I'm worried I might never succeed, because my degree is in graphic design which is pretty competitive. On top of that, I just really don't feel like I have much to live for. I don't have any friends I feel a real closeness to. My husband is who I used to consider my best friend, but even we aren't connecting well anymore. And, my family and I aren't very close either. I don't feel like I have anyone to lean on in this world. 

I just don't want to go through life with the mediocrity and the deep, physically painful unhappiness I feel nearly constantly. I would totally commit suicide if I knew a guaranteed way that wasn't painful, but alas I am unfortunately not intelligent enough to even figure that out. I am stuck on this world completely miserable, and I want to escape so so badly.
