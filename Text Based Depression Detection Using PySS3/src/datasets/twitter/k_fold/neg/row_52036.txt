Absurd lifeI haver been reading a lot of Albert Camus.
For what i get death is he's main theme. When You get It, that life is meaningless and absurd, suicide is definitely a choice. BUT he goes on how some moments are transcendental and truly happy, how rebellion for life, for doing absurd happy stuff ( for godsake, his pre nobel prize Interview was in a soccer game!) IS the goal .
I wish I could understand what he is talking about, the Second part. All I can think about now is how I have a job I hate (health worker) , people suffering for no good reason and I can't do Notting about because of burocracy and too tio many patients. I tried getting into Specialized programs but I am not good enough to pass the tests.
Just the Idea of enter the ER or going to work makes me die a little. I wish I could go back and be an electrical enginer instead. Being a health worker , helping people , I wish I could be bettet, I wish I could diminish their suffer and my own.
But life is absurd, do something or don't do It, you are doomed.
I can't through away my parentes strugle to put me trough Med School.
Can't see a way out. Just want to vanish. (Don't know How to do that without hurting the Very few people in my life)
It's unbereable , Just jeep going with booze and benzo? At least not causing so much suffering around me.
