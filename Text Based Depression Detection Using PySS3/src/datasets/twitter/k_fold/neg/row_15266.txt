Getting tiredJust being by my self for the longest time alone and it just seems like it would just going to continue being like this for ever. Iâ€™m just never going to fit into anywhere or anyone.forever alone. I just want it all to end. I just always feels empty inside.

I always think of just ending it all myself but when it comes to it all I could do is cut myself but never actually get the courage just go deep and ending it all. No is probably gonna miss e anyways, not like I have any friends.
