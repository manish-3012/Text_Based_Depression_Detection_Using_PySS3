I messed up big time and now I want to dieI did something stupid a year ago and now Iâ€™m freaking out

Warning that this might be nsfw(Iâ€™m not sure if it is, just proceed with caution).

I used to be involved in a really weird fetish. I no longer do it and Iâ€™m honestly not sure if I would consider it a fetish because I donâ€™t think it was a sexual thing for me. Anyways, I was chatting in discord and on instagram with a few people about this because they were also into it. I shared some really personal and taboo stuff about this that is often frowned upon by society. 

Me being a stupid, naive teenager shared some private information that I probably shouldnâ€™t have told. I told them what state I lived in but I never told them what city or what my address was. The part that I really messed up on was sending them a picture of my face. I donâ€™t know why I did it, we had been chatting for probably less than a week. I canâ€™t even remember how many people I sent a picture to and itâ€™s really stressing me out.

About a month later, I deleted all of my accounts that I had because it was not something that I enjoyed(not in a sexual way at least). 

I just recently remembered this and Iâ€™m freaking out. If the conversations I had with those people got out along with the picture of my face, I would be publicly humiliated. Itâ€™s very taboo and something that Iâ€™ll never tell anyone I know personally. What are the chances that my messages will get out?
