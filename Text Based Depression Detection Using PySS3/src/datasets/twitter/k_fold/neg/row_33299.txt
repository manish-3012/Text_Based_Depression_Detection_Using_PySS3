BRACE YOURSELF! My story in 2 acts, going to need help with the 3rd.My Moral Suicide

**ACT 1**

Grew up in a nice Christian home. My family fit in that slot with the rest of our extended family. We even all lived on the same road. My mother and father were regular good ol' Christians.  Liquor and Power Rangers were evil. I was only allowed to watch Looney toons and evening news.

Family suppers at the same table.
Family vacations.
My dad built the house we lived in.
Church every Sunday.


This is where I developed my over developed sense of fear. As a kid, I was getting a sense of how all things end. At 11 I had a bad feeling that my parents were heading for divorce. So I went up and asked my dad,  even though the idea of it in our circle of family and friends seemed ridiculous.

â€œDad, are you and mom ever going to divorce?â€ He laughed, hugged me and said â€œNo, never. Your mother and I love each other.â€

Year and a half later they divorced. 

**SONIC BOOOOOOOOM!!!!!**

Dad moved out. Mom kept the house. Got a shitty boyfriend. She became an alcoholic out of regret for her failed marriage. She just let it go when times got tough.

Anywho long nights she was gone, some nights wouldnâ€™t come home. I lied in bed wide eyed scared as fuck, praying she didnâ€™t kill herself. FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR FEAR. She had committed moral suicide and this, i guess, is how my path was laid out.

She even rolled her new truck drunk one night. Morning I usually had to nurse her hangovers. Came home most nights just to find her drunk, glassy eyed. I wanted to kill her. She'd pick fights and it would always make me feel like shit. I told her I hated her on a number of occasions, and I think I really did. Iâ€™d destroy bottles of booze and leave messes of it on the kitchen floor to show her how pissed I was. She'd try and get us to hate our dad, who in reality, is a perfect person next to her. 


My two sisters and I lived in fear and hate. Man was it fantastic! /sarcasm


It continued to happen. And she drove drunk ALL THE FUCKING TIME. Holy shit this pisses me off just writing this and Iâ€™m listening to Owl City; try getting mad while listening to this music. Try it, seriously. 


Anyways: I kept strong! I really did. My faith in God and Christ grew and grew, I figured there would be a light at the end of this tunnel. I enrolled in Bible School because I figured I was going down a shitty path and God was an answer i was willing to try. I did this because my Dad was still an upstanding straight edged good man who actually FOUGHT for his marriage, so he inspired me. 


Bible school helped, I made great friends and yadda yadda yadda nothing changed with dear mother. But something did with me. A+


**ACT 2**

**INT. COLLEGE â€“ MORNING**


Jack, 20, walks up to the COLLEGE DOORS for the first time; his smile broadcasting to the world â€œVIRGINâ€. CAMERA PANS across the vast atrium and all the beautiful women.


**JACK**
(under breath)

Fuck yeahâ€¦


Jack is me, btw. **BOOM COLLEGE FAST FORWARD!!! HOLD THE FUCK ON!!!!** 


I changed a bit, everyone kind of liked me because I was unique to them, different. In college Iâ€™m that funny dude but I was constantly aware that this â€˜blissâ€™ would end. That my youth would end and I would be replaced by a new crop of students. Iâ€™m so afraid of growing old. FEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAARRRRR.


Get my first girlfriend in the my first year. This was the time of exploring for me. She was even the first girl I kissed. For our relationship to progress, I had to shed layer after layer of my morality. The very thing I put my self worth in. I started to slowly commit moral suicide over a period of time until I lost my virginity to her. 


The first time I had sex I was so fucking drunk I barely remember it. Something I thought would have been special and something I was going to share with my wife flew out the window. And almost ever time after that having sex with her I was drunk. And it **fucked me up**


Then I did something I swore never to do. I drank and drank and drank and drank and drank then drank some more then puked then drank again. 


How to become an alcoholic:

1 part school stress

2 part destroy your very identity and self-respect with violence

1 revenge on your mother


Stir, then shake: PRESTO Jack is an alcoholic.


Im now done school, broke up with my girlfriend, feel useless, don't trust women, high sometimes, drunk every night, not giving a shit, lazy, out of work and i feel left behind; something I vowed never to become. Iâ€™m also fatter. 


You see, I understand that I've already killed myself. I am ash, a joke. There is nothing left. My foundation has been destroyed. I'm a jellyfish on hot sand as the tourists walk by and poke me with a stick.


I deal with my destruction by drinking and forgetting my failures and my fears. I'm 24 and I haven't hit a bottom yet. Sober nights (rare) I lie awake and I'm forced to "think" about what my life has become. I'm not even depressed. I'm confused. How did this happen? Im unable to take risk i'm so afraid of EVERYTHING. Why did it happen? WTF GOD?! I think about suicide and it makes me feel better, I know this is not healthy. Please help. 


Atheist responses welcome. All responses welcome. Even if your response is "GO FUCK YOURSELF! HAVE YOU EVEN READ OTHER POSTS ON THIS REDDIT? YOU'RS IS PIDDLEY SHIT!!! GTFO"


I'll take it in stride, but I really do need help before I do something even more retarded


*ACT 3*
