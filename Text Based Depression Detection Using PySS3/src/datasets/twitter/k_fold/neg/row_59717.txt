I've never been more readyI've got a note, a plan. I'm good to go. Humanity is garbage. We're all fucking horrible greedy individuals. Hell is the absence of God and I'm living in it. I'm ready to go. I've got the bath ready and a blow dryer. I've never belonged anywhere and I never will. I'm so fucking sick of being me. I'm not the weak one. Everyone else just doesn't want to admit that life is a fucking miserable waste of time. Nobody else has the courage to off themselves. Fuck you for thinking that it's your fucking responsibility to "save me". You're all stupid for thinking that you'll make a difference and I'll never understand why you bother with this shit. 

I'm so ready to go. The train is in the station!
