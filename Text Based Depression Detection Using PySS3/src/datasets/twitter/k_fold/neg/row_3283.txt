What Happens Next?[Throw-away]

I don't know what to think anymore. I've had an average childhood with a family that loves me, and they're the only thing keeping me from ending it all. Ever since I got out of the military five years ago my life has been in shambles. I drove a lot of my old friends away from chronic alcoholism, and just feel disconnected from people. I eventually quit drinking, and things got better for a bit, but nothing great happened. I worked a bunch of shitty part-time jobs because I have a minor misdemeanor that prevents me from getting jobs that were once my dream. So I pursued a degree in a trade I thought I wanted to do but didn't certify in. So now I have a degree, but nobody wants to hire me because of the lack of certification, and now I'm so fed up, I don't even want to pursue that education anymore. I've used up my GI Bill, and am in credit card debt. I'm stuck living with my parents, and although I'm greatly appreciative of it, I'm absolutely embarrassed that I do at 27 years old. I'm sick of failure, I'm sick of it all. All I want to do is go back in a time-machine and stay in the military. I thought life would get better when I got out, but what point did it matter? Life got worst inside. No girl has ever loved me, and never will, and I'm gonna be 40 years old working at some shitty job living with my parents. I just don't want to deal with this anymore. I've dealt with this thought for five years, and have even sold my gun to prevent it, but it's just becoming too much for me inside. I want a way out.
