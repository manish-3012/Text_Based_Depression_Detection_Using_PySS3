talking to my mother was the last nail in all this.I called my mother to ask for 20 bucks. She agreed.  I tried to open up to her and she just interrupted and said "you made your choices a long time ago". 

Revenge suicide is very mean so I feel bad that I will commit suicide after my mom said that to me.

But at least the last thing I told her is that I loved her.

I figure just go get a frozen pizza or something tomorrow. I wish I could get a real pizza but if I could, then I wouldn't be committing suicide.

It you keep things in perspective suicide isn't that big of a deal. 

The people I care about, the people who care about me are just waiting for me to do it.

For once, I won't disappoint.
