When do I get to be happy?When the fuck do I get to be happy?

When is it my turn?

They say live life for the little things but if I'm *really* supposed to live for the little things then I'll just end it now.

I'm fucking miserable and there's no plausible future that this ends for me. So why am I supposed to be working endlessly, desperately hoping that there *is* a future where I'm not miserable?

Anyone who says "be positive" just feels insincere. I put tons of effort into my future and still fail. Maybe the "positive" people can still survive but I just don't have that. My brain isn't wired like that, and I hate to say it but the only way to fix that is with hard drugs.
