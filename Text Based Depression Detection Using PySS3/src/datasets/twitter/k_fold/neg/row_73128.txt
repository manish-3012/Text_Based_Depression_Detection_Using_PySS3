Advice on helping suicidal people at bipolar threadI'm a poster for the past month in the sub bipolar because I have bipolar disorder type I. I've been suicidal before many years ago but never tried to commit suicide. Sometimes people post about feeling suicidal and I don't always know how to respond beyond the basic go to an ER for help. Any long time posters here have advice on things to say or avoid saying? I would like to help but worry about making things worse. Thanks!
