I need helpI've been battling suicidal thoughts for 2 years now, I don't really have a way of coping with it. I feel my urge is growing ever stronger and I'm at a point in my life where I really don't see another option if I ever want to find peace. 

I need a friend.

For some reason I wanted to write a poem describing my feelings, so I did. It took me about 15min and I'm no poet so don't bash on it too hard. Feel free to interpret it yourself or ask me what I meant. Here goes:

His soul is vacant

Forever asleep 

Now the expression is blatant

His heart buried deep

Nightmare takes form

Dreams die young

Lost in the storm,

Till his body is hung
