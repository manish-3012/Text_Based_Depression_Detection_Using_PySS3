I don't care what happens to meI dont care what happens to me. I'm garbage anyway. I'm tired of trying to build something of myself. Everyone gives up on me eventually. I cant shake the feeling that im running from the inevitable.  Spinning my wheels in the mud. I cant bring myself to eat, shower, speak, get out of bed or anything. I have to go the fucking work tomorrow. Do I just quit my job and rot in this bed? I've already attempted suicide twice in the past couple of days. The pills made me vomit the second time. Im kind of scared to try again, I may just go into a coma and get brain damage or something.
