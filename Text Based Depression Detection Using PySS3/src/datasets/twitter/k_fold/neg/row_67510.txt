Finding the strength to tell your s/o?I want to talk to my boyfriend about how I feel but I always feel so guilty. He's been through much harder situations compared to me. I've always felt like my depression and thoughts of suicide have never been justified so I've always just refrained from talking to him about things like that. I think a part of it comes from the fear of getting laughed at and committed to a hospital because my family has done that to me in the past but I don't know.
