I don't know how to hold on anymore.I always had a rough time believing things were going to get better if I just hung up and tried to make my life better.

I started working out and went back to university and graduated with a degree.  I switched jobs from one that I hate to something that I enjoy, but I'm still alone.  Barely hanging on and I make way less than I used to in a field where I was lead to believe that I would make more. (from Call centre jockey to Accountant).  But all I had since graduating is a life that is more lonely and more rough.

I scrounge and save only to have my car decide it's time to take more of my cash. (was a free car that was supposed to help me out) and instead it is costing me more than had I just signed something new.  I finally scratched and saved my way out of debt from the summer to just get dinged again this weekend with new bills.
I have nothing left to cut for expenses.  I'm eating in more often than ever, had next to no luxuries and I'm left wondering why I even bother to keep trying to fight.
I don't think I'm suicidal, but I honestly, just can't take it anymore.
