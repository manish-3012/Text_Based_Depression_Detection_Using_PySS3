I'm going to die tonight, and its not gonna be peaceful.I'll be honest, I dont really want to die. I'm afraid of death, the confusion of not knowing what happens. It frightens me.  


But this loneliness has torn me to pieces for too long.   


All I ever wanted, ever needed was to be loved. I wish I could die slowly, peacefully in my sleep, thinking about another life with a lover.  


But no, here I'll die, alone, freaking out, scared, bloodied.
