i cannot stand this ringing in my head much longer.I have had loud (80db at times) constant ringing, whistling in my ears, head for 3 years now. Its from hearing loss due to working in bars and dj for years. I have struggled with alcohol and pot issues and struggled with paxil. i am sober now. I have suicidal thoughts every min. of everyday. I used to think i was depressed years ago, nothing can compare to the depression i am feeling right now. I'm with my parents, but am losing my will to go on, i feel its a matter of time before i do something truely stupid. of course i do not want to die, i just want relief from this noise and the anxiety and depression. i know i will never get relief from this noise. only thing louder is the shower. its piercing. everyone says just live with it i get that, but what if you dont want to fucking live with it??!? it kills me that i didnt take care of myself all those years, and now i really dont feel like it at all. i am on 6 fucking drugs right now for my depression and anxiety trazodone 300mg, immovane 5mg, pristiq 50mg, seroquel 100mg, librium 5mg, and ativan 0.5mg  daily. i am a zombie. is there really light at the end of the tunnel? i live with my parents and i barely talk to them. am in a new city and am fearing the worst. what do i do!?
