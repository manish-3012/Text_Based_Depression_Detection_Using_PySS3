Thoughts never leaveI have been a sad person for 53 years now and it never gets better. I know with 100% honesty my mother loves me. Everyone else loves me when it benefits them. Even my kids. Thatâ€™s what hurts a lot. Tonight is Christmas Eve and for the first time in my life, I am alone. Tomorrow I wake up a lone. Despite what I do, Iâ€™ll wake up tomorrow cause I love my mother, and solely my mother, enough that I would never hurt her. I donâ€™t remember a day when I didnâ€™t want to die. God brought me here and never should have. Why did they save me? Whatâ€™s life lesson Iâ€™m trying to teach? My sons decide to lecture me on my faults and not in any of it did they mention anything I do right. Sure I spend way too much on gifts and now the things they say leave me again just thinking and thinking about death. The end. Itâ€™s over. It has been and always will be my fault and they even say how much Iâ€™m at fault. What about them? Iâ€™m shut down and donâ€™t want to talk with anyone. This year I will learn to show no pain and start to show less care in their life. They donâ€™t need me theyâ€™ve assured me of that. I would like to know one day from each of them one thing, just one positive thing about me as their mom and one positive thing I did during their entire life. Iâ€™m rambling. I want to disappear.
