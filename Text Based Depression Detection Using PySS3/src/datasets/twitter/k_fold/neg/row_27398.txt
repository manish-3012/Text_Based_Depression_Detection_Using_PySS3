Feeling like ending my life because of not seeing any suitable careersI've been feeling low for a long time, but now I really feel like not finding any suitable career which I can take will be the major reason of my suicide.

Never thoguht my life will end due to such a mundane thing, but we all need money to live.

Software jobs sucks, corporate environment too.
