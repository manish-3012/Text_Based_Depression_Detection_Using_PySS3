How do you cop.This is my first post ever and I don't know how I got the courage to do this but I am in need of some guidance.

I'm so alone in this world. I have moved halfway across the country and am living in a city alone. The darkness, silence and solitude is just getting to me. 
I have no friends or family here, no one to talk to. I try to leave the house but most days I convince myself not too. Life is just dull and has no meaning to me anymore. 
This sadness has made me think that I literally have no meaning in life. 
I'm declining at my job, I barely eat, and I just don't know what to do anymore.

How do you cop on the day to day. How do you get out of bed in the morning. I literally have no reason to then to drag my corpse of a body to my job where I have done worse and worse month after month.

Please help.
