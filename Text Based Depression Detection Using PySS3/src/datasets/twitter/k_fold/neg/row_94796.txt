I don't know how to feel.I should be happy, I got into the university of my dreams, I have family who care about me and my family is financially well. But I don't have any friends or anyone to talk to and I just feel so lonely all the time. I've slowly been slipping back into depression. I haven't been able to sleep properly in weeks, I talk to myself so that I don't feel so alone, I eat way too much to compensate. Nothing I do feels fun anymore. And lately I've been just thinking that killing myself would probably be better. I feel so unhappy with myself and feel so alone and I'm honestly not sure what to do because I'm just not good enough.
