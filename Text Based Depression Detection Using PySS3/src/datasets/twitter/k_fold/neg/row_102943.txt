giving up againi moved to NYC with my boyfriend for a fresh start. iâ€™ve been here for almost a month now but iâ€™ve already booked a plane ticket back to my home state for monday. i just donâ€™t know why i thought my life could get better. iâ€™m planning on killing myself when i get back home. iâ€™ll always be unhappy, thereâ€™s just no fixing it this time
