I canâ€™t feel anythingJust gonna start by saying Iâ€™m 15.
About 2 months ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 8 months.
She was my first serious relationship. I had never felt anything with one. She was 16.
I never felt so happy and loved in life and everything was amazing. I had never been honestly genuinely happier.
I lost my virginity to her so obviously I have some pretty strong emotional attachments to her.
I decided we needed a break because she had bad problems with depression and I thought our relationship was making it worse so I decided a break could help.
It didnâ€™t.
Within the first week of us going on a break I had her best friend tell me she had went and had sex with another guy because she was angry at me for what I did.
It broke me.
She denies it ever happening but even the guy has told me it has.
We broke up afterwards but ever since then I canâ€™t feel love towards anyone now. I feel like everyone is going to betray me somehow or someway and I just canâ€™t hold a steady friendship or relationship anymore.
She has a new boyfriend now and still seeing her post pictures of them together kills me.
Iâ€™m in advanced classes at my schools governor school and Iâ€™m currently on probation because my grades have been affected by it and their threatening to kick me out which means Iâ€™ll lose all the scholarships Iâ€™m guaranteed and and Iâ€™ll be kicked out of National Honor Society.
Things donâ€™t seem to have an upside anymore and I just canâ€™t seem to keep it together.
I legitimately donâ€™t want to do anything anymore. It all just seems so pointless.
