Just got out of the hospital and I already want to kill myself. I thought that was supposed to help.I've been in the hospital for the past few days and somehow my dad managed to get me out today even though I don't think I'm ready to be home. Now I'm just laying in bed wanting to die. I thought the hospital was supposed to help but instead I just want to die. I don't know. It's probably stupid. I don't even have a reason to be depressed. Everything is ok right now. I'm stressed out about AP tests but I can't concentrate long enough to even open up a textbook or read a crash course book or anything. I just want to cry but it's like I'm not allowing myself. 

I don't know what my problem is. I came home from the hospital and I hurt myself. That's not what's supposed to happen. I should be feeling at least a little better. And now I'm so embarrassed to go back to school because I just got my friends back. I don't want to go back to being the crazy girl. I want to keep my friends. But who knows what will happen. I'm just scared to go back. I don't know whats going to happen. I just wish I could be happy. I was doing so great but now I'm...I don't know. I can't even really put any words into how I'm feeling. I don't even feel like I can talk to anyone about what I'm feeling in real life besides my therapist because I'm "too young" or my life is "too perfect" or everything is just too great for me to be sad but then again no one even knows what I'm dealing with. 

Flashbacks are going to kill me. I can't keep living through everything over and over again. Forget the fact that I've been dissociating a lot and hurting myself while I do it. It's scary to just be bleeding but have no clue what's going on or what just happened. I don't know. I should probably just stop now but there's so much to say but I don't want to bother anyone with it. Sorry I'm really sorry everyone.
