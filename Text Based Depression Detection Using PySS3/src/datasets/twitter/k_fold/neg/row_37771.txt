Someone listen plsI think Iâ€™ve been manic for the past few days I was considering driving all the way to New York from Mississippi to jump off the Manhattan Bridge lmao and I was also spending hours looking for hookers. I just realized how dumb what Iâ€™ve been doing is. Iâ€™ve posted in this sub like one hundred times within a year. Lol welp Iâ€™m gonna apply for a job tomorrow. Thatâ€™s all.
