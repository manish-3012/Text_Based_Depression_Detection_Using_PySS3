tonight tonighti seriously feel like taking all my sleeping pills that i know will kill me if i take all of them

i hate myself an i always have

i can not figure out how to love myself

scientifically

actually just feel love for myself

i eat right, i exercise, i act nice to people

i still hate myself

i just want to erase my memory of me

the only thing i fear giving up is the way i look and my ability to make art

otherwise, it's nothing, besides obligating myself to live because my family would hate it too much

when i smoke cigarettes or drink, i just feel like it is slow suicide

i have poison tattooed on my back
