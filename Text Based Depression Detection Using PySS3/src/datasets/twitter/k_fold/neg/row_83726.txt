ViennaSlow down you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight (tonight)
Too bad, but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right (you're right)

I might kill myself tonight. My girlfriend left me. She was my best friend. She was a person who knew everything about me. I think shes with another guy already. I'm not mad. Just in desperation. I can't stop crying.
