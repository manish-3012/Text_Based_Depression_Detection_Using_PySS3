Thought I had achieved goals but I need to end it for the bestIâ€™m 23F and I had enough. I got a bachelors degree and sought a professional life and moved to a corporate city. I graduated in June but havenâ€™t been able to get a job. I have a speech impediment so I canâ€™t even get past interviews, scheduling  specially phone calls. I have failed all my goals and my parents. I have no money and just incredibly in debt. I think today will be my last day. I will drive to a happy place and maybe have a nice lunch. I will then pick something up to finish the job.
