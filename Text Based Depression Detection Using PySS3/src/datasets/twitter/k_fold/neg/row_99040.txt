Benzos and alcoholLast night I took 90 different benzodiazepines ranging from 0.05mg all the way up to 30mg I .rank over 2L of beer and mostly polished off a bottle of wild turkey 81, why did I wake up the next day? my speech is bit slurred, I've lost my balance a couple times, but why the fuck am I still alive?

I'm trapped in a dead end town, my boyfriend of 7 years is leaving me tomorrow, I'm 26 years old with no job experience, my vision is so bad I can't legally drive, not to mention the random muscle jerks and spasms caused by my myriad of other pills. 

I don't know what to do.
