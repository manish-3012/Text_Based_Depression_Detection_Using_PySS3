I just lost my best friendToday was the first day of summer for me (m17) and I've been confined to the house because my mother doesn't think I'm safe to go out alone and today she started yelling at me and i started feeling disconnected from the world and I think we hit each other and I ran out of the house and I couldn't tell where I was but i think I ended up at my best friend's house and she wasn't home. So I stayed on her porch until a family friend took me to her house and I texted my best friend what happened and she msged me that her parents wouldn't let her talk to me any more.  And recently I've been feeling ok and I've been able to see myself in the future in a few months but after this whole episode I can't imagine myself being alive anymore because she's my best friend and she's the only person I've ever felt valuable around and she's the only reason I'm still alive and I don't really know why I'd still be alive in a day if I can't talk to her anymore.
