20th OctoberI already have it planned for that date. I made a list of things to do before I left.

All my life being a failure. All my life being unlovable and unfixable.

No more pain, no more loneliness, no more hopelessness, no more anxiety and no more existence.

My birth was a mistake. I would like more to erase myself than to kill myself.
