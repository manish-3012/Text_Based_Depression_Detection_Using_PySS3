I can't take this shit thinking of just offing myselfHow can I escape this endless cycle of torture that society has placed on us. I am at the brink university is taking a massive toll and I rather not do it but since my parents are Indian they will probably disown me if I ever bring it up. Its either this or leaving everything behind and running away. I don't care what my parents think tbh. I haven't talked to my dad in over 3 months can't stand the guy. Never talk to my mom treats me like a baby. I just wanna run away or just off my self with some pills or cut my wrists.
