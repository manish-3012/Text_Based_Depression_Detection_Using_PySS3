Vent: My online friend is going to kill himself.Back in October of 2019, I became friends with a guy online through an LGBTQ+ Instagram matchmaking account. I fell for him, he fell for me, but his ex girlfriend came back into the picture and he got back with her, even though the history of their relationship was horrible.
She was emotionally abusive towards him, and at some point before they broke up the first time she made an elaborate lie about how her mother said she couldnâ€™t date him anymore so she had to block him, when in reality she just didnâ€™t want to tell him that she didnâ€™t want to be with him anymore.
Despite that happening, they were off and on for a few months. He would come back into my DMs for comfort during their fights, I would provide it and fall for him a little more each time but I didnâ€™t act on the feelings anymore since he was taken.
Now, a few weeks ago, his girlfriend split ways with him again, and when she did, she told him that it was because he was suicidal and that the only reason she stayed with him at all was because she felt sorry for him. She stomped on his pride and tore his heart out.
Heâ€™s come back to me, and this time heâ€™s staying, but his suicidal thoughts are even worse than before. I worry for him, Iâ€™m doing everything I can to be there for him, but Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™m not enough. I feel like I canâ€™t break through to him and Iâ€™m really afraid that itâ€™s going to happen soon. He doesnâ€™t realize how much he means to me. I would go to the ends of the earth for him. I just wish I could take his pain and sadness away. He says that there is nothing I can do to help him, that heâ€™s too far gone. I feel so useless. I canâ€™t just sit here and watch him die.
