Venting
Well the semester just started back up again. I still don't know why I'm in school. I think I know what I'm going for but have no plans on what I "want my life to look like" everyday I still feel incredibly sad and depressed, I still think of suicide as much as always. I'm almost 27, have no friends( never really have) in not a people person, I don't relate to things people my age having going for them, I'm a home body have bad anxiety and am always moody or upset about something. I feel like I'm wasting my time I school. I'm just too much of a chicken to attempt suicide. I want to, I have the resources I need to do so. I'm not worried about IF I die,  I'm worried about what happens if I DONT die. Idk I posted something like this the other day, I just use this to vent. I'm slowly getting more and more depressed and idk what to do. I want to end it all
