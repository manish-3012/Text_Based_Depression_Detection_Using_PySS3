I Tried to Commit Suicide by Cop one Year agoIt was the 27th of December 2019, it was so close to actually happen, my plan was about to work but a gunshot that was aimed to scare me stunned me right in my track. I was a second away from pulling out the fake gun, I was tackled from behind before I was able to, I was immediately arrested and sent to the suicide ward and later the psychiatric hospital.

I didn't know it at the time but I was in a state of psychosis, I had already been suicidal for a very long time but it was the state of psychosis that actually put my plan into action.
