Day after drinkingYesterday I made a post here after I got drunk for the first time. Today is the day after that. Iâ€™m 19 by the way.

I really want to do it again. To sum up Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with depression for about 6 months now and have constant suicidal thoughts. But when I got drunk I didnâ€™t feel depressed at all. I felt good and happy. I have some more bottles left over from last night and I want to feel like that again. 

Iâ€™m mostly a little scared if I can become addicted to this. My dad is an alcoholic actually and heâ€™s been drinking for over 20 years so Iâ€™d hate to turn out that way. 

Do any of you drink when youâ€™re down? How often? I think I can control myself to not overdo it.
