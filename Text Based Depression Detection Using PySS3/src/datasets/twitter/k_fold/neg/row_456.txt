Ive made my peaceI've made so many mistakes and have repeated these mistakes over again. I'm a failure in all aspects of my life. My life is going nowhere. I can't see a future for me. 

Tonight I took a handful of oxycodone and muscle relaxers. If I die tonight I've made my peace with this world and beyond, but if I wake tomorrow I'm not sure what to do with myself. This is my first attempt and I don't know if I can bring myself up for another, but I don't want to live anymore
