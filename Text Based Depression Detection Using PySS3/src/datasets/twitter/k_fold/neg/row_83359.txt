4 years since the last time I was raped and the anniversary of it is too much. I can't keep doing this... I can't keep living in this fear.I have been dealing with sexual abuse from ages 12-19. A month from being 19, I got to go to college and break away from the abuse. I've been raped several times over, I've been molested, I got pregnant at 16 and had to give my baby away, and I've seen so many friends ruin or end their lives. But when I experienced my last sexual assault on 10/31/14, I died inside. 


TRIGGER WARNING: I'm going to go into detail about the night of the assault. 

So I got to college and I felt free. I began a relationship with who I thought was a good guy. (He later became abusive) well, Halloween night of that year we were partying at his place and he goes into his bedroom with my best friend/ex girlfriend and they proceed to cheat on me. So I walked home. In the city. At 3am. In a slutty Halloween costume. 

I was almost to my dorm when I decide to take the fast route behind another building and away from the road.
