Just so done...I don't want to live anymore.

Living is nothing but torture every single day.  Every day at work is a struggle because I know I'm being fired but everyone there refuses to help me address whatever problem they have with me.

I barely have any friends and the ones I do have don't understand.  My family fucking sucks and hates me.  

I'll never find love or happiness on this shitty fucking planet.  I just want to go to sleep and just never wake up so I can finally be free of this shit.
