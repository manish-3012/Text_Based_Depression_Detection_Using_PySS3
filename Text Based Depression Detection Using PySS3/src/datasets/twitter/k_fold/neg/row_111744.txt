Just got out of hospital for voluntary admission on account of intent to/attempted suicide. Wanted to say thank you for your kind words.As some of you may know, being in that position is very confusing and when you have your mind set and you have a plan ready to go, it's hard to slam on the brakes when the brakes are on fire and the steering wheel is on fire and really everything is on fire. I posted here and then my brain kinda turned off. 


After some convincing, I admitted myself and I've had time to calm down. It felt good to have a short break from my hectic life to be able to think, and to put myself in the care of others. I was too close. It was lovely to open up my inbox and see your kind, wonderful, caring words. You people are doing a great thing, and never feel as though you aren't appreciated for taking the time out of your day to do so much as message someone who desperately needs your help, or for someone to acknowledge that their problems are very real and very much fixable in more ways than one.

Even though it's not always said, I'd like to say thank you on behalf of many who have come here and found what they needed.
