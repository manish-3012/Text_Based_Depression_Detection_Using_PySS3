I can't muster up the strength to go to class anymore. Or do anything really.I'm tired of college

And I'm tired of life. I haven't gotten out of bed in three days. I already missed a few classes and a doctor appointment (which I'm not going to get back until June because health insurance in my country sucks). I don't want to continue living. I already tried to kill myself twice in the past but I guess those weren't enough. I can't even use sleep as an escape anymore because I either oversleep and wake up feeling like I'd rather be dead or can't sleep at all for days. 

I swear I'm going to kill myself if I fail this (or any) semester. Finishing college is basically the only thing keeping me back from suicide but, ironically, I hate lectures and attending them just makes me feel worse. Is there even a point in going on like this?
