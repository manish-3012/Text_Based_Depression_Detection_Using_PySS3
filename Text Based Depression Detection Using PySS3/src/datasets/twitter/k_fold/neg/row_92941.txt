Having a rough day and called the crisis teamBeen having a rough day well a rough few weeks. Decided I was done with living last week. Put some plans into motion and started prepping for today to be final day of living. Yesterday some stuff happened. Had a long really emotional talk with my best friend. I think he picked up that something was up. Left me doubting if it's the right thing to do today. I'm still unsure if it's the right thing to do. I have all my prep ready and just feel loster than usual. Been going to regular therapy for a while and I've been fairly blunt with them so I had a list of numbers from them including the access team number. Decided if anytime was the time to call it, it'd be today. So I rang up spoke for about 20 minutes and was told I'd called back later today from the nursing team. Now I'm stuck in limbo and still just as lost as before. Not really after anything from this just want a record of it. Maybe someone's going through the same stuff. The access line thus far hasn't been a terrible experience. No police knocking on the door and been told I'll be called back within 4 hours. How's everyone else's day going?
