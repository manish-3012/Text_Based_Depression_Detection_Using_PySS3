Questions about writing a noteI am going to start writing my note soon and I have a two questions about writing it. My first question is, should I write to my friends? I want to write part of my note to my friends, but my parents probably wouldnâ€™t let them read it. My other question is, should I include all the reasons I am killing myself? I want to include a big â€œfuck youâ€ to my mom and explain how horribly she treated me, but I feel like she might of cared about me. I think that it would be to harsh to say that she drove me to suicide and I donâ€™t want her to live with that guilt.
