Im getting thereI honestly am in mental pain everyday. I seriously considered a lobotomy but it is not done anymore even with consent. I just cant be happy, nor can I see happiness in the future. I am in tons of debt, in college, working a hard job for no money, have depression, OCD and moderate social anxiety and selective mutism. I dont know how coming on here is going to help. Nothing else works though so why not. If I were to do it I would just OD because it is less mess for people to clean up. I can not and will not live like this. For the love of my sanity, please do not comment and say ``get out there``. If I could do that I would have but I can not. Thanks for reading.
