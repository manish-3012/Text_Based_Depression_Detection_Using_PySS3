I will never find love.What's the point of living like this? Why even wait? The older you get, the more bleak your prospects are. And for someone who's chances are already practically non-existent, why bother? Living 40, 50, 60 years longer just for the marginal chance that someone will be willing to look past everything wrong with me seems like such weak motivation to go on. 

It's so easy to tell someone that they will find the right person one day. It takes no effort to say and there's nothing binding you to that promise. You just give them blind hope and let them continue suffering. It's also easy to tell someone that they don't need others to be happy. Everybody has different wants. And if a person's wants won't ever be fulfilled, what's the point? 

I am sick to death of all the endless platitudes. "You'll find someone one day", "You don't need love to be happy", "It'll come when you least expect it". All said by people surrounded by loved ones. But I already know that's what the comments will be. That's all people can offer in the face of utter despair. Why even post this then? I don't know.
