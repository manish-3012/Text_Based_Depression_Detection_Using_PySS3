Sexual assault survivor trying to do â€œnormalâ€I donâ€™t know what normal is anymore. I feel as though Iâ€™m closed in this set of choices that Iâ€™m running meaninglessly towards, like a horse with blinders. 

Iâ€™ve tried taking therapy. Counseling. Iâ€™ve been prescribed countless medicines.

The flashbacks wonâ€™t stop. My attacker was a good friend of mine. One I never thought to be capable of such horrid things.

Now I am trying to restart my life. Iâ€™m in a relationship and I have a great job. 

But itâ€™s so hard to â€˜feelâ€™ good. I canâ€™t feel happiness and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be able to love anyone again. 

I feel trapped. Yesterday I got into an argument with my boyfriend, and I tried overdosing. I failed.

I want to think of reasons to stay alive, but I keep coming short. My family hates me. All my friends are away. My attacker got away with everything. My fears got me to the point where I couldnâ€™t even graduate university. I feel like Iâ€™ve lost all purpose.
