At this point, I'd say I deserve it.I've had problems with social anxiety before, I can't talk to people, I can't even go out in public anymore. But recently, I crossed the line. My best friend has been trying to talk to me for weeks, and I've ignored her. I've gone totally radio silent. She's texted me again and again but I couldn't bring myself to respond. The worst part is, she's the only friend I'm doing this to, and it's because she was my closest friend. With everyone else it's easy to hide how alone I feel, how close I am to ending it all. But she's always been there for me, she's the only one I could talk to when things got really bad. But now, now I think things aren't ever going to get better, I'm unraveling and I'm afraid that if I let anyone who cares about me get close, I'll only be setting them up to be hurt in the future. But I knew it was upsetting her, and I didn't stop. Until just this morning, I sent her a text, an apology, I explained that I've missed her. That I understand if she doesn't want to be my friend anymore. But it's all too little too late. She was so supportive of me when I was suffering. I don't deserve friends like that. Then what's the point?
