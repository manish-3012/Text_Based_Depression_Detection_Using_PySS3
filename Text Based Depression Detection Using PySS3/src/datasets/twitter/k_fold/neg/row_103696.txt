Iâ€™m thinking about it again.I always turn to these thoughts when things get too stressful. Iâ€™m trying to move, trying to switch jobs, trying to take care of my physical health, just had an expensive (for me) surgery that I know have to make payments on, I have more credit card debt than Iâ€™m comfortable with, I donâ€™t have a degree but I want to go back to school but I just have so much shit on my plate that I donâ€™t even want to think about, these bills due, those deadlines coming up. I canâ€™t handle all this financial stress, and on top of that I have to deal with all my horrible disgusting memories from my childhood, and I have to live this life with those memories for the rest of my life. The love of my life left me. My parental figure from my childhood is depressed and not taking care of themselves. And no one can fix any of this besides me. And Iâ€™m trying and fucking failing and my self esteem is shit. Iâ€™m in physical pain (that thankfully wonâ€™t last) and Iâ€™m so fucking tired. Iâ€™m pissed that I was dealt this hand of cards. What the fuck did I do in my past life to deserve this? Fuck.
