There is nothing to eat in this house. The power is _x000D_
getting disconnected on monday. I'm stealing _x000D_
internet from the neighbor. I can't provide for _x000D_
them. What use am I?The only way this bottom gets more rocky is if they take these kids away from me while I'm still alive. Why have to deal with that heartbreak, pain, anxiety as well when it can all end now rather than later... I'm so sick of living like this, that I'm sick of living. No one will hire me. No one will help me. I need a leg up.... A boost.... but there's no one to help me climb this fence and escape from what is essentially a prison of poverty and hunger. I'd rather be dead, then alone and homless.
