I hate myself and I want to die even though I know it's not the solution.I don't know.  I'm not physically insecure, I think I'm pretty and I'm very comfortable in my own skin as far as my body goes.  My issue stems from my personality.  I fucking *hate* myself.  You know how if you have a friend who annoys you?  And you can walk away or distance yourself from them for a while?  I wish I could do that with myself.  I really do.  I'm constantly with myself and I can't get away and I absolutely hate myself with a burning passion.  I have PTSD from childhood experiences, anxiety, other medical problems, etc.  I can't get away from that.

I just want to be done.  I'm tired.  I don't want to hurt myself I guess, I just want to be gone and stop having to deal with myself.  I want to escape my own mind.  Take a break.  I hate going to bed at night because I know I'll have to wake up and face myself again.  Fight with myself internally.

That happiest I've been in a while was when I felt myself going under anesthesia for a medical procedure.  I consciously could feel myself relax and go out completely as it was happening as I just remember thinking "finally".  I don't know if dying is anything like that, it's probably not.  But I would imagine that the feeling of getting away from yourself is.

The only thing stopping me is knowing pricks from high school who think we were "best friends" would  make it all about them and how much they miss me.  It'd be a loss of dignity if it came down to them  pretending like we were friends when they actually tormented me pretty good back before I graduated.  And the fact that I don't know what happens when I die.  What if there is a God that will punish me for taking my life?  I'm not religious, but I haven't put the idea of a God out the window completely.  Even worse, what if there is an afterlife and I'm still not away from myself?

I just want to get away from myself.
