If anyone is out there seeing this, I could really use some sort of support or someone to listen right now..I've been crying out for help for help for awhile now but it's been so overlooked, I feel that I have lost all reason carry on anymore. 

All my demons are suffocating me and I'm just withering away without the slightest care or concern from anyone around me. There is one person I have that truly loves me and supports me, but for him I must put on a happy, positive face. I can't share my suffering because he is currently in rehab battling his own diseases and fighting for his life. I can't expect him to fight for mine, too. I can't expect anyone to do that. I know that no one would, anyway. Know one cares. To them I'm just a dramatic and whiny girl because I can't fully share all of my pain and my true feelings. All my diseases and demons. 

It would be a weight off every ones shoulders if I just disappeared from their lives. 

There is still a slight logical part of me left the doesn't want to kill myself, but it's fading away and I just need someone to help me right now. 

Please.
