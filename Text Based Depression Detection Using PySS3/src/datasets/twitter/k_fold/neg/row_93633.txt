Over 30 years old, doing very well on paper, but had it cross my mind for the first time yesterday.I have had lingering depression since my adolescence. Itâ€™s not crippling lay in bed all day depression, but itâ€™s just this cloud that hangs over my head. My upbringing was actually amazing, I didnâ€™t grow up in a wealthy family so I never had luxuries, but my basic needs were always met. My depression doesnâ€™t really get in the way of my professional life and responsibilities, in fact, Iâ€™m actually very successful - about to wrap up a third degree, job prospects are wide open, I live very comfortably and I am grateful that I do not have to worry about finances. I can buy most things that I want without hesitation, which is one reason why I think nobody takes how I feel seriously. 

Another reason is probably because I have tried to hide my depression not only from other people, but from myself. People generally like my personality, people always say Iâ€™m really funny, that Iâ€™m a people person, that I am fun to be around, etc. But when I come home, I take that mask off and I experience the real me. I come home and have so many hobbies I enjoy, have a to-do list far greater than I have time for, but everything always feels so numb. I canâ€™t concentrate on anything when Iâ€™m home. 

For example, to tie the point from the above two paragraphs together, I love videogames, so over the past few years I picked up a hobby of collecting old Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 games by buying and flipping collections. By flipping collections I have spent very little money and amassed over $10,000 worth of retro games. Now they just sit in my closet. When I try to play any games, whether itâ€™s the old ones I collected or modern ones, my mind wanders because I donâ€™t feel the satisfaction from it - I just donâ€™t get satisfaction or joy from anything anymore. Everything always feels numb. Iâ€™ll get brief moments of pleasure and satisfaction pretty regularly, but then it goes to the default numb feeling again. This goes for several other hobbies. I feet that my life boils down to go to work, work really hard but feel zero passion, time passes until I go home, I get home and I pass time until I can return to work to pass time until I go home again. 

I try talking about it with others very close to me (I have three in my closest circle) and it seems like they try to listen but they discredit it in the end. Iâ€™m too happy-seeming of a person with too many great things going for myself to really be depressed. I have tried many different things to help myself. I exercise almost daily and take care of my health. I have tried St Johns Wort and actual antidepressants and they donâ€™t seem to do much. I have tried Adderall which obviously helps for the time being probably because Iâ€™m able to focus on the task at hand, but once it wears off itâ€™s back to baseline so I know itâ€™s not doing anything. I have tried CBD oil which seems to help, but ultimately I end up returning to my baseline. I know of a few life changes I can make that might help, but I just canâ€™t do them right now. I donâ€™t do therapy, simply because I went to school to do therapy... 

Nothing helps. Nobody listens. Never in my entire life have I had suicide even cross my mind. Not once. Yesterday I had it come into my mind, and it scared me. I would never do it because I could never do that to other people. But I thought yesterday if it werenâ€™t for hurting a few people I would consider doing it and have a far more difficult time shaking the thought out of my head. I donâ€™t want to, not at all, itâ€™s scary that my mind even went there. Iâ€™m over 30 years old and I stayed with the thought way longer than I should or even wanted to. Iâ€™m not at immediate risk or anything, I have way too many protective factors, but Iâ€™m upset that after my whole life, this is where my mind goes.
