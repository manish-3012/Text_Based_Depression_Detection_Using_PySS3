Chronically illI've never had a chance from the start. Life beats me down in a multitude of ways that leaves my head spinning and me wondering what point there is in anything. I can't even get out of bed. My fathers heart condition is worsening, as soon as he passes away I will follow suit if my health doesn't improve, this is the straw that broke the camels back.
