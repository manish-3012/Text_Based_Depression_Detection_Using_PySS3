How do I say how close I am to killing myself without sounding pathetic?A few friends have send me texts asking how I am and I am so sick of lying so I don't respond. I can't respond with truth because they don't want to know. People want you to say that you are fine. I am so far from fine. How do I tell people I want to die, that I do not care about anything? I don't have a good way to say I've been so depressed for a year now without even a week of relief. I have tried reaching out and doesn't do shit. I am just so sick of holding on for nothing. I want to keep trying because for some stupid fucking reason part of me still believes I won't always feel so bad. I still believe that I could be happy but that part of me is getting smaller and smaller everyday. I need help and I've tried getting help but it is never enough. I don't know what to do. Medication, therapy, alcohol, nothing is working. How can I explain that without bringing everyone down? I can't. I don't know. Anyway, thanks for listening to me ramble.
