AnniversaryItâ€™s been exactly a year since my suicide attempt. Iâ€™ve been anxiously awaiting this day, even if it doesnâ€™t make much sense, itâ€™s just a day, but I still feel weird about it. My boyfriend called off work to keep me company (after I asked him though..) so Iâ€™m not alone with my thoughts. My friends are aware after I brought it up to them and they check on me as well, so thatâ€™s a little comfort. Nine more hours and this dreadful day will be done.
