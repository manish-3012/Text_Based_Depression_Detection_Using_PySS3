I officially don't need this subI don't need this sub, not because I'm ready to die, but that I got the treatment, help and support I needed. I feel like my story is worth sharing. To avoid confusion, I'm a tall, 13 year-old boy

Two Sundays ago, on May 12th, I was trying to study after 2 hours of feeling completely unmotivated and hating myself for it. I got extremely frustrated, and on top of hating myself and the importance of the test I was having trouble studying for, I felt like death would just be a release of all this pressure, pain and stress. I went into my closet to get a belt, moved my bed away from the ceiling fan, and put the belt around my neck. The only problem was that there was no way for the belt to attach to the ceiling fan without my feet hitting the floor. It took me a solid five minutes to realize there was no successful way to die that moment, so I put everything back to normal, and continued studying, with no success.

That following Tuesday, I had to visit a nurse-practitioner for my medication. When she asked about my suicidal ideation, I told her about the incident on Sunday. Then she asked about whether or not I could ensure my safety until the next time I saw her, which would've been in about a month. After much thought, I said I couldn't, since anything could happen in a month. I maybe could've successfully hung myself after another depressive episode. I maybe could've jumped in front of a subway nearby where I live. Who knows?

This was apparently too much for the nurse-practitioner, who then told my mom about my suicidal ideation (which was new to her at the time) and looked up vacant spaces in nearby hospitals. I immediately panicked, since now the cat was out of the bag, and in almost no time at all, my entire family knew I wanted to die. I was taken to an ER, where I could barely function out of pure stress. I tried to convince my mom that I would be fine if she supervised me while I'm at home, and that a hospital wouldn't help me at all and would only make me more stressed. She tried to cooperate with me and the social worker, and everyone agreed that I could go home if I was intensely supervised, which even meant someone had to sleep in my room with me. The lock on the door to my room was also removed.

I felt like this wouldn't work and I'd eventually need my own space. I finally broke out of video-game frustration, on the afternoon of May 18th, and went up to my room and slammed the door. My mom immediately tried to get into my room, convinced that I was 100% definitely try to harm myself. I pushed her out of the way, and ran into the bathroom, which actually had a lock on the door. After an hour of my mom convincing me to come out and needing reassurance that I wouldn't try to harm myself in the bathroom (Even if I wanted to in that moment, how would I?) She eventually told me that we were gonna go to my therapist in their office in *INSERT COUNTY NAME THAT'S NOT NORMALLY WHERE MY THERAPIST WORKS.* I trusted her, but was immediately suspicious of the fact that she didn't need directions for the 40 minute drive. I was lied to, and instead taken to a hospital. There, I was admitted into a behavioral health unit for children/adolescents. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ten days later, today, I got discharged from the hospital with many coping skills and medication. I made some friends in the hospital, and had a rather nice time. I was diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) but now, my suicidal ideation is almost gone completely, and I sorta feel like myself again, a feeling I haven't felt since 2018. Although I was angry at my mom on the 18th, I'm glad she put me in that hospital. I still have to go to a partial hospital for about a month, so I probably don't have to worry about school for awhile. I'm grateful for my family, who've all been very supportive throughout this process.

This will hopefully be my last post here, so to everyone reading this, I hope you find the help and support you need. If not, if you've lost all hope like I did that Sunday, well I hope you find your peace. Good luck, r/SuicideWatch!
