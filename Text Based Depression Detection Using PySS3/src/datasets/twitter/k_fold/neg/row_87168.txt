Nothing is really worth it anymore.I don't find happiness or enjoyment in anything anymore. I feel like I'm an empty shell just existing. I lost the one person who made me feel safe and secure and happy, I'm alone on Thanksgiving, and I'm too depressed to even get out of bed. I don't have anyone to talk to who understands, and the only thing I can do is vent on Reddit when I'm upset. 

I don't want to live like this anymore, I've been struggling with this emptiness and apathy for years, and I'm just so miserable. I don't want be selfish and take the easy way out. I don't want to hurt my family, I'm sure they care about me even if they don't show it, but I just can't do this.

I try to find things to look forward to, but there's nothing.

Every night when I go to bed I pray that I don't wake up so I don't have to spend another day like this. I may have a lot to live for, but what's the point of living if you're constantly suffering? I just don't know how to deal with this.
