HelpFirst of all I speak Spanish and my English is not good at all.
For a couple of months now (since I ended my love affair) I have felt like committing suicide, I just can't be happy, I have a nice family, good friends and I don't suffer from needs, but since she left I haven't been able to be happy, there is a void that nothing can fill and I don't know what to do, whenever I have tried to end my life the fear and grief of leaving my parents wins me over, but I don't want to continue living .. today I found out that she already he has another, and it was the straw that broke the camel's back .. I just want to leave and I wanted you to help me find a quick and not so painful way to end my life.
