Stuck with only one way outIâ€™ve messed up my life terribly and I donâ€™t see any way to fix it. I have a shitty job, I donâ€™t have any friends or romantic interests, and my life is going nowhere. Even if I could fix my problems, Iâ€™m just going to get depressed again and end up in the same place. Why spend years fighting a losing battle when I can just end all my suffering now?
