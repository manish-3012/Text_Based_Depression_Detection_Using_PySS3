I cant wait to die. I maybe too scared to kill myself. But I'm thinking about buying sleeping pills and take most of the bottle.I really hate myself. I hate the fact that I dont know how or want to love myself. I been abandoned from my actual parents as a kid. Never weretogether. I was just booty call kid. And that's exactly how my life goes. I never was much to look at. Any relationship I get in it always go left. I have a very small penis so on top of that they never stay. I let people try me, bully me, take advantage of me, run over me my whole life. The things I went through in childhood still effects me to this day. I regret not standing up for myself in school. It was hell every day in school....I realize now that I will never be loved nor will I love myself. I'm done talking to women because there is no point. I feel embarrassed, desperate, humiliated, and I just want to die. I feel as though God hates me so much to where he wont kill me but just let me endure being tormented. Maybe God and Satan working together. Make me feel like I'm the worse person in the world. I don't want to be here no more. Before October is over if I'm not dead by then, then I must continue this life of torment and pain.
