Why notI'm still young and I'm trans and life sucks I've been bullied (just cause it's fun) and used for sex by multiple exes and my brother passed away just before I turned 10(it was my birthday 4 days later) I don't have any friends and I believe I have social anxiety and might be a psychopath but if I live till 18 I'll be checked out by my people. My life has been shit and I've been hospitalized for attempting before and I wish I would have succeeded. I'm going to bed hopping I could just die in my sleep. Gn.
