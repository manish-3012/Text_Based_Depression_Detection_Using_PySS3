feeling guiltyhow can people be so selfish. taking everything from me including my happiness, and when i want to end my life they take that choice away from me too. it's like i can't have anything my way in this life. in MY life. they make me feel guilty for wanting death. they say that the pain will  go to them, then should the pain stay with me till i can no longer take another breath? how selfish of them. but it makes me think about what i do. when i harm myself it harms them too. if i kill myself they'll forget about me as time passes. sometimes i want to be selfish. i want to not care about what others think or feel but after a while when i start getting too numb the pain comes back all at once like a tornado and it takes me off my feet. i physically feel heaviness on my chest and that's when tears start to fall.

i hate talking about this with people i know because they don't understand and they'll never understand. this is my choice. can't you see? i have no more energy to live. what else do you want me to do?  you say i can talk to you whenever i feel down but when i do it's like you brush me off and i feel like a nuisance. a bother that u don't want to deal with, but when i suddenly mention death you start with your selfish words again... i don't even know what i'm saying anymore. it's too much. i hate when i have a lot in my mind. i can't express them with words.
