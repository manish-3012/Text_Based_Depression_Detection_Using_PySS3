i have a good life, and i know it will get better. I still really really want to fucking dienot posting on a throwaway bc im a lazy sack of shit; here goes nothing i guess

a few days ago i attempted suicide. I first tried to do that thing with carbon monoxide; couldnt find the keys. tried to hang myself but the fan was too flimsy, and I was gonna electrocute myself via fork and socket but i was too much of a wimp. I ended up calling my mom (i'm 16) and she helped me, but i still really want to die. my mom is on a business trip so im staying with a friend of the family (my dad is a narcissistic piece of shit), and one of the few things preventing me from taking a bath with my laptop is that i dont want their 3 y/o daughter to walk in on my dead body. 

im trans and on hormones, live in an upper middle class household, have a great girlfriend, go to a great school, and have an amazing mom. i have no addictions and life is just going better, BUT I WANT TO FUCKING DIE. I DONT DESERVE ANY OF THIS AND I JUST DONT WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE

yes i have a therapist. she helps a lot. I still want to die.

i am on zoloft, and it is definitely helping. I recently had a depressive relapse i guess.

idk i just really need help bc i want to just fucking end myself right now and im not sure if i can hold back that much longer.
