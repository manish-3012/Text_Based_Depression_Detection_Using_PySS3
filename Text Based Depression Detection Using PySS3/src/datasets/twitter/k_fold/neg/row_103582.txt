This isnâ€™t even the worst of it. Happy fucking holidays.10 days of being the only sober adult in a house with eight adults in it.

10 days of three hours of sleep per night if Iâ€™m lucky.

10 days of being insulted, slapped, and screamed at by drunk and stoned assholes for not letting them give scotch or a pot-brownie to a toddler.

10 days of having to hide my wallet from literal millionaires so they canâ€™t steal from me again.

10 days of micro-aggressions and triangulating from a family of scum that have been doing this for generations and are *thrilled* to finally have a new omega.

10 days of cooking for a house full of people who, in theory, can take care of and feed themselves, seeing as how they havenâ€™t all starved to death since I was last here.

10 days of being told my cooking is garbage and hearing â€œThis is what I have to live with!â€ from my wife, while the people complaining about my cooking shovel more and more of it into their greasy fucking mouths and ask for seconds and **DO NOT ONCE ATTEMPT OR OFFER TO COOK ANY GODDAMN FOOD THEMSELVES.**

Okay, that last one is a bit of a lie.  Two days ago brother-in-law chested up to me and said he could cook bacon better than me.  House filled with smoke, his sweater caught fire, fire department and EMTs came, toddler was screaming and inconsolable, two vile lumps of burnt carbon were all that was left of his attempt at bacon, house **STILL** smells like burnt meat and smoke ... and the whole family agrees he won.
