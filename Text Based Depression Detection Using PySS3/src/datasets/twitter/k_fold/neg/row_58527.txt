i hate thisi hate this i hate everything i cant do this anymore im giving up i feel like go downing a whole bottle of pills and sleeping till i die. i have no one, my "friends" are fake as hell and they all have someone important in their lives thats always there for them. i have no one. my ex disappeared on me 6 months ago and i just havent been the same. my grades are absolute shit and my dad wont take me to go get help. he thinks im just a pussy and i need to grow up. i really cant do this anymore. i just cut open my thigh and i think i hit muscle. ive been having a panic attack for an hour now and its just getting worse. its so difficult to breath, i feel like im suffocating.
