Please help me i have no idea what to doI live in South Africa. Theres a very close friend of mine who i love very much who lives in the Illinois area. For the sake of this post im calling her Ann. 

Ann is 34, thats a bit older than me. Shes been living by herself for the past five years now. She is technically still married to a man who she has been estranged from for a while. For the purposes of this post ill call him Al. 

Now Al and Ann have known each other since she was 18, he is 6 years older than her and had kids before they ever met. Ann is a very shy and a very complex person, she dated him for a few years before they got married. Once they were married he began to beat her regularly, and he also began to rape her. She found child porn on his computer but she never reported him to the police. He puts her down emotionally by telling her that she is worthless and nobody apart from him will ever love her. 

When she was 29 he left her because she refused to sleep with another man in front of him. Despite this he still raped her and beat her frequently, and he hurt her enough so that she now believes that she is unattractive and worthless. 

Ive been trying to get her away from the town where she stays with him for some time, however she does not know how to drive and they share the same bank account. 

Or so she thought. Earlier today Al came by and revealed to her that they did not have the same bank account, instead she was merely a person who was allowed to draw money from his bank account, meaning that all the money that she had ever saved in her lifetime was his, and that now he was taking her name off of the account so she would no longer be able to draw money from it. Furthermore, he told her that he is now going to be moving back in with her.

Please Reddit, please, I do not know what to do and i need help desperately.
