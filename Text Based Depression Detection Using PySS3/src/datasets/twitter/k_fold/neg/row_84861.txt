Iâ€™m in a park.Itâ€™s sunny outside. Everyone around me is happy. The weather is nice and the sky is clear. I donâ€™t think I know how to feel happy or content anymore. I look at families playing and my friends laughing and all I can fixate on is killing myself. Iâ€™m so tired. I donâ€™t think I know how to feel happy anymore. I am uncomfortable at the least and suicidal at worst. I donâ€™t know what to do.
