I'm tired of feeling lonelyI have a few people that I would consider decent acquaintances . Whenever they need to vent their issues I'm always here to listen. Whenever I want to vent, they either ignore me, shut me down, or talk over me about their issues. They just glaze over anything I've said. 

Then I have people who are also going through things and the thought of talking to them makes me feel like I'll just be a burden adding on to their already full list of shit they're dealing with.

It's frustrating. I have no family. I was disowned for dating outside of my race. This pandemic doesn't help since you can't go out and meet people the way things use to be. 

I feel like my life has no purpose. Like my thoughts and words have no value to anyone. I feel like I don't fit in this world. Never have. I have no direction. I just float along.

I really feel like an outsider looking in. I just wish I had someone I could really vibe with. Someone who's non-judgmental, unconditionally loving, and understanding.
That's literally all I've ever wanted. It doesn't even have to be a lover. Just another human that I can share human experiences with. 
This is why I want to die. Because I don't have this. 

It amazes me the amount of shitty humans that remain here and have a full support team. But for someone like me, kind, generous, loving, truthful.. I just get the shit end of the life stick. 

I tried chopping wood aggressively to get rid of these negative thoughts. Following the idea of having a "safety" plan. Taking a shower helped.

I feel like crying is useless now. It doesn't bring change. I'll still feel lonely tomorrow. And the next day. 
I don't understand why I'm still here. 
Just knowing I have a one way ticket out of here is comforting. But I'm also too chicken shit to use it.

So in a world full of people, I have to resort to the internet to link with like-minded individuals to feel some sort of peace. It's quite tragic.

I feel you.
