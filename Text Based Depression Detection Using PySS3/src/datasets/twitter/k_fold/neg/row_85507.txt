I don't even want help anymoreI don't know what to do. I want to die but every way I have access to seems horrific. I see the rule is not to be explicit, so I hope this doesn't count, but if I had access to a nice method then I'm sure I'd have done it already. The thought of getting better seems like so much work and a burden on everyone else. Even here I'm not sure if I should be posting or leaving the space open for people who could really benefit from it. Suicide seems so much easier but I don't have the nerve for my options. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't think I want help but I don't know what else to do, and that certainly doesn't make it easy for others. I feel like I'm just setting them up to be hurt even more when I finally do it. I don't know where I'm going with this, or what kind of response I'm expecting, or even why I'm here, but I guess that's just a reflection of my life. I guess I should include a little about myself. I'm 18, male, community college sophomore, living in the U.S. I want to die all the time. I've always had to cancel professional help because it makes my family hate me. I'm afraid to take drugs because of how they're thought to damage brain development for young adults.
