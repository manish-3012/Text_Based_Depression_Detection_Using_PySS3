Update on my depression:I said awhile ago that I used to sleep off my depression. Thats not the case. Now I fall asleep depressed and I wake up depressed. I'm depressed 90% of the time. Nothing makes me happy. My suicidal tendencies drove me to threaten suicide to my mom and she asked if I had a plan. I said I wanted to overdose because all other methods of suicide are painful. So now she says she wants me to be serious instead of seeking attention because she's out of options and wants to take me to the ER if I'm actually serious.
