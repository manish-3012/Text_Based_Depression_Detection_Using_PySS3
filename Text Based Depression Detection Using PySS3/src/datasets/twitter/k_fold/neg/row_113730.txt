Just end thingsMy ex boyfriend and I had a court appearance today (For a Criminal Domestic Violence [CDV]). I didn't go up to the stand just had to be there. 

He requested a public defender but he made too much money for that - so I was relieved for a second - until after then he requested a jury trial. We were in an agreeance - before the no contact order was put into place that I would recommend PTI, and he would go along. Obviously, he didn't. 

I've been battling suicidal idealizations for a really long time, but it's never been as tempting as it is now. This is the first post I've made on this subreddit. I just try and help. But, I need help this time.

I just want to end it, end it ALL. I'll be shattered if he's found not guilty because he gets a better lawyer than me. Shattered, devastated, RUINED. 

I have the pills, and I'm old enough in the US to buy the alcohol to just slow the breathing and die a slow peaceful death.

[This is not just about him. He's the catalyst. I've been battling bi-polar disorder and crippling depression since I was 13, so a few months shy of three years]

I'm open to help, as it seems so many people here aren't. I'll take your advice and take it to heart. I don't know how to TL;DR this, so please read the whole thing. 

I don't want to live anymore. I think it might be hard to sway someone from my decision. But I think I want to make my family happy enough to see me graduate.

Thanks.
