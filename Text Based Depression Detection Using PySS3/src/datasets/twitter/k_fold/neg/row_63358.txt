getting my thoughts outI wrote it down so I wanted to write it down again. 

I've thought of this so many times it almost feels real. At first it felt extreme, but even that sensation has left me at this point. The shackles I feel tighten around me another notch each day, and no matter what I do I cannot escape what binds me. I just want to be free again. To turn back the clock six years and see if maybe I could have saved myself so much pain. Its selfish, I know. But the spots where the chains sink in have worn to the bone, and having put them on myself I have nothing to blame. No painful memory to pass the weight on to. Just my self to carry this burden I brought on myself. I don't know how much more I can cary. Maybe I passed that point years ago. Or maybe Just a week ago. Time melts for me, and i have little left to keep my demons at bay. I don't think I want to anymore. And as I try to recall I cannot remember a single thing I ever might have done that was not in y best interest. That wasn't just for me. I'm selfish, and sick, and have nothing that feels redeeming. And  I just want these chains off of me, and if I'm not due for some good news, I Think I'll rip them off myself. To set everyone trapped in my chains free. So the burden of my weight is lifted from all. So they can move on, and I can be free of this once and for all. I love you all and blame no one. Please be happy where I could not. And smile for me, knowing I finally beat Heroin. Once and for all, I can take my shackles off.

Thank you for taking the time to humor me, it means more than you could know.
