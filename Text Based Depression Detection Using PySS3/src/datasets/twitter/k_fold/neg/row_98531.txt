I don't know what to do anymoreI've already tried killing myself multiple times, and I'm thinking about trying again. I don't see the point in not doing so. I have yet to make someone proud, make anyone stick around in my life, and my only two "rocks" and slowly starting to not care about me anymore. I know that's such a cliche, but it feels like a breaking point for me. Not having anyone who cares. I don't like having people close to me because I know deep down I'm a horrible person, despite what people claim to see. I self harm all the time, and I'm hard to be around. I think of myself as a walking monster because of all of my scars. I just... I'm not ready to take on the world alone, but that's the only way I could take it on... I'm scared to be alive and I'm scared of myself. I just really don't want to be anything anymore...
