Everything is a mess!My entire life is a mess. 

I have a well paying job that I hate. I'm fairly certain my company is going to go bankrupt soon. The writing is on the walls for sure. There have been mass layoffs, including my work best friend who was honestly like a father figure to me. I still talk to him, but it's not the same as seeing him on a regular basis. The people left at the company are all miserable and fear for their jobs. The surrounding negativity is making my depression 100x worse. 

I'm looking for other jobs, but haven't had any luck yet. Found one that was decent, but I would have had to almost cut my pay in half, which I simply cannot do. 

Despite having a decent salary, I can't seem to save money. Things always pop up (vet bills, higher than normal electric bills, car stuff, etc). My emergency fund is always gone as a soon as I reestablish it.

I hate my apartment. I loved it at one point, then awful neighbors moved in and construction began outside my window (There are multimillion dollar homes being built right next to my complex). This construction is literally 7 days per week, 16 hours per day. I can never sleep! It's causing me to become increasingly irritable. I've spent almost $300 trying to buy noise canceling products. Oh, and I woke up to all of the gas siphoned from my car on Friday...

I asked about switching to another unit, but it would be a $400 transfer fee and higher rent. I want to just break the lease, but it'll be a $2,000 fee. 

I don't have too many friends these days. Most of them are married and have kids, but I chose my career. I'm slowly catching up, I don't think I realized how lonely a career focused life would be. 

I also feel like everyone who knows me is always annoyed with me. 

I'm at the point where I don't even know why I bother anymore. I feel like I have no control over anything in my life and that too much change is happening at once.
