i tried to get drunk enough to work up the courage to finally do iti normally feel so scared and unmotivated when i think about actually following through with ending my life, but i thought that maybe if i drank enough i could work up the courage and motivation to walk 10 minutes to the lake.  i wish i had something like xanax to top it off - to really lose all my inhibitions.
in my mind i would be so drunk/fucked up that i wouldnt even be conscious of what was happening, and maybe it could be written off as an accident so my loved ones could feel at least somewhat better.
instead i just laid on the floor of my bedroom until my girlfriend came in, visibly worried because i have been known for my suicidal behavior and i was pretty drunk. i wish i didnt have to make her suffer so much by just knowing me. i wish i could wipe everyones memory of me.
... instead  i guess ill try to find some bars and try it all again with my next paycheck. im the worst type of person.
