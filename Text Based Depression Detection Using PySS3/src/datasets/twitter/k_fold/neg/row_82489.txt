Idk.Not immediately suicidal this time, but I feel like I need to vent again, so here we go. I find it increasingly difficult to understand people. I'll watch some stupid shit on youtube, and I'll find myself confused. I can't understand why people would be into this outlandish shit that just wastes your time (ex. vine comps.). This is the case in everyday life as well, I see people and find myself questioning their motivations for saying things. I almost feel like they're not human, in that they don't function normally. They have to be stupid to be happy, I guess? (ex. talking about bullshit drama, banging on doors) It's not even like they're mentally unstable, these are regular, everyday people. I can't empathize with them at all, and I used to be able to at least understand the reason behind doing some of this shit. I just don't get it. I don't know if I described that accurately, it's hard to articulate exactly what I'm trying to get at.
