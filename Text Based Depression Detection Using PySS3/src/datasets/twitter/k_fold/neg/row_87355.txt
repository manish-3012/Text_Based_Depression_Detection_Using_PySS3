Suicide is lurking, nothing is interesting, and I dont have meaningMy brain is trying to create some form of social stimulation by dreaming and fantasizing about different scenarios, just normal stuff, sometimes things that make me think for a bit when I wake up so I dont spend my day thinking bout nothing.
I've been at this point for a couple of years now, my social life is nonexistent; I remember reading about how many words a human said a day, it was in the thousands... most days I only say 'ok' once and thats it. Music makes days go a little faster, its helping but that's the only thing I have. 
I guess all I'm going to accomplish in the time I spent dying is going to be a number in a suicide statistics paper, probably a cameo in the newspaper, maybe a guy is going to mention how he cleaned my skull pieces from the ground to his girlfriend. And after some time, people will forget about my existence, and I'll just be a corpse who helped feed a couple of worms
