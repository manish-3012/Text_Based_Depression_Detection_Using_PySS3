This is me, signing offGot fed up with being treated like shit. Tried to tell people to stop treating me like shit. Was treated like shit for "being a whiny, attention-whoring bitch."

Tried MMFB. No one responded.

Tried TwoX. Supposed to be full of nice women. Told me to suck it up. Told me I was stupid for thinking the way I do.

I hate being me.

Have no friends that I can talk to. My mom thinks I hate her because I forgot to do the dishes. My dad is drowning himself in alcohol. My brothers moved out and never looked back. My employer thinks I'm a problem. Probably am.

Not a problem anymore.
