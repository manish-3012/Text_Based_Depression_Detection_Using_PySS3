Iâ€™m scared of wasting my lifeIâ€™m 16, going on 17, and I feel like Iâ€™ve wasted my youth and Iâ€™ll just continue to be bored and miserable for the rest of my life. 

Iâ€™ve wasted my teenage years obsessing over my body (my face, my height, my muscles, etc.) so even if I donâ€™t kill myself, I donâ€™t have much to look back on. Iâ€™m also way too insecure and riddled with social anxiety to hang out with anybody and get into relationships, and I have super strict parents anyway. 

Iâ€™m so afraid that my time to be a stupid teenage boy is running out, and Iâ€™ll be off to college wasting my late teens and 20â€™s away to become a doctor before I know it. Yes, Iâ€™ll have a nice salary and itâ€™ll pay off long term, but Iâ€™ll never get those years of missed social development back. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll never have a not boring adolescence like all of my friends. Iâ€™ll never go to any school dances, have my first kiss, sneak out at night to do crazy shit, etc. 

Iâ€™m sorry if this was all over the place.
