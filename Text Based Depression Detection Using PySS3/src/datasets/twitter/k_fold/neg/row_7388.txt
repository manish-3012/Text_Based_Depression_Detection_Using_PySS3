Do i have depressionMy parents just say it's a phase but I've been suffering for 8 years now and I've already started cutting a while back and now I'm just staring at pills and am just so tempted to kill myself. I haven't done it yet because i promised a good friend that i wouldn't. I despise the person I am and no there was no single event that caused this. I've had it for 8 years after i was bullied for about 4. The bullying stopped about 4 years ago but it left me with no self confidence.

I was going to kill myself yesterday but i remembered my promise and i really wouldn't want that person to cry. I have almost stopped eating only having one meal a day unless my parents force me and i am sleeping roughly 1-2 hours a day.

Is it a phase and will i just get over it like my parents keep saying?
