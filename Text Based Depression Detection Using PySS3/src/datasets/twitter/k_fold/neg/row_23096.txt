I can't do itNot sure if this is the right place for this. 

I'm done. I feel like life just keeps beating me down. I'm fighting a battle I can't win, and I'm tired of struggling, I don't want to have to struggle anymore. It's just too hard and I want my life to stop. I can't do it myself, but I wish I could. I wish someone could help me.
