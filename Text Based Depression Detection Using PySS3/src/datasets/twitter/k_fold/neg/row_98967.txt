my life feels emptyi don't even know why I'm writing this here, but i think i need to get my feelings together and out there. i feel like a total peace of shit, I've always been mean to others, yet i feel the exact opposite, like everyone hates me, and despises me. I've been often violent to my dearest family, and i dont even feel remorse. I m feeling completely empty and numb, i can't even have a good cry. I can't even bring up good memories or think of anything good

. i don't know what to do, please
