I came very close to killing myself today.I know I need to change. I have been getting too controlling and itâ€™s affecting my only good relationship. The controlling is coming from jealousy. Itâ€™s damaging my relationship because I will tell her that I wouldnâ€™t like her to post selfies only because I donâ€™t want other guys hitting on her. I see that I am very selfish and probably donâ€™t deserve her. She treats me so well and does many of the things I want. I treat her like trash when I get upset, which happens easily. And I need to stop before I lose her. I walked around downtown for 2 hours or so trying to get my mind sorted out, instead I found myself wanting to jump in front of oncoming traffic or grab a cops taser and fire it at him to try to get him to shoot me. I walked back home because my girlfriend was worried about me. When I got home I grabbed the pistol and held it in my lap for 20 minutes thinking of why I should live. I chose to live and now I am here. Confused and hurting. I need to change for the better. Iâ€™m not sure how to go about this, Iâ€™ve tried this past week but Iâ€™ve snapped again. If this isnâ€™t allowed, Iâ€™m sorry.
