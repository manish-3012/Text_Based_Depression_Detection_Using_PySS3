It's getting harder to wake up.Being awake is a nightmare. Half the time I am numb, the other half I am in such severe depression I feel like I'm drowning.
I am genuinely considering trying to get a physician to allow me to end my life.
I just want my agony to end. I don't want to be living and feeling such anguish and sadness anymore....
I've attempted suicide before by ODing, by slitting.......
Why am I feeling such unholy pain?
I almost want my parents to just ALLOW me to end it. To understand this is what is meant. That I NEED to end my life..... That I'm not going to get better.......
