This has to endSo I thought I had a handle on this. Then my mom got diagnosed with cancer and she's responding poorly to chemo. I can't tell her that me and my gf just split up. My ex finally couldn't handle our toxicity together and our woefully unmanaged depression and severe anxiety. My mom just wants me to be happy and if she found out... I don't know how long she has left but our relationship is so that I've always wanted to die before my mom, I love her so much. I don't want to be here when she dies, and I don't want her last thoughts to be disappointment.

My best friend that I used to talk to in situations like this snapped a few weeks ago. Started talking gibberish and went insane and threatened to kill his family. He's locked up now and left an abused girlfriend and child alone to contend without him.

Every avenue is closing in on me, my friends were my girlfriend's, so now that we're split I have no one to go to. I'm living with my ex so every day is an empty reminder of what I've lost, I can't leave because I got laid off with no car and no prospects, my unemployment is about to run out, and my family won't take me in because of covid and the threat of my mother's compromised immune system. Honestly I can't handle the thought of re-entering the workforce, I have no will to leave my (or what used to be) room let alone be seen in public. Nothing consoles me anymore. I'm a 32 year old man child that's so broken that I foresee no possible relationship gracing my existence ever again. And I don't blame the world for that, I've ruined everything. 

I used to compose music. That used to be my life. I used to be a bottomless creative with so much potential and it's all wasted. The world is a horrible place with horrible people in it, and it's enough trying to face that reality, but now over the past several days my depression has been manifesting physically with terrible sleep, the desire to leap out of my own skin, a deep and painful pit in my core that feels like a black hole eating me from the inside out... Even my brain is deteriorating; I'm surprised I can manage to be coherent enough right now.

My body tenses and cringes so hard that my chest hurts, I want to scream until my lungs collapse, I frantically whisper for help under each raspy breath even though there's no help for me. I pray for death to a god I don't believe in, I want it so bad even though the concept scares me shitless. I'm a malfunctioning biological computer begging to be shut down, I want help and friendship and love and happiness and at the same time want nothing to do with it. I spend my days in bed now, my gaming/computer addiction is no longer of use to me as distractions are now obsolete: the monster now has me and nothing can distract me from it's horrific gaze.

I have nowhere to go. No one to help me. Therapy was never my thing, meds didn't work, and I don't want to be locked up for the sake of preventing others from having to worry about me. I don't want to die, I just want all this to end, but that means ending it. I've tried before and my gf and family stopped me. Well, my partner has left me, and my family isn't here, so now what? What the hell am I supposed to do? Life is meaningless, it's flavor a palate of grey static with no sustenance or nutrition. What's there left? Why sell me the ideal of a colorful existence when I've become blind? Why listen to the siren song of perseverance when I'm deaf? What embrace am I supposed to find comfort in when I have no arms left to hold? My heart is a husk, my mind is a cage, my body is a marionette with knotted strings. I want so badly to ask for help, but I'm not strong enough to follow through with what only help there is to offer. 

Sorry for the long post. I'm so lost and broken that it's taking effort to keep breathing, as though every wrong that floats along in my life magnetizes to my chest and exponentially crushes me harder and harder until breathing is the only strained goal I have left. I'm sick of this. I'm going crazy in here guys, I'm literally losing my mind and it's the worst experience I've ever faced and I'm doing it alone. Somebody help me please, I don't know what to do anymore. I'm begging you, I can't be this person anymore and if it means nonexistence then so be it.
