What is there in my life that makes it not worth skipping?Working a shitty job 8 hours a day for 40 years (if I even find it with my qualifications)? Coming back home to  hobbies I don't enjoy anymore? "Friends" that barely consider me a 2nd option? I'm tired of feeling afraid and anxious all the time, ESPECIALLY when life doesn't offer me anything good in exchange. This planet is a prison.
