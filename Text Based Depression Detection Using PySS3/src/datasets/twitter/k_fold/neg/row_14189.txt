Okay. I'm going to do it. I'm going to list my past mistake. Please tell me. Am I deserving of love? I've had clinical depression for years. Since I was 15. Now I'm 28. I was undiagnosed and didn't seek help for a long time. Between 17 and 20 I was going through the worst of the worst. I would die before going back to that stage. I was miserable. Full of self loathing. Wanting to die all the time. I was also drinking. A lot. And constantly. I was an annoying drunk to be around. Couldn't hold my alcohol. Would be a dead weight very often. Would pass out. Would be loud and embarassing. I've done a few dumb shit here and there. I was also quite.."loose". And would make out with people.. forget the next day. Feel shit about it. And disgusted with myself. I would randomly throw myself on guys. Even people I was not interested in in the SLIGHTEST. I never understood why. 

One night with one guy that I'd occasionally made out with, I was very drunk with. We were in a bed with 2 others..and I kept trying to make out with him. He said no a few times. It took me atleast 10-15 mins before I stopped trying and left him alone. I apologised to him since. And I have. NEVER. EVER done that again.

Even before this I wanted to kill myself. Since this..it feels like I am for sure not deserving of life. And I can't imagine why I deserve any love or forgiveness. Even besides that, I just look back at my drunken days with so much disgust. I hate that person. Even now when I get drunk even if I don't do anything wrong but I'm just little loud and annoying and drunk, next few days I feel so much self loathing. Sooooo much. I RARELY drink now. Only for certain occasions. 

This has been such a big source of my current suicidal thoughts. And I feel like why would anyone accept it. Why should anyone accept me.
