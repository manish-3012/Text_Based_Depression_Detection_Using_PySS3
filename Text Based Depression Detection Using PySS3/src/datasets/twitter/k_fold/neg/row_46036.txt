I'm planning my passingI just need to tell someone this because it's such an intense all encompassing secret and it's all I think about.
This evening I wrote my suicide letter and tomorrow I'm going to buy the materials I need to kill myself. 
I'm so so sad. I'm leaving people I love behind but I can't deal with this pain anymore. I have a million unhealthy coping mechanisms. I've been slowly trying to self destruct through an eating disorder and drug abuse for years.

I just don't want to be anymore. I have a therapy session tomorrow and I'm usually very honest with my therapist. Tomorrow will be one of the first times I keep something from her. I'm going to have to act "ok" for an hour so she doesn't suspect my plans have evolved.

Next week I hope to get it done.
Sorry,  I just needed to tell someone about my plan. Ty x
