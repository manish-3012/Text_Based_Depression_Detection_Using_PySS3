Constantly thinking of suicide. Don't know what to do.Honestly, I don't know what to do. My life is honestly fairly simple. I'm not abused, i have a great girlfriend, and i'm still in school with good grades. I don't know what it is but i constantly feel this hole in me. It's eating away at me and i don't know what to do. Anytime i talk to my mom about how i feel it's always something that gets put off to the side for later and ends up never getting done. I also never tell my girlfriend anything about my emotions. Not only does it make me feel weak but I don't want to put her in a panic about how i feel.
