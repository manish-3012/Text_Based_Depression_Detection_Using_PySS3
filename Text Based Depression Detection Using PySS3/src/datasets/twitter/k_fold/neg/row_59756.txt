I wish I died when I was 14That was my first full blown attempt- when I was in middle school. Eight years later and I wish I died then. I wish I never heard the words "it gets better" because I'm here, almost a decade later, and I'm FUCKING MISERABLE. I'm 22! I hate every single thing about me. I'm not smart enough or resilient enough to complete school. I'm completely fucking weak, okay?  I'm everything wrong with your modern student and I have no idea what how to fix that except cry and hate myself (rightfully so). I'm a woman, and I'm fucking ugly. I don't get to dream of marrying something who will love me. I'm wasting away, but it's not like there was much of me to start with. I'm just stuck between occasionally lying to myself that somehow everything will reverse for me and just resigning myself to planning my death. How the fuck is there any hope for me? I spent the majority of my "best years" hating every single thing about me. I wish I had one redeeming quality, but I don't. No one wants to help someone like me. I wish I died when I was 14. These past eight years were bullshit.
