My life is moving so fast, but I'm lost and feel left behind.I just moved in with my girlfriend and we're planning on getting married, but I've failed so many people before and I know I'm gonna fail her too. Im back in school trying to get through college but I've dropped out before, and I'm afraid it's going to happen again. I try to pursue my passion in music, but it's never what I hope it'll be. 

Everyone around me is achieving their goals, and I'm always there to encourage and help them. I feel selfish when I say this, but it's never returned. Every time someone accomplishes something, and they get to move forward with their lives, I'm always the one left behind and forgotten. No one talks to me anymore. I'm going to therapy, but even when I'm open about how I feel every day it just reminds me how weak and broken I am. I haven't been eating, my sleep is never enough, and to top it all off I work at Target.

Today has been especially hard because one of my gf's 14yo dance students just passed away and the funeral was today. I had to look the twin brother of that kid in the eyes and say "I'm sorry for your loss. Itll be okay. Things will get better." It won't. This life isn't worth this pain.

I feel the edge getting dangerously close and I don't know how to stop it. I've been there before. I've tried to end it before, but even in that I failed. I won't make that mistake twice.

I don't know what I hope to get out of posting this, and most likely no one's gonna read this. I just needed to get these thoughts out. Maybe it'll help.
