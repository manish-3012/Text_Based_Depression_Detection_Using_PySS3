Why am I still alive?I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.

Every single day I think about suicide. However I am way too scared to do anything about it. Itâ€™s been like this for so long. 

I have literally hit rock bottom. I have nothing to live for anymore. I destroyed my life with my self destructive ways.

The last year it has got progressively worse and worse. If there was a button or switch to just end my life I would have done it already but sadly there isnâ€™t.

I want these thoughts and feelings to go way. I donâ€™t want to think about anything anymore. Iâ€™m always feeling sad, alone, depressed 24/7. From when I wake up to when I go to sleep. Itâ€™s a constant struggle. Itâ€™s hard to do anything. Constant depression.

When will this all stop? When will all the pain and sadness go away? When will I have the courage to do something about it? 

I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
