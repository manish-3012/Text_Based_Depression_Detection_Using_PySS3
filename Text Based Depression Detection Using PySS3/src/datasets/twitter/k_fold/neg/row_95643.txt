I understand everything now but it's just sadSome people just should never have children.  
The older I get and the more I analyse what the fuck was going on in my childhood and teen years, the more I understand why I'm so overly sensitive, terribly anxious, suicidal. I had lived under constant stress in unpredictable home environment, was neglected, lied to. It's just so fucked up to give birth to a child in a toxic environment where every family member is unpredictable. Walking on eggshells. I remember nothing but being anxious 24/7 and depressed. Mental abuse is just as bad as physical.  
I really can't hate my family though. But I am deeply resentful for some things.  
Most of all I'm bothered by a fact that mom got pregnant with me when she was only an impulsive 19-20 year old. She saw her unintended pregnancy as a way of getting out of her abusive home and settling down with her own new family. Talk about opportunistic. It blows my mind that my existence had some sort of a specific purpose even before I was born - to be used as a chance towards someone's goals. I feel bad for my mom but it's just so unfair. 

It's so unfair that I can't function like a normal adult because I was traumatized, stressed out, isolated, didn't have experiences in growing up and learning the most basic things about living through everyday stress, and now she demands to be normal like nothing happened. I can't rewrite my whole life in a day, it's not a matter of seconds.  
The most basic things like going outside and going to classes stress the hell out of me and make me suicidal.  
Oh I've worked so hard on getting better. But the moment I understand that some people are born into abusive environments makes me so damn upset - we didn't choose to be born into that. And now we have to work 100x times harder than people who were brought up in normal families. Makes me want to jump off the building. So unfair.
