desperate after break upim so lost and desperate after my break up
my boyfriend of 8 months broke up with me and it completlt detroyed me..
im a 19 year old girl, a good student and i really feel like ii have no reason to continue living my life after losng him
he's my first everything and he was my world.
i just enetered a state of total desperation. 
after he dumped me, he still insistted on being friends, remaining an important part of eachothers life. i told him hard this was for me, how hurtful. but of course, i'd never wanan miss him, since i still have feelings for him, i still love him more than anything else

it just got harder and harder for me, i felt i was losing him, feeling him replacing his feeling for me as a lover to a friend, so when after two months of a "friendship" I noticed a new girl in his life i snapped.

u see, we are all in the same course.. i cn't focus on lectures anymore, university, the one thing that kept me going, cause evry day i see him and her and its just too much and he cut contact with me compeltely and im dying im so devasted and hes fine absoletely fine, every time i see him he is happier and hes always smiling adn he said he is over me. 

he doesnt love me anymore he said.

he wants to be a friend
but i cant have him as a friend, i love him as s o much more and am never gonna be able to be there for him as he finds a bbetter girl to replace me

im sorry im really sorry, i know were no longer together, i know i have no say over his behaviour, i know i should just move on byt i cant.

my parents are done supporting me. they tell me i stress them out, that i should be glad hes no longer in my life.

so i have no one to reach out to.
i just dont care anymore

all i want is the best for him, and me being here is obvously the only negative factor in his life rn.

i just wanna stop
