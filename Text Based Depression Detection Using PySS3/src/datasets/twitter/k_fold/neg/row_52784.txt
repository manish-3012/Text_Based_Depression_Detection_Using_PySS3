My Twitter friend is suicidalIâ€™ve never made one of these posts before and I hardly ever use Reddit, but rn I just donâ€™t know where to turn to.

Iâ€™m involved in a twitter community that is relatively small and very obscure. One of my mutuals is always tweeting abt suicide and wanting to kill himself because heâ€™s unhappy. I never really took it seriously because Iâ€™ve known him for 7-8 months and he hasnâ€™t really done anything but whine on my tl. But something abt this time is different and Iâ€™m genuinely scared heâ€™s going to do something.

He has a plan to make a cosplay of a certain character in a video game (wonâ€™t say specific character bc itâ€™s not well known and I donâ€™t want people finding him), take his fatherâ€™s gun, and record a livestream of his suicide on New Years Day. He says because he canâ€™t get attention alive he would be better dead and it would be our (my and the communityâ€™s) responsibility to spread the video and make sure his suicide gets him post humorous fame.

His other mutuals and I have talked abt him and we rly just donâ€™t know how to help him. A lot of people think heâ€™s bluffing but idk something abt this just feels very different. Maybe itâ€™s because I believe rhis could actually be a viral video.

Please I just donâ€™t want him to die and really donâ€™t want his death to be another nasty internet video. I just donâ€™t know how to help. Every time I try to talk to him he either ignores my messages or texts back one word responses. He doesnâ€™t deserve to die and I want to help him I just donâ€™t know how I can.
