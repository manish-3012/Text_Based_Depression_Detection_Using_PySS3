Failed Suicide Attempt - Now Feeling Guilt, Severe DepressionHey everyone, so yesterday I took what I hoped to be a lethal dose of paracematol, I thought it took like 48 hours to react but somehow it reacted in around 6 hours and i had intense pain in liver and nausea and my parents quickly noticed and took me to the hospital. 

Now after a few hours and stuff settling down I'm feeling really guilty and severely depressed. My parents are being really overprotective and its really killing me. 

Im so fucking done, i have this insane pressure over me, I cant even explain. I just want to die.
