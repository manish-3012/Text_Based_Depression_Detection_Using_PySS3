Need help getting anti depressants as a minor. Came closer than ever to commit suicide this week.I have a yearly physical tomorrow and im 17. Been severely depressed for a while and am coming closer and closer to doing life threatening harm to myself and Its getting worse and need help. My mom is super ignorant when i try to tell her my problems and wonders why I dont like talking about whats wrong. Everytime i ask her if I can get anti depressants she changes the subject and/or is super ignorant. My mom doesnt know about how much my arm is cut up since I hide it because I dont want to be classified as "Attention seeking". Can I talk to my doctor about this and will she give me anti depressants. Im just tired of feeling like this and each day that does by I have to cut more and deeper in order to feel better. A couple seconds after cutting myself my entire mindset changes and im totally fine and usually panic a little treating the cut. Recently had my first suicide attempt and I was completely having a complete mental breakdown after. I cant say what I did due to rules but it was half of the "Thirteen Reason Why" show method. 
tl;dr - Can I ask my doctor for anti depressants during my physical exam.
