I don't think I'm going to, but I really want to end it all...My Dad was really hard on me growing up and had high expectations of me. He died when I was 22. I accomplished every goal I've set for myself. I felt like achieving these goal would make me feel better about him being gone but I feel like I'm a chasing a feeling that doesn't exist any longer. All I can imagine is how proud he would've been of me. After he passed, I was in a relationship with the woman of my dreams. After 6 years, the relationship ended. Mostly due to my unaddressed issues.

Recently, I began strangling myself with a cellphone charger cable to cope with the emotion pain. I always stop right before I'm about to fade away. It's comforting to know that at least I have a method of suicide that I'm ok with. A gun would be best, and I even prepaid a dialogue for the guy working the counter at the gun store.

I hate feeling like this and I really want to end it all. I'm sure this feeling will pass eventually, it's just really hard right now.
