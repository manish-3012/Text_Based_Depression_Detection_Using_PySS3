I am already sick of life.I don't know what to do anymore. I'm 23, yet I'm convinced that I'll never be happy. I've tried pills, therapy - nothing works. I can't even hold down a fucking job because I'm so drained. My family are a bunch of fucking drunks, or they patronize you out of sheer judgemental arrogance. I dislike being around my own parents, my sister, my aunts and uncles, my cousins - I cannot tolerate them. I can't even leave my room because I hate being around them so much. Sometimes my Dad tells me out of frustration to just "go ahead and hang [myself]" if I am so miserable all the time. I have no desire to contribute a fucking thing to society at this point. I don't want to be a part of a planet where you're either hardline liberal or conservative, where the two candidates for the most powerful position on Earth are a couple of sociopaths, where nobody even tries to take care of a weakening environment that will one day jeopardize the lives of billions, where compassion and understanding are seen as worthless qualities in favour of vitriol and public degradation. If I hear one more story about a black kid getting gunned down by a police officer, or a crowd of African-Americans chanting death to all police officers, or people having their lives ruined by bombings in Syria/Iraq/Palestine/Yemen, or another climate change-related disaster, I'm going to lose my fucking mind. People are disgusting, unreliable, and uncaring. I genuinely do not want to live on this planet anymore.

People who say that I have years and years ahead of me - decades are nothing. Life is short. I'll be a withered old man before I know it. Why bother prolonging the agony?

I really, really want to die.
