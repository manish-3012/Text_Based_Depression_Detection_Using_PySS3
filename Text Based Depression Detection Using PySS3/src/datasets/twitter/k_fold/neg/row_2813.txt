Why do people treat me like I'm worthless?I live in the UK and I just can't deal with people anymore, everyone I come in to contact with on a daily basis seems to be a complete asshole. Family treat me like they wouldn't really care if I killed myself or not, most people are rude to me, I'm a 21 year old male but I'm not invincible. I feel things, I care about people. So why don't people care about me, what am I doing wrong, this feeling isn't all in my head it's my reality and it sucks. I'm angry, aggressive and don't really give a **** what happens either way.
Can someone explain why my situation is the way it is? 
I suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome and constantly get told I'm very lucky to be getting the help I'm getting, despite the fact 'help'  is just a concept there's no substance to it, I'm lucky if I get to see a phsychiatrist every three months despite the awful state I'm in, it's turning in to a dog eat dog world and no longer want anything to do with society.
