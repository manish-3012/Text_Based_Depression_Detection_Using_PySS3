Messages on Reddit donâ€™t fulfill the care I wish those around me had...I anonymously discuss my battle with depression on here and generally get lots of DMâ€™s from strangers saying they care about me or I can talk to them. I do genuinely appreciate that kindness but what a lot of ppl donâ€™t get is how open a lot of us depressed ppl are. 

I mean everyone around me knows what mental state Iâ€™m in. 
If I donâ€™t leave my room for days I feel like that should be concerning. 
Repeatedly sharing how exhausted I am with this battle is concerning. 
Withdrawing is concerning. 

If the ppl in my life donâ€™t care and actually know who I am I just donâ€™t see how a random stranger can convince me I matter. I donâ€™t matter and at the end of the day Iâ€™m just a drop in the bucket. 

Iâ€™m tired of living like this. I want it to all stop. Until you experience this horrendous pain (daily) and accept the fact that youâ€™ll have to live with it forever you donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like. 

I think itâ€™s selfish to force the sick to live.
