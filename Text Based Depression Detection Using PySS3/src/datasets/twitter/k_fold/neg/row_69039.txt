None of my problems would have happened if people were more understanding.I was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism when I turned 10. For a long time, I knew something was wrong with me. I used to be fascinated with things that nobody else my age was interested in, I used to pick fights with a lot of people whenever I was never included in something, I would get into confrontations very easily, and overall, I was just a mess. 

Things were going fine until I entered middle school. There, I was always complaining about why I was never in the top set for a subject, which in turn, fuelled the competitive drive that I have today. 

Throughout much of the seventh to eight grade, I was a dick. I used to skip classes because I didn't feel like going, I used to get told off for having meltdowns, and every teacher used to get pissed off with me. 

One teacher told my parents to enrol me in a vocational school, another group told me to drop out of school, the other group simply thought I wouldn't amount to anything. 

They all claimed that they had my best interests in mind and they were trying to help out, but they only put me in further difficulties. 

I really don't know what to believe now. I seriously hate myself and everything there is about me. 

I honestly hate being a human being.
