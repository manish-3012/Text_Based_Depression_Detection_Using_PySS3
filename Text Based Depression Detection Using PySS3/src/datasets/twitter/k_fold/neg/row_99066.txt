Life is precious.It's the craziest thing with can experience because without it contains all that exists. It's full of pain and misery to the point milliona across the world wonder what's the point. It's about the finer things the simple pleasures, draining every last drip of enjoyment out of, because once you're gone everything left in this world is gone with it.
