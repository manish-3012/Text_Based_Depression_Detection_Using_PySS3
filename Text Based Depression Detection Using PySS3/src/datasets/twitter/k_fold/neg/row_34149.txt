I feel like a walking corpseI just don't think I have the drive to live anymore. Everyday I feel so sad that I wake up and have to keep going. Whenever I look in the mirror I just look dead. There's nothing behind my eyes. I look like some doll that started moving and not like a person. Everytime I think I have something good in my life to make it better or worth the constant agony, something ruins it. I can't ever have happiness without something fucking it up. I'm just so tired. People constantly tell me it gets better but I absolutely cannot see making it past 30. I want to get a job and apartment with my friends to make sure they are taken care of then just finally end it. I just don't understand why me? I keep thinking maybe I did something horrible in a previous life to be cursed with this one. It hurts just to be alive.
