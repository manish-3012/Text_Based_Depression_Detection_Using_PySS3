My life is meaningless,boring,miserableIm a 17 year old boy i graduated high school and i got accepted in one of the best univiersities in my country in mechanical engineering but i just hate my life i have no friends when i was in school i would always sit alone eating lunch everybody bullied me i am too short im 162 cm i feel like im inferior to others because of my height i hate standing up when im around people because people will get to see how short i am i am really shy and have social anxiety i cant act normal around people and because of that im afraid of college and the thing that i fear the most in college is group project i feel i might drop out just because of that how am i gonna do a group project without without social skill i remember when i was in school and we had a group project i was so shy to ask anyone if i can join their group and i would wait untill the teacher put me with someone you cant do that in university im thinking of switching major because of that to a major that doesnt require group project but i just love math and physique and i love creating things and i find that mechanical enginnering is the best major for me but it require group project i have three sisters i dont speak to any of them and i hate them they are all bigger than me i hate my mom she used to abuse me my dad never really cared about me when i was a child i was sick and i needed a meadicament or a pill maybe its called i dont know im not english and dad did not buy me one and he said to me you can die i have three other children he is going to put me in university and pay for my university so that he can say that his son is an enginneer but 2 years ago my grandpa died and he left for my dad a big land worth 6 million dollar but it is far away from our city i rarely get to go to that land i love hunting with my shotgun but i have no place to do that but my dad said that he is going to sell that land and buy a land close to the city not in the city and actually it is close to my university and he is going to build a villa with a big pool and a big backyard so i started thinking that if this happens i can live happily in that villa doing the stuff that i love doing my hobbies in the backyard getting a big place to be alone and act normally and discovering new hobbies that will let me get rid of social anxiet and gain confidence and not being shy anymore but guess what no one want to buy that land and my dad dont want to lower the price i felt that it was my last chance to change my life but i guess life is meaningless anyway i become atheist recently and im now thinking of commiting suicide
