About to give upM/22 here been liveing with anxiety, depression, and aspergers as long as I can remember I struggle everyday to get out of bed I hate my self and the life I live everyone feels sorry for me and it's actually the only reason I still have my job because my boss feels sorry for me...I'm only alive because my mother needs me it would destroy her if I killed my self and I don't want to think what would happen to my family but I honestly am getting the the point where I don't care anymore and I hate my self even more for that I'm just a selfish good for nothing jerk...iv also never been able to hold a relationship without ruining it....I think I'm going to end it but I probably won't because I'm a pussy
