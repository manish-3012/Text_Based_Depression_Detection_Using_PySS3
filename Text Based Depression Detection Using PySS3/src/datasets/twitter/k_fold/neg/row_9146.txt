Suicide attempt. My story.I will say there is a trigger warning in this post so don't go further if me talking about my attempt will trigger you.

I don't even know what happened, it was such a blur. It was a culmination of everything that has happened recently, a breakup from a long term relationship, moving, work stress, rejection, mental illness, and extreme loneliness despite having many people around. 

I was laying in bed after being told she no longer wanted to talk to me and something came over me like a wave of determination. It was happening. I was already 6 cider deep but I needed more alcohol. I grabbed the biggest knife out of my drawer and headed for my car. I got in, found an open liquor store and got another 6 pack of ciders. I parked at a park near my house and downed 3 ciders. I wrote out a suicide note on my phone and sent it to anyone who I have any care for at all. I drank one more cider before I put the blade to my wrist. I ran it across. Nothing. So I tried again. Running across my forearm even harder. I felt a pinch and sting as the blade cut my skin. The rest was accompanied by screams and cries. I punched my steering wheel asking myself why am I here. Then I saw the red and blue flashing lights.

I was taken to the hospital where I slept, and then was sent home. This past week has been hell. I don't know who I am, what I want, where I'm going, anything at all. I don't know if I will ever attempt again, but in my head it's a possibility. The hope that comes with people rallying around you has faded and it's just me and my thoughts again. Alone again. Me and my thoughts. When will this end? Please help.
