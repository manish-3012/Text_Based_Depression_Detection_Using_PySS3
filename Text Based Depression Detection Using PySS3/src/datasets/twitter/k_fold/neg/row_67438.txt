Iâ€™m readyI think tonight might be it. Iâ€™ve never been more certain until now that Iâ€™ve wanted to go through with it. Iâ€™m not happy, and life just keeps kicking me while Iâ€™m down in this ditch. I didnâ€™t ask to be put in this world so isnâ€™t it my choice if I want to leave it? I might give it a day. See if anything changes but honestly Iâ€™m ready now. I have it planned out. I know what to say to who I want to say something too.
