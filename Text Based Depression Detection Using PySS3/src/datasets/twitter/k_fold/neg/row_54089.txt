I have an Illegal Addiction and its taking a phycological hitHi i am currently underage the age of majority and i have been watching child porn for 3 years, i constantly try to stop, but i cant seem to i started with loli/shota and got more and more realistic and eventually found a real site on the normal web. I keep on trying to stop but i cant seem too. I would like to add that i have not actively asked someone nor downloaded any and in real life i have not even looked at a child in a sexual way, for some reason it changes when it on a photo on a screen. I feel like the scum of the earth and i have considered suicide due to it. Even if i get over it i dont know how i will get it out of my past and live with myself. I have had the suicide issue before but this issue isnt helping it what so ever and i feel like my life will just get progressivly worse.  My GPA is shot already making me basically only able to go to community college (Even then i might not be able to).  This feels like i just can never get any better
