talk me into ittalk me into it. please. don't even bother trying to talk me out of it because i already did it myself last year, and i convinced myself this year everything would be good because i had things to look forward to.

well, everything i ever looked forward to was taken from me and at this point i think the universe is trying to tell me something.

i'm in the mental state to do it, my body is just being a coward. everytime i try my survival instincts kick in and stop me. can't hang myself because my instincts kick in and i struggle like hell, even though i want it to happen. 

give me something that'll stick with me long enough for it to happen, or just a quick and efficient way to get the job done.

i don't really care about pain at this point because it's worth it, and dealing with the mental pain is worse and lasts longer than the physical pain anyways. still, if anyone has any quick, painless way to do it, that would be appreciated.
