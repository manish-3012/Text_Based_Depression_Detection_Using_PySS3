Going to vent for a bitIt's 5:30 AM and I can't sleep. I just want to talk about stuff and maybe I'll be able to.

I've wanted to kill myself for 7 years now. It's incredible that I'm still here. I've attempted several times but they were half-assed attempts to be honest. But no one knew. My parents never did... I've suffered alone. I've never made any close friendships except for online(the only other comment I've made on this account explains the trauma I went through for that) which while they do matter, they're so fragile. I'm busy with college and can't talk to them so as a result I don't exist anymore.

God I can't even find words..I've tried to talk to different people so many times but every time I try to talk about anything I can't wrap my head around what I need to say. I just want to kill myself..I just have wanted to for so long. Nothing is getting better really. I fucked up a few chances I had at redemption because of how bad my brain is. I want to say so much in this post but I don't know how and it's really destroying me I want to stop being trapped in my own thoughts
