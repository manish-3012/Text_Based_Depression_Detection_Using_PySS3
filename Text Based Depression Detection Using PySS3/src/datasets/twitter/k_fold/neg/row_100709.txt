Will they get over me?I know it's a pretty arrogant thing to ask, "will they get over me?", but I need to know. Will I hurt them more than I help myself when I end it all? I'm so unsure as to how everyone will react when it happens so to comfort myself I want to know. Just to be more specific, there are a few people who knew I was once depressed but I have not expressed my will to die since then so it will blind side most people. I've planned the big day just a few days after my birthday as to celebrate with everyone one last time. I've written out an extensive note to everyone and I think it covers all of the important things. 

I kinda just want to know what I'll be doing to everyone.
