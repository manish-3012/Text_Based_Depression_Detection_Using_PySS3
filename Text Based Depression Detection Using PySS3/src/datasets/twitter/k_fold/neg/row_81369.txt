I think I will actually do it nowI have posted many times about doing it, but never really brought myself to commit suicide. I am delusional, I am 100% sure I have pure O. My therapist doesn't do anything when I tell her I will commit suicide. I was never happy, until last monday, I met my best friends friend who came from the US to my country to visit her. She is absolutely stunning, most beautiful girl I have seen, also nice, smart, and I was her first hook up (we are both 16). i have no idea how but I managed to get her to like me, I usually have no luck with girls, but less with girls who were models. We hooked up like 10 times in the last 5 days, but she is leaving back to the US, and I know I will never find anyone like that ever again, I am still hooked to her. I know this is the typical whiny 16 year old bullshit. But really I love her, and it has got me down. the only thing I will have of her is a picture we took kissing. She doesn't want to date due to the distance. I have severe depression (actually diagnosed) but my therapist doesnt want to give me medicine, instead she doesnt help at all.
