Tonight I will dieI canâ€™t do this anymore. Everythingâ€™s too hard. I feel so alone and hopeless. Iâ€™m in pain and itâ€™s too much. Iâ€™m scared to die but Iâ€™m more scared of living. I think Iâ€™m going to finally overdose on the stash of hundreds (maybe thousands) of heart pills, psych pills, and Benadryl.
