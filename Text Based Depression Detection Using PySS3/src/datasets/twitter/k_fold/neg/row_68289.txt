I really need someone to talk to right now.Hi.


I'm feeling pretty shitty right now. I almost killed myself a couple days ago, but decided to check into a hospital instead. My family took me back into their place, but now everyone I know left to go to vacation. I'm home alone, and my girlfriend is gone as well. I haven't felt this alone since that night, and I really need someone to shoot the shit with.

I feel pretty crappy. I feel as if no one actually wants me around, like they only spend time with me and tolerate me because they don't want me to kill myself. It's such a terrible, isolating feeling.


I play RuneScape, OverWatch, LoL, not much else. I enjoy music and fantasy movies. Haven't read any good books lately, but I'll talk about anything.
