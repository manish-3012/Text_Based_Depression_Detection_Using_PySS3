What effects will large quantities of hydroxyzine have on the body?(long and short term)I overdosed on the 16th, and im just curious of the long term and short term effects the medication will have/has on my body. I have a weird twitch in my left eye, and my balance is still slightly off. I went to the hospital when it happened, i somehow woke up when i quit breathing. For reference, i ingested between 7,000-9,000 milligrams.
