Not sure exactly when but Iâ€™ve decided this is it. 32 (female)Itâ€™s been a long time a coming. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for more than half of my life (since about 15 years old). 

The older I get the lonelier I get, the more defective I feel.

My therapist essentially said I was â€œnot attractiveâ€ today. Something I worried he thought and thanks to growing up with a very vain mom, that stuff mattering is ingrained in me. I slept around with random guys for the first time in my life last year. I wanted to feel â€œwantedâ€; it backfired. He said that once we really get into last year it wonâ€™t be that â€œyou are not attractiveâ€ (along with a list of other things that I canâ€™t remember for the life of me cus his saying that took over it all) that will be the core of what eats you up about it. Iâ€™m paraphrasing. 

He just tried calling now cus I kept texting him. I inadvertently hung up on him.

Iâ€™m just done with the world. Iâ€™m 32 and I still feel like a suicidal 15 year old.
