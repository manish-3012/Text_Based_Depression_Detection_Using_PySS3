I've struggled with depression my whole life, but this is the first time I've really thought about ending my life.I was recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Having that information about myself is starting to make some things make sense. I've been in counseling for many years, and I've made some good progress. Maybe, now that I have this new diagnosis, I'll have more significant results.  I have my first appointment with a new counselor next week.  I wish I was feeling hopeful about working with her, but I've worked with so many counselors over the years, I feel indifferent to the whole process. 

I've been going out with a great guy for a few months, but he told me yesterday that he can't handle my mental health issues. I don't blame him. I don't know how to handle myself either.  He hasn't been returning my calls or emails for a couple days. 

I've struggled with depression my whole life, but I think this is the closest I've ever been to actually wanting to stop living. It's not just being single again; I'm used to being single. I'm just so tired of everything in my life. I try so hard to get some traction and make something good happen. But my mental illness keeps stopping me. I'm stuck in the same old self-destructive patterns, and I have no clue how to do anything different. 

I don't know how to have relationships with friends or family. I don't know how to get or keep a job. I don't know how to find a good place to live. I'll be starting a new quarter of school on Tuesday.  I don't want to go.  I don't know how to stop myself from jumping off a bridge. 

I want to stab myself in the leg.  I want to pull my hair out.  I want to feel some physical pain.  I would appreciate anyone talking to me.
