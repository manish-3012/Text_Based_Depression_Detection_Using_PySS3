Career breaks are stupid and so am I, I guessIt's been about a year since I quit my job to save myself from burnout.  After a couple months I decided that I could take some more time to learn new things and enjoy not needing to be at a job.  Looked into what they call a "career break" where you deliberately take time off to do things important to you and prepare for your next step.  Seemed like a totally reasonable thing to do.

Now, a year later, I spend most of my time crying and wanting to die.  Even with 20 years of experience I don't feel qualified for even lower level jobs and I can't think of any other thing I'm remotely qualified to do.  I could go back to school, but I can afford rent or tuition, but not both.  I'm at the point of just giving up on finding another job and really just giving up on life.  I feel completely hopeless.
