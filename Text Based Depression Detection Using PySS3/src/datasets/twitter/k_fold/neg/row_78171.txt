Really feel like a failure...A lot going on, really too much to type on mobile. Just feel like a complete failure. An utter waste of space. Had to ask someone to hide my guns for fear I might act upon my feelings of hatred towards myself... I feel like I've failed my daughter, my wife, my parents, myself. I just really need someone to help me.
