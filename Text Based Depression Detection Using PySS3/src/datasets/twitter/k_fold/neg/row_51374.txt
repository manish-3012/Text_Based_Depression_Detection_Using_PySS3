JSS (just survive somehow)I was thinking about the value of this phrase that showed up in The Walking Dead tv show. 

It has value because it can help us in the situations we keep thinking about suicide. 

Just hang on there, buddy. Life can be shitty right now, but if we just survive somehow, we might find out that life goes on... whether we like it or not...
