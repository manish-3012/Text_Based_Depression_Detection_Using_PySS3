I think after I see my girlfriend next weekend it'd be the last time I ever see her.I'm honestly incredibly depressed and suicidal but I want to see my ldr girlfriend one last time next weekend. After that, I think that's going to be the last time I ever see her because after that I'm going to kill myself. I'm so tired of living I don't want to hold on anymore. Nothing is enjoyable to me and everything seems so dull and I have no drive for anything at all. Everything is going wrong, I'm not happy, and I just feel so fucking empty. I just cannot do this anymore so I'm just going to spend next weekend with my girlfriend to the fullest and maybe it'd be the last time I ever see her again.
