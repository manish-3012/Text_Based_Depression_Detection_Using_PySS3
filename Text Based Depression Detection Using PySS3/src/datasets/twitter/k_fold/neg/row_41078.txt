Don't know what to do anymore.I just don't want to live anymore. My "friends" are all assholes to me and have basically told me that they don't like me and never really have. My mom recently sat down to talk with me and told me that I need to be nicer to her, and she started crying halfway through. I do come off as ruse sometimes, but I didn't think it was anything serious, and now I feel like shit. I cut myself for the first time today. I would kill myself but I'm too much of a pussy to go through with it. Please, someone just help me get through this.
