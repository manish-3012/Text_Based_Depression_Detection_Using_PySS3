Being LovedI hate the thought of being loved. I'd rather have an abusive family that wanted me dead so that everything would be easier and I wouldn't have wasted all of the resources in the past few years. I hate that my parents might be hurt if I killed myself. They are the only people whom I have not written my letter to yet, because I feel like it will kill them if I made one for them. I wish they had another child who was more successful than me so that they could easily forget me. I wish they aborted me at the first sign of my life. But they HAVE to tell me that they love me. Every time they say that, I feel even worse because I'm undeserving of anything. 

I'm happy I don't have any real friends; they would probably keep me in this world, and I would probably keep poisoning their lives with all of my assholish actions and words. I'm probably somehow unconsciously manipulating the people around me; there's no way that anyone would ever want to talk about me. 

I'm genetically disadvantaged at everything. No matter how hard I work, I'm still one of the most stupid Asians, and even if I have a high 90, I'll still be looked down on because I apparently should be getting 100s. I still have the highest BMI in my peer group no matter how hard I work. I still have to put in unnecessary effort in sports to compensate for my height. I am also so disgustingly hideous that our teacher skipped over me multiple times when she was complimenting our class.

I don't even have anything to cure. I'm just a useless piece of shit who got their brain fucked by something. Nothing will help and there is no answer. What is the use with medication when you continue to have no worth, even as a happy person? What's the use of this complex biological mechanism that I inhabit that is rendered completely worthless with this fucked over brain? Fuck this life.
