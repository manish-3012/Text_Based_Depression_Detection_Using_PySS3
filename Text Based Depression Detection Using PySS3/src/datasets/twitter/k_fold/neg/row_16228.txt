Hanged myself last night.Was having a good night watching anime and drinking vodka, I ran out of vodka then I went to grab beer at the store and asked my sister to watch Netflix, eat pizza, and drinking beer with me. It was a fun night, then she put me to bed, I sat there in my bed, ended up crying. Then I decided to do it. I messaged my mom, "I love you tell (sister) not to blame herself. Bye." she replied with, "I wish you would stop this." I grabbed my joggers made a knot at the end so it tied together and put it on the door and closed it. I then climbed on a chair and put my joggers twice around my neck and kicked the chair away. My sister was still up and heard the chair so she checked on me. I was probably hanging for a minute by then. She let me down and I put up a fight, begged her to let me die, and did some ufc moves so I couldn't move. She ended up calling 911 and they came handcuffed me took me to the emerge. I slept, ate breakfast and lunch, talked to a shrink who I convinced to let me out, making sure I come to see a counsellor there tomorrow morning, ask to be admitted in the psych if I wanted. Now I'm home apologized to my sister for fighting her and asked her to forgive me.
