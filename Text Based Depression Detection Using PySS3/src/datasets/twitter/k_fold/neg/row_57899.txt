Who do I go to for support? I want to end my lifeSo I hated myself for the longest time because I can't live up to people's high expectations of me &amp; people get tired of me because I talk too much about my issues. I understand nobody wants to hear someone being negative all the time, but I even wore out one of my therapists. 

I'm only doing the minimum (which is basically their high standards) to get people off my back &amp; despite all the treatment, I feel like I'm just doing and not really living. It's a special kind of numbness that slowly kills me on the inside because I know I'm only doing this because I'm sick of people being disappointed in me.

My self-loathing is so strong. My resentment for these people just grows &amp; grows, knowing that I might have to act this way for the rest of my life, even if I cut contact because they'll never stop. 

I'm doing everything for the wrong reasons &amp; I'm not really healing. I'm coping, but it's just delaying the inevitable. I want the pain to stop.
