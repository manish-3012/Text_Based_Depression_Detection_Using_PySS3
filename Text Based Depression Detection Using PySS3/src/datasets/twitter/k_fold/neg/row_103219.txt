I refuse to have another birthdayI finally picked a day. August 4. A few days before my 18th birthday. I am currently writing letters to my loved ones. It is difficult. I can't stop crying. I have done this before but this time feels permanent. As I go through the list, I realize that all of them don't care about me as much I care about them. I don't want to do it on my birthday because I hate my birthday and I would really like not to have another one.
