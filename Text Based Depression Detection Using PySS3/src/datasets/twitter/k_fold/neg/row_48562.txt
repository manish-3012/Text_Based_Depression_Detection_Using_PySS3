I want to kill myself because my life is at rock bottom.19m. I took up high school and now studying because my mother made me. I'd like to earn money and not be on my parents' whim for another 5 years, I can't make it...

My GF barely contacts me Mon-Fri and responds mostly dull one-liners whereas my ex talked to me all the time, called me, told me she loved me etc. I fucking crave this and keep wondering wtf is going on that there is almost no contact with her. Tired of this shit, keeping convos alive is tiresome.

Studying shit I have no interest for. No hobbies. Used to excel all 12 years of school, getting top marks only. Burned out last year and tired, unable to focus for long. Kinda failed my exams (according to my performance) and parents treat me like a walking disappointment. I see it in their eyes. 

I dream of blooming, expessive love.

No idea how to get out of this shit. I want to die but am not courageous enough. Cut my arm open a year ago, wishing I could bleed to death or paint my walls red. I'm crying, I'm dead inside...
