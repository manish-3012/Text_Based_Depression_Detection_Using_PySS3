gone ahead with it
Because my mouth
Is wide with laughter
And my throat
Is deep with song,
You did not think
I suffer after
I've held my pain
So long.

-Langston hughes


I am sorry my peers &amp; family. I have been struggling with depression for the better part of my life.  The ever revolving door of depression is something I canâ€™t shake anymore. Celebrate my life, do not cry please. 

This is of my own accord &amp; I am finally happy. 

I have started my method and no turning back now.
