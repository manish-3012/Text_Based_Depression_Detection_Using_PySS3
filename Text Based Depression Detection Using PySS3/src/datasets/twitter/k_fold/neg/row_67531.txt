feel completely uselessiâ€™ve always had extremely low self esteem- when i was younger iâ€™d hide half of my face with my sleeve, and cried when people would show pictures of me. it was getting better, but got really worse the past couple of weeks and i can barely look in the mirror without makeup and feel horrible for my boyfriend- i donâ€™t understand how he finds me attractive let alone wants to date me. i constantly feel like he knows iâ€™ve gotten uglier and now feels trapped because he thinks iâ€™m annoying or cant get the courage to dump me. heâ€™s an extremely accomplished runner, state ranked, and has already had a job and is getting college scholarships. iâ€™m getting horrible grades, 3.17 overall gpa, and will barely get accepted into the state schools i want. i got a job but turned it down immediately. i lost the lead role in mock trial, my only extra curricular. i feel completely hopeless and useless. if i give up now, thereâ€™s no hope for me in college or when the time comes that i NEED a job. i just want to give up and kill myself already. i went to the concert i said iâ€™d kill myself after last night. i donâ€™t think i can make it to christmas. i donâ€™t think i need to. how do i stop these thoughts? my therapist cancelled on me this week so i cant see him.
