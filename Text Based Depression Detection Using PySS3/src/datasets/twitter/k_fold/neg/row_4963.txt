I wish I was born a girl insteadI don't want to transition. I have no desire to become a woman in this life. I just wish I was born a girl instead. A girl with beautiful white skin, which I don't have, and soft brown hair, which I don't have. Not the abomination I am now.

My life would be so much better and I'd be so much happier. I hate how I look now and I can hardly be around people. I don't look anyone in the eye when they talk to me anymore because I hate who I am and what I look like. I wish I had long hair and wore girl's clothes. And don't tell me I can still do these things as a male, it's not the same and that's not what I want. I don't want to be seen as a man. I wish people would look at me and think I'm pretty, not handsome (though I'm not that either).

I also wish I was white or just had lighter skin. I hate being dark-skinned. I would be alright with not being female if I was a least white. I am pretty much the opposite of what I want to look like, and ugly dark skinned male, and there's no way to change it. I've given up on my body and I don't take care of myself anymore. I spend so many hours in my head pretending to be a pretty girl. I have an image of myself as a girl and I spend most of my waking hours as her. I don't look in mirrors anymore because I don't want to be reminded of what I really look like. I avoid contact with people because I don't want to be reminded of how people see me now. My life was already bad before these thoughts started and now it's broken beyond repair.
