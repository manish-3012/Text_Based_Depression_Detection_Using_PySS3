I donâ€™t wanna be alive anymoreXpost from r/depression. 
sorry ahead of time for my vent/rant.

Last few years, I have been struggling with depression and I feel like I want to die now. Iâ€™m unwanted by everyone that I know. I try to make friends but often get used and abused for things and happiness at my own expense. I try going beyond to do things for people as well but no one does those things for me. I try comforting people and being nice because no one should ever be down or alone except when it comes to me

I feel like a burden to everyone because of my suffering Iâ€™m facing but I canâ€™t help but to self pity. No one in my family gives a damn about me except my mom. She at least talks to me. Everyone else just yells at me constantly, blames me for their troubles, puts me down. All I try is to respect them, help out, put my all but everything I do, right or wrong is wrong. For everyone and everything. Everyone is just helping me dig my own grave when all Iâ€™m trying to do is get out.

I have tried everything as well in trying to help myself. I have tried excising by going on walks to try and clear my head and eating healthy to try and change things for me. I have tried talking to a therapist but I feel like nothing is helping from that. I have tried substances to make the depression go away or less effective but they donâ€™t work. I try to do new hobbies but they donâ€™t get me going. 

There is a lot more that I can say but all I want is people to appreciate me for who I am and who I try to be. I want people to like me and maybe even love and comfort me and MEAN IT! 

Most of all, I just want to be happy...
