Finish your schoolsOne years ago I failed university and after 6 years failing I don't want to study anymore. I called to my mom and told her that I failed and she told me: 

"Please don't kill yourself, stay away from bridges or metro. Please don't harm yourself"  I ask:

"What? Why should I kill myself?! It is not the end, human being lived and survived without diploma, not everybody should be educated or with a comfortable job, somebody need to do dirty works too and I am comfortable doing them. Why should I kill myself because I fail?!" she calmed down and replied:

"I can see why you fail university, you have no shame, no dignity or honor even to kill yourself for your big failure in your life" I can't blame her actions, because I know her mom and dad, she had a terrible childhood. but her words hurt.

...

One year later, I can understand what she mean. Life without proper job or without social life sucks!
