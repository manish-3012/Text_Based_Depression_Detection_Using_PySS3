I don't want to existI am terrified of death, but not because I'm scared of ceasing to exist - I'm scared of afterlife. I am scared that there is a hell, I am scared that my consciousness will still exist, for eternity. I don't want any of this, I want existence to be over. I want it to stop, I  hate it, I hate it so much and living is just discomfort and anxiety at this point, there is no pleasure or reason it just hurts and I don't fucking want it anymore. I want death, total death, or at least the closest to 'ceasing to exist' I can get. I just hope to fuck there is no reincarnation or hell. I might start going to church again, even though I don't believe, but I just need something to convince me that I can be okay and saved. And if that doesn't work I don't think I can do it anymore. I will need to die.
