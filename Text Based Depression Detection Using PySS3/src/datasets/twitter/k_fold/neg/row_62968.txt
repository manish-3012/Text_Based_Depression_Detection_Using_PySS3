"Just keep trying"That's all anyone can ever say or come up with. That's it. Just keep trying. Why? Cause apparently it gets better. Well, no it really doesn't. Not for everyone. For some people sure, but it hasn't for me, it's only gotten worse. I've wanted to die for about 6 years and counting, and I've just kept listening to that stupid advice to just keep trying and guess where it's gotten me? Nowhere.

I'm not good at 1 thing. Not even the thing I do all day everyday(video games). I'm not even good at 1 game. People are like "Yea I've heard if you're good enough, you can get paid to play games" well I'm not good enough, not at anything. Tried going to college, that didn't work cause again I'm not good enough. Tried getting a job, and once again I'm not good enough. Tried being a twitch streamer as a sort of creative outlet and ideally an eventual job, but guess what, nobody cares and I'm not good enough. So gg, I just wanna die.
