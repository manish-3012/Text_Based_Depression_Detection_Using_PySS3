Please HelpThis is my first post on here, and Iâ€™m really desperate right now. A friend of mine on discord tried to talk his boyfriend out of suicide, but his dysphoria became the deciding factor and now it might be too late. My friend cannot talk to him, he tried talking to his parents, but they wonâ€™t listen, he tried to have him call his uncle, whoâ€™s the family member he most cares about, but he didnâ€™t pick up. I saw his desperate message to me about 4 and a half hours ago and Iâ€™m scared for both of them. I sent him a message telling him that he needs to call the police at this point, but I have no idea if thereâ€™s anything else to do. Iâ€™m praying for both of them right now and Iâ€™m really fucking scared
