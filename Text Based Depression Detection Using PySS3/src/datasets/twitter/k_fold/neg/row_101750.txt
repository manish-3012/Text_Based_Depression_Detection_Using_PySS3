But why should you care?Idk sorry if this is in the wrong place, but why exactly should any of you care if I, or someone else who you don't even know on the internet, decides to take their life? 

Whether I decide to kill myself right now or later doesn't affect you in the slightest because you don't know me. You don't gain or lose anything from it. We have no close relation and you don't even know what type of personality I have. There's no reward for saving someone on the internet, nor will you be repaid for the effort and time you've spent trying to prevent me from doing so. And even when you do, I still might go through with it, which means I've wasted your resources. 

I just feel like most of the people who try to help others (or help me rather) just do it to mentally feel better about themselves that they've done a good deed for the day. Or perhaps so they won't feel guilty about not doing something when they could of.

Again I'm not trying to diss anyone here, these are just my thoughts when people try to coax me out of ridding myself for the betterment of my family's life, and saving myself from heartache having to constantly fall back into this pit of self-loathing even though this is all apparently suppose to "get better eventually." Then you're waiting 8 years and the suffering still hasn't subsided so then what? Continue living like this as an adult? I'd honestly rather not.
