I Do Not Know What to Do26/f/WA, U.S.A.
Corrected scoliosis. Around genocidal people.

I was basically in domestic violence. Felt like torture after I googled what happened. 

PTSD and severe depression. On meds...not working.

Got into trouble trying to protect someone. I am a felon now.

I am so scared everyday and I am almost alone with no strength left.

I do not know what to do. I feel like surrendering
