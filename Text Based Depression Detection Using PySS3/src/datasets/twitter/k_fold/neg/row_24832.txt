being ugly has fucked up my entire life.i think only a very specific group of people will understand me when i say, suicide is my only way out of this. and if you relate, im so sorry.

no more drowning in my tears at night thinking if ill ever be good enough for a guy. no more thoughts about my ugly face; eating me up from the inside, taking over my entire fucking life, fucking up every aspect of my being. no more seeing beautiful girls around me anymore, who make me want to kill myself even more. no more seeing every teenage boy your age around you falling in love with them, while i sit back and wonder whats so wrong with me that im undeserving of that kind of feeling. 

i cant wait to pull the trigger, the thought just makes me happy. just gotta wait till i turn 18 so i can buy a shotgun. feels good to let this out too.
