The wallIâ€™ve been dealing with suicide/depression for quite sometime. Majority of it was in my early teens years, as i keep growing up (Iâ€™m 23 right now) it was very difficult for me to care about myself. I lost my sense of self care and self love once I got into my first serious relationship because i was putting  everything in front of me make sure everyone around me is good and then I realized Iâ€™m lost in this world. I have my passion and I know what I want to do but each day felt worst and darker and darker like the sun would never come up. So after Iâ€™ve broken up with my ex I started to work on myself. I started losing weight I had to get my life in check. Around the same time I started to smoke weed heavily, so the plant was talking to me it really open my mind more on life it brought me peace and joy for a while. Then it sorta push me waaaay back like I just woken up for the first time in my life I saw all the mistakes Iâ€™ve made so I was in this nervous/anxious state all the time trying to fix what I have done. After a few months I learn to be a in a good state of mind things went well...

Then the wall came up I felt lost all those negative thoughts kept coming back into my mind. I didnâ€™t want to give up not like this so I fought hard I got back up. Family told me to be on pills, I donâ€™t want pills to mess up my programming to â€œfix meâ€ for a few months and then later have those same pills have a terrible side effect. I knew it wasnâ€™t going to be easy so I work on myself everyday to get better at my hobbyâ€™s and skills to keep growing.

Then I did mushrooms for the first time so

With mushrooms it really open me up all my thoughts in my head were gone it didnâ€™t matter anymore. It made me realize about life it brought me back, just like weed woke up me the shrooms did the same but in a positive aspect.

The past is the past forget work on today everyday to see the full painting. So I did just that some close family saw a difference in me
They enjoy what their seeing and so did I.

Then I did acid a month after the shrooms the trip I had was definitely amazing. It just proven to me everything that I learn with weed &amp; shrooms to acknowledge my faults to understand myself better and also to love myself no matter what. I felt I got a reboot and a new hard drive at the same time.

Now itâ€™s been a more or less a month to two months after my first acid trip and now I feel the wall came back down on me again. I woke up this last Monday and itâ€™s been a little ruff these past two days, I understand I canâ€™t let it get to me but I donâ€™t know what it is or why Iâ€™m like this but those thoughts that Iâ€™ve worked on for the past two going on three years now are all coming back. Iâ€™m scared. I want to cry.
