What do I do?Thanks to anyone cares to read this, for the last few years my family has gone through some really hard time because of my brother. He is a drug addict and has emotional problems. Its become harder and harder to live in my house because every night i have to go to bed wondering if the fighting is going to lead to one of my parents getting hurt(we have had to call the police 3 times). To make it worse iv been becoming more and more depressed since I entered middle school (I'm 15 now). I don't want to tell my parents because then they will have to deal with 2 children with psychological problems. I started to play lots of video game to try to separate my self from the fighting. I play with my friends but when I do they just either make fun of me or make me feel worse about my self and never act like friends should, By now they are not really my friends and I just play alone (it does not help much). I don'd not what to do. Nowadays I just come home from school, eat sit down and then try to play on my computer a little if I don't feel shitty. Please tell me what I can do, i just don't know how long I can live with no real friends and a family that may break at any moment.
