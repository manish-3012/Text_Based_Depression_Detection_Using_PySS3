I think I almost killed myself yesterdayIt was in school, I fought with my friends and had just found out that I had no real friends, and I thought my life would never be okay and that I'd never be happy. I was extremely anxious and couldn't think straight, like I was having a panic attack. I got out of control and climbed up the fence in the second floor, attempting to jump, but a teacher saw it and grabbed me, she ran in my direction screaming and was able to pull me back down. She then talked with me until I calmed down, but I'm still feeling so anxious right now and just wanted to get this out of my chest. I feel so alone and I feel like I have nobody who truly cares about me.
