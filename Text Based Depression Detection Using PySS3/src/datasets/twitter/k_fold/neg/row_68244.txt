I'm not going to, but I wish I couldThe past few months have been a living hell. My best friend committed suicide in the middle of September, now, when I'm 18 i don't know what I'm going to do. We had plans to move to an apartment and open our own garage. Here lately I've pushed all of my friends away because I'm scared I'd hurt them if I ever did anything. I resorted to drugs but realized that wasn't a good way to cope. I've tried to get over this but idk how. I just wish there was a way to stop the everyday pain of knowing my closest friend could come to me for help. If anyone could help me, please tell me how to make this easier.
