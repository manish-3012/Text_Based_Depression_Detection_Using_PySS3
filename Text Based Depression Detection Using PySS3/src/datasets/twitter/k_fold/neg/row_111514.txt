doing this from my main account is risky but i just keeo thinking about itFirst things first I have one kid and one on the way. Just bought a house with my fiancÃ©e or doesn't really like me. I feel like we are just going through the motions and she's only with me because of the kids and her limited options. Everyday is a fight and I'm just constantly depressed. I'm addicted to opiates which I'm currently trying to get away from but proves to be very hard. I love my son for than anything and don't want him growing up without a father or, even worse, growing up with a substitute father. I find myself envying the dead...a lot... I was reading about a musician earlier that died due to cocaine toxicity and instead of feeling bad for his family or him I feel like "man, he doesn't have to worry about anything anymore, he just gets to sleep." I don't know what to do.
