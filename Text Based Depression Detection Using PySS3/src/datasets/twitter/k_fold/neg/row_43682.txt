I get so depressed listening to songs from 2010-2013Then I remember the times when I was a teenager, when I wasn't depressed, when I was living with my parents in peace and harmony, when I didn't have to pay bills, when I went to school and had at least someone to talk to, when I had free time, when I didn't have to wake up every morning before work thinking I would rather die than go there, when I didn't care about my future, my relationships with other people, when I wasn't feeling that enormous weight of all the responsobilities, fears and hopelessness on my shoulders, when I had dreams, hopes and desires, when I wasn't feeling like I am a piece of trash.
