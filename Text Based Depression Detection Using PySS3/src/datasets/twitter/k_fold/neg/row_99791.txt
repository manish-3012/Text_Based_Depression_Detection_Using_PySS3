To the reddit void : HeadachesI don't know how to say this without sounding insensitive or unmindful of the problems that people face when they're feeling suicidal but i really need to say this to someone 


I'm suicidal and there isn't anything wrong with my life. I live okay and I have a steady job, i can take care of myself. But I don't want to live anymore.
My relationship with my family is distant but I know they care 
My job is a dead end but it pays well &amp;, I know that I'm capable of moving if I wanted to
I'm single but that's only because I know I'm overly dependent of my S.O and I'm just toxic in general (I don't want to put anyone through that)
I'm not lonely 
I'm not being mistreated 
I'm just sad ans I don't know why..


I've had these annoying headaches going on for so long I can't quite remember when they started but it seems like they just won't ever go away. Even when they don't interfere with my day to day, I still feel this buzz in the back of my head driving me crazy. . . 

I want to say these headaches are like metaphors for my thoughts of suicide but lately my head doesn't stop pounding until I cry it out
