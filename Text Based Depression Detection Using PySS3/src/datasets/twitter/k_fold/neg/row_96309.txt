Just the rantNot aloud to read sorry 


Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m floating away, yet no one is to notice. Iâ€™m just drifting as far as possible. Maybe, just maybe Iâ€™d actually miss my life or maybe not and Iâ€™m fine with not knowing. But that shit donâ€™t just happen, thatâ€™s not life. You live a long life, you struggle or you just donâ€™t. Well, thatâ€™s not realistic and thatâ€™s not the reality we live in. You die no matter what, you could get; sick, old age or suicide. But tell me how can people just leave you alone, sometimes I feel nothing at all, and I like it. Sometimes I feel to much and it drives me crazy, like I canâ€™t breath and I just need someone to hold me.  But would that be enough for me, or is the real destiny or whatever, is to do the one thing youâ€™re scared to do. But I could say, I could cry out; Anyone I donâ€™t care who, whoever sees me drowning just hold me. Hold me tight, hold me like youâ€™re never going to let go. Yet, I think people are blind to see the truth, until someone dies, itâ€™s a reality that hits us humans and you donâ€™t feel. You donâ€™t feel that loss, you forget. No matter how much you tell yourself you miss them or how much youâ€™ll miss them. Your life will go on the same, because you donâ€™t want to die and the only way to actually feel something, to feel a loss so deep because youâ€™ve loved them so much. Is going to end up driving you to kill yourself. And I want to die. Iâ€™m no therapist, yet you guys donâ€™t know anything and I bet you just assume Iâ€™m fine, I am fine. Exactly, right? Yet you just donâ€™t ask because I joke about it to many times, I donâ€™t know why... maybe Iâ€™m not ready,, sounds so fucking hypocritical. But arenâ€™t we all. All fucking hypocrites. Not so harsh now, but I had a feeling you guys all knew what was coming or what was wrong with me. Do you want me to hold you, do you want me to tell you how much I want you to live. No, I donâ€™t... no matter how much you try to save me, maybe thereâ€™s nothing to save and Iâ€™m broken. Iâ€™m not angry, Iâ€™m not sad. Probably could change in the future, you could make me really happy and our hopes and dreams that we told will come true but I canâ€™t help to think. I think about it all the time. I make up  these thoughts in my head and I picture how itâ€™ll happen, everyday. Even when Iâ€™m happy as fuck. It just hits me out of nowhere, I see myself dying and itâ€™s fucked up if youâ€™d ask me. Deep down you know your life would be better without me. A life without Tia would be great. Just think about the freedom, the not hurting me, and not feeling like you need to tell me to get lost. Tia get fucking lost, leave and just go ... why canâ€™t I just go. I donâ€™t know. Maybe itâ€™s my breath just breathing and maybe itâ€™s my heart just pumping. Am I really here, do you really see me or do you just see this girl who is annoying and happy. Even though this is not my real name. Doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not true.
