The last note wrote,I see a future full of hope and then I see a future of needles. 

I choose the needles every fucking time.

I want to go out and be something. I want to be known. I want friends, I want a damn life.

But all that shit takes effort. 
And whatâ€™s the point making effort.

I could start now and change everything. Thatâ€™ll take time.

I could get high right now and melt into the couch with the artificial happiness Iâ€™ve created.

Iâ€™ll take that any day of the week.
