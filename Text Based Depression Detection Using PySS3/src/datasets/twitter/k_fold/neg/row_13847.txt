Has anyone ever had their therapist break a lease?I live with two verbally abusive roommates, 2300 miles away from home. I can't do it anymore. In order to quite literally stay alive, as well as preserve my mental health, I need to get out ASAP. 
Does anyone have experience with their therapist breaking your lease due to mental health? 
Would that break the lease for my two roommates as well?

Aside from that, any tips to hold on to my sanity until I can get out? Locking myself in my room every day is really taking a toll. UGH. Thanks in advance!
