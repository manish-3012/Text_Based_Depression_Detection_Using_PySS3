I love my life, but every night I cry in my room thinking about suicide.This has been happening way too often recently again, and I am currently just crying in my bedroom. I love my life, but I canâ€™t stand my mom. She is the only reason I get no sleep ever, she is the reason I trade out pillows at night because mines already wet. I canâ€™t do anything right in her eyes. And what makes it all worst is that she doesnâ€™t even know how suicidal I am. She constantly bombards me with shameful comments and I act like I donâ€™t care because if I do sheâ€™ll use them against me. She loves, and I love her, but she thinks sheâ€™s helping my family turn into better people when sheâ€™s really destroying it. Again, I love my life. Within the past week Iâ€™ve just been noticing how much joy I have doing what I do. This is when Iâ€™ve realized that everything that makes me so depressed with life is her. She comes home late with my sisters everyday late at night, so I get her bull crap always at the end of the day. This is why every night I think about writing my last words and just grabbing a knife. When I try to stand up against my moms stupid ass comments so tries to play as the victim, and says she feels attacked and one of these days sheâ€™s going to kill herself. I know she wonâ€™t. Sorry that this post doesnâ€™t make much sense, it was just whatever came to my mind at the moment. This post while writing however did make me feel a lot better. Iâ€™m not going to kill my self because I know itâ€™ll hurt and that makes me oddly feel better too. Please no one of you see this comment. Writing is for some reason making me feel nice, even if it is all jumbled up.
