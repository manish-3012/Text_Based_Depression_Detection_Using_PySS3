So tiredI am just...tired. I have been dealing with depression and whatnot for the past 6 years and I am so on and off with it it's exhausting having the comparison to when times were okay. I'm on my third week of abilify and at first I was fine/almost manic with energy. Now I feel physically sick. Like not just having an upset stomach. My whole body and mind are exhausted and I feel like I have some sickness and I can't function or think my head is bogged down by sadness or apathy whatever. I'm really bummed I thought my energy increase might level off a bit but now I am just crashing. Things ended with my only in person support system and I am truly on my own. Can't keep annoying people with this. I don't think I have many options here. To be honest electroconvulsive therapy is the only thing other than suicide that sounds appealing.

Not sure the point of this
