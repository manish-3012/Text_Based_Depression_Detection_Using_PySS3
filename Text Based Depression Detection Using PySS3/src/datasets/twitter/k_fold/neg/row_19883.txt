Why am i acting like this?Its been 5 years since i want to die and nothing got better, i feel so lonely. But lets be real a bit, its absolutely not the fault of my depression or suicidal thoughts, just my attitude. I really want someone to desire me but i don't do anything for it, i want someone to force me into talking about this, i want someone that say more than ''go see a doctor'' or ''call the hotlines''. I know nobody can change what i am except me, and its asking a lot, everybody has their own problem why would they care about me, its normal. But its hard whenever i try to change a little bit, like just trying to be positive for a single thought,  that little voice is insulting me and making fun of me. Who is he? I hate him, why is he still there. Recently i have lost to self harm and, well, its feeling good, i can punish him for being mean to me all this time. I really hope he will suffer. I am alone and hopeless. I feel like i'm nothing. I've lost my soul 5 years ago. I'm not me anymore, i'm someone else. And this someone else is acting weird. I really feel i am unkillable and this is awful to think about, i want it so badly.


When i posted here in the past, people told me to be kind with myself, i don't understand. What is it supposed to mean? Am i not kind with myself ?
