18 year old girl about to be homelessI left an abusive household where my parents (especially my dad) sexually abused me for years. Around the time I turned 18, my dad would try to get me to sell my body to him in exchange for money. 

My last straw was hearing my parents talking about sending me off to the middle east and marrying me off. When I left, I had no money, no legal documents, no family and no friends.

 I've been living in a homeless shelter since November, and the staff told me they wouldn't kick me out until I found a place to stay, but things have changed and they're kicking me out on the 29th. 

I have section 8 and for weeks after I applied for an apartment, the staff told me not to get a job and to focus on housing first. The apartment didn't work out and now I have no job and no housing. I did apply for another section 8 apartment, but its a big maybe.

I've told the people close to me that i'll be alright, but it's just me putting up a facade.

I don't know what will happen to me. I have a friend who would be willing to let me crash, but I would only be able to stay for a couple of days because of his lease.

Being out on the streets is scary, the amount of creepy comments/solicitation of prositution made towards me frightens me, and I'm not even on the streets right now.

I don't have any family I can go to, and I don't have any close friends in the area either. I'm doing all I can, but I feel so scared. I don't know what to do, but I would rather kill myself than go back to my parents.
