I feel like I'm giving upI dont wanna go to school, I dont wanna go outside, I just wanna stay in my room. Stay in my room alone. Away from everyone I don't want to talk to anyone anymore. Not because of hate, but because of the pain. I'm sick and tried of going through it. It happens to fucking much. Everyone leaves, they forget me and I have Start from square one It's so hard to find people, God for bib ones I can open up to. I don't want anymore of it. I just want to be away from everyone and be in a dream forever. I don't want to wake up anymore In a dream I dont feel nothing, and that's what I want. I just want to fucking die I just wanna sleep. And if dont die soon, from something. 
Then I'll  be the that does it. Fuck the letters I was writing for them, they dont like me anymore. They dont give a shit if Im ten feet in the ground. they only care if its their fault or not. Not that its me thats dead

I have been searching ways to kill myself with out it being so painful. I can't put a bullet to the head I don't have a gun. I cant jump I'm in no city or bridge. And cant drive to one if I'm only 15. But when I find it, I'll be gone.
