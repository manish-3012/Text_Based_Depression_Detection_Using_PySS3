I cannot even kill myself correctlyI have no joy. Others around me think I just bitch and complain about everything. I am a burden to myself and others. I begin arguing and starting fights. I can't communicate with others without complaining. I forget things I say and do. I see no point of causing chaos with all of my family members. I tried killing myself last night. I took my last 5mg of hydrocodone, 600mg of gabapentin and 100mg of Baclofen. I smoked pot just in case of pain. I can't even kill myself right. I do NOTHING right. I do not want to be here anymore.
