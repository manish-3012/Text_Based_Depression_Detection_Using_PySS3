Is there a point anymore?I'm sitting here really trying to think if there is a point to anything, making friendships, "love" , achieving, fairly point less in the grand scheme  of things, we will die be forgotten as time goes on , our lives are meaningless  we wake up work, feel defeated , every day and for what? honestly?
