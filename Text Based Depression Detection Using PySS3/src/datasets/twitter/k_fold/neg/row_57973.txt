Do hotlines help?i just wanted to know if hotlines help; has anyone used a hotline before? i don't want to call just to have my address tracked and cops called.  i haven't been well and i don't know what else to do. i want to kill myself but don't want to at the same time? mostly because im a coward, but i would like to get some help. also, are there any hotlines that aren't a voice call?  (im sorry this is my first post here.)
