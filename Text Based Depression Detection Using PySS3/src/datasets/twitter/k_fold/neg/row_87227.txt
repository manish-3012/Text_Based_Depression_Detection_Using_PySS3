The thought of committing suicide actually helps with anxiety.Itâ€™s a very strange mindset I have, very paradoxical to say the least. I have bad anxiety, Iâ€™m sure plenty of you can relate, and suicide seems to help with it. I get in stressful situations and I feel like there is no way to save myself from the inevitable. I then think of suicide and I always have that as an alternative. Thinking like this helps me say â€œfuck itâ€ and perform tasks, because it seems like I will die soon so I donâ€™t care. So in a sense, the thought of suicide prevents me from committing suicide. I know this is an extremely toxic mindset, but itâ€™s been helping so far. Does anyone else feel the same?
