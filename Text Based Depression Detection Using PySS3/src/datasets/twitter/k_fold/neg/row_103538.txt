The hospital muffled my cry for help.I felt like I had nowhere else to go. 

My boyfriend of 3 years and I were planning to move in together and talking about marriage, when he suddenly dumped me for my friend and got his own place. 

I lost my job due to my mental issues causing an inability to work. Despite struggling with mental health for as long as I can remember, I have not gotten a diagnosis because I cannot afford medical help. Due to not being able to get a diagnosis, I canâ€™t apply for disability. So I have no job or income, no place to live (no supportive family), and Iâ€™m just getting more and more debt. 

Immediately after losing my last job, I walked to the emergency room at the local hospital. I briefed them on my situation, including telling them about how I am suicidal and hear voices that are seriously getting out of control, to the point where theyâ€™re beginning to be able to control my body and I am losing all feelings of control over my life. I also told them explicitly that I did NOT want to leave due to what was going on.

At the hospital, they left me alone in a room for what felt like a long time until a nurse came in, and gave me a pill to â€œcalm me downâ€. Ended up being an Ativan which Iâ€™ve never had before. The Ativan made me feel all loopy and between that and the nurse somehow I got talked into leaving, but not before they gave me a prescription for NINETY pills, which they said were a starter antidepressant which of course just went onto the credit card bill.

It seems like the world has given me every sign to just give up. Iâ€™ve been avoiding the hospital and saving it as a final cry for help, but even the people who are paid to save lives donâ€™t give a shit about me.

tl;dr
I went to the hospital ER saying I was suicidal, they left me alone then gave me 90 pills and influenced me to leave after I told them I donâ€™t want to. Feel like Iâ€™m out of options.
