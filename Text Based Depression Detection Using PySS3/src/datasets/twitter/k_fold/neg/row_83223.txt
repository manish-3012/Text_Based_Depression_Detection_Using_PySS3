i numb myself all the timeI always had hope, but now i am bereft of it. I've dealt with suicidal ideation before, and i thought hope would always be there to pick me up... but it's nowhere to be found. 

Even though i have things to be hopeful for, i've just dug myself into such a pit... I'm not sure if i can get out of it.

I feel like such a pathetic person that is not worthy of love. i get high and/or drunk constantly, and if i go more than a day without numbing myself, the pain and self-loathing comes crashing down tenfold...

i just want to be happy, but I'm not sure if that's an option anymore
