Why canâ€™t I have a friend?1. Iâ€™ll bring them down to my level

2. Iâ€™ll suck the life out of them

3. Theyâ€™ll never really accept me

4. I donâ€™t know how to be a friend

5. Thereâ€™s nothing interesting about me

6. I canâ€™t afford any hang outs anyways

7. I donâ€™t deserve a friend

8. Iâ€™m sick all the time

9. My existence is a detriment

10. Iâ€™m not worth it

But Iâ€™m still so fucking lonesome. I just want to die.
