She dumped me.I've been feeling down lately. All I do is smoke pot, play video games, and listen to music. This girl was starting to become special, and she ended things with me. "We're two different people"
It sucks, and I don't know what to do. Suicide isn't going to happen, but I just needed somewhere to vent where people feel incredibly depressed. I keep crying, and I don't know what to do.

I miss having a girl around, and not having one hurts.
