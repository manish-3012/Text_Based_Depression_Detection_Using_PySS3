I feel so alone, no one caresI posted here before about my fiancee breaking up with me. Turns out a week and half after we broke up, she was seeing some other guy and now they've broken up. She rang me crying saying why did it have to be like this. It hurts me knowing that she was with him, enjoying herself, whilst I was crying myself to sleep every night. She said a part of her still loves me and she wants to be my friends but it's too hard.

I have depression and I beat her a few times, I was a total prick towards her, so I don't blame her for leaving me, I blame me and I just can't deal with the pain anymore. I'm living with so much regret and guilt and remorse over what I did and I'm hurting so much. I just wanna end it all. I feel so close to giving up. I'm a disgusting waste of space, I deserve to die. I can't do it anymore. I don't wanna suffer anymore.
