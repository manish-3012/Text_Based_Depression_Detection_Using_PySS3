Either a blessing in disguise or maybe the worst thing thatâ€™s will ever happen to meFor the longest time, i can say; iâ€™ve lived my life searching for a reason to kill myself. Family, parents, breakup, friends; you name it. Little did i know that one day, i would â€œmaybeâ€ cross paths with this little virus called HSV; or simply known as herpes. you can try to tell me this isnâ€™t the end, this is NOT something u want to end ur life over. but, to be honest; death before dishonor. if i canâ€™t be a host of my own life and body, what makes you think iâ€™ll simply turn into a walking host for a virus ? do you think thatâ€™s what i want to be known as ? no, and i simply cannot bear the idea of living after this. if i test positive, i donâ€™t know when or how the hell im going to do it. but i sense the end is near. i didnâ€™t want to kill myself over an STD but, i guess beggars canâ€™t be choosers.
