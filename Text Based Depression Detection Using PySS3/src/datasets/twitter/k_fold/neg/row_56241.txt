Help meThis isn't exactly suicide related but I didn't know where to turn. My father is emotionally abusive and as a result of this I have dealt with suicidal thoughts and actions before and have spend time at an outpatient center. My father is threatening to no longer allow me to attend school and when I said I would contact the school or child Protection agencies, which I have never contacted before, he said he would kill anyone who showed up and kick my ass. He has hit me before. I don't feel safe I my home right now but I'm not sure what to do.

Edit: thanks for the words of advice. I'm at school waiting to go and see my counselor.  I'll update when I have the chance.
