My friend is suicidal, please help me redditMy friend, a female, just told me that she wants to die and has aleady cut her arm open a couple times. Shes a meth smoker and I think she's been smoking it all weekend. Her best friend did some awful shit to her yesterday out of what seems to be jealousy regarding her new boyfriend.

I think I convinced her to go see a doctor as I didn't know what else to do, shes offline now but I told her to sms me when she gets to the doctor.

I could really use some good advice right now.
