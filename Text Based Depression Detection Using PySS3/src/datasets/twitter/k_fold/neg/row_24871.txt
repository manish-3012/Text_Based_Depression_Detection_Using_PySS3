Why does anyone care?I don't understand why anyone likes me. I feel like I just bring everyone down with my depression and negativity. It seems to matter to some other people a whole lot whether I live or die and I don't get it. I guess they just see the nice parts of me, the big things that make me seem like a good person. But I see these little things and from my view, I think it just ruins me. Like I have literally everything anyone could want and I still feel suicidal. If I'm inevitably going to keep feeling suicidal over and over, what's the point? It would be better for me to get it over with now than to commit suicide at some later stage when people are depending on me. I just don't see it as a big deal if I die now, and I don't get why everyone seems to care so much about suicide, and why anyone would care if I died. 

I have a place in mind, and I probably would end it, but knowing how it would affect family and friends, I can't.
