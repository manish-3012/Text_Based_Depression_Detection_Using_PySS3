I'm Completely Alone...I'm a guy hitting my mid-twenties, and I feel so alone and POWERLESS.  I've never touched a woman, and I feel nobody is interested in me.  Everyone ignores me.  My family treats me like a child, and everywhere I go I feel small and EMASCULATED.  I try very hard but I don't ever get credit for anything I do.  I'm so damn pessimistic, but maybe with reason.  I don't think I'll kill myself in the next few months, but I always worry that somewhere down the line, it will happen.  I'm just growing resentful of people and so damn tired.
