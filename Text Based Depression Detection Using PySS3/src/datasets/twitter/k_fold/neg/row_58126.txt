My life is overI dont know what else I can do anymore. Im trying to get out of a relationship with this girl, and she recently told me that she is pregnant, and wants to keep the child. I really dont know if she is lying or not, but for the moment, I feel I must stay in a relationship that was utterly abusive just so I don't have a kid. I don't want a kid, I'm only 19, and I can't handle this. I can't trust that she'll actually abort it, as she keeps on changing her answer, she keeps on telling me that she wants it. If she has a child, my life is ruined. I can't live with that. I can't live with this. Death is the only way out right now. I don't know what else I can do.
