I want to die.I'm an 18-year-old who just moved away from most of my family. I live with my dad and go to a college fairly close to where I live. I just finished my first semester of college with hardly any human contact, and will most likely spend new years eve alone. I see all these posts on social media about people who want to go back to college to see their friends. When I see these posts I start crying. I've also begun to cut myself....something I never expected myself to do. I wish I would've been invited to at least one party in high school and would've never gone solo to prom. I see all these posts on instagram and snapchat of people hanging out with their friends and I wish I could've done something like that. I care about my family, and that's the only thing that's keeping me from killing myself at the moment. Recently, I went on a date which was ok. There were several moments in which I could've made a move but I was too afraid. After the date, I cut myself. I hate living.
