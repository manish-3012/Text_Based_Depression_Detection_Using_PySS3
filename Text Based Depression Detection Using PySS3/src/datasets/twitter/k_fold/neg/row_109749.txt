Is there something wrong with me?Not much to say but everyday I think about killing myself, for the past week Ive slept with a rope under my bed, I just got rid of it today though. This morning I felt like I just wanted to kill myself. Im not depressed as I was before but I feel stale and empty, its like im dragging myself. Im doing so much to keep my mind clear. I work out almost everyday and started playing pool as a new hobby and I love it. Ive met new people and made new friends and about to get back into school. Generally my mind is calm but that thought of doing something to myself is always on me. I dont like being alone because of these thoughts. I havent told anyone about how im feeling because everyone thinks im over it.
