I just donâ€™t know whatâ€™s next for me anymoreI gave up on life a long time ago. Inside, Iâ€™m simply dead. Iâ€™ve never had a job. I dropped out of high school years ago. I have no friends. Thatâ€™s why I look and sound miserable. The only reason I havenâ€™t committed suicide (but think about it everyday) is because I canâ€™t bring myself to do such a thing to my small family. I love them. But man, everyday I have to deal with a mental breakdown and I donâ€™t know for how long I can handle it.
