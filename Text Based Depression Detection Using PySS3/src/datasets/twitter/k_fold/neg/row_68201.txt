My father destroyed my familyMy father has been a terrible person ever, he betrayed my mother, at the time she almost killed herself. After a few years it seemed that all was well, but my father got into trouble with some people without any need, he could just stay quiet and said nothing, but he made sure to talk what he talked and now there is no turning back. My mother said she is going to kill herself and she probably will, because the situation is very bad. Well, if that happens, I think I have no choice but to die too, because I already have some health issues that make my life very difficult and I don't know how I would be able to survive on my own. I hate my father so much.
