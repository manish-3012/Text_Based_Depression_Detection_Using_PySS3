What the fuck can I do with my life?I want to drop out of university. But thatâ€™ll only mean I have to repay my tuition fees and maintenance loan, and that Iâ€™ll go nowhere in life. How can I even pay it all back?

Iâ€™m constantly told I canâ€™t get anywhere in life without a degree. Is this even true?

I have no clue what I want to do in life, but Iâ€™m certain I want to drop out because I hate my degree. I donâ€™t find any other degree interesting either. And I donâ€™t want to go into things like retail or joining the army. What exactly can I do? Have I wasted my life? Will I live unemployed forever simply because very little interests me and because I wonâ€™t have a degree?

I got into a â€œgoodâ€ university that is high on the league tables (which doesnâ€™t matter), yet Iâ€™m also being told to be grateful because others have it worse and would literally die to be in my position - and so I have a strong feeling of guilt for hating my course.

I donâ€™t see myself being alive within the next few years so whatâ€™s the point anyway?
