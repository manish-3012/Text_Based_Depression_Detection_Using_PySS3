Why's everything so fucking hard?Waking up is hard. Eating is hard. Fucking walking is hard. Don't even get me started on going out. I hate my life. It's so unfair. I'm not able to die painlessly, and why? There's no reason. It's just not possible. I'm failing at everything, and I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself. Fuck my life. Fuck me. Fuck everything.
