Four Months Sober, Then I Got High. I am baked right now. I'm listening to Ravi Shaknar. I realized I have an addiction to this stupid online community. The people in the community are incredibly racist and huge assholes. Like, I let them torment me all day. When I go on this site I guess I say random and confusing things. It makes me insecure and like an idiot. I don't really have friends IRL and it frustrates me man. I have mental health issues and i still got high. lmao. don't do it not worth it. drugs dont work ... i just feel like shit now and i keep struggling with abandoning this stupid nline com. just ruined my clean streak.
