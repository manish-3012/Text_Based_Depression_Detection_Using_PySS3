Can't sleep. just so stressed.I don't know what to do, I'm just really panicking right now.  I haven't been sleeping lately (30 min the past 2 days...) and everything is becoming a lot.  I really don't know what's wrong with me.  No matter what I do, I just can't make friends.  People talk to me sure, but they don't like me at all.  I started cutting again a couple of days ago and speeding with prescription meds more and more. Instead of helping it just made me feel so much worse.  I don't really see a point to this right now. i just can't be happy.. I'm just a waste of time and space.  I'm struggling. i can't do this. i just can't. i really just need someone to talk to.
