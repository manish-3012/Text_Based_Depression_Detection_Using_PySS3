I havenâ€™t felt this way since the days I would self harm in high schoolItâ€™s gotten to the point where I feel like it would be easier to disappear. Iâ€™m suffering and Iâ€™m tired of putting up a front about it. Iâ€™ve tried to process my emotions, tried to be positive and every other clichÃª in the book. This wave of sadness and hurt feels never ending. Iâ€™m so afraid, nothing feels comforting right now.
