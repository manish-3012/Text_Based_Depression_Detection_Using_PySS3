Can't live without herI'm 20m, in college. Had low grade depression for about 7 years but resolved to get over it and turn my life around last year. And I did, for a time.

Last Fall I began to make friends for the first time in forever and I fell in love with one of them that I became especially close to. I'd had plenty of crushes before, but this was the first time I'd ever felt so strongly. Not just about another person, about anything really. I felt like my life finally had a purpose. I had found a reason to live. I was the happiest and most motivated I'd ever been in my life.

So in December I asked her out. She said no. I was crushed, but figured that I could go onward, maybe things could change between us. But for now, we could just continue as friends. Except then she began to avoid me. She ignored my texts, always sat across the room from me in class (we used to sit next to each other every day), avoided eye contact, really just did everything to make it obvious she wanted nothing whatsoever to do with me. I was garbage and had been tossed aside as such. My reason to live was gone.

Months later and it's still the same. I'm too awkward and anxious to confront her about it. I still love her, but I'm almost certain things will never work out. Every day I sink deeper and deeper. I hate myself more and want to die more. 

I've been getting professional help for these past few months but it feels like it's only delaying the inevitable. Since we'll likely never be together, I won't be happy again. I can't and have no desire to move on. And so there's only one way I see this realistically ending.

Not sure why I'm even posting this. I don't want to feel better. Sorry for wasting everybody's time.
