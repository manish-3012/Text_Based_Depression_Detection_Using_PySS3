I am going to get fat as the last remaining motivation to kill myselfI pretty much have everything of being a total loser in the books. Jobless, addict to video games/porn, living with parents, no skills, no friends, it goes on. The only thing I am missing is obesity. Maybe once I am there I will have that last push to push me off the edge of the high mountain I have been wanting to jump.
