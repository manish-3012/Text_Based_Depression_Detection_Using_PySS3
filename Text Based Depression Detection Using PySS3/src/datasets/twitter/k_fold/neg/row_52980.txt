I need to ventI've been depressed for 4 years 4 long awful hopeless years but 2020 has made it all worse see my mom is abusive not physically but mentally she yells harases me makes me feel worthless tells me every day how dissapointed she is in me and that how I should be so much better why am I not better im raising you and my dad as much as he trys just goes along with it watches and even encourages her a bit the first thing us that they both work in the medical industry so the few friends I had now avoid me like well the plague they skip school classes just to not see me they schedule meetings and hangouts on days I can't make it even though they know I can't make it and before you say I'm reading into things here theyve told me they probably won't ever want to hang out with me again, my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me because I was depressed I had one really big beacon of light in my life my sister until she realized I wanted to become a cop swat to be more specific she then started ignoring me despite my protests every time I try to talk to her she calls me worthless scum of the earth that shouldn't be here, and she's right my overwatch tournament team has kicked me out my friends there dont want anything to do with me anymore and now I realise they where all right I really shouldn't exist
