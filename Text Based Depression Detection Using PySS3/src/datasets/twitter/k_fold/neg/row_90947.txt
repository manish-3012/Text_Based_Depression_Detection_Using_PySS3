I'm 15 and cannot keep going.I hate this. I'm a freshman. I am a smart kid but failing most of my classes and I am a complete fuck-up. I have hurt a couple girls this year by committing then ditching or stuff of the sort. I hate myself for all that  I've done. I have a couple hobbies but I have no interest. People think I'm an introvert. I am always negative but have 0 motivation to be otherwise. I have a good family and am wealthy but feel spoiled and hateful. I have days where I am positive, but it all ends when the friend leaves. I used to have interest in so many things but I lack motivation for things I love to do. I am just worthless and do not want to continue on through this high school, with verbally abusive parents and a terrifying lack of care for anything that exists. Someone, please just help... I want someone I can check in with daily, or even someone that kind of cares... I just don't want to "be" anymore... I know that suicide is horrible but I have no alternative... either kill myself now or deal with the hatred and the depression I'm in, only to lead an unsuccessful life...
