I am exhaustedIt's been exactly five years since I ended up in a psych ward. Ten years since I started self harm. I am so tired of everything- the pain, the expectations, hurting others, being a burden... I'm a newlywed and I already fucked up. I am a broken failure. I keep trying things that could "fix" me and I end up deeper.

This is my cycle, my five year breakdown. What's going to happen this time? will I even survive?
