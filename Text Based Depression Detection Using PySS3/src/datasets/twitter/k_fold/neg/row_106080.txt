I'm 16 and my life is coming to an endI won't go into too much detail because nobody cares but let me just say that I have no social life, I haven't left my home in like 6 months because I developed agoraphobia which has gotten so bad to the point where I can't stop shaking whenever I leave my house and I have no future whatsoever because I stopped going to school in grade 9 and I have an addiction to cigarettes and I just can't stop smoking them no matter how hard I try. I have anorexia too and I starve myself up to multiple days a week and everyone thinks I'm going to starve to death.

That's not even the end of it but a lot of stuff that has happened is personal and I don't feel comfortable posting it on the internet

Might as well end it all because there's no hope

Thanks mom and dad for abandoning me at birth

I had the worst 16 years of life ANYONE could ask for

I don't need help, I just wish that I was never born and everything would have been fine.
