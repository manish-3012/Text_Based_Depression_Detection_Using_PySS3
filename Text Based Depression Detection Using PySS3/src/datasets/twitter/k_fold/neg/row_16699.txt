What am I doing anymore?I don't really know what to do. I just want to escape the standard life. I'm expected to live in a way the forces me to be in contact with people. I don't have anxiety. I just genuinely hate interacting with people but I do what I can to fake it. I don't want a life of being with people. I just want to be alone. I can't be happy in the presence of others. I haven't for a long time. Yeah all of this is self inflicted and I get that so I'm not blaming anyone except myself. I've lost a lot of my friends because they choose to attack me when I talk but that's because I have different opinions or the way I convey them. I used to be depressed early on in high school and I tried sophomore year but it's different now. I used to day dream about it then and hated looking for help. Now it makes me sad that I have these thoughts again. I don't want to but I don't see myself being happy with anything the world has to offer me. I'm a first gen college student and I have a little brother that I had to raise until my grandfather took us but I can't see anything that's going to make me happy so why not leave everyone and end it so they don't have to see me unhappy?
