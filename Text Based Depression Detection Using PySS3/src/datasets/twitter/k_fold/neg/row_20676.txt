Why me?Is anyone else scared to die? Like, youâ€™re not scared to die but, scared of what happens after? I donâ€™t believe in god but I believe in the devil (hard to explain how that works) Iâ€™ve done some pretty shitty things in my life so Iâ€™m scared to kill myself but I want to. Can anyone relate?
