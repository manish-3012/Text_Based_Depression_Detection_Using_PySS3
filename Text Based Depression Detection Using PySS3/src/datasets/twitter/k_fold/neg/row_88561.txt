Iâ€™m going tonightI have a condition thatâ€™s untreatable and canâ€™t be cured. Iâ€™m kind of scared but I think things will go okay. Iâ€™ve never actually had a near death experience so I have no idea how this will go but itâ€™s my only option. This is how i spare myself and my family from future suffering. Iâ€™m gonna watch my favourite show and mix the stuff together. Then Iâ€™ll sit back and pray I donâ€™t panic too much. Iâ€™m too incapacitated to think about how everyone will react but itâ€™s okay. Iâ€™ll be gone. Like before I was born nothing will of ever happened or have ever been. And so all the bad things will be wiped away. I just hope my family forgives me
