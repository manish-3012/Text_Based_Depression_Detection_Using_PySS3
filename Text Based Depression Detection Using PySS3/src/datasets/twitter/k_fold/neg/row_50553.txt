What am I doing wrongI donâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m doing wrong in my life. Iâ€™m trying as hard as I can I really am but I still slip up sometimes and people always remember the times I mess up. Never the times that I succeed. Nobody will hire me or date me or like me. Everybody stays away from me except for a very small number of friends. And even they wonâ€™t hang out with me or do things with me. They have other friends who are more important that they need to make time for. They all have jobs even if their grades are worse than mine. What am I doing wrong I just want to be happy and successful. I donâ€™t even want to try anymore itâ€™s just too hard and not worth it. Every time something good happens or potentially happens it always gets ruined. Iâ€™m tired of it and want it all to stop but I canâ€™t make it stop
