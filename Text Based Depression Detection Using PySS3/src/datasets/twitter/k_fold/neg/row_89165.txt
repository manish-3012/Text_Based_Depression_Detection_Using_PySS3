Running away or killing myself.Don't really care for going into much detail but I have enough to go to one way and eat cheaply for maybe 4 days wherever I end up going yet nowhere to stay. But fuck it, it's better than all that's going on now. I could just end it all but why miss out on trying for an adventure, yeah? Or maybe end it all after my short lived adventure. Decisions amirite!?
