I am a failureA disappointment. I called the hotline today finally and it didnâ€™t help. I want to die and get it over with but Iâ€™m so scared. The darkness keeps creeping in closer and closer and itâ€™s getting harder to keep it at bay. How am I so numb but also in complete agony at the same time??
