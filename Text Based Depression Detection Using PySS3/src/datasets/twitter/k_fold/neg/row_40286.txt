I have the "happy accident syndrome"I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I fear the pain, and I dread the possibility that I may not die from my attempt. So I hope that I will die in some freak accident every day. I feel like life is a grey plane, and that I don't belong on this earth. I am a colossus of a man (like 6''9' for more than 200lb), and I never fit anywhere. I'm shit with people and nobody likes me... I just want it to end. Pray that I will be a victim of a lethal event, because it's the only thing I have left.
