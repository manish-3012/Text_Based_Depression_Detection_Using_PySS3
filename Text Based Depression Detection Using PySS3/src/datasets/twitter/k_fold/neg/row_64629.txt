Fucked up.So I'm 17. My life has never been that great. All ways had plenty of "friends" but never those I could call close. Never any luck with the girls. But I did have that one really close friend. She was awesome, everything to me. Then I fucked it all up by being a complete idiot and making her cry. I sent her a fucking long message apologizing and she said it was cool and all fine. But it seems like she ignores me at school , like she doesn't speak to me. This makes me lonely in a sense and I really miss her.. also, school. In my school we have core math and math lit. I take core math bbut I'm hopeless, I get like 20% and my mom would never let me take math lit. I'm also fucking tiny being 17 and weighing 50 Kilograms. This makes people laugh at me and stuff. I'm already insecure but fuck. I lost my only close friend in the world, I liked her but I was willing to hide that to keep the friendship but now both chances are gone. I feel like k have no hope in life, will never finish school and lately have been crazy depressed and thanking of just using my belt somehow, don't know. Haven't really thought how I'd go yet. I'm just useless at everything
