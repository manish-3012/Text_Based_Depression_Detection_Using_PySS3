Nine and a half weeks.It's been nine and a half weeks since I started to think about dying. About death. About killing myself. But I'm not going to do it. Because nine and a half weeks ago my best friend killed herself. And I feel empty and worthless. I want to die. I don't want to put my loved ones through what I'm going through. I don't want them to feel my emptiness. Nine and a half weeks and my life has never been worse. Nine and a half weeks and my grief escalated from just grief to a sort of depression. "There's this big part of the world that's just gone, and everyone keeps moving forward."
