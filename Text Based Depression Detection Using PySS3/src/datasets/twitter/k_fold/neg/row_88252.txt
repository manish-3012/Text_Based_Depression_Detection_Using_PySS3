I think I fucked upA few days ago I told my significant other that I didn't love her, so she would leave me alone, I wanted to take distance from her, so I could kill myself and she wouldn't feel guilty about my death, she was my emotional support, and the urges to kill myself just keep growing as my life is  crumbling down, I really miss her, but there is nothing I can do to repair the damage that I caused, it feels like now more than ever death is the only way.
