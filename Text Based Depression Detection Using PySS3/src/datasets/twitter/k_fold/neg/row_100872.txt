Nothing will ever change, I'm just a waste of oxygen.There's absolutely no point to this post. I just need to die right now, seriously, I'm trapped. I'm non religious in a community of strict believers, I'm painfully lonely, I have severe social anxiety and anger issues, I even feel on edge around my mother and sister for god's sake. I don't want to leave my house, but I don't want to stay in, I don't want be alone, but I don't want to be around people. And it doesn't help that I'm a hypersensitive piece of shit. I'm only still alive because I don't want to dissapoint my family. I'll hurt them to think I went to hell. How many other people would kill to have my life, I absolutely don't deserve it, what the hell am I still doing here?
