12 years studying for job I don't want.Now every morning I wake up wanting to end life.

12 years studying to be academic psychologist.

Completely lost faith in the job - so many regrets, wish I'd done something else.

The brutal work required to be successful at anything kills my soul and I can't retrain, I can't spend 8 hours a day doing job hate either - feel trapped.
