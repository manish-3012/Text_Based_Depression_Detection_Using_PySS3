I'm going to kill myself next Thursdayi'm 19 years old and i have officially diagnosed borderline personality disorder . next thursday i'll have an exam and if i fail on that exam that means i can't go to university. actually there's plan B so who the f.k cares about passing or failing what makes me suicidal is the exam-situatuion. so yes, i decided that finally this is the end. i'm going to kill myself by a train next thursday. i had enough time to think it through and i just have to go. i can't live anymore like this. this is inhuman, i'm suffering. and it doesn't matter if i take my pills or if i go to therapy the thing is the thing... i'm suffering. i don't like living at all. why is killing yourself such a big deal, it should be casual because people like me who try their best and still can't reach any tiny mini happiness in their lives shouldn't be alive.
