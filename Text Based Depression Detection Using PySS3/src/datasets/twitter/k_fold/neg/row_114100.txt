I used the text line last night.Things were really bad yesterday, and I was very close to going through with it. I had a plan, I had taken steps to set it up, and I had everything I needed arranged to do it. A little more research on my plan determined it would have been a fairly unpleasant way to go, which is the primary reason I didn't do it.

I ended up breaking down and trying the text line. And, after doing so, I feel more hopeless than ever. I want to be clear that I'm not ragging on the text line or the person on the other end who tried her best. And I'm certainly not meaning to discourage anyone from using that resource. Still, I feel the need to talk about my experience, and my experience left me feeling bleak. It hit me in the face with the reality that I really am that far gone, that my situation really is that far beyond help.  


I don't know what I was really expecting. Maybe a way out, some hope, some relief, some viable direction to maybe actually get out of this. I knew better - I knew that such hope and help did not exist, but I keep finding myself daydreaming about it anyway, and occasionally reaching for it, only to grasp thin air. The worker texted with me for a while, used clearly formulaic responses of superficial support, and, once she was convinced I wasn't going to just off myself then and there, provided me with a link to a website that, after I explored for a time, turned out to be pretty useless unless I had money to cough up for a therapist - and I have had abysmal luck with therapists even if I did.  


I can't blame her or the text line. What more could I really have expected? They aren't miracle workers, and anything that is likely to actually help me at this point would amount to a miracle. I do appreciate them trying. They aren't the problem - I'm the problem. They don't have the tools to solve me, and it wouldn't be reasonable to expect them to.  


If anyone who works for the crisis text line is reading this, I really do appreciate your effort and you being there. I know you've had much better success with people who weren't so absurdly far gone, and you do a good service. This isn't meant to put you down. This is me venting my frustration with myself.
