Guys, I'm not in any trouble, but I think I might a little paranoid (please read)Well last night I was talking to my friend yesterday, who had some family friends over, and at the same time had a fever with a sore throat and headache. She told me she only 1 glass of wine, and a dose of Nyquil. Not sure how much, because I haven't heard from her since last night.  Last thing she told me was that she was sleepy from the Nyquil. Can you guys please tell me if she's in any trouble? She's my best friend I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid, or if my madness actually has a reason behind it...
