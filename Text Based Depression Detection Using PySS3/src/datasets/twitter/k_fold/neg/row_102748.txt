World would be better without meHugely long story but the tl;dr version states basically my life has gotten shit in last 6 years. People I looking after left after treating me poorly and tried to make my life hell. Lost job for a while. 
Then due to family and work and colleague pressure I tried doing stuff myself but treated everyone like shit as I could not deal and so neglected in all ways and kept yelling and complaining person I looking after and really wanted to be with him. My super neglect caused him to rightly so leave forever and not contact me ever. 

I have changed so much with counselling and help and support I am a great person now and can deal with the stress associated. Got ridof of toxic too. But nothing will EVER make me forget how I treated people in that time who not deserve it. The best people. So I may as well leave the world having ensured all my possessions and house etc. Goes to the person I neglected most and deserved it all (was always the plan anyway). I dont deserve to live well and truely and the pain will never go away as he will never want to see or talk again. I cant even contact not knowing where lives or have any contact info now. 

Bye world!
