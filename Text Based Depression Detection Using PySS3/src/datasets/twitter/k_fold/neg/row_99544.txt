I quitSomeone, who has accomplished a series of great things since aged fourteen, just took his own life. What have I accomplished?

When I was fourteen, I was in high school, my teachers were saying something that stuck with me ever since: "You are meant for great things", they kept saying. I did not understand. I turned 15, and a series of events led to going from "you are meant for great things" to "be careful, you're wasting your life". I did not understand that either. Then I turned 18, went to college, dropped out of college, a series of events led to today. I am 27, and I am going ahead with plans to end my life. Why today? It could be the Werther effect, but to be fair, I have been considering ending it since I dropped out of college. And that was 7 years ago.

I live in the third world, and life in here has very little value. Ending it happens all the time in a set of different ways. Ending mine won't be any different.

My uncles abused my mother, my brother and I. I grew up to be a rebel teenager who read too much on the internet and aspired for a better future, a better life, but that meant I had to to fight the people who were abusing me and the reality that enabled them to do so. I lost, and in the process, I made mistakes, those mistakes have been hunting me for the last ten years. I'm tired of running away, I'm tired of lying, I'm tired of making excuses, I'm tired.. Better, stronger and more privileged people than me chose to quit fighting. Why should I not? 

Peace.
