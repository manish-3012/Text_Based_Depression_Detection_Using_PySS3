Don't know how much longer I can carry on.I've been stuck in this slump for the past week or so where I don't feel motivated to do anything. Constantly frowning and pissed off at everything, experiencing multiple, very frequent instances of "l'appel du vide" (the call of the void), and just filled with this horrid sense of dread and unease at everything. I wake up, every morning, cursing myself for not dying in my sleep the night before. I just want it all to stop.
