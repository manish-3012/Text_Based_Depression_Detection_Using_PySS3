Iâ€™m really done.. gonna start preparingIâ€™m just tired. been suicidal for 6+ years and suicidal daily nonstop for like 4 years. I canâ€™t change my life in the way I need to in order to feel even a little better. so Iâ€™m just fucked. and Iâ€™m not gonna make myself keep suffering. I live with family but havenâ€™t spoken to or really seen them for a month now and theyâ€™re doing so much better without me. I tried to kill myself when i was 8 and I really wish it had worked, theyâ€™d be so much better without me all together. so Iâ€™m really ready and done. Iâ€™m gonna start getting ready to kill myself by just cleaning up, writing a â€˜willâ€™, and figuring out what i want to say in my note. 
Iâ€™m not posting for the â€˜donâ€™t kill yourselfâ€™ stuff just because it makes me feel less alone with other people who are suicidal too
