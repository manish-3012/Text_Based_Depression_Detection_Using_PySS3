How to get a friend to not go through his suicide plan when you yourself are suicidalPretty self-explanatory. 

My friend from uni has been in kind of a rough patch actually. The last 3 years have not been kind to him and he eventually has been disillusioned with life and you know have just given up. He has compulsive OCD and anxiety and his meds don't seem to be working according to him. Every progress he makes doesn't seem to help as he says he finds himself in the same place. The uni in this lockdown has also been kind of extra harsh and I really think he'll go ahead with the plan. 

I don't know what to even say I say all kinds of stuff to at least keep living but there's this inherent bias idk. I always wanted to go ahead with my own plan for too long and whenever I say anything, I feel it doesn't come off as convincing. Maybe it does for him, but idk. I feel like I am in kind of a tough spot. He doesn't seem to see anything worthwhile in living and refute every point I put which confirms my own fear that I am not able to convince him. He says he's going to take his life on the 31st after having one last bye with me. In my head, if he does do it, I don't think that I will be able to stop myself too.
