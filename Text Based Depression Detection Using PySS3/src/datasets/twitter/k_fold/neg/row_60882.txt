Nothing seems to change the fact I wanna die?Iâ€™m not depressed anymore, I have friends, I have a good family who supports me and makes sure I got everything. 
But thatâ€™s not good enough for me to want to stay alive. 

Everyday is a struggle, it feels a day is forever for me. I hate working but you know you have to work to do anything in life or go anywhere, but Iâ€™m about be 20 soon and I already have trouble keeping jobs. Donâ€™t say itâ€™s just that job, cause I had over 20 different jobs in fields. Nothing changes the fact I lose motivation everytime cause I remember I have to do this for 40-50 years.. but I can barely last a day? So how I am I suppose to live this life.

I have hobbies but I donâ€™t even enjoy them, I only do whatever cause itâ€™s the only thing to distract me from thinking about suicide. 

Been thinking about making it look like it was accident of killing myself somehow soon in life, my parents now Iâ€™m suicidal so Iâ€™m not sure if they well believe it was accident but other people might.
