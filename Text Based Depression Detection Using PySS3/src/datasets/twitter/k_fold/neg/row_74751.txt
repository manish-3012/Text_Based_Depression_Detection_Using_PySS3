i need help (25m)I might as well state right off the bat, suicide currently isn't an option for me yet, despite believing that's hands down my easiest way out at this point and as much as I want it to be an option.

Everything has lost meaning in my life. My will to go to university, to work, to further myself in life. Why it could possibly be important to wake up in the morning is beyond me. I just don't see the point of every single fucking day, all the negative shit, how everything good comes to an end, it's just this perpetual cycle. I'd explain my story, but I truthfully don't see the point, it just doesn't matter, and i'm feeling beyond hopeless.

I've spoken to counselors and psychologists over the past few months and nothing seems to be helping me. Anti-depressants aren't helping, especially due to my issues being entirely situational.

here's the problem. I hate being alone, i'm always trying to get my feelings or decisions reaffirmed by people, and most of all... I don't love myself, partially due to being treated poorly and discarded ( ghosted from a near 6 year relationship, when I was extremely mentally and physically healthy). I guess, I'm just tired and I don't know what to do anymore.. I don't know how to fix myself anymore.
