Embarrased parentsHave your parents ever told you they're embarrased to call you their child? 
Well mine have when I was 14... I'm 25 now still living in the same roof I struggle with hurting myself.. I have no where else to live but here. I Swear sometimes I'm borderline close to just ending it. I act very impulsive so sometimes the idea gets really Farr. 
I'm I too sensitive I mean is it normal for a parent to say that? 

I'd call my mom a 2 face one minute she's all love and I'm her favorite son (when in front of company) then she'll talk mad shit like wtf... 

Can I send myself to psychiatric insititude? Like I said living here if just hurting me it fells worst then hell. I have high blood pressure and sometimes I just yell into a pillow till I almost pass out . Which is bad. But I don't know how els to release the angry for pain. 
I also smashed me head into things idk... man I need help ... thanks
