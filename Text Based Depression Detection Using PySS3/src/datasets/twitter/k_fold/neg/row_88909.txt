Some notes from my diary latelyReflecting back on some of my prior notes, I feel like the hope is virtually gone now. Somethingâ€™s changed in me. I see the pointlessness of my life, the hopelessness of what Iâ€™d dreamed. To be a father and loving partner...And I feel a combination of apathy and bitterness. Distracting myself, I eat, I drink, I waste time, I smoke. A big part of me just wants to go on some epic fucking bender and end it all when Iâ€™m outta money. Another part of me sees the smiles, the laughter and the good natured moods of people around me and wants them to feel my pain, my hopelessness, my bitterness. I feel acidic, corrosive. It takes most of my energy and strength just to be polite and kind right now. Most of the time, as horrible as it may sound, I just want to tell them to fuck off and stop living in a fantasy world. I want them to feel as hopeless as I do. 

People say be honest. They say â€œwhatâ€™s on your mind?â€. They say you can say anything. Yeah, I highly doubt that...Regardless, I canâ€™t be fucking bothered to lie about what I truly think anymore. Well, at least not here and with select few people anyway. 

Anyway, the hope appears to have been extinguished from my heart as bitterness and despair envelopes it poisonously. I am toxic to those around me now. Iâ€™d say I hope for a positive way out, but to be honest I just want a quick, painless death now. Having attempted before (and knowing how much it sucks to try), I donâ€™t know if or when Iâ€™ll have it in me to try again. Serious suicide attempts are no easy thing to try. I suppose itâ€™s fortunate for my family, â€œfriendsâ€ and the do gooders who want me to live, but I just donâ€™t care anymore. It didnâ€™t used to be like this. Iâ€™d feel guilt. Now? Not much. Theyâ€™ll get over it in time.
