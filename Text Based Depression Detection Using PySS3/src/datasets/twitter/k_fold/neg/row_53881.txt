There is no hope for meSo basically I feel there is no hope or future for me. Iâ€™m going to end up as a disappointment. Iâ€™m not going to college and I have no clue what Iâ€™m gonna do for a living. My mom regularly reminds me that im a failure and Iâ€™m a disappointment to the family. She usually isnâ€™t verbally abusive but she is now. I just have no will to live. Nothing excites me to continue living. Itâ€™s just going to be a bland and unfulfilling life. Iâ€™m a senior about to graduate and I have no plans at all. My dream in life is to be an artist and travel the world. Also I want to have a YouTube/twitch that I can post my travel videos to. Of course all of that is unrealistic. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll pursue that dream. The only thing I look forward to is to escape this dull future. To escape the torment from others. My mother isnâ€™t the only one that has noticed Iâ€™m a failure. Iâ€™m constantly criticized because I was supposed to be this great basketball player and go to college. I fucked all that up now and I have no idea what lies ahead. I understand my problems probably arenâ€™t as bad as some peopleâ€™s on here. But if there is anyone out there that has had similar problems or can help give me hope for life, it would be appreciated. I know I did all this to myself and I am worthless but I need help. Reddit may not be the best place but itâ€™s worth a shot.  Thanks
