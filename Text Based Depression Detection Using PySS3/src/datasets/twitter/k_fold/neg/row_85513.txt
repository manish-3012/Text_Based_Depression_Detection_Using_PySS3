Can someone help me here, please.I just can't keep going. I was chucked out of my house and put through the hell of being in a psych ward. There was no justification for it, just that I was made homeless and since I was with a mental health team, they had a 'duty of care' to put me somewhere. 

My parents fucking despise me and look at me like I'm a disgusting piece of shit. They won't let me in the house, despite the fact I'm in a supported living unit down the road. I don't even have anything I need support with, but I'm just here because they just can't stand me being near them. They told the mental health team I couldn't stay at the house so they put me up in a supported living unit for people with autism/aspergers...which I don't even have.

I don't have the power to change any of this...firstly, I would need money to move, then the emotional resources to cope and some sort of support network but I have nothing. I oscillate between being so confused I can't function, bouts of extreme sadness and INTENSE anger directed both inwards and outwards.

I just feel so awful that when I'm typing these words, I'm struggling to express myself, my brain is just fucking mush. And this anger, it's getting awful. I walk down the street with such hateful thoughts, I feel like strangers are going to attack me or are laughing at me and because of that I'm always ready to defend myself. Honestly...I sometimes feel like I'm going to lash out at someone, I want so badly to just let out all my rage. It's extremely scary...it's such a bloodthirsty, predatory feeling, I am incensed. Otherwise, I'm going to end up killing myself if I keep all of it in.

I have even made plans to end it all. I have made an attempt before, but this time I would chose a more lethal option. I just don't fucking have the energy anymore. This is tortuous. 

Please, can someone offer any advice at least, I can't carry on feeling like this...
