Really bad resultsI just received my results and they are appalling, I got a DDEU for my AS Level. I have no idea what to do my self. My parents are Asian so they a strict when it comes to grades and they said I'm a disappointment. I feel like trying to hang myself. Idk what to do. It would be so much easier just to end it right now.
