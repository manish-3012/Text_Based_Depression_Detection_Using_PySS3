I feel like no matter what I do, I'll cause pain to those I care aboutIf I commit suicide, I tear my family and closest friends apart. Honestly though, I'm still a drain on them if I continue to live. I don't know what to do. Although I know I can't commit suicide for their sake, I feel more and more driven to suicide, and it is tearing me apart.
