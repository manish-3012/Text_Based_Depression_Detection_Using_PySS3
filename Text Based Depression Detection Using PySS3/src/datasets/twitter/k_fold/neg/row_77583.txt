NumbnessI'm 19 today. My girlfriend and parents are really nice about it and clearly gave it a lot of thought. Got my best friend coming over soon, but in all honesty. I feel completely numb and miserable. I feel so guilty for feeling this way because of how much everyone has given to me. I'm drunk and all I can think about is how much I wish I were dead...may 30th 2001, my date of birth which I wish never happened...

Sorry if this is hard to comprehend
