it doesnâ€™t get betteri donâ€™t wanna diagnose myself with depression but letâ€™s say i have been feeling suicidal for about 4 years now, sometimes i feel normal for few days and i think itâ€™s over and that my life is good but it never gets better. i donâ€™t rlly have friends, thereâ€™s a girl that i used to talk to a lot and i told her how i feel but she never did anything so i stopped talking to her. my life is so bad and i keep asking myself what did i do wrong. everything around me is falling apart. i have been raped multiple times and i havenâ€™t told anyone and the worst thing is that i have to see that peroson everyday. my dad does drugs. my parents almost killed eachother and then divorced. police has been in my house too many times. my mom is verbally and physically abusing me. i donâ€™t study bc i have no fucking motivation. no one EVER cared ab me. no one ever actually asked me how i feel. my both brothers are seeng therapists and iâ€™m needing it the most and i canâ€™t see one. itâ€™s rlly expensive so i canâ€™t pay it by myself. i have been sitting on my window every night, trying to jump but iâ€™m scared of hell. i donâ€™t belive in god but my parents baptized me when i was a baby so i guess iâ€™m a christian. if u are going to comment some dumb shit that i have heard before just donâ€™t.
