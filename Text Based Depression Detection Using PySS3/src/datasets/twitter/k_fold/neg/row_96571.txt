Just ventingI tried to kill myself about two weeks ago, I am very behind with school, but I honestly don't care. I don't have any motivation and I just feel frustrated. All the consulers and my family constantly checking in on me is  overwhelming me. I just want to be alone, I feel surrounded. I feel like I'm wasting everyone's time. I'm so grateful for everyone who has been there for me, but I just feel like a burden. They keep asking me to make promises and I just. I'm really trying, but it's so hard and I'm not even sure what to do anymore.
