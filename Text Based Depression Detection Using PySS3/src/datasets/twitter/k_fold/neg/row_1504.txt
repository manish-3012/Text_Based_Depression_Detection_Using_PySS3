Iâ€™m a burden to all those around me and Iâ€™m worth more dead than aliveIâ€™m a burden on my folks and all those who help me. And tell at me because â€œTheyâ€™re tired of helping me.â€  They come over and just start cleaning even when I donâ€™t ask and then get mad at me because I wonâ€™t help them or myself. I never asked for your help; donâ€™t throw it in my face. Iâ€™m unable to care for myself a lot of times; donâ€™t guilt trip me because I canâ€™t do more.  Iâ€™m struggling to find a reason to live each day and doing dishes isnâ€™t a major concern in my daily life. 

My daughter has emotional/behavioral issues from going back and forth between houses with as much animus as my ex and I have. My ex is emotionally and physically abusive but nobody believes me because sheâ€™s the â€œscared housewifeâ€ and Iâ€™m the â€œviolent veteran with a history of mental health.â€  Even though I have recordings and witness statements that she hit me and I never hit her, yet nobody believes it. If my daughter wasnâ€™t splitting time, a lot of those issues would go away. My estate would set my ex and my daughter up for life and my daughter would draw my benefits (held in trust by my ex) until she was out of college. My benefits are worth more than my ex makes working full time. My ex would never have to work again, and because Iâ€™m disabled from war time service, my daughter doesnâ€™t pay tuition at state schools. Iâ€™d be setting them both for life. 

Im just killing time until I die. Why be a burden to everyone while I wait?  Iâ€™m just drawing out everyoneâ€™s misery, including my own. A moments courage is all I need, and then itâ€™s done. Iâ€™m a burden to those around me and I can do more for my daughterâ€™s future dead than alive.
