We all gonna die one day anyway so why wait ? I can end the suffering right now ?Why should I want to live ? If I suffer so much , why can't I end the suffering by just simply ending my life ? What is so wrong about suicide ?

Look I have a shitty life. My life is shit . I'm alone. I need to work so hard to get a good life in future. But I'm too tired to go all through this bs. I don't want to live anymore.

I cope with bing eating because it gives me a type of dopamine boost on a short term and also helps me to have a long sleep.

I don't want to suffer anymore . I don't want to study and work everyday for hours so I can have a good future. It's too tiring.
