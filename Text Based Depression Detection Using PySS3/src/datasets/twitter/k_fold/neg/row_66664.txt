Stop Shaming UsIâ€™m tired of people always shaming those of us who didnâ€™t have good parents by always saying shit like â€œWell I guess your parents didnâ€™t discipline you enough, and thatâ€™s why youâ€™re ungrateful and disrespectful.â€ Hey, fuckface, just because you had parents who actually gave a shit about you doesnâ€™t mean you have to belittle everyone who had shitty parents who couldnâ€™t have cared less. 

Yeah, for the first decade of my life, my parents would sit me down and explain to me the difference between right and wrong, and I was a good kid. But then there was some infidelity, we lost the house, and they got divorced. Thatâ€™s when they acted like I was supposed to feel sorry for them. Yeah, the 11 year old feel sorry for the 38 year old. Iâ€™m almost 26 now and the neglect Iâ€™ve received from them for the last 15 years has made me feel suicidal many times. 

Yeah, Iâ€™m an ass and Iâ€™ll always talk back to authority and anyone who speaks to me in a rude, authoritative, or belittling tone. Itâ€™s because I hate being neglected and shamed, and itâ€™s always made me feel like a piece of shit who deserves to die. But goddamn it, the next time I hear that itâ€™s because of my parents, Iâ€™m going to write down their phone numbers and give them to the person who says it to me! Then youâ€™ll see what the fuck we go through that makes us the way we are!
