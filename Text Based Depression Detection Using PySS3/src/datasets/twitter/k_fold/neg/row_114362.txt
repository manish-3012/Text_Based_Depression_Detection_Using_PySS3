I just canâ€™t do it anymoreI honestly never thought I would be posting here.  My birthday is Sunday and the past 10 years or so, my birthday has always been terrible. A few suicide attempts around this time and all (years ago in my teens). But this time of year, it just has me reflect on the fact that my life really hasnâ€™t improved despite truly giving life my all. Iâ€™m in my final year of college and am undergoing counseling and medication treatment, as well as trying countless other alternative treatments, including regular talk therapy, DBT, TMS, and esketamine. 

I feel like iâ€™m at the end of the line here. I know it would hurt my family, but Iâ€™m also feeling like they would understand, and in the long run, save them money and protect their emotional lives moving forward.  Theyâ€™ve seen me struggle for most of my life with these horrible thoughts. I even think my psychiatrist and other doctors would understand that Iâ€™ve given every treatment a chance, yet nothing has worked. 

I know itâ€™s time. I really have tried. I know iâ€™ll be a coward in some peopleâ€™s eyes, but this truly is what is best for all involved. Thank you for reading this far.
