I wish that I was dead.I grit my teeth through everything I do. I hate my job, my abusive ex boyfriend won't stop harassing me and I just found out he stole a bunch of money from my bank account. I'm broke, I'm tired, and I don't deal with stress well. I'm tired of being the brunt of everyone's frustrations at my job and being treating like less than human. All I ever wanted out of my life was for someone to love me unconditionally, but I never got that. I will never get that. My friends are tired of hearing me whine every day about how miserable I am. I'm tired of hearing myself say it. My anti depressants stop me from attempting suicide again but I feel dead inside. I wish that I was dead.
