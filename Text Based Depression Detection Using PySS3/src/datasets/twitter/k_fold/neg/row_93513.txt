The biggest thing stopping me is that Iâ€™m scared of the act itself. I wish it was as easy as just pushing an â€œoffâ€ button.As much as I know it will hurt my friends and family when I do it, life will go on for them. And in the end, nothing matters. In a hundred years, no one will care. My memory will eventually be lost in the void. So, that kind of eases the guilt of hurting people who love me. 

But whenever I think of how Iâ€™ll actually do it, I get scared. Thereâ€™s no quick, easy, painless way. It will most likely be messy and painful, and then thereâ€™s the possibility of failing. I think itâ€™s because I have no idea what to expect. No one knows what happens after death. For me, I think itâ€™ll just be lights out. And honestly, Iâ€™d be fine with that. It sounds better than my life here. But Iâ€™m scared of what itâ€™ll feel like to die. I just want to stop existing. Since thatâ€™s not possible, the only thing left for me to do is desensitize myself to the point of not caring at all about the act itself.
