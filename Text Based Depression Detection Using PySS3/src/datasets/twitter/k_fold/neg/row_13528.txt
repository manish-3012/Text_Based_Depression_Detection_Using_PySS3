It's gotten worse.I posted here about a half a year ago while I was having a breakdown. Unfortunately things haven't gotten much better.

I have no motivation to do anything. Learn, work out, socialize... Here the last week its even interfered with my job, putting me on the brink of getting fired. A year ago I thought, wow, if I ever got fired from my job, I'd probably kill myself. 

I have no real talents. Nothing to be praised for. I'm 22 and I still don't know how to drive because I'm just not motivated enough. I've started going to a doctor for my issues, and I'm on antidepressants, but they seem to be doing more harm than good. 

I'd give anything to just have some kind of motivation. Anything. Hell, I can't even kill myself right, I just eat whatever the hell I want and hope that kills me off faster.

I'm sorry if this comes off as scattered, I've just recovered from a fever and I'm extremely sleep deprived. This has been on my mind the last few days as I've been sick in bed and I can't stand it anymore.
