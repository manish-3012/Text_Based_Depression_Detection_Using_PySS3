Not suicidal, but I've always been able to talk to you guys.Hi guys, it's me Jen. Some of you know me and some of you don't, I'm usually here to help but today I need to talk or vent a bit. Some troll made a stupid comment and it really got to me. It taken me years to be able to talk about my past comfortably, and to be ok with myself. I'm normally really good at just shrugging off trolls on reddit but this one hurt. I was having a nice normal conversation with someone about the justice system and how it deals with rape, when along came some troll with comments about how I'm a lying cunt who should be hit by a truck. Im holdin back tears right now, I don't want my fiancÃ© to see how badly it affected me. Is anyone there?
