Why should I not kill myself?Hello, I don't really know where to begin this, but I need some help. I can elaborate more if anyone happens to give a fuck. I'm a 23 year old guy and I have no hope for my future, and I see no point in living. I was just dumped by my first love, we were together for a year and a half. After we broke up, I ended up moving back to my hometown about an hour away. She told me she wanted to "work on herself" and then I ended up finding out she cheated on me with a guy I was worried about, and is now in a relationship with a different guy I was worried about who she always called a douche bag and shit like that. They became Facebook official today, her family and MY friends commenting on the post. Little do they know, a month ago she was telling me she wanted to be with me forever. She lied to me, strung me along, and broke my fucking heart, and now she is telling her family, her friends, and my friends lies about me  and our relationship, calling me crazy, a stalker, and I don't know what to feel. I know nobody knows the truth except for me and her(like i said there is a lot more i can elaborate on). It sucks to be the victim and the bad guy somehow. I have no friends, and nobody cares about how I feel. Prior to this I had a pretty fucked up life, got a DUI when I was 20, which completely halted all of the "dream" jobs I've had permanently. I'm lost as fuck. I know I'm smart, I'm a good looking guy, I'm funny, but I have nothing. I have no path, I'm not close to finishing my degree, and I just feel like nobody cares about me, which sucks because I don't even care about myself. I'm pretty drunk right now, and I have a loaded Beretta 92 on my nightstand. I've been thinking about suicide a lot recently, but tonight it just seems like I really want to do it. I feel a weird sinking in my chest when I think about it. Please help me.
