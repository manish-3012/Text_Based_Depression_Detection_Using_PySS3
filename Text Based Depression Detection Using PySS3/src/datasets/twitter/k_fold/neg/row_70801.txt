A month away.So i'm not really sure how to start this or what to really write but essentially it all boils down to the fact that I've decided that ending my life is the best option for me. I've also decided to wait until about the end of march so as to not inconvenience my older brother too much right around his birthday, it would be selfish of me to do so.

I've dealt with severe depression for the past eight years of my life and at this point I have tried most of the non-experimental treatments from varying medications to therapy, even to light electroshock therapy. Some of these treatments have managed to work in short terms but nothing has managed to help. I don't have an absolutely awful life, but at this point I don't see the point in struggling to keep living it. I go through the daily motions of school and do my best to keep a smile, albeit a fake one, on my face to try and keep the people around me happy and not worrying about me. I have little to no relationship with my family and any attempt to reach out to them for help has ended in either dismissal or anger on their parts. The few close friends that I have are people that I do care about and will regret leaving but they will certainly be better off without me as the guy who tends to bring the group down. I'm a good student and a hard worker but what's the point anymore, I'm just going to end up a debt slave in the end even if I can find a job that I end up loving. Today I ended a seven year relationship mostly due to having made up my mind about this and not wanting to put an even heavier burden on the woman that has managed to keep me going for so long. I'm done falling apart and have finally made up my mind on this and it's actually the most relief I've had in years, but at the same time I want to have some sort of hope....

Thank you for listening to my rant.
