helloso . Im posting here again. a 100th time in my life. But i dont have anyone to talk to, and its so easy on the internet.



i am an attention whore. Ok, i get it. I dont really want to die, i just want someone to care about me. Im sorry. I really want to overdose on something rn. But i cant. My parents hide any drugs from me. I just want to destroy myself. I dont really know what i want to achieve with this. Why i am so obsessed about suicide. I just cant stand it that there are people who are loved and no one cares about me. 



A short time ago i was feeling ok, i even bought some books, but now nothing happened and i feel bad. Thanks myself.
