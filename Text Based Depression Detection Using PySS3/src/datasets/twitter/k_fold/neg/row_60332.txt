my last day heretoday is my last day on earth, i lost the most amazing person to ever be in my life because i took her for granted and did not appreciate the immense amount of love she gave me. i can no longer stomach the guilt ans shame for giving up on my true love, she was crafted by god for me and i denied her. i was horrible for years and destroyed her mentally, for this i must cease to exist. i wish things were different but they arent. shes gone for good and for that i must be too, i cant even look in the mirror i am so disgusted with myself. if you have someone who loves you take my death as a lesson and treat them right no matter what. i never thought for a second what my life would be like without her and now i must pay the ultimate price. im sorry mom dad brothers sisters, most of all im sorry cassidy. i loved you so much i just never stopped to think it. good bye world.
