My decisionI made a decision awhile ago that when I feel like I have no more fight in me, i will kill myself. Thatâ€™s the way Iâ€™m dying. I made up my mind. I got into a fight with my mom earlier &amp; I almost told her but I canâ€™t do that bc I know sheâ€™ll just hurt &amp; want me to get help. My decision is final. Iâ€™m still trying to live a normal â€œhappyâ€ life but I know one day Iâ€™ll just give up &amp; itâ€™s comforting to know I have a way out.
