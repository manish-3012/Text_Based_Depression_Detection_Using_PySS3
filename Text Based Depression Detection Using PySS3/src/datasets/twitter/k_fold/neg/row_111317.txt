Contacting Crisis response is a waste of time.My best friend for over 25 years said she wanted to check out . My friend has been using opiates for the past 2 1/2 years.  Her life is so messed up from drug use and her metal issues. I tried to get her help through Crisis Response in Tri Cities Wa. I know that her using drugs is a major problem that needs to be addressed. This day the major issue is to keep her alive so the drug problem could be addressed. I can not believe what we were told. We were told that she could not be admitted to a unit for help, because she had used drugs that morning.  I got pretty upset. I told the guy that did the intake â€œ so itâ€™s ok for her to go home and commit suicide  because she is a drug addict. â€œ The Crisis Response worker told me there is nothing he could do. So if you use drugs and want to commit suicide there is no help for you in Tri Cities Wa. One more time nobody cares.
