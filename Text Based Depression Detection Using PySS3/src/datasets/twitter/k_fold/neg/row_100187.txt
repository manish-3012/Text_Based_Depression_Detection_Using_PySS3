My ex girlfriend (we broke up yesterday) wants to go street racing. How do I stop her?We live deep in the heart of hurricane sandy destruction, and her car has shitty brakes. I just know that if she does go out, she is going to die. I have this sick feeling that she is so upset because we broke up that she wants to do this, and because we broke up she won't listen to me when I tell her not to do it. What do I do to stop her?
