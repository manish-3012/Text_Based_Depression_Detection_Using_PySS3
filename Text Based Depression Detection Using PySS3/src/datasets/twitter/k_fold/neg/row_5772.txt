I am a slave to my own systemI am a slave to a system, I live everyday with depression and try to better myself and overcome it. It's an endless loop of trying failing, trying failing, trying failing. Then when I've had enough and I try to end suddenly we need to live a life where society turns a blind eye to mental health and offers no help outside of of them milking everything from us. It's sad really sad. I know some of you feel the same way. I don't know where I was going with this but something just struck a chord in me.
