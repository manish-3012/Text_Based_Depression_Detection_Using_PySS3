Life is exhausting. Please help.I don't even know if I want help, or just want to die. I keep thinking of driving off the bridge with full speed, at least I'd get damaged really bad. At least the pain will increase if not decrease, leading me to chaos. 

I don't know why I'm in this universe anyway. Like everybody else, I don't know what is the truth or why anybody or I should exist. I was given birth just like you, I guess but didn't see my birth for myself (maybe I wasn't born), people told me that I'm old enough to differentiate between the imaginary and the reality. I don't know the difference. 

Why everything is either too easy or too hard, I don't know if that's the truth or not. 

;( Please do something. Why is there this urge to connect with humans? Why do I need everyone of you to live? I'm tired.
