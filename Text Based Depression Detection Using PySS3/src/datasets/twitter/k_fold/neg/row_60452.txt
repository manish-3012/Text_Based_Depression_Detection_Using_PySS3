I want to rope myself so bad because I'm so ugly I cry whenever I look in the mirror. No one can love me. Not even my mom. She admits how ugly I am.I say looking in the mirror just crying about how ugly I am. I was bullied in high school (in college now) for my hideous features. I have no friends bc no one wants to be friends with an ugly girl like me. My mom picks everything out about me, like my hyper pigmentation and frizzy hair. I have spent hundreds of dollars on serums, prescriptions, hair masks, clothing. Whatever I do, its no use. People ignore me when I talk to them, even my own family. When ever people are taking group photos, and I want to join in, they say no. It kills me because people judge me based on my ugliness. THere's no use living in a world where no one wants me. I'm a kissless virgin at 20 and will stay that way forever. God just fucking kill me. I self harm and starve to cope from how I feel everyday. I suck at college so I can't even contribute to the world with intelligence. Guys ONLY care about looks so I will NEVER have someone who LOVES me. If my mom can't love me, then no one can. I should just end it. I already chose a building to jump from.
