My friend just died and I canâ€™t handle it, I want to kill myselfIâ€™m 21 years and Iâ€™ve attempted suicide twice. Once with a gun and the most recent time with pills. For a while I got back on my feet and my boyfriend convinced me to quit taking my pills (seroquel) and Iâ€™ve been about 3 months without them. Before my friend passed, I started getting feelings about not wanting to exist anymore, and my depression slowly started coming back. Now that my friend passed away, I really want to go through with it again. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do.
