If anyone wants to talk I am here, survivor of 2 attempted suicides.I know its hard to really say your reasons for wanting it all to end, and it would be selfish of me to say you should know better. But I am here for you guys, I've been to the abyss and back several times and 2 of those times ended in hospital trips with giant needles injected straight into my heart to revive me. If you need someone, I am always here to listen. Tell me all about your problems. I come to all of you as a veteran and hopefully to some a ray of light in very dark times.
