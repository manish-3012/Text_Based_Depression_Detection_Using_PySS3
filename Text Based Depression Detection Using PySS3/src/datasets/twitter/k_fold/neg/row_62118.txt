i dont understandhonestly i dont understand, how a few words from someone you dont know can affect you so much. i dont know if im just senstive or not. holy shit. i got told to commit suicide a few days ago from some dude on snapchat, it was my fault because i was spamming him after he had commented something rude on someone elses post. and now i still want to fucking die because of that. i apologized for spamming him and he accepted the apology but i cannot deal with the fact that he told me that nobody would care if i kill myself.
