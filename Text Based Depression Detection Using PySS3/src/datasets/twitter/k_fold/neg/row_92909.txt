Yeah, I'm doneI've picked a time to end it. A few months from now when my step dad comes home. I figure that way my mum won't be alone. She's the only thing stopping me. Part of me genuinely hopes things get better before then. Part of me gave up a long time ago. Until he comes home, I'll keep going, I owe it to myself to give it a chance to get better, but I doubt it will. Nothing ever changes. I never change. After that I'm done.
