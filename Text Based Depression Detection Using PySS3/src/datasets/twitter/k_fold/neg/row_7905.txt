I cant stand living knowing I look the way I doI donâ€™t know why God made me this way. I just wish I were someone else. Everyone in my life including my parents has called me ugly. Iâ€™ve never been liked and I hate looking in the mirror or seeing myself in a video. 

Now Iâ€™m not killing myself JUST because Im visually revolting, as I have a host of other heavy heavy problems: sexual/mental abuse, drugs, shit grades, no future, loneliness, severe paranoia etc etc. My entire life has been one fuck up to the next. It would honestly be better for most others if I were gone, itâ€™s not like I would amount to much. 

Iâ€™m definitely going to do it two weeks from now. I have two methods planned out: Overdose and hanging. Iâ€™ve decided against the rope, because the chances of brain damage are way too high and my life will get even worse, but Iâ€™m still not sure on what to overdose on. Doesnâ€™t matter, I have 2 weeks then Iâ€™m out.
