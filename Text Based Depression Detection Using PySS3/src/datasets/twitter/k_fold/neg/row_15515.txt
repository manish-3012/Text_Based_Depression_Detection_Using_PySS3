should I tell my school counselor that I want to kill myself?I'm honestly at my breaking point rn and I don't know if I can tell my school counselor without being taken out of my school. I'm at a special dual enrollment school and I'll be in my senior year so I've put far too much work to leave now. But, I'm afraid that if I go to my counselor that I may be removed "for my own good".
