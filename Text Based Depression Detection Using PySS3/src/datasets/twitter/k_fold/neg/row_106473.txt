everything in my life, is the way i've felt forever, but emotional involvement in an abusive person has fucked me over more, and i cant look at myself in the mirror without being disgusted.i want to keep this part short because typing it all out is going to hurt, i was with woman, woman abused me, a few months ago, she ignored me after saying really upsetting things, I cut half of my arm off , didn't mean for it to be so deep, but it was, 28 stitches later, muscular and nerve scarring, permanant loss of strength in my arm, and she knew that she contributed to my feelings that night. now currently, her family fucked me over, i have not done a single fun thing in over a year, and they said i'd be coming with them to the pne at playland or cultus lake waterslides, then when i leave to go to my house instead of theirs because my (now ex's, probably, who knows, she may get me back in when i hear from her) girlfriends aunt was coming to visit and apparently is so fucking weird that she didn't feel comfortable sleeping in the same house as a stranger like me (who has been dating her damn neice for over a year). so i leave and then find out they lied and i have to pay out of my broke ass, they know i didn't have enough money. now, this girl, has made me give up on myself, i still have an impacted wisdom tooth because i was too unmotivated to go to the appointment, and i regret it, living with her i brushed my teeth 3 times in like a month or two, my face looks ugly, im scared i have bone loss in my jaw, my smile looks different, and im obsessing over all of it. and i want it to end
