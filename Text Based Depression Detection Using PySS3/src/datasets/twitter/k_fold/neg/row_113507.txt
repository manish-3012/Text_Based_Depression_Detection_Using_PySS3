I can't do this anymoreI have can't do this any more. The world would be so much better without me.

I have been having some homicidal ideation for a few years now, and the urges to take a life are so much stronger than ever before. I think that I will do something that I will regret, that there is nothing stopping me and everything I know will fall apart. I will take the life of someone else and then take my own life so I do not have to deal with the consequences, or I will take the life of myself and myself only.

Should I kill myself or aimlessly idealize homicide?
