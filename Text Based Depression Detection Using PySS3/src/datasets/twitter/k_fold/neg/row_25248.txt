No good way out 

My life has an implicit negative value in the sense that like my life doesnâ€™t really make anyoneâ€™s life better.  
If I didnâ€™t exist I think the world would be better off, but, if I were to kill myself, the pain that it would inflict would probably make the total happiness of the world go down as well.

So thereâ€™s no winning here
