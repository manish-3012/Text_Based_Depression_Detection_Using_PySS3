TiredIâ€™m so sad. Every part of my body just aches with sadness. I donâ€™t want to be here. I donâ€™t want to be anything. I just spent 25 days in an inpatient hospital but the minute I got home any sort of happiness Iâ€™ve felt there was gone.
Iâ€™m just so alone. I feel just so worthless. I wish I was just numb.
I just sit here and think over and over again about hurting myself. And how good it would feel to be free and happy. I just want to be happy. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
