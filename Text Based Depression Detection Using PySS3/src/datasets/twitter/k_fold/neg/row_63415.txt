Please tell me that there's more to all this...The only reason why I'm still here is because I'm fucking terrified of the notion that "this is all there is." That there is no afterlife or anything life, that when I die, I'll just rot in the fucking ground, in same broken body I was born in.

Please tell that I'm not wasting the only life I have? That there's more to all this..?
