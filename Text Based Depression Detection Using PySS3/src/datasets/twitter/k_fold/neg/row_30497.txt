I don't want to be alive anymore.  At all.  I'm 20 and I've ruined my futureI have a doctor and I can't talk to him

I can't talk to anyone


As soon as I start talking to myself I start crying


I've ruined my future and relationship with my family.  I want to talk but once my secrets are out I would rather die than face them.  

And I'm that is what I'm going to do
