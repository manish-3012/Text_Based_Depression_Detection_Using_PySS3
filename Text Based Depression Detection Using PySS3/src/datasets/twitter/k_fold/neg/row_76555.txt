Nights like theseI miss him, and I miss feeling some level of happiness. I've been heavily suicidal for a month now. I got told a week ago on my birthday that I wasn't loved anymore. I neglected my homework so I'm fucked tomorrow. I've been dealing with extreme amounts of anxiety and depression. I'm so exhausted and I feel done. I want to give up. Tonight I really want to kill myself. I won't - I'll eventually fall asleep just to wake up anxious and depressed again. To deal with this torment another day. I dreamt about suicide for the first time last night. I hope I dream about it again tonight. Goodnight, and thank you for reading this. I'm sorry for being such a depressing and unloveable being. I try my best but it's never enough. Not even to strangers. I'm sorry.
