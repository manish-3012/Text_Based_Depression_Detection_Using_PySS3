I have a good life, but I want to die (17, M)I'm a relatively average 17 year old student in the suburbs of a larger city. I get decent grades, good standardized tests scores, win academic awards, the whole deal. I'm liked by most people, and generally considered funny and fun to be around. 

My parents used to be pretty typical asian parents, treating me horribly like some sort of machine just for college, but I told them how they ruined my life finally over the summer, and since then, they've sort of been off my case, and I think a few weeks ago, our relationship resumed a sort of normalcy, minus the unhealthy parts on their end. 

I've got friends, I've got family, and I've got a relatively decent home life, but I hate my life. Some days I'm fine, and I can watch youtube and enjoy myself, but days like today, I feel so worthless, and can't enjoy anything, and legitimately want to get some rope from the shed and hang myself. 

Like I know teens do that, but those are people who were bullied like crazy, or something like that, not people with a nicer life like mine. That's what makes everything worse. I basically have everything, and there are all these other people out there with real problems, like whether they'll have enough to eat, and the worst problem I'll have to face in the next few months is something like whether I got accepted into a prestigious college or not. Makes me feel like even thinking 'I hate my life', is just being a pussy about it, because like I said, compared to the next guy, my problem is nothing. 

And on top of that, it feels like my life is slowly spiralling more and more out of control. All this college crap is so stressful, because it's like this defines your entire life: this is the 1st choice you make as an adult. I would give anything to be a 6 year old with a GBA again.

I know everything I feel or say on something like this all comes from a position of privilege, but why is everything so difficult? Why does leading a normal life have to be so hard in a place that is supposedly the pinnacle of human civilization? Why do I have to define myself now, when 5 years ago my biggest worry was a video game?

And then there's also some deep existentialism and other bull shit, but honestly, why do I have to have all this crap in my head? Why can't I be normal and not have to deal with all this knowledge of my own worthlessness; at least then I might be able to be happy.

And that's why I want to end it. I might have friends, but I wouldn't say I have a best friend or anyone rather close. I'm still a kissless virgin, despite being 17. And my family might be nicer to me, but I still wouldn't describe this as the healthiest family, and likely not one that would care too much if I died one day (my sister is the one they have all their hopes and dreams riding on anyways). 

But then rational me comes in and tells me because of the meaninglessness of existence, it's better to just jerk off for 60 years and die from cancer at 85 or whatever. But, I just don't want to have to float through all that, because while there might be some good, there's also just so much bad I just don't want to have to deal with. 

What can a guy do? Does anyone know? Is it possible to know? Or is life so meaningless that even if I kill myself in 1 hour, nobody anywhere will care, and 2 days from now this post will still be getting replies like "It get's better!"? I don't know anymore.
