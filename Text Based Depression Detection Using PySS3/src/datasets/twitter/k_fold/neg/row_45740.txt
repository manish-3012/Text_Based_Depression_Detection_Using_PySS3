Everything is shitI last tried to kill myself in October and I feel like Iâ€™m about to try again. Nobody knows how to be there for me. Itâ€™s not even that they donâ€™t want to be there. They just canâ€™t. It fucking sucks. Thereâ€™s probably no psych hospital bed available for me. Iâ€™m never getting better. I should just be done.
