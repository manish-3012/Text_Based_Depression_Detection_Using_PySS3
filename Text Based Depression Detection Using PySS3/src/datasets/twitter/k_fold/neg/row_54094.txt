Please help me.To start with,I took admission in a reputed college for JEE engineering entrance examination preparations.My parents didn't have too much money and they took a loan just to pay for my fees which was way too high for us. I studied sincerely for 2 months but after that I committed a huge mistake of being with bad people and I lost interest in studies and I also have a GF and I talked to her daily for atleast 3 to 4 hours and wasted all of my time and didn't study well.Now after 2 years I am writing this post just to vent out my depression. I feel very sorry for my parents as I didn't get selected in any college for higher studies

There are still 2 months for my final exam which is MHCET and I still have some hopes left with it. But at the same time my depression is not letting me study at all and I am worried about it. Anyone who would just help me give enough of some motivation to start my studies will be of great help. To be honest I feel useless and I never want my parents to do anything good for me because I wasted their money.

I know there are still chances at life and if I start studying I will surely get selected but my depression and sadness isn't letting me study at all. 

I deserve nothing after what I have done with my life but my parents love me a lot and will do anything to see me happy.

Please help me as I have been having suicidal thoughts lately. Thank you.
