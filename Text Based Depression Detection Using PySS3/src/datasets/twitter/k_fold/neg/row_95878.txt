Merry fucking Christmas
Tonight, Christmas eve, as my present to the world.

A dead daughter, sister, friend.

A dead ex girlfriend. My first love, and my last. If you see this, know I love you, and I always will. I broke a lot of promises, I'm sorry I have to break this one too. 


When the morning sun rises, the deceiver wakes her head.

When the morning sun rises, the day repeats like breath.

When the evening moon rises, the fool will bow dead.

When the evening moon rises, there is only end in death.
