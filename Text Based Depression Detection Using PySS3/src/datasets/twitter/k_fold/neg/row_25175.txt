It's my 21st next week and all i want to do is dieI'm tired. I don't know why I'm all of a sudden feeling so depressed and suicidal again.. Things were going so great. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working with the county, social workers, etc., to get me back into work, school, housing.. everything that I need right now... I have a wife that says he loves me, but things are starting to feel dull and I even got tempted to start sexting again, just to feel appreciated. Just to get attention from someone that "loves" me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Three times I've cried in bed next to my wife and he just ignored and played video games because I brought it upon myself. I'm tired of being belittled. I'm tired of struggling to have to fight the urge to go through the process of growing up and just be an adult already. I was never given the chance to be a child, to be a teenager, to be a young adult... I'm just expected to be mature already. I've been told by adults that I'm "very mature" for my age, but by my very two close friends that I relax around I'm "childish" and "immature." What the fuck am I.

It doesn't help that I feel like I have to now put on a mask around my wife. The one person that I thought I could be myself around.. guess not. Guess I have to put on my outside face around him. I guess I have to be the cold hearted, tough, "mature" individual around him now... or maybe not. Maybe I can stop fighting finally. Maybe I can relax... I made it. I made it past the age 15 like how I didn't think I would. I made it past 18.. but maybe not 21. Maybe not that age.
