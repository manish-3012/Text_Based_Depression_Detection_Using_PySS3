Why am I even here?Posting on my main cause I don't care anymore. Screw everyone and everything. So much time taking meds, doing therapy, thinking things are finally getting a bit better, then something small hits you in the face and you're back at the bottom of the pit. Even in your highest moments you're still staying at the edge of the pit and anything can push you down.


 I finally cried so much I can't feel my face anymore. I know, this might pass by tomorrow, then it's just a matter of time until I'm back here. It's like a big circling highway full of stones and holes and whatever other unpleasant things you may find when driving. I wouldn't know, I don't even know how to drive. 


I know this is how it'll end, unless some accident happens before I get the balls to do it. I knew it for a long time now. How'd I start thinking about it since I was a kid? Kids shouldn't be thinking about this. They should be happy in their blissful ignorance.


Whatever, I'm rambling too much. I needed to let this out. I'm not going to kill myself today. The need to self harm is getting quite strong, I guess whatever happens happens. It's not like anyone is going to see it since the world is in isolation.


Thanks if you took the time to read this garbage of a post. I don't know where else I could have let this out.
