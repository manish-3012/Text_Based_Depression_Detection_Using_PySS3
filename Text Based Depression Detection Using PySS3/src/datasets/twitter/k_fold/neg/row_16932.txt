Why?Iâ€™ve struggled with the thought of suicide my entire life, well as long as I can remember. My life just feels like a waste of time not worth the worry or bother. I have had an amazing career as a cinematographer, an amazingly beautiful wife and animals. But now I work selling snake oil for a major MLm wasting all momentum I built up. My beautiful wife isnâ€™t attracted to me sexually and we go a minimum of months with out intimacy. Iâ€™ve lived life with out religious beliefs and the only thing that really has meaning to me is this phrase, â€œ life really doesnâ€™t mean anything, but the meaning we create for it.â€ So now, I donâ€™t know what my meaning is? I feel as if my life is slowly becoming American Beauty, where the highlight of my day is jacking off in the shower. Sorry a little all over the place here. Feeling pretty lost.
