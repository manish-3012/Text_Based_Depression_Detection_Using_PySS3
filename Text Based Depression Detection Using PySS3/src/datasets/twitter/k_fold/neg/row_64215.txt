Just read this pleaseI don't know what to title this. Honestly. After everything in this life, my beloved boyfriend dumping me and seemingly not feeling a thing (after almost a year..) has just broken me. But every time something bad happens, I feel this way. Every time I feel like its rock bottom and I'm finally going to do it, but I always manage to have something else happen and sink even lower.

That said, I feel as though this time...well it's the closest I've ever been to suicide. And I keep seeing signs telling me its the right thing. Its hard obviously, but idk. I even went into the ER this Monday, and I told them if they didn't admit me I'd kill myself, but they just locked me in a room for 5 hours then let me go. Haha, it's a sign.

I can't even cut anymore. That feels like its the end. I can;t even bring myself to cut because I don't have the energy. Anyone experie ce this?
