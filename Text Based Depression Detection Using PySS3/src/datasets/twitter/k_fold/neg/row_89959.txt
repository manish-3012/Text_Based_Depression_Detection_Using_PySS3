Is it selfish to reach out to old friends if Iâ€™m 99% sure Iâ€™m going to commit suicide soon?Thereâ€™s a handful of people that I wish I could reconnect with but Iâ€™m not sure if I should. My main concern is that I donâ€™t want to remind them of my existence only to burden them with my inevitable suicide. Obviously all these former friends have forgotten about me so maybe itâ€™s best that it stay that way.

I have no illusions about any one of these individuals â€œsaving meâ€ in any way so being open about my intentions is not an option. I donâ€™t know what to do...
