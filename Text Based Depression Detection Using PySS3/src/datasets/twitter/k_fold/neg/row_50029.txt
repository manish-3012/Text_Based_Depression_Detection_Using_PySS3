my mom just hit me, she has ocd but doesn't know it, my whole family is abusive, idk what to doMy mom just freaked out about me wanting to pour old sriracha sauce into the new bottle we bought and she says that the old sauce is dirty and has germs because it's been sitting for so long and I argued with her that there's no germs and even if there are it won't affect you, but her issue is that she wants everything to be "clean" and orderly and I asked r/OCD if she had OCD and they said definitely on both my posts between a post I posted years ago to one I posted this week. (On another account). And my dad is just abusive all around (except physical for me) and a narcissist and I just don't know how I'm gonna get out of here in college when I can't afford to dorm. Anyway my mom just totally slap and hit me after I said my last word of the argument and now I'm crying and I really don't know what to do I just want someone I can relate to. I kind of want to die but I just really want to be able to go to the psych hospital and get some professional help, so attempting to kill myself is the only way I can think of to do that.

And my mom is so confident in her beliefs about cleanliness that she just told me to ask Reddit if leaving out food uncovered in the fridge is dirty but the thing is, this is sriracha sauce which has a cap which has never touched any thing so sheâ€™s just being paranoid about microscopic imperfections.


I feel so lonely and unwanted, I just don't know what to do.   


My parents are so irrational I don't think there's any hope of understanding at this point.
