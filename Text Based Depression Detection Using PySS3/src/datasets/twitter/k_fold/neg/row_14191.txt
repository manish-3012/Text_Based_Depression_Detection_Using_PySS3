Help: my best friend is in the hospital.I just hope someone reading this is familiar with inpatient mental health services. My best friend has been in the hospital for a little over a week now, and she just gave me a call this morning. Unfortunately I was sleeping and didn't see her phone call until later. I called the hospital back and gave them her first and last name, but was told they didn't have a patient by that name. I'm sure the number I called was correct and that the hospital was correct one (it's located in the small town we live in). 

Is there anything I can do to reach her again? Should I call back and ask if they can connect me with someone who called me 2 hours ago? I really would appreciate any and all input. I have been worried about my friend for days and I just want to talk to her.
