I wasn't ready to leave.I was just discharged from a two month stay in a psychiatric hospital only three hours ago. The first thing I do when I get home? Begin hysterically crying and cut myself. What the fuck is wrong with me?

I haven't stopped crying since and I'm already thinking up ways I can kill myself.
