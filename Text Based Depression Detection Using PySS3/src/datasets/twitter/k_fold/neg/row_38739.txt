Even though I am happier.I wish I was dead. I know my life will continue to disappoint me. I am going to have to settle learn to think positive and be okay with life. However I know that life is bullshit. No matter what happens it's just pointless. Everyone is just a pathetic sack wondering if they are special wondering if our suffering makes us unique or stronger.  I just-- when does this end? I have been on tons of anti depressants for a year been to the psych ward got a new job took vitamins did meditation and what happens??? I still want to die.
