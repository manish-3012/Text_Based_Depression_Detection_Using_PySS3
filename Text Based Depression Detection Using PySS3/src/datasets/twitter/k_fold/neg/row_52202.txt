I'm dying anyway27, diagnosed with stage 3 NSCLC. 

Sexually assaulted 3 days ago. 

I'm coping badly. I want to die. I want to speed up the process and just do it already. I need to write my letters and tell the ones I love goodbye. The only things stopping me is I don't know what to tell them, that it's not their fault, there was nothing they could have done, i loved them... All of that seems hollow when you're about to kill yourself.
