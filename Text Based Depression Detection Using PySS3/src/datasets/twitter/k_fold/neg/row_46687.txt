I have a problem and its killing me on the insideIn going to start this off with saying I'm 90% sure i would never kill myself... I just need to speak and this seemed like the place. There hasnt been a day in the last 6 years that I haven't thought about killing myself. I go through my days in a haze and everything feels so bland the littlest things can send me into an angry rage or into  a deep tear filled sadness. I get these... what I can only call depression anxiety attacks where I instantly get into this deep deep sadness each time seems like it tops the last and I start to freak out about everything and these "attacks" can last from minutes to weeks. Im getting hit with a real hard one right now and I just needed to speak to someone... even if it is a faceless subreddit and would like to thank you guys. I feel like I'm ruining every relationship and friendship I have left and I don't know what I'm doing if I'm being perfectly honest.
