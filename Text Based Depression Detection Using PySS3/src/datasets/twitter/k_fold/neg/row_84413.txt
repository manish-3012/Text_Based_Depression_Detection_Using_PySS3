Life?Well I'm going to take my life. It will relieve everyone of the burden I am. It will take an aspect of worry away from them. They will soon get over it. I think 1050mg of amitriptaline will do it xD. This going to be fun. It is selfish of me to do but it is selfish of other people trying to keep me alive if I'm not happy.
