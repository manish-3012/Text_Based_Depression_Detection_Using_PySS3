I don't like being alive.The title pretty much says it all. I genuinely get no satisfaction from being alive. Everywhere I go, Everything I do, I just feel out of place everywhere. I have never felt happiness my entire life, and I'm tired of people just telling me that all I have to do is change my point of view and whatnot. It's not that simple. Something inside of me is just fundamentally broken from birth I guess. I'm giving up on everything and I can't take living for other peoples sake anymore. I plan to kill myself this weekend at the moment.
