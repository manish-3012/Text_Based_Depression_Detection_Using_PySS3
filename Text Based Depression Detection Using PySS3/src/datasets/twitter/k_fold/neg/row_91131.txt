i can't fucking take it anymore. everything is too much, i have nobody to talk to or nobody that understands and no way to kill myselfi don't know how to even write it all down; everything is too fucking much. i don't think i even want to talk about it because there's hardly a good way to describe it. i can't fucking do this anymore. so many fucking people have hurt me, i am a shitty person, i can't escape where i am, i can't get fucking therapy. i just want to blow my fucking brains out now. i can hardly connect to anyone, i feel so fucking tired every single day, my father is a piece of shit, my family knows nothing about me, i'm only fucking 18 and i'm stuck in my house. i'm trapped. i want to fucking die. i got out of an abusive relationship with a narcissistic piece of shit months ago, and they still hurt me now. i deal with fucking ocd and trauma and other bullshit with no help. i feel like an alien, i hate myself so much. the person i was with, the narcissistic scum piece of shit, made me fucking believe that they would be with me forever, that they would take care of me and i them, they wouldn't hurt me, they fucking lied. that probably is the least of my fucking concerns. i am a horrible person. i did so many awful things in the past, i want to kill myself. i don't want to talk about them. i think i must be evil. i feel afraid i'm sharing far too much information, and that i am a fucking psychopath. i want to just be killed. anytime i try to find friends somehow (usually though using subreddits for that purpose) i feel like the people there just want to fucking take advantage of me and are fucking creeps. i can't trust anyone, i don't have anyone really, i have no family. all i have is a few close friends who struggle with their own shit, but at times, i feel that even they don't understand. i want to be independent, but at times i just wish there was someone to fill in the void. sometimes i feel hally, but i'm always like a fucking rollercoaster. i'm never going to be able to escape this hellhole house and be myself. i fucking hate the US, i fucking hate this earth. i just wish i lived somewhere far far far away. i can't even fucking sleep, last night i tried sleeping early but woke up around 10 pm, it's 6 am now. i just wish i could fucking die. please help me
