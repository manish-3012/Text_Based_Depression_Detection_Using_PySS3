My FiancÃ© moved out and blocked my number while I was in the emergency roomI went through a traumatic event a few weeks ago that left me with suicidal ideation. Knowing that this is problem that could negatively impact my relationship with my fiancÃ©, I immediately enrolled myself in both group and one-on-one therapy. Iâ€™ve been attending these sessions everyday and making an effort to apply the lessons to stressful areas of my life. Yesterday, I woke up with strong feelings of wanting to commit suicide. I mentioned this to my fiancÃ© and he called his parents and forced me to tell them. I already felt so ashamed of my situation and was hoping I could handle this sickness between just us two and professionals. They told me if I donâ€™t check myself into the hospital, they will call the police. My fiancÃ© blocked my path and took my phone away. I felt so scared and trapped so I went to grab his gun. At that point, I knew Iâ€™ve gone overboard so I dropped the gun, packed up my stuff, and told him to quickly drive me to the hospital. He dropped me off and I stayed there for about 24 hours. I called him throughout the night for him to come visit but he refused and said itâ€™s over between us. When I got out and was finally able to use my phone, I realized he has blocked my number, took me off his social media, and cancelled all arrangements with wedding vendors. I went home and saw that he has left with all his belongings. My actions have destroyed my relationship even though it was the one thing I was fighting hard for.
