why am i still sad?My life is going in the direction I wanted it to- I mustered the energy and strength to take action and yet
I don't feel.. good?
I still struggle with psychosis and severe dissociation 24/7, I still have intense urges to self harm, I still have panic attacks over the smallest things and find myself numb to what should be important

I'm bipolar, suicidal, and probably have an eating disorder(but it's not taken particularly seriously as I'm far from thin)

I don't know where I intended to go with this, I just 


Need a sympathetic shoulder to cry on I guess?

Thanks y'all
