I have nothing to live for.My life is so bleak.

I donâ€™t have any genuine friends, I feel like a stranger in my own family and Iâ€™ve scared off the only person I truly cared about. I have no future or goals to look forward to. My life is falling apart and Iâ€™m just letting it happen because Iâ€™m so, so exhausted.

I just donâ€™t know if I want to be alive anymore.
