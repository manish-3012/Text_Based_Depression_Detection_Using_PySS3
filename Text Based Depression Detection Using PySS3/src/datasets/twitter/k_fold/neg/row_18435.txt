Late night thoughtsIâ€™m not alive because I want to be. Iâ€™m alive because I have to be. Because my life is set up  in such a way I have no choice but to continue living. This is an irrefutable blessing. Depression tells me itâ€™s a curse. Depression doesnâ€™t want me to live. Depression wants to consume my body along with my mind.
