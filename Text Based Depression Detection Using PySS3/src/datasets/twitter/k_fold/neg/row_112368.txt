Where do I go?I could use some advice, and reddit has always been good to me.

I've struggled with depression since my early teens. I've managed to keep it almost in check, but the only thing that's kept me going is my wife.

This burden eventually became to much for her, and she left me about 2 months ago. That was a major trigger for me - I lost my job, my three year old daughter was hospitalized after slipping on some ice, and my wife left the day after valentine's day... It was too much for me to handle.

Since that day I've been completely paralyzed - I don't even want to get out of my bed. I've had a couple of job interviews, but I have no confidence in myself, and the potential employers have clearly sensed this and I have not had any offers.

At this point the only person left in my life who's opinion matters to me is my wife (not divorced, just separated - though I doubt that will last for long.

At this point, I'm ready to give up. My wife has no feelings left for me other than resentment, my daughter can sense my issues and doesn't want to be with me, and I have no friends left.

I'm ready to do the unthinkable, but I would rather find help. I'm scared of myself. Do I go to the hospital? What's the best option?
