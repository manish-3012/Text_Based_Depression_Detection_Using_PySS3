I need closure...I want to preface that I'm in no way promoting what my brother did. I'm merely here because it's hard for me to move on. I found out today my brother commited suicide. 

Some background in case it helps: 
We all had depression issues due to a tragic family death, so surely this has had a toll on him.

I wasn't extremely close with him, but I tried reaching out to him many times. He never replied to my messages for years. He didn't have many friends or family, and he pretty much had a deep hatred towards everyone and everything.

He decided that life wasn't worth living, and him killing himself isn't what is bothering me the most; it's how he did it. He hung from the side of a multiole floor building. Bystanders called police and a fireman went up with a ladder only for him to let go. Why would he wait? Why would he hang for so long only to prolongue? I know for a fact it wasn't because of regret. This has been eating me inside and I can't get any idea why.

Please if anyone has any ideas, good or bad that would make any sense...
