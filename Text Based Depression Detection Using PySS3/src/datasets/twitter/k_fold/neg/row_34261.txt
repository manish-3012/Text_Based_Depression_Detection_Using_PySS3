I'd rather die than work at Walmart.I live with my parents. 

They think I'm not looking hard enough for a job, I do put applications in, but because I'm not digging ditches or flipping burgers I'm lazy. 

I'm 24. I got kicked out by them originally at 19. I had to come back a few months ago due to covid unemployment. I had been living alone and was working a well paying office job.  

Now I put in applications to target and grocery shops and hear nothing. I don't even want these jobs. There aren't ANY jobs hiring for my skills (similar to my previous role). 

This is going to sound awful but I'd rather die than work at Walmart. I worked there briefly unloading trucks when working my way up to my office job, it was hell. It was depressing. It was hard. It was shit pay. 

I hate being alive in this capitalist hell hole. I hate the fact that rent is literally pushed up to be barely affordable for anyone in any given area. I fucking hate that I'll probably never be a property owner. I fucking hate that the only people who are supposed to care (my parents) think I'm a lazy piece of shit. I hate how they bought a house making min wage in the 80s (on their own, separately), and because I can't do that it's somehow my fucking problem. 

My parents are getting sick of me by the day. They are well off, but they are charging me rent next month. I know I'm not wanted here, I know I've overstayed my welcome.


I don't want to live anymore. I just wish I had the courage to do it.
