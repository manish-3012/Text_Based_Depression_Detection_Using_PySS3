Need someone to talk toI've been avoiding attempting it because every time I've tried in the past I always survive and end up with more problems than I had before. No one in my life knows I'm this suicidal or that I'm going through anything at all. I don't trust anyone that knows me to open up to because every time I've tried to in the past it didnt go well. I really feel like my head is going to explode. I've been suicidal since I was a kid but it keeps progressively getting worse. Lately it's all I can think about like my mind is a broken record that's just repeating the same suicidal thoughts over and over again
