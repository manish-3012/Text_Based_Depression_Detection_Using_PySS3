Without thinking, I drove an hour to a fucking bridgeI want this to be over so badly. Iâ€™m sitting here in shock. I got myself out of the house around 1 am and drove straight to the closest bridge high enough to die from. Iâ€™m sitting in my car, itâ€™s shaking from trucks passing me. Iâ€™m too terrified to get out but Iâ€™m even more terrified of what Iâ€™m going to do when I work up the nerve to get out.
