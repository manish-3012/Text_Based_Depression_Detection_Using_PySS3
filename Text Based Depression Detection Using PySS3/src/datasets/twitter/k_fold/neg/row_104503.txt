I'm panicking bad, please help, about to lose my medsMy campus has lost a lot of staff recently in the psychological services department, I have gone from being able to get a weekly therapy meeting to being able to get one every two months, IF I attend group "coping classes" which I refuse (I have gone, they are one size fits all garbage and are run by a very condescending instructor whom I am not comfortable around. And there is a group of girls who attend for what appears to be the sole purpose of finding good rumors to start).

The issue isn't necessarily this, I can get through shit myself if I need to, but they're about to cut off my meds because I'm not actively enrolled in counselling, you can ask anyone around me, I get BAD when I go off my meds, the last time I had to I spent an entire Saturday on my couch laugh-crying.

Idk what to do... I don't wanna feel that bad again
