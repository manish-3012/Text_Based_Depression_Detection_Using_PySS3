i think i'm going to end iti've been depressed for about two years now, last october a friend of mine overdosed and lost his life.
just a few weeks before that i got a girlfriend who made me feel happy for the first time in ages. she helped me through losing my friend. i was getting better and feeling happy on the daily. today we broke up and i don't have anyone on my side right now.
it's all hitting me so hard right now i can't fucking handle this.
