Well I'm doneI highly doubt I'll see tomorrow but if I do then I'll punch it in the fucking face and tell it to go away since it'll be another day of my dad telling me to do something to get my stuff back, me having about 8 anxiety attacks and somehow doing it, then him not giving it to me and yelling at me for being lazy and not doing work and faking depression (even though I've been clinically diagnosed with depression and anxiety). It doesn't sound that bad but the way he goes about it is outright abusive (not physically thankfully) but emotionally and I can't take it anymore. I almost killed myself last night but didn't, so I'm doing it tonight. So, goodbye everyone. Good luck in this cruel-ass world!
