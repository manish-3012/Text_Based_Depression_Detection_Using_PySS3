giving up, on giving upIt took me a long time to build up the necessary - fortitude, let's call it - for the act. Months on months, slowly cutting away at support networks through neglect, and apathy. 

Some years ago, I tried, the first time. A knife, I thought. An alley, in the dark, in a busier city. A place I knew, from wandering alone and hungry and exhausted. Didn't want to be identified, didn't want to be identifiable, so I kept a little cash in my pocket and mailed my wallet home. 

It was supposed to be clean. I didn't want pain, and I had a horror of discovery. A knife, sharp, part of a multitool. I would aim for the carotids; properly done, it would be over in two minutes. 

Didn't work. I only thought I had the fortitude. 

The second time was a bridge. Four hundred foot drop. Walked past, autumn midday, and I couldn't do it. 

The third time was - something different. A fall, from somewhere else way up high. I won't go too deep into the details, except to say that it didn't work. Cuffs and well meaning policemen. 72 hour hold. Then a brief stint in a ward. Learning to love therapy, and the wellness of modern medicine. 

A year later, I found myself back on that bridge, looking down a 400 foot drop. Again, it didn't take. 

It's funny, in a way. I've given up on the idea of having a way out of this. Resigned myself to merely existing, because however many times I've tried, it turned out I didn't have the fucking constitution for it. Or the nerves. 

I have good days, and bad days. Warm days full of light and fucking terrible days, full of loathing and seething, splintering hate. But most days, most days I think of folks who can make it through and get it done, with a degree of envy. 

Here's to you all, beautiful, broken souls. Maybe you've found something worthwhile on the other side.
