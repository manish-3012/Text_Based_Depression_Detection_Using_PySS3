â€œHappy new yearâ€ message never appeared to be happy to me.â€œHappy new yearâ€, you have successfully survived another year in this harsh environment. I know, survival is hard, no matter where you go, and that approves how amazing you are, as you are successfully managing how to do this difficult thing. Well... not in my case. For me, â€œHappy new yearâ€ message only sound like I need to suffer for another year, as there is no happiness existing in my life. A lot of bad things happened as a year starts, just same as usual, and I have made some suicide plans that will never work - I am saying like this from my 11 different suicide attempt experiences - but giving me false hope. 

I hate every new year. I am waiting for the end of this story, not another time fo suffer.
