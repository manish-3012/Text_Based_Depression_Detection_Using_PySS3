I'm basing it on one decision; someone else's decision.I'm 19 and before I found "her", I was already having suicidal thoughts. The thought vanished when we got together and I thought she was the one who saved me. I spent the best and the worst times with her these past 6 months, and tonight we had a fight. One that ended up me asking her if she still wants to stay or not. She still hasn't answered. I'm not going to say anything about this as it might force her into a corner. Until now, I never realized that I still have nothing to hold on to if she's gone and that I'd be driven back to suicide. Only this time, more eager. I know that most people just move on from their relationships but I can't even imagine trying. I don't even want to try. I can't find sleep every time we fight and especially now. This may be some kind of attachment issue or something and I want to get help but I'm afraid my "problem" is too small for a professional to deal with(teen love and angst and the likes). The only thing that'd probably stop me if the decision doesn't go the way I expect it to be is my guilt for being such an ungrateful person for doing this, especially to my sister who had financially secured me even though it wasn't her obligation, and the pain I'll probably have to suffer to get to my door.

I know basing it on someone else's decision is foolish and really ungrateful to the people around me. I've only been with her for 6 months and my life isn't really that bad. I am sustained properly and have people at my back. I feel like I'm being a kid who wants to quit just because things turned out bad for a second (and maybe for most people's standards, it's not even that bad). But even with everything I have, I still have this feeling and I'd rather bury it with me than live with it. I'm thinking of giving myself (at most) a month before doing it everything goes wrong. But I have a strong feeling I'd get the urge the day she decides.
