I put a post on here a while ago and only one person wanted to help.I know I shouldnâ€™t complain about it. That person is a great person. The situation (which is still up on my profile) always felt misunderstood by everyone in my personal life. I thought maybe the internet might have more sympathy, but I was wrong. Nothing has changed in my life, except that little worm whispering â€œyou donâ€™t deserve helpâ€ has gotten louder. I basically spilled my guts about how horrid of a person I thought I was, and the silence only confirmed it. Now the people in my life who were there for me are for one reason or another gone and Iâ€™m falling on the internet again. I never learn, I guess. I might as well end it before this becomes cyclical.
