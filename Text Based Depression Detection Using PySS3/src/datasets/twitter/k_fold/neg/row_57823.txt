I have no controlI feel like everyone is telling me how to live day to day and that I have no control over my own life. This is why I don't tell anyone I want to kill myself.

I'm so sick and tired of being forced how to live my life. Non of my thoughts are valid, everyone has something to say to counter anything I say so why the fuck do I bother talking anymore. 

I'm so done. Going to drive off to the middle of no where hours away and just deal with this, my way, and no one can fuck with me anymore.
