Just looking for a discussionOK so first of all I am not depressed nor I'm going through some shit OK so now I got that out of the way I am from Serbia (sorry for the bad grammar btw) where I work as a fiscal worker for like 350$ a month which is pretty average but is more of a survival than a life and after paying the bills I'm left with almost nothing so just killing myself seems like less of a struggle.
