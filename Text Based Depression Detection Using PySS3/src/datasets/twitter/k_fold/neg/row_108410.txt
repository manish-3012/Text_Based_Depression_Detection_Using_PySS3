Currently in suicide watch rnI attempted suicide last week and am currently on suicide watch at my hospital. I'm not showing progress so they won't let me go. Being here longer is only making things worse because I'm scared of the medical bills. I'm in a room with no windows. So I can't see outside and I have to wear a mask for obvious reasons. I'm only allowed access to my phone for certain amounts of time. I can't sleep and am not hungry. I'm force fed sleeping pills and have a feeding tube since I haven't eaten in 3 days. I have no reason to live. Nothing keeps me going. Nothing. I left the hospital today to see kittens at my aunt's house an hour away but had to come back after I passed out in the car. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Not like I'm going anywhere at this rate.
