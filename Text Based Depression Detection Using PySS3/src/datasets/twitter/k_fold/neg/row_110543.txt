I don't want it to get betterPeople tell me I should hold out because life might get better. I don't want that. I don't want what life has to offer. A meaningful profession, art, music, family, love, money, drugs, sex, religion, philosphy, charity, food, water, shelter... I have no desire for these things. My only desire is to be left alone. I want to sit still until I fall into a coma from lack of nutrients and then wither away.
