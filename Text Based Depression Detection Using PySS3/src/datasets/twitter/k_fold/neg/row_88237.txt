I am worthless.
I can't do anything right. I sit around and mope all day because I know that nothing is worth doing because all I've ever been met with is failure. Then I become sad because I know I will never get anything done just moping around. I think about the problems that I have constantly and it makes me feel even worse about myself when I realize that people have it a lot worse than me. I don't even have a room where I can sit alone and think because I have my extended family living with me and my room is literally a hallway between rooms. My friends have started to ignore my calls and I don't have anyone who understands what I'm going through. I try to talk to my family but they don't want to deal with me anymore. I just don't want to fucking live like this anymore.
