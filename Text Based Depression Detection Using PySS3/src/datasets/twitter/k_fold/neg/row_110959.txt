Trying to fall asleep is the most painful part of the dayItâ€™s currently 2am. I want &amp; need to sleep but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m stuck in a cycle of going to bed late &amp; waking up late in the mornings. The only thing that helps me fall asleep is going on my phone until Iâ€™ve exhausted myself. I have a headache from crying. I just want my brain to completely shut off. Every time I close my eyes I instantly get suicidal thoughts and I canâ€™t distract myself. Depression is a demon, I wouldnâ€™t wish it on anyone.
