dont want to go through thisWe recently got a bottle of ibuprofen. i want to take it all. i only took a handful or so but im not feeling anything. i slashed open parts of my wrist but was too scared to hit a vein or artery. someone make this go away. im so tempted. i post here everyday almost, i feel like im headed towards a dead end. i want it all gone, i want to leave everyone alone. someone put me out of my misery. i cant take being so fat and ugly and disgusting. i want to go away.............
