I Think I've SnappedFuck.  Fuck fuck fuck.  I think I've fucking snapped.  This isn't even suicidal ideation at this point as much as it is 22 years worth of keeping shit buried.  I think something inside me snapped yesterday and now the floodgates are open and I'm on the brink of madness.

I don't know if I can weather this.  I need to weather this but I don't know that I'm strong enough.  This is something that'll probably take years of therapy to fix if I'm lucky.  And that's if my family is understanding.

Why'd it have to fucking happen now?  Of all times.  When people are counting on me the most?  I mean I want to live but goddamn.  Brain chemistry is winning.

I don't think I can go back to fully being a normal person.  I've got anxiety, PTSD, and disassociation up the whazoo but I've never been diagnosed so nobody fucking realizes this except my girlfriend and the one time I tried to talk about this shit with my parents as a kid they blew it off.  

Part of me wants to just walk in one direction and never look back.  Fuck everything.  Fuck responsibility.  I'm tired of being the only one holding things together and having to pretend I'm fine and dandy throughout it.  I'm tired of being a fucking doormat and punching bag for people to vent with.  When the fuck do I get my venting session? When the fuck do I get to be the weak one?  Fuck. 

The entire fucking universe is trying to kill me it feels like and all people have to comment on is what a shit job I'm doing when it comes to surviving.

And I feel stupid about this.  Like I should have been able to weather this shit but then my brain got in the way.

Fuck.
