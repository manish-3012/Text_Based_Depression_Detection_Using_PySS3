Should I just end it alreadyHonestly, I see no light in my future, I see no happiness, I see no hope. I feel Iâ€™m just living each they, but at the same time not living at all. Iâ€™m physically alive but mentally Iâ€™m already dead. Iâ€™m pretty useless as far as skills go, Iâ€™m a disappointment, Iâ€™m so lonely. I donâ€™t see a bright side. I donâ€™t see anything going for me. No ones going to love me. No ones going to care for me. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s holding me back from just dying already. Everyday makes me want to die even more. Is anything worth it. Is it worth to keep living in a world that has nothing to offer to me and I have nothing to offer it? Is it worth living when no hope is left for you? Am I stupid for thinking maybe one day things will get better? Because that day isnâ€™t coming at all. I didnâ€™t choose to be alive and live in this world, donâ€™t you think I should at least be able to leave this world at my choosing. I didnâ€™t choose to feel this way, but maybe I can choose to end my suffering.
