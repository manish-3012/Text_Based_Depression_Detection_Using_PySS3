Life is unbearable.For the past year my life is hell. I'm in a constant state of emotional distress and it doesn't seem to go away. 

Due to a lot of issues in my late teens/early twenties, I fucked up my education, my work life and my social life. I'm a complete failure and now I drift aimlessly waiting to turn thirty in a few years. 

My SO is far too emotionally weak to support me. (And they shouldn't have too anyway) One of my best friend is no longer able to have serious talks about anything with anyone and dodge any addempt to ask them for help with a dumb pun. My other best friend is also dealing with a shitload of stuff right now and I can't possibly ask that of them. I'm alone in that battle and I'm loosing it. 

Everyday the pain is getting worse. It's getting harder to breath. I used to daydream about getting on a train to a new life. Now I only daydream about jumping under the train. 

I just want everything to end and no longer feel that pain.
