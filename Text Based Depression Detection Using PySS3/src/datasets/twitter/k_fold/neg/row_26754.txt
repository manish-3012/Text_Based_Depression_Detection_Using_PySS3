I don't want to die, but sometimes it seems like the only option.It's something I've thought about for a while now. Not always planning, but just thinking about how it would be better not to exist. I know I need help. I've talked to my parents, but therapy really can't be a reality right now. We don't have the money. My brother is going to have to get surgery on his hand so medical costs are already going to be high. My brother's gf is living with us because her home life is shit. (Which I don't blame her for at all. I'm glad she has electricity and running water now.) It's the holiday season and my parents have 5 kids living under their roof at the moment. The money for therapy isn't an option. College sucks. I'm barely making the grades to keep my scholarship. I'm not thriving, I'm dying. The one person who was helping me stay afloat hates me I'm pretty sure. It's my own doing. If I could find a way to end my life and make it look like an accident, I would. I guess for now I'm suffering in silence. I just want it to end though.
