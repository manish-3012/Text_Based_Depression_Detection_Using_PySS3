Is suicide logical for me?First things first, I'm a PhD student who got onto my course through being very lucky, as I'm naturally unintelligent. Let me put it this way, I worked a -ridiculous- amount in my undergraduate, I worked every damn day for ~16 hours whilst everyone else was out doing stuff, and essentially all of them scored better grades than me, even without revising - pathetic. Whenever I learn something, I forget it. I can't explain a single bit of my work I've carried out to anyone; I've practiced over several years but I just cannot express anything in words. It makes it humiliating at meetings, as everyone just looks down on me with pity. If I quit, someone else could take my place, which would be better off for everyone.

I just don't see how I fit into the world, my existence makes the world a worse-off place. From a philosophical stand point, I do not believe in personal gain or materialism, only progress for the world. I try to be frugal, however, I consume food, use resources, all that. I would be fine with this, but I have nothing to give back. However hard I try, which is a fucking lot, (I'm essentially always working, because I have to), I know, by logic, I cannot contribute anything. I have been debating suicide for a long time now, and the only thing that has stopped me is upsetting other people. But overall, people, and the world, would benefit from my absence via death.

I don't believe I am overlooking anything, from my views.
