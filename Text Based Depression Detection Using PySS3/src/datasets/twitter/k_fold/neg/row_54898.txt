I'm just tired and done with lifeI have no reason to be sad or empty. But I do feel this way and I don't know how to reverse anything. I have a loving family and concerned friends yet I have no energy to face them or reply to their texts. Depression has finally overtaken everything and everyone I love. I don't know for how much longer I can hold on.
