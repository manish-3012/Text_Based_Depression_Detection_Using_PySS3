Easier said than done.I've tried several times over the past month, using an extension cord. The need to breathe is the greatest impulse I've ever felt. Seconds feel like minutes and so many thoughts rush through my pulsing head that I let go, to my misfortune. Last night was no different.

There's a gun in the house somewhere. I spend majority of the day alone. I have ample time to search for it, but I fear I won't find it. I've considered, alternatively, drinking myself silly and taking a knife or two to the abdomen. It'd be a much-needed release of rage. Sometimes, I grab a knife and practice the motion, stopping just before contact.

Why haven't I done it yet? I don't know. I can see it there on the horizon, but, for now, I just want to drink hot chocolate and think about what I would have done with my life, had things been different. It's torture, but it passes the time.
