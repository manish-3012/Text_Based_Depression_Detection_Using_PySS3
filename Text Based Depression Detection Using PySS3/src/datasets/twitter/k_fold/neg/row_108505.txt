it's almost my birthday and almost my suicide dateI've been waiting till after my birthday.  I didn't want anyone to be sad when the day comes and I'm not here.  I was thinking of doing it a week or so after.  I just don't like being here.  I'm so alone. I thought I might not do it anymore because things have been slowwwwly been looking up but everyday and every minute I feel a pit of loneliness. It feels like it will never go away. I've been feeling this for years. it's only gotten worse since my s/o left me. 
I'm just so tired of trying to make myself feel better.  I'm so tired. I'm so so tired.
