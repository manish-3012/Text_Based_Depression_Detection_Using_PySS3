I need help saving a lifeI need your help saving a life

This is a trow away account and i am not a native speaker, but iâ€™ll try to express myself as best as i can.

My (M15) girlfriend (F17) is going trough a lot of things right now, his sister tried to commit suicide, his mom is a drug addict so she lives with her grandmother now, and she only puts negative thoughts on her mind, sheâ€™s been pretty open lately but i donâ€™t know what to do, i need help.  Iâ€™ve tried to make her feel better, but she thinks that suicide is the only and easiest way to get out of all this problems. I donâ€™t know what to do or who can i contact without making her family angry at her and i need some advice on how to make her feel better and make her feel loved. Shes the one whoâ€™s make my life a little brighter and i want to make the same for her. I know we are pretty young but i donâ€™t want to see her name on headlines because i couldnâ€™t help. Please help me
