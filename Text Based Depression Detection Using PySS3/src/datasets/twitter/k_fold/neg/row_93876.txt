Suicidal self â€œhanging onâ€Itâ€™s my birthday today. In 2016 and 17 I had a very horrible time with family and relationship issues. 

Iâ€™m very alone (partly my own doing) and have lost friends and family members due to either illness or feuds. One person even told me â€œI have seen all you have to offer the world.â€

I promised myself I would kill myself before my next birthday. But I havenâ€™t. 

Comparatively 2018 has been much better. But the thoughts still hang on. 

My doctor gave me sleeping pills to manage my bad sleep and I canâ€™t bring myself to take them in case I need to save them to kill myself. 

Which I know I wonâ€™t have the courage to do, but will think about a lot. 

I think that part of me is sad that I failed in my promise to myself. 

It feels like a bittersweet birthday.
