I've planned to suicide on April 28.I'm terribly, terribly sorry for my poor use of English. You might think why have I chose this date. That day will be the birthday of my crush, the only one I've cared about. Many years ago back in my high school in my home country, I started to feel depressed for not being able to fit in. It was at that time where I saw her, with her unforgettable, charming smile on her face.

Looking forward to her beautiful smile is enough to make my life worth living. I had not had the guts to ask her to be my girlfriend. I realized that I was going to studying abroad sooner or later. Ever since that day I spent a lot of time regretting that I should have done better in the past. 

I tried my best to forget my past and move on. Something tells me that I will never ever see my only crush in my life again, so I began a relationship with another girl. Little did I know my first girlfriend (not my crush) is neurotic and insecure. Although our relationship was abusive, we had some great times together. Our relationship lasted for 11 months before we finally broke up. It's like being in a long, emotional rollercoaster. Ever since we broke up, I realize what I was looking for the whole time - looking forward to meeting my crush and to see her smile right in front of me!

I know everyone will condemn me for not trying hard enough and will me to suck on it and move on. But I don't really care that much anymore. Since I probably have less than a month to live, I'm gonna give everything I can and push all the way for the rest of the month. I'll do my absolute best to finish my project, apply for summer internships and graduate school. I've got nothing more to lose. If everything fails and nothing works out, hey at least I know I have already done my best.
