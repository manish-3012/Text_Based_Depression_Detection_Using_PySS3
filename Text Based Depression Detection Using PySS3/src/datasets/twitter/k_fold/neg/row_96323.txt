Close people suffering from my death is not enough of a reason for me not to, honestly.I don't want to fucking not kill myself because other would suffer from it. I don't want to continue this numb existence for others. I want actual concrete reasons that would make **ME** feel **BETTER** about living, not me feeling worse about dying.

I want to have reasons for **ME** wanting to live further. I want to wake up one day and not think about the misery of being the one of fucking 400 TRILLION people that my parents could've given birth to. I want to look at it with gratitude instead.

Life is a gift they say. Well, if I could fucking donate my soul to someone that actually wants to use it and truly live, I would. I would right fucking now. I didn't ask to be here. If I had a time machine I'd go back to when my parents met and I would prevent that from ever happening. 

I feel like a fucking mistake. I feel like I'm not worth the air that I'm breathing, the atoms that I'm occuping or even of just being here. 

It's not even just feeling alone anymore, the feeling is better described as if I were alone in a whole planet 100 times bigger than Earth and that its athmosphere is crushing me everyday a bit more until the day I'm completely broken. 

I feel like that obnoxious piece of sand inside the mechanism of a perfect clock. Fuck me.
