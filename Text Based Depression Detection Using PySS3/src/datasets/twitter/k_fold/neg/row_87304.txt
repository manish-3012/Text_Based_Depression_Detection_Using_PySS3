Want to end it nowBetrayed. Was cheated on by someone I gave all my heart to and whom I thought love me completely as well.
This much pain is too great to handle. 2 Years wasnâ€™t long but not on the short side either.
I guess I was a fool to trust someone like her to begin with when I heard about her past relationships.
She probably still thinks I donâ€™t know she cheated, blamed everything on me, and is happy right now.
Iâ€™m just suffering in self-blame, lost of myself, and the feeling of betrayal.
I donâ€™t know if I can go on another day like this...
Shouldâ€™ve ended it a while ago.
