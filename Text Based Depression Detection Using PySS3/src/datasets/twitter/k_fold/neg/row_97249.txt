I don't know what to doSo I am very worried about my friend. She recently came out of the closet, and her Catholic family had a hard time accepting her. For a while, she seemed fine, but now she seems suicidal. My other close friend told me that she hasn't eaten and has a mast metabolism. I am afraid that she might do something bad.
