Life sucks probably going to live stream myself ending it.Idk what Iâ€™m working towards, I feel empty. Nothing makes me happy, Iâ€™m unable to connect with people, and I hate the routine of it all. Idk why suicide is even considered some bad thing, death might actually be nice. To whatever family cares, and if I have any friends close enough that theyâ€™d care âœŒðŸ¼ out see you on the other side, or maybe I wonâ€™t who cares
