I have screwed up my life beyond repair and lost all hope.I have made mistakes before, but I see no way to come back from things this time.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my whole life has been one giant series of mistakes.  I dated people who wound up just using me for money (and often cheated on me).  I bought a house I never should have and lost all my savings on it.  I've entered jobs, gotten scared, and walked away when things got too tough.  I've bought things that were pointless/stupid because I thought it would make me feel better.   Right now I am in the largest debt hole of my life and I don't see a way out of it. The sad things is I have been in debt before, paid it back, said I would "never again" do that to myself, but I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I've put back on the 50 pounds I worked hard to lose. I've had emotional outbursts at work.  I've been called loser, freak, psycho, etc.   I suspect I might have undiagnosed something (either mental illness or be on the spectrum) but come from a family where people were clearly mentally ill but told us to "suck it up."

&amp;#x200B;

I look in the mirror at myself and just cry. I don't have friends.  People don't visit or invite me to things.  I've tried meetup groups but I just don't fit in.   I haven't had a date in five years.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost the will to get up in the morning or to live.    I don't have the courage to end it all but feel like the world would better if I was gone.  I feel like all I do is hurt people.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to take pleasure from simple things, and tried to laugh by listening to comediennes, getting food I like, getting some exercise, etc.   But all I do is feel dead.    I've tried listening to positive TED talks, tried reading good books, tried a gratitude journal. I've tried thinking I am a lot better off than many, and others would gladly trade problems with me.  But here I am selling off life possessions, downsizing, preparing for something, but I don't know what. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my 40s, have two college degrees, have a boatload of debt, and I have exactly $12.00 to my name for food and gas for the week.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've ruined my whole life through stupid decisions, a fear of the world around me, and bad actions.  I accept that I am the captain of my ship and I did these things to myself.  I have lost all hope and all belief in new chances.  I feel like I've run out of time, and all I can do is give up.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I am horribly afraid of death.    But I also feel I will never be good enough for this world.

&amp;#x200B;

I have ruined my life, and I don't see a way to save it.
