Every time I almost killed myself but didn't I wish I hadI don't have a single time that I almost killed myself where I'm glad that I didn't. I haven't experienced anything worth experiencing at all and I've only felt the exact same way every second. I wish the first time I almost killed myself that I had done it and I wish any of the times after that I had if not the first time.
