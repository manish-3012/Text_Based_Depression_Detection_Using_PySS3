Please help me help a friend. One of my friends told me recently that she had tried to kill herself. When she told me I was really taken aback and couldn't think of anything to say other than "don't kill yourself". I've never had to deal with this before and I have no idea what to do or say to her. Obviously just telling someone not to kill themselves isn't going to help much. I feel like if she does end up committing suicide then I'll just end up blaming myself for not doing everything I could to prevent it. I have a hard time communicating with people in general and I feel like they probably think I don't give a fuck about them which is not true at all.
