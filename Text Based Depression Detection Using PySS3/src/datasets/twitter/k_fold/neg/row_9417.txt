Does this technically count as suicidal? If not, it could be a precursor.I don't necessarily want to die, I just wish I could stop existing in a way that wouldn't cause my friends and family pain. I'm so tired. I'm tired of dealing with my depression, I'm tired of dealing with my job, I'm tired of remembering to take a handful of pills every day. I don't want to do it anymore, but I also don't want to die, so I trudge on through the wasteland of life, but it never gets any easier.
