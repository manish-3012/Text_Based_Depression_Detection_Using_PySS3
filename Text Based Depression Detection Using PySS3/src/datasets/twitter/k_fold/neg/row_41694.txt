Forced Swim TestIâ€™m a graduate student working towards my doctorate. AFAB, non-binary &amp; bi. 

I imagine people will read about my identities, and think â€œgood, they should fucking off themselves, disgusting piece of shitâ€.  Donâ€™t worry yâ€™all, Iâ€™m working on it. Haha. I face that daily, from my family, my work colleagues, my professors and other students. Plus, Iâ€™ve said far worse to myself, and I donâ€™t see an end in sight until I kill this awful body I live in. 

Iâ€™m so sad. That kind of sadness that makes you feel like youâ€™re slowly being lowered into the ground and covered with dirt, like a casket being buried. That sadness that numbs, the kind that urges you to shred your skin to control something. 

Our world is so fucked up right now, the people in charge are fucking idiots- and worse idiots who are killing vulnerable people. 

Thereâ€™s this method for studying â€œdepressionâ€ in rats. The idea is that depression is learned helplessness in a way- you ask for help, support, love, encouragement. And after enough times of being rejected, harassed, shamed, screamed at, raped- you slowly learn to stop asking. They do this with rats, to study depression- teach them to become helpless. They call it the â€œforced swim taskâ€. They put rats in water and make them swim and swim and swim, but the rats canâ€™t possibly get out- thatâ€™s the point. I wonder if some rats give up and drown. I hope not. But those rats who swim and struggle and learn to be helpless- they force a model of depression on these rats and their brains are all fucked up, and they slice their brains up and see if SSRIs work. Or whatever. 

That what I feel like. A drowning rat, forced to swim and struggle. Scared to ask for help, to share how much Iâ€™m struggling. And Iâ€™m fucking tired and sad and I donâ€™t want to be. So Iâ€™m trying to not be like one of those rats- Iâ€™m trying to ask for support and encouragement. 

Anyone out there willing to lend a rat-sized life jacket?
