would this do itor at least what would happen to me if I took these and locked myself in my room:
prozac 1000 mg
atarax (hydroxyzine hcl) 1250 mg
vistaril (hydroxyzine pam) 1300 mg
I also have Advil, Benadryl, and multivitamins.
Please just like scare me away from doing this.
Tell me that if I take my Prozac regularly I'll be fine.
Tell me hydroxyzine won't do anything to me.
Please I just want honesty.
Would it be painful?
Would it work?
