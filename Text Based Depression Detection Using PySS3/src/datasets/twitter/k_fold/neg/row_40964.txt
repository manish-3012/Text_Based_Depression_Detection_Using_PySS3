I'm lost in life.Since 2012, all i can really remember is sadness. Yes, i have had my ups, but the majority of all the years, have been filled with sadness and depression. I'm so close to giving up. I dont know what to do anymore. From when i was 6 to i was 10 (i'm born in 1998), i was bullied every day. They locked me in toilets, threw things at me. Then i started swimming, and got happy, from i was 10, to 14. In August 2012, my parents got divorced. This led to that I had to hear at my parents calling them the worsts things in the world, and even though i told them this was making me really fucking sad, they didn't really care. It has been 3 and a half year now. I don't see my parents as my parents, I see them as strangers. I don't like being with my "friends", because they seem to be so immature or, i dont know, just not knowing how hard it is. They are just so happy all the time, and i can't name one beautiful thing on this planet that makes me happy. I have said to my self so many times, that i just need to wait until i can move out, but it's so hard.. Like, i don't feel there is a purpose for me in this world, and everything would be much better if i just left. I'm lost. I don't know what to do with my self anymore. I'm literally curious to see what is on the other side of life, because i'm sick and tired of this shit.
