popping pillsi just wrote out the note and im popping pills in bed. i hate existance. and i feel completely and utterly disposable.My girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me after saying that im annoying and a terribke boyfriend. and she told me that she wouldnt care if i killes myself. and now she wont even reply. she just leaves me on read. i know this sounds so pathetic but she was the only one who actually made my days bearible. and now that shes gone i feel just empty. nothing else can replace her. and im just tired of pretending that i can cope. it feels like my friends dont really care or understand what im going through. i just feel so alone. i hope i dont wake up.

ps ive been depressed for over 4 years now
