I can't work i want to diei'm 18 i finished high school this year and i have a free year until i start college so i have to work until that (that would be lame if i would be at home doing nothing during a year so...). i have borderline personality disorder so it's a case already but work is the most scariest thing ever.

i'm on that level when i'm getting a panic attack whenever i want to apply for a job or just want to THINK about what i could do during this year. actually i found a job some weeks ago, i worked there 1 single day then i felt so bad and so bored of it i tried to kill myself so i was at the hospital last 2 week (and that's why they kinda fired me for obvious reasons). 

i'm on meds, i'm on therapy nothing helps in this.

i need a job but i just can't because my social anxiety is so high i can't even walk on the street anymore. plus the panic thing what i mentioned before... today i wanted to ask the lady in the bookstore if they have any job opportunity (bookstore sounds calm so i thought it could work for me) but at the door i felt so panicked and so anxious i turned back and come home immediately. and it wasn't the first time i did this...

i'm so scared i don't want to work but i have to. the only way out is suicide but i don't want to make to the hospital again so i gotta be sure and real for this time
