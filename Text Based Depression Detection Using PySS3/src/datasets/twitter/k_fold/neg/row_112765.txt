Does it matter when I kill myself?I had this dream and at the end of it Iâ€™d end up in my own cozy apartment with bookshelves in the city I want to live in. 
â€œDonâ€™t kill yourself till you reach that!â€

Earlier I also kept putting off suicide plans till I move into a dorm. I refused to die in my childhood bedroom. 
But now itâ€™s like... who cares? I know Iâ€™ll probably end up killing myself. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s now or in 10 years but does it matter if I kill myself in my childhood bedroom, a dorm, or an apartment that I might own in the future? It literally wouldnâ€™t even matter. The result would be the exact same
