It's never been this bad. HelpI'm on the edge and I just.. I don't know where to go. 


If you look at my post history I made a post about my sister. It's getting so much worse. I left for the day, just the day, and she's mad. She's belittling me and treating me like an I'll behaved child. 


It's suffocating. 



I started to self harm again, after 8 years, after losing my mom, my dad, my grandma, my sister, I lived through an abusive relationship, all without self harming. 



But I started again. The goal isn't to die, it's to feel something real, not the pain inside. 


Even then, the thoughts. The thoughts of just disappearing are so fucking strong. If I'm a failure, a disappointment, a burden, then why not just solve all the problems and remove myself from the equation? 


I'm so scared. I don't know how long I can keep talking myself off the edge. I spent three hours laying on the bathroom floor crying because I wanted to end it, and continuing to breath just caused so much pain. 


I want it to stop. I want to run disappear. Help me. Help me please. I can't escape myself, I can't escape my situation. J want to die. Please. Help.
