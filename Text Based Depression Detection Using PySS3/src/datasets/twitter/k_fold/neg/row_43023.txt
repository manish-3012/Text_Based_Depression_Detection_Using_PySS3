What to do now?20 Year Old Male, living on his own for the first time. Extremely addicted to opioids due to failed back surgery. Canâ€™t come off of them or heâ€™s sick ... canâ€™t stay on them because heâ€™s sick. Continually throwing up despite having Meds now. Mom hates me dad hates me canâ€™t move back home. Have very limited resources and absolutely no motivation or obvious solution to fix. Leaching off of friends and couch surfing to survive. Left feeling like shit , left feeling like all I do is exploit . Left feeling like if I didnâ€™t have surgery my life wouldâ€™ve been stable... what the fuck can I do? And is there any reasonable point to live now?
