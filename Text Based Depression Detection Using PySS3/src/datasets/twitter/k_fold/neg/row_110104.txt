TrappedI feel trapped. I don't want to be here but am scared to commit. I know that I can't keep living like this but have trouble telling people how I feel because it has not gone well in the past. I have trust issues and don't know who to talk to. I've tried to tell one friend who has gone through this sorta thing but she takes to long to respond and the suicidal thoughts have gone away by the time she responds. It can take over a day sometimes and I'm worried that one day I'll snap and regret it in my last few seconds. I don't want to upset anyone. I also constantly wonder if I'm actually suicidal or not I feel like dying but am to scared so is that actually real or am I just looking for attention or something else I think that's kinda why I have such a hard time telling someone. I tried to tell my dad how anxious I am all the time but he basically laughed at me. He never listens to what I have to say especially about mental health. My mom is even worse and she would definitely be annoyed with me. And I don't even know what made me this way. I should be happy I get good grades I have good friends and even though my parents put a lot of pressure on me I know that they love me.
