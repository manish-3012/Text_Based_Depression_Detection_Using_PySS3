Being stuck is making it worseYou'd think that my being unable to kill myself would be a good thing, but it's not.  Every day gets worse and worse as I'm unable to change my life, due partly to my situation and partly to my own flaws.  Regardless of the cause, I can never go through with what I say I will, and everything just seems so stagnant.
I'm just so damn stressed out, and being stuck here stresses me more, and then the more stressed I am, the less I'm able to do and the worse I feel. It's a vicious cycle, and I'm starting to lose a grip on reality again.  So much of my days are spent daydreaming of a better life with better outcomes, and at night I have even more trouble sleeping than normal because I don't even want to sleep â€“ I just want to daydream of happiness.
And every time I daydream, I have to come back down and realize that none if it is real and there's a good chance none of it ever will be, so I feel worse than before.
I just want to die.  It's the closest I'll ever get to happiness.  But I can't do it. I can't do anything except be miserable.
