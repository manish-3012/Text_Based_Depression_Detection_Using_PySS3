I think I'm going to attempt to overdoseIt's only been 16 years and I'm convinced I'm not going anywhere in life 
About Everyone I know thinks I'm a garbage person and I am 
I do scumbag shit and I'm a scumbag person 
I'm addicted to opiates my mom lies so much now that she can't keep her stories straight my dad moved out and my brother probably will be too very soon and I'll just be alone in wherever we end up living because the lease is up in four months and we can't find a suitable place to live. 
I failed math and then the summer school math I've never passed math in my life either. I think I'll have to resort to dropping out 
My girlfriend seems to be less attached every day and no one keeps in contact with me anymore 
It wouldn't even make a difference if I left
