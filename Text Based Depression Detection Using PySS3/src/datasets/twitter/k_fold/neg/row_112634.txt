i cant take it anymore 

i hate where i live. i don't fit in with society. its very conservative/close minded. i am open minded, care free. i cannot make friends here. the jobs i have had here are shit shows and i have had set backs with each of them. i applied for two jobs in another city and after interviewing they both rejected me today. i am so angry/depressed/tired. i think to myself.. you should ask for adviceâ€¦ but then i thinkâ€¦. you have done that before.. and nothing gets better. i finallyâ€¦. finally had the thought thatâ€¦ you know whatâ€¦ maybe its finally time. anything you try sucks. anything you apply yourself to sucks. i think its finally time to off yourself. no more tears or crying about it. no more fantasizing about how I'm going to do it. i am past the point of caring what my family members will think/ the trauma this will cause them. just fucking do it. there is nothing for me in this life. i have finally come to the conclusion that its not the shitty jobs, the people who donâ€™t want to be my friends, the men who never notice me, the personal goals i fail to achieve, the financial stress that builds everydayâ€¦. its me. it makes so much sense that its me. i am not suppose to be here.suicide is not something you think about for a month and then do it. its a decision you think about for years. and i have thought about it for years. because nothing ever got better. i don't want to make a mess. so maybe ill do the whole carbon dioxide routine. cowards way out? sure. whatever helps you sleep. i canâ€™t care anymore what anyone thinks. it doesn't matter. nothing matters. i am just a person people see walking by and then they move on to their lives with their friends and family and jobs and pets and happy things. ill still be that person in the background, walking by.

thanks for listening.
