im tiredive been depressed for about 10 years now and ive recently started to feel suicidal again. every small thing makes me think of taking my life, i wish i could just do it and call it a day. i keep thinking about my mom and my familly, how they would suffer so much because of me, and they already do due to my condition. they are so supportive of me, i know they love me but i cant stand feeling like this. i dont know what to do, i dont understand why i always seem to feel this way, how every now and again i have the desire to take my life and die already. i need someone i can talk to about this without feeling like a burden
