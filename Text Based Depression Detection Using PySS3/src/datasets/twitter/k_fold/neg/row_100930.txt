I am binge eating to death and i cant stop. I want to just get it over withI can't stop eating. I am over 400 pounds. I eat until I get sick until I feel like I'm going to throw up I made a promise to my wife you that I would not kill myself and I love her but I don't know how long I can live like this. This has ruined my life. I can't go out anymore and play basketball I can't go hiking with my dogs. I'm afraid we might have children one day and I can't play with them. I feel like an addict I'm so embarrassed that it is not drugs so I keep it to myself please help me
