My girlfriend thinks I cheatedI probably did. I let someone do things things to me because I was scared and uncomfortable. They didnâ€™t ask me if it was okay but the lack of consent doesnâ€™t even matter now because I let it happen. And I hurt my girlfriend. I shouldâ€™ve stopped it but I didnt know How. I froze. I hurt my girlfriend emotionally and I canâ€™t deal with that. I didnâ€™t want anyone else but she thinks that I did because I let it happen. I dont want to live knowing I hurt her and knowing Iâ€™m a cheater. I donâ€™t have much in life keeping going and she was one Of the main things that made me happy and I hurt her. I wanted to make her happy and protect her but instead I did the opposite. I canâ€™t do this I donâ€™t wanna live with myself all I do is hurt people. Iâ€™m at a breaking point right now and I donâ€™t know what to do
