I'm begging Reddit for help, real ACTUAL help. I'm dead in 10 hours. Let's see what Reddit(ers) can do.As title says, I'm dead. This is a final notification from this reddit here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f5sajn/suicide\_is\_not\_selfish\_depending\_on\_circumstance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f5sajn/suicide_is_not_selfish_depending_on_circumstance/)   I deleted the original post so just get the context there. But to briefly summarize, I'm 26, US american studying abroad in Asia. It's easy to pay for college when the USD currency is stronger so that's that. My parents, my loving parents supported me for four years so I can graduate. I will not be graduating. Unknown to them, I've been keeping them as well as my wife and child in the dark. In the 2nd year of my course I failed miserably. I was contemplating suicide right then and there after I found out. Silly me of course thought that I could put if off, perhaps leverage my situation by making myself financially self-sufficient so I dabbed in the forex market for two years with great hopes. Failed. Technical analysis, fundamental analysis, price action, chart and candlestick patterns were worthless. I spent the last past weeks studying a special FX tool that could be considered a black-box but I no longer have time to confirm it. I'm out of time, more on that later. Tomorrow my parents find out if I graduate or not, obviously not.   


So reddit title says it all as well as my previous post. Tonight I'm going to be drinking heavily, then put a bag over my head and that's that. Why I'm killing myself? Because I lied, I caused pain, misery. My parents fought tooth and nail, sent money to me through sweat and blood for me to graduate, get my diploma and start my life with my family but I failed them. They've complained more than once that times aren't getting easier, so me being alive doesn't change any of that. But that's not all. Two years dabbing in the most prestigious "profitable" market has failed me time and time again. Only now do I realize that the rabbit hole in the market goes much deeper than silly little charts. If I had more time, I'd be able to reap massive profits in such a short time span. To give you an idea, I took a $5k demo account and turned it into $27k in 6 days worth of trading. Not bad. I needed further study but it's no longer an option for me. I've costed my parents $40k and they lost 4 years of their life, their fragile life, time and money that they're never going to get back. So if I were you and you were reading this, I would refrain from posting anything along the lines of "Oh, it's okay. Tough love. Failure you is better than no you at all. Think about your daughter." Your comment will just get shrugged off like yesterday's news. I need real help redditors and I promise to pay you back even double what it is you spend but I need real help.   


So I need a ticket back to the US and a job, one that at least pays min. $30k/yr and most likely a place to stay. If I can have that, all will be good. I'll be off my parent's budget so no more strain to them, I'll be able to take care of my family. It won't bring back those wasted 4 years, but at the least I'll be alive to do what a father must. Other option, I could "sell" this FX tool. This tool isn't downloadable anywhere on the internet anymore. I'm not the programmer but I made contact with the programmer and it's now receiving quotes via FIX api meaning no fake broker feeds, you're getting the real aggregate feed. There's three anomalies I've documented that pinpoints when and where a turning point in the market happens, only for the 28 major currency pairs. Last option, I die. Well, let's see what Reddit(ers) will say in the next 10 hours. This'll be interesting. And for all intents and purposes, if I don't reply back after the allotted 10 hours I'm obviously dead. I'll keep this post up as a reminder to ALL who ask for help on Reddit whether or not someone will or can help you. I'll be online until then. Post's up.
