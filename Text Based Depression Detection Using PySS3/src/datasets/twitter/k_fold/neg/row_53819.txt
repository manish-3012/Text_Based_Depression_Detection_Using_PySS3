Absolutely terrified of dying. But I have to. Will miss my son. But he's better off without me.There's nobody left to talk to about it.  Everyone says "I'm calling the police right now" or "get the fuck over it."

I can't decide between note or no note.  I think it can be ruled an accident.  I'd rather my son not know that I'm as much of a loser as I am.  But I want to tell him I'm going to miss him.

There's no resources for what I'm going through.  I was too vulnerable and got taken advantage of.  It's even harder because I saw all the signs.  "I'm scamming this person... " etc...

I didn't care.  I was so lonely I went along for the ride.  I never imagined it would go this far.

I'm not mad.  I knew what was going on.   I felt happy for a while even.  I was even looking forward to being a victim again.  Just not this much.

I don't think they can help it.  I know they were abused too.  I even thought I could be the one that gets through to them and saves them.  I've been told that I make too many excuses for people that take from me.  Guess I can't learn from my mistakes.

It's weird how much clarity comes from not having to think about next month.

I have two therapy appointments scheduled this week.  I can't even tell them.  I'm so scared.  I've been visualizing what's going to happen over and over.  It's going to be as gruesome at I deserve.  But I'm terrified.

Most of all I'm going to miss my son.  We just had the best weekend ever together.  It was so hard to fake it but I hope he remembers it.  

Thanks for listening.  Nobody else will.
