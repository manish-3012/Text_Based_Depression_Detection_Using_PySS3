I don't want to be here!I just need a fucking friend to talk to when I feel like hurting myself but my best friend isn't really someone I can tell that to, and everyone else is just a casual friend and I'm like reaching out so hard and I have nobody, literally no one to talk to about all of this and what is even the point! I'm an extreme extrovert with no friends! That is so depressing!!! So maybe I should just go through with it because literally not a single person cares. 

My parents and sister don't give a shit, my best friend doesn't like when I talk about this, and every other "friend" I have is just an acquaintance because I had to leave all my old friends because they were toxic which made me toxic in return and I just simply don't want to be here on Earth, I just wanna decompose. And I have no one who wants to stop me. No one cares. All I wanna do is hurt myself because I have no one who cares to talk me down.
