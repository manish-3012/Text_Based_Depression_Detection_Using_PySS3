I have so little time to figure so much out, and I don't think I want to anyway.I am fifteen. I am supposed to graduate high school early. Even if I somehow finished all the school work, my school requires a senior project. You pick a topic usually about what you want as a career. Unfortunately I forgot to develop a personality or interests. I have one year to find a topic for that project and I can not do that. For a while i went on the decision I would wait the year, and if I came up with nothing I would kill myself then, but I don't wait that long. I'm tired of dealing with everything I do. I can't think of a reason to prolong this. The only reason I have is I'm helping a couple seniors with math, but they are both so far behind they probably won't graduate on time anyway. I'm not really contributing anything, why should I keep going? My options seem to be failure or death. Death seems to be the best option.
