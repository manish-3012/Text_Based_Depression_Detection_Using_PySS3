I just want it all to end.I messed up but that doesn't make me a bad person and I surely did not deserve the punishment. Now everything is uncertain. I am fearful, sad and tired and bad things just keep happening. I truly want it all to end. Every day I want to find a way to kill myself. My life is upside down I cry almost everyday, my friends are tired of listening and some people insist on telling me I need to get over my losses and the bad things that happen as a result of my actions. I've heard I need to be a strong woman. But I just can't. I hate everything in my life. My ex found my reddit name and proceeded to trash me, make fun of my pain and say horrible things after reading details about my pain. I just can't do this anymore. I am so alone. I wish I could find a way to end it all. I am just so fucking tired.
