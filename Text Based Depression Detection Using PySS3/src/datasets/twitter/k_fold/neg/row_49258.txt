I'm ready to admit defeat.Anxiety is just too much I think I'd like to die now I don't know what's on the other side but it has to be better than this. I'm a manchild pot head allky i sabotage any and all things and I can't figure out why I do it I throw away very expensive things because I feel like I'm stupid and don't deserve to have them same with clothes I've refused to keep any possession since I was about 12 because just reminds me of how much of a worthless piece of shit I am I know everybody will be happy to see me go family and friends who know I'm in pain. I don't want to think about how people will laugh at my funeral so quietly I've asked do not have one be cremated and then thrown away. I can't stop being mean to everyone. nothing seems worth pursuing. I'm truly ill
