It's just been constantly un my head for the past few monthsNormally my suicidal thoughts are passive, although daily.

Lately the thought has been more at the forefront. I'm tired of flipping between feeling nothing, sadness and anger. It's some how exhausting to feel nothing.

I just want it all to end.
