I have nothing to live for...I want to be a writer but Iâ€™m so fucking terrible at it no person would ever read my novels.

Iâ€™ve been looking my whole 14 years of life for someone to click with, someone who gets me, someone who loves me. Iâ€™m tired of the loneliness.

Iâ€™m thinking about taking a fuck ton of alcohol and slitting my wrists or waiting for an extremely cold night, taking a fuck ton of alcohol and laying outside in nothing but shorts until I freeze to death.

I met one singular person that I love with all my heart and that gets me. But theyâ€™re dating the person I fucking despise the most. Heâ€™s an asshole and treats her like trash. How could a human being like someone like that. I could do so much fucking better than him but she doesnâ€™t even acknowledge me.

Iâ€™m tired of the loneliness, Iâ€™m tired of the sadness, Iâ€™m tired of living.
