I think I'm done tryingthey won't go away. I have tried everything I can. they keep going back to where they aren't supposed to. I spend a portion of my morning planning. staring. planning. it actually felt good. doing this would just erase everything for me. the hurt would go away. the pain would disappear. no more mean words. no more tears. no more anger. no more headaches. no more trouble breathing. no more chest pain. no more anything. i think its time to throw in the towel. ive lost all my support. so, really, whats left for me. i can answer that. nothing.

edit: im done talking. thanks anyway
