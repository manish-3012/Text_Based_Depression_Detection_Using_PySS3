GoodbyeI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll wake up tomorrow.

I cut myself too deep that it wonâ€™t stop bleeding. So, I wrapped my wrist in bandage in hopes that it might actually stop. I also took 3 tabs of Valium and 3 tabs of Lamotrigine.

If I never wake up, I just want to say Iâ€™m sorry to my mom and dad that I couldnâ€™t get myself together any longer. Trust me. This has been a very long process and I thought that I could shrug these dark clouds, but it seems like every time I take a step forward, I actually take a step back. I love you so much, mom. I love you so much, dad. Iâ€™m so sorry.
