Opened up to someone, but they made me feel lazy and guiltyOpened up to one of my friends. Like the title said, they made me feel lazy and guilty for not working hard in university. 

Of course I could be doing something more productive. No, I don't have the motivation to my coursework. I wish it was as simple as just "finding motivation" and " stopping sitting around". I never said I don't have time for anything, I just don't have the motivation or energy. They said that they understood what I was going through, especially with the social anxiety, low self esteem, depression, stress, etc but they don't really get it. 

I just feel alone and all I can think about is wanting to end my pathetic life. 

(But hey, finding motivation is simple, right? /s)
