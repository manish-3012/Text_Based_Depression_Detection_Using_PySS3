Hoping it would get better but im back to this loop againYep, was planning to end everything at the start of this year (during the day of my birthday) and fell off because of something unexplainable thing that forces people to go home, which made me inevitably  cancel it. I have everything ready and planned with than i have ever been, not going to explain further.

After all of this mess and whatnot, met some friends online that we chatted for hours, played games, watch movies, and so on. I really liking the friendship so far but i fucked up (as usual) recently, they become busy personal stuff (i understand), had some issues here and there. I wanna share things to them but the issues arises.

I really cannot cry for some reason, no matter how much i feel crying to the verge of my chest and tears going haywire, it's not flowing, it's not releasing, everything is a mess now and i become even more of a mess now that there is no place to be in. I cannot enjoy something at all and resort to some mindless things for mindless laugh that lasts 10 mins. and a mostly angry moments because of sheer frustration, also mostly just blankly wondering if i did just end it all. A good sleep for the whole straight day and just laying in bed after.

So far, i need some warmth in my life, i need that genuine hug of comfort, a genuine talk of something that really enjoy for both parties, genuine companionship and all. Tried everything back then and failed miserably and i don't wanna try it again as it may go that way again because im the problem.
I mean there is something exciting things that i wanna share but i feel no one is excited to hear them or even slightly interested because i will fuck it up eventually.


TL;DR: Im back on the loop again.
