Is there something like a literal 'suicide watch'?I should pre-face this by saying I'm a mess. I have everything going well in my life. I have a good family, finished my degree and plenty of work experience and all that.

Problem is, I've had a long life of being replaced made to feel useless by people. As such, my worst fear in life revolved around people replacing me/leaving me. Relationship wise cheating on me was the ultimate way to destroy me. I met a girl who made me feel wanted for 6+ years and she ended up cheating on me. It released all that pent up fear in men and I've been miserable since.

I think I'm a hazard not only to myself and others. I get anger spikes and all that shit so I'm afraid I'll hurt someone.

Context aside, is there such thing as a literal suicide watch? I feel at any moment I can get so depressed I'll do something stupid to myself. I've been to therapy, I take some pills to lower my CNS. I just don't feel right. I want to check into somewhere and be put in a hospital bed where I can't hurt myself or anyone. I feel incredibly unstable some days and perfectly fine others.

What do I do?

Thank you fine people of SW.
