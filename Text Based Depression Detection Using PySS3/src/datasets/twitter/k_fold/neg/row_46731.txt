I'd give anything to just dieI'm too weak to kill myself no matter how badly I want to. No one even gives a shit about me. I don't really matter to anyone. I feel so fucking alone. I lost the love of my life and my best friend because of his paranoia and a misunderstanding. Says he just wants to be "friends" but I can't be friends with him after that. I want to die so much it hurts. I'd give anything to die but I just can't do it. I got to be happy for a very short time, for the first time in my life, with him, and now that's over and I know I can never get that back. He was the only person that has ever cared about me, and that's gone. I won't find anyone like that again. Hundreds and hundreds of people I've met and only one has ever cared. I hate them all. I hate being alive. I hate that I can't die.
