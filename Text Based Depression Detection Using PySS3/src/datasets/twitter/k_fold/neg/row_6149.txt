It all comes down to this Hello again. I've been thinking a lot since my last update here on SW but I have not yet decided what to do.

I've finally managed to get a firearm but I've just been staring at it for a good 30 minutes now. It all comes down to this now. One simple choice between life and death. 

I have 2 choices now. It's either suicide or I have thought about making some sort of life-changing trip to USA or perhaps Germany which I hope to cheer me up a bit.

I will think about it for another 3-4 hours before deciding so if you think you can say something that can cheer me up, go ahead.
