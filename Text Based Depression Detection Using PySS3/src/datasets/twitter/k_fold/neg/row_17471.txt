Iâ€™m so close to ending it all.My mom will not stop insulting me and comparing me to my dad, who cheated of her. She uses it in everything, from forgetting to do chores to even my own personality.

I canâ€™t handle it. I donâ€™t want to hear it anymore. The way she yells at me makes me feel like if I was just never born, her life would be so much better. Is it my fault that sheâ€™s suffering? I really feel like itâ€™s the best to everybody around me if I just stopped existing, and disappear.

I donâ€™t have the will to drop everything and everyone who was with me, but at the same time I canâ€™t even type this out without crying and having shaky fingers. My self confidence is gone. My belief in myself is gone. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know where to go.
