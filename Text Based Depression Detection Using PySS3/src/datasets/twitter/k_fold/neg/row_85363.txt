I feel like playing tonightI'm just about done with my first bottle of vodka tonight, so I feel like playing. Game goes like this: finish a bottle or two of vodka, take all the pills you can find and then cut yourself until you pass out - see what happens.  
I feel abandoned. By my therapist, my family and my friends. It's not their fault though, it's mine. I'm just incapable of forming normal connections. I have a hard time being honest to people, but even if I am, I never feel understood. I take that as a sign that I'm too far gone to be relatable to anyone.  
I can't be alone. It's unbearable. I wish someone would understand why I have to hurt myself, why so many things make me cry and that that is as wonderful as it is sad.  
  
Soo.. tonight I'm playing. It's my chance to help people understand.
