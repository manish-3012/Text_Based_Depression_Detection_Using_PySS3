my parents plan to drop me from school and plan to drop cellphone plans, make me take part in rent, and just let me live my own.in my state they are legally allowed to drop me from school and basically let me be on my own. i canâ€™t believe it went from being a great child, to having them be so disappointed and upset with me they want to stop supporting me. i donâ€™t know what i did, iâ€™m watching my life go by... nothing iâ€™m doing right now i planned, my mental illnesses are controlling my every move. i donâ€™t want this to happen but itâ€™s too late and thereâ€™s not much i can do. therapy isnâ€™t even an option anymore. my future is ruined if they carry on with this. as a little kid iâ€™ve never imagined a future in me, iâ€™ve never seen myself being older than 20. iâ€™ve never really thought of it because i simply donâ€™t think it wouldnâ€™t ever happen. i really need some help anything would be useful.
