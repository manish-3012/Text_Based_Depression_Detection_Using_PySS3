I'm alive and that's my purpose in life.If you are "already dead" and extremely lost like I was/can be. Read my post history, or if you just want insight to my issues in the past year. 10 months ago, I would not have fathomed seeing 2019. It's such a perplexing concept to me now, that I was so close to death. I still buckle and think about suicide every now and then but I haven't tried to kill myself for over a year now.

This feels so stupid lmao

I had no ambitions but death, no wants but death and I saw no purpose in myself. I realised one day while looking at the stars "Not a single thing I can do in this life will affect any one of those stars in any way, life really is pointless."

Then it really clicked. "Life IS pointless. You need to create your own purpose. A purpose that is validate by you and you only."

I decided from that night on that my purpose was to stay alive. A song quote

"No one else is dealing with your demons meaning maybe defeating them could be the beginning of your meaning, friend."


I made this post for two reasons.

1. So that anyone that is currently where I was and is unable to comprehend living until tomorrow reads my post history and thinks "This pitiful motherfucker is still alive, why the fuck can't I be?"

And 2. I AM FUCKING ALIVE! What the fuck, I made it to today. I have never had such an intense battle in my life, I've made it. I am on an incline. For the first time ever, I feel privileged that my suicide attempts failed.

This post is the stupidest flex ever but I really hope I give someone hope by making this.
