I lied. Back for Now. Feel Free to Ignore.I've been teetering on the brink of suicide everyday, but I haven't fallen over the edge yet. Maybe I never will. My new resolution, to keep myself in a sane headspace, is to post here. I'm going to try to be encouraging and not too much of a downer.

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has helped me thus far. I hope everyone has a peaceful Sunday evening (well, it's Sunday evening for me right now). If anyone wants to talk, I'm always here.
