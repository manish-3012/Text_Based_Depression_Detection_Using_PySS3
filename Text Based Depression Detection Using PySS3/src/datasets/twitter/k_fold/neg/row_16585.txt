Im tried.I dont know wjat else to say, I dont want to die, I just dont want to live anymore. I'm done, I know I know I'm not even 30 but I feel like I am just done trying anymore. Why do i need to put in effort to something it seems like I cannot change. I fucked up by not carring about a decade ago and now those decisions still affect me. A big part of me hopes that I will end up homeless soon as I feel like that will be my lowest point and maybe then I can finally do it.  I actually have a plan for how I am going to kill myself, I plan on driving my car out to the cornfields in the middle of Winter here the next couple months and just sitting there with a bottle of alcohol. Maybe watch some YouTube on my phone, listen to the radio something as I just get cold pass out and die.
