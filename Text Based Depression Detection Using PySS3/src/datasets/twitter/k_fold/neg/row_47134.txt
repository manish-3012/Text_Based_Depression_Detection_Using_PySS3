I'm out of options. (22 M)I don't really know where to start with this. Bear with me, please.

I've suffered from chronic depression and PTSD since I was a child. I've had my ups and downs; but on the whole, my life has been on the gradual decline. I'll spare you all the sob story, and skip to the past year. Last year, I tried to take my life for the first time. I am 22 now, and was 21 at the time. It wasn't a snap decision. I thought it out, planned my timing, and honestly feel it was an informed decision that was my best option. I was, however, found and escorted to a hospital for recovery. For the umpteenth time, I was also transferred into psych. But it didn't work this time. There was no short glory period after I left. I just said what I needed to say, took the pills, and signed out when I was dismissed. Now, I'm 22. My girlfriend left me. I lost my job due to an unforseen need to move. I have no vehicle. The few friends I have left, those that haven't caved to their own demons, are moving on to bigger and better things. I'm no longer in physical shape. My social anxieties have worsened, I have frequent and recurring nightmares. My insecurities are higher than they've ever been. I can't see a therapist or a psych, as I now live out in the boonies. I'm scared to keep trying, and I'm scared to keep going until I'm well and truly alone. But the resolve I had once to end it is gone, due to seeing the fallout. I never thought that all my options would be gone, even the final one. I k ow the obvious answer is to just keep walking on amd see what happens, but I still feel things would have been better if it just *worked* a year ago. I don't know who else to talk to, so I guess there's my word salad, Reddit. Thank you for your time.
