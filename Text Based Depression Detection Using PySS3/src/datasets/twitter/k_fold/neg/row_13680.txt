I can't go onI just want to die, I know it's the right thing, i'm tired of feeling bad and empty all day, it's too embarrassign for me to open up to a psychologist and I want to stop bothering the people around me. 
I really see no happiness in my future, i have made the plan to kill myself long ago but i kept hoping that thing would get better, but everything is worse and i'm tired of feeling this way.
If i really want to die, then why do i post it here, where people try to stop you? man, idk anything at this point, i just don't want to bother anyone i know irl.
