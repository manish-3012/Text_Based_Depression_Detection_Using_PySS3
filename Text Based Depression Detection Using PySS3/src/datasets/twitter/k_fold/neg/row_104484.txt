[Trigger Warning] My SO casually told me this morning that if I hadn't made him go to bed he would have killed himself last night. He just left for work and I'm afraid he may attempt suicide.To the wonderful mods: I've read the sidebar links and I'm only looking for support and personal thoughts on what would make things better for him.

Last night he very casually hurt himself in a minor way, then exclaimed about it being difficult while laughing. It scared me because he didn't seem to care at all about what he had done while I was openly horrified, and I essentially forced him to lie down and go to sleep.

He has been very somber all day, not like himself at all. He left very abruptly for work, then a few minutes later he came back, said he was sorry for leaving without kissing me, gave me a kiss, and walked out. It could be nothing, but I'm worried it was a "don't leave without giving her a proper goodbye" moment.

His parents are not very emotionally supportive, nor are his friends. They all love him but are fairly closed-off people. I can imagine his best friends reacting with something like "That really sucks, dude, I guess see a doctor or something" if he told them he wanted to commit suicide.

He often asks me why I'm dating him and what I get out of our relationship. He sometimes says that he has no friends, despite having dozens of people he could talk to at any time including members of our residence who are trained in crisis intervention and would do anything in their power to get him help. 

I don't know what to do. I'm worried he'll be angry if I tell any of his friends or those who would help, and that anger will push him away from me and into a place where he feels completely alone and more likely to hurt himself. I don't want to make a scene at his workplace for the same reason. He can be volatile, very impulsive, and has a short fuse, and it wouldn't surprise me if he told me to stay away from him if I did something like that. He often does things that he regrets later for no reason, like tossing a favorite mug out a third-story window and watching it shatter then later saying "Why did I do that? I liked that mug!" 

He is not in a position to afford any kind of medical treatment, and a large hospital bill for psychiatric care would likely add to his stresses and drain him further. Despite that, I love him and I'd do anything to keep him alive. I'd let him break up with me and never speak to him again if it would help, but I know that would make things worse. 

What should I do? I just need support and "what worked for you" kind of advice, I know this isn't a place for actual psychiatric evaluation and specific advice. But if there's anything you can suggest, even something ridiculous or seemingly insignificant that would have an impact to you, please tell me.
