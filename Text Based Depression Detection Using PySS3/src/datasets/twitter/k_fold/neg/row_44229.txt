Iâ€™m too much of a loser to ever get a gfIâ€™m 21 and well Iâ€™ve come to the realization I have no chance at getting a gf I mean I can talk to a girl for a short time but Iâ€™m still awkward and I usually donâ€™t know what to say and Iâ€™m not attractive at all I mean Iâ€™m boring and ugly and even in my dreams I get rejected itâ€™s like I just have no shot at getting a gf no matter what I do relationships are too complicated and I donâ€™t understand them
