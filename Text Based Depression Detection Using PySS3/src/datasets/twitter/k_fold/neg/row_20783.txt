Broke up 6 months and my happiness has gone with her!Breaking up with my gf 6 months ago was hard but I thought that I would get over it. That never happened. After she left, I realized a massive hole left me which was happiness and there's just a void of nothing but sadness.

I just think about her all the time, how she's enjoying uni and finding new men to picture with. 6 months of sadness and nothingness has made me really depressed and heading into adult life, makes me think that this will stay with me. I tried talking to other girls but I feel like I'll be cheating on her even tho we aren't together. My sadness will just continue. 

If I just kill myself, this suffering will end and she won't even know i'll be dead until she eventually remembers me but that's if she ever does. I came to the conclusion that she was it and put my soul into her but then she left me. Everything feel apart, I wasn't motivated to do anything, I even tried to kill myself but that failed when 30 pills wasn't enough to kill me.

I'm just out of options, I just can't stop thinking about her, I just want to stop thinking about her, I want it to end.
