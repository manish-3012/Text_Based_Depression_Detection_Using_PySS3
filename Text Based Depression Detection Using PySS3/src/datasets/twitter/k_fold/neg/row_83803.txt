This is the worst it's ever been. Everything fucking hurts.I woke up today feeling so good. I fucking felt so amazing. I was going to start applying for university again, I was going to get my life back on track.

And then I looked up my grades and realized that unless I retook two hs classes and got exactly 100%, there's no degree out there that I could take that would be useful in life.

WHY CANT I JUST BE HAPPY. I JUST WANT TO NOT WANT TO DIE. EVERY FUCKING TIME I GET HAPPY I JUST FUCKING CRASH. EVERY TIME. I HAVE A GOOD DAY AND I COME HOME AND I WANT TO DIE WHY. WHY CANT I JUST BE FUCKING HAPPY IM CRYING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE FUCKING YEARS.

I just want to die man. I'm crying right now I just want to end it
