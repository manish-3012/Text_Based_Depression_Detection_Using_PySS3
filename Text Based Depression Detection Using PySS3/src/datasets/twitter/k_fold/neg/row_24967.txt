Is wanting to die the same as being suicidal? There is nothing "wrong" with my life, but it seems like too often I get this desire to die. Whether it be run over by a drunk driver, struck by lightning or some other uncontrollable event, I think it would all be easier if life just ended. I get these thoughts throughout my day, even if my day is going relatively well. I've never seriously considered ending my own life, but I frequently imagine it ending unexpectedly and suddenly and not only being ok with it, but sometimes actually wanting it. Why does my brain operate this way? I've never considered telling anyone about these thoughts and I feel doing so anonymously would be a good first step, if more steps are needed.
