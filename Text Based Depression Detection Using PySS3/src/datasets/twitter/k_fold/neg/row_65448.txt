Iâ€™m so tiredI have been down this road for 13 years now and Iâ€™m jus tired. I have tried for so many years to just be because thatâ€™s what I hear the magic trick is but itâ€™s not working. I got out of a 7 year relationship bc they fell out of love with me. All of my friends are around when they need something but how about now? I am trying so hard to be tough and get though life but everyone uses me as a door mat. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m so tired of hating myself. Iâ€™m so tired of everyone around me being hot and cold. 13 years is a long time and I just want this to end..
