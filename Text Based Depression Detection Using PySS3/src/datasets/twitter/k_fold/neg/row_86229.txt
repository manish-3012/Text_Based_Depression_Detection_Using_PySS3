I'm so tiredI honestly am so tired of living. It hurts so much and I don't know what to do about it. I've been told so many times, it gets better, it's just a phase but I've been feeling like this for the past 3 years. Every trivial issue just causes me to have these thoughts and fall in. Like I'm so done. Worst of all, I just got played recently by someone I actually thought liked me and now I can't get her out of my mind. I don't blame her for these thoughts honestly, she's been really helpful with helping me deal with it but now without her everything seems so bleak and worthless. Im hoping I have the strength to end everything by tonight
