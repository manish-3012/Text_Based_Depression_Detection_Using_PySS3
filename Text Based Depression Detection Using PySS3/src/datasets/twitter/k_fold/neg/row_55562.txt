Every morning when I wake up I know it won't get any better until I go back to sleep again.I'm at my wits end. My life sucks and I have nothing to live for . I have severe mental health problems that affect me internally and on the outside I seem normal but I'm anything but . I'm 31 years old, can't work due to these issues even though I want to or I want to go back to school to learn something useful but it's a vicious cycle I can't really articulate how I feel but I'll try .....

I want to have a life , I've missed so much and I know I'll never get to experience certain things but I want to have a life , go out on dates , have a relationship. I've never been with a girl and at my age with my circumstances I doubt I'll ever have that experience. Which is why I want to go back to school and try to build something of a life but the more I think about trying to i doesn't seem like it's possible and I get so depressed that at least once a day I place a knife on my wrists . 

I have nothing to live for and I want to end it but the fact is I can't because I'm a care giver to my parents and they have said as they get older they need my help more so I'm stuck . I'm basically living a shit life and being miserable and depressed every day simply so I won't put my family through any heartache . I just don't know anymore how I can go on day after day. 

Thank you for listening.
