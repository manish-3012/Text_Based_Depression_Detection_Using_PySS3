I feel uselessI don't see a reason to live. I've felt this way for a very long time. I'm used to this, but the urge to do it is stronger than ever. I can't even think about my future. I just don't see it. Nothing. I would just do it, but there are some people that care about me, I don't want to cause them pain. But this reason to not do it slowly fades away, as I become less social and less people talk to me, some even forget me. Sadly, I can't seek profesional help. My parents say to get over it and I'm too young to seek for it myself. It would be easier to just end it than to find help. I have issues that make my life hell. I'm transgender in a transphobic enviroment and even when I'm not out it hurts. I just want to quit. It won't ever get better, I'm in too deep. I have no future where I can be truly myself. Internet helps. But... it's not the same thing. Why can't I just be normal? I'm such a freak. I don't deserve to be alive. I fuck up everything. My grades suck, I smoke, have scars from self-harm and I'm a horrible friend, I can only see negative things in myself or the places around me. I do sometimes truly try to get better, like find a hobby but anything I do I stop doing since I suck at it. I know you gotta learn and try a lot. But I can't. I just can't. I fucking suck at living and I should stop.
