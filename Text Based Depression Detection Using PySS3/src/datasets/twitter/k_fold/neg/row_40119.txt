I just think life sucksI don't have a sad story. I'm not hurting. I do have people that care for me. According to everyone around me things are not bad.

But the thought that I have 30 to 50 years more of this makes me spiral.

This. This life. This grind. These fake ambitions. These fake people.

All I feel is apathy.

There are no things I want. There is nothing I want to accomplish. There's no where I want to visit. There is nothing I look forward to. There is nothing.

I try. I meet people, I go out, I try new hobbies, I travel. People say I should "fake it until I make it". I'm tired of faking it. It's not clicking. Everything feels empty, without joy.

I have been diagnosed with depression, I'm taking meds and doing therapy. The meds help a bit. I sleep better. Therapy has been disappointing, it's like I'm stuck in a loop when I talk to her, I don't feel progress. 

I don't think I'll try to end things again, but in my heart I hope I die in my sleep tonight. Every night.

Oh well... Off to bed...

Good night.
