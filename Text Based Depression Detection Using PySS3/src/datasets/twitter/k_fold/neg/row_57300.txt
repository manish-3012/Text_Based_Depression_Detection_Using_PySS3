Im scared im going to kill myselfI was as normal as i'd ever been earlier this year dealing with all the stress and a doctor randomly gave me anti-dpressants. i didnt even see the doctor for depression i went in because i wanted a physical and came out on a ssri. Ever sense then my life has been all fucked up. I eventually got off of them but i dont feel the same anymore. Theres just so much pain now and i cant describe it. All i think about is killing myself and i hate every part of my life. I came close to slitting my wrists a few weeks ago and thats all i can think about. i havent improved that much since i stopped taking them my depression is just so much worse now :(. I even have a suicide date
