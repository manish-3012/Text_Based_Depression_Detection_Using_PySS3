Dying in my roomFor the last years I've had no motivation. I am 22M and suffer from a lot of physical things (most of it is undiagnosed but I know from family history and how I feel I have them) I don't have motivation to change my life. 

Throughout the years I've had opportunities to change my life but I never had the motivation to go through any of them. In the end its either lack of fear, lack of support network etc that stopped me. Now I'm supposed to be in the prime of my life and have nothing to show for it. 

Due to the person I am if I were to search for socialization I would only encounter people I would hate. Even though i hate myself I have this weird inferiority complex. I have such niche interests that the only people I would encounter are people that I know for sure I think less of. I dont know how to word it properly but they are people I cant stand and due the person I am if I were to get better then that's who I have to settle for unfortunately.  

I've been thinking about killing myself for years now. About 6 maybe more ive been in this state of mind. The method of suicide is still in the process. I would like to get my gun and go my way while doing some other things but in reality I just might hang myself with a belt? The process of getting better i don't know. If life really does get better than it would've by now. 

Then I think its fate. I'm fated to end up this way.  I would like to do things my way and go out with a bang but I just might die in my room.
