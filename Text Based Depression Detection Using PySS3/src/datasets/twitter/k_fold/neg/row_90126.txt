The need to vanishI simply want to vanish. Iâ€™m caught between what Iâ€™ve done and what happens to me. No one is perfect but how imperfect can one get. My attitude has not been one to applaud as Iâ€™ve been lazy, procrastinating and carefree and I get a lot of burners for it. The thing is I donâ€™t want to intentionally be a burden, i just need to be more conscious. Every attempt is subdued by more reminders and suggestions that thereâ€™s something wrong with me..like a horrible mental illness or condition. Socially awkward and donâ€™t get me started with the ladies. It seems worst than helpless. I wonder why I never learn or if Iâ€™m worth it. The lack of self confidence and low self esteem doesnâ€™t help and it sounds pathetic but I find myself tearing up observing other guys doing so much better than I do. Iâ€™m a Christian but offend God so much it seems nothing and no one is on my side. I just wish there was a way to not exist without dying. Help.
