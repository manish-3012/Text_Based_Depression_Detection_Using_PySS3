Hi.**11.25.19 20:14**

Today is the first day that Iâ€™ve genuinely thought about killing myself. I seem to have no future and Iâ€™m worried about where Iâ€™m going. My parents have such high expectations of me and I donâ€™t think I can do it. They always say Iâ€™m smart and so do my teachers and other people. But I just know basics and enough to get by. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m actually smart. I know for a fact that I donâ€™t have their work ethic. Theyâ€™re immigrants who came from India and eventually worked their way to their current tech jobs with Apple and Google. I have everything material wise I could ask for and Iâ€™m forever grateful for what theyâ€™ve done for me. But they expect me to be better than what they are today and Iâ€™m not sure how to do it. My grades are about B+ to C-, with a D in a Spanish class and I do nothing outside of school and have no to very little social life. I just feel like killing myself would be better for everyone rather than having to deal with me. I donâ€™t want to see my parents look down at me because I couldnâ€™t meet their expectations. Itâ€™s just really bad right now.
