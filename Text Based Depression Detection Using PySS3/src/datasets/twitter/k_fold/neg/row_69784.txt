Canâ€™t do this anymoreI donâ€™t know where to start. I feel like my life has nothing to offer anymore, thereâ€™s no one to talk to or no road to follow. Iâ€™ve never felt this alone in my life. Ever. Itâ€™s the worst feeling ever. I literally have no one to share my feelings with. This is my only platform to share my thoughts, I have nothing and donâ€™t know what to do with this life. I want to escape and disappear so so bad. Iâ€™m exhausted of pretending to be fine. Itâ€™s been too long. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I always believed good things would take time, but nothing has ever changed for me in all those years. The loneliness is KILLING me inside and I donâ€™t know what to do. I wake up and think about death, go to bed with the exact same feeling. Always wishing I would die in my sleep. I feel like Iâ€™m still this child / teen, reliving every single thing and wishing I could do everything over. Iâ€™m stuck in the past and am afraid of the future. I just need someone to guide me though this life, I canâ€™t do this on my own anymore. Canâ€™t take this any longer, these suicidal thoughts are haunting in my head every single day for the longest time. 

Can relate so much to this quote:
â€œLoneliness does not come from having no people around, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to you ..â€
