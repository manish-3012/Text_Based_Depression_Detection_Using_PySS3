What the hell is wrong with me?!Just bought a new car,  my other half got a promotion, about to get a dog and all I feel is nothing... fucking nothing!
Everything is going great, my other half is everything to me, love of my life, yet... somehow during sex today all I was thinking about was how meaningless and pointless everything is, how worthless I am and that I'm better off dead. I'm ashamed I have these thoughts, but I would never dare to hurt someone just because I'm not ok, I'm so fucked up in the head and I'm afraid I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna end it all.
