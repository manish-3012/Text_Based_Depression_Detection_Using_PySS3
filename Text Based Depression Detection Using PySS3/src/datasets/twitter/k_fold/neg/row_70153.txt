I don't deserve to be happyEveryone always says that life gets better, and even if that's true (I don't think it is), I'm not sure I deserve to have a happy life. I have no redeeming qualities, and every time I could finally do something to start fixing my life, I fuck it up somehow and just get more depressed than when I started. As soon as I can find a painless, cheap way to end it, I will.
