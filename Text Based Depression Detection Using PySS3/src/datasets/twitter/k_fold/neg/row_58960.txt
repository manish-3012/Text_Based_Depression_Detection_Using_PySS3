Iâ€™m struggling to hold it together yet againI posted here a few months back and things thankfully improved somewhat. But I feel like Iâ€™ve taken 10 steps back once again. 

I was so amped up for the holidays. I hadnâ€™t celebrated Christmas since 2018 and was excited. Christmas Eve I had so much fun with my mom and my boyfriend. Christmas morning was alright. 

But after opening the gifts with my boyfriend, my head just went south. I went to lay down and didnâ€™t get up for hours. Itâ€™s like all my energy and what Christmas spirit I had just plummeted. I thought it would be a happy turning point for 2020 but itâ€™s like my head just decided, â€œno. Be sad. You know this isnâ€™t what you wanted. You know itâ€™s just another day. You know nothing matters anyway.â€ 

The day after I held it together reasonably well to spend the day after Christmas with my boyfriend and his family, but I felt miserable and sad inside. I donâ€™t know them very well and the entire time I was a quiet, anxious mess. Truthfully, I didnâ€™t want to go. I didnâ€™t feel ready to meet my boyfriends sister and her fiancÃ©. I felt like staying home and crying but I didnâ€™t. We had fun playing a card game. But then that night I was back home and felt just overwhelmingly sad again. I refused sex because I clearly canâ€™t be in the mood when depressed as hell. On Sunday after I worked my morning shift for a cal center from home and my boyfriend went home, I spent all night crying. 

My birthday is Saturday and I feel directionless. Iâ€™ll be 26 and feel like Iâ€™ve accomplished so little. I feel like I canâ€™t get away because of my personal responsibilities to my pets but wish I could just be alone for a few days. But at the same time I truly believe if I were alone for too long lately, Iâ€™d finally commit. Most days lately I feel like the only things keeping me tethered here are the fact my mom would be devastated and my boyfriend of almost 1 year would be sad for a while. I feel like my head is constantly under water and I can never make any momentum in life without being thrown 10 steps backward. I wish I could be on antidepressants again but Iâ€™ll be losing my insurance on my birthday as thatâ€™s the cutoff for being on my moms, who was generous enough to put me back on it when I lost my job due to Covid in March. 

I simply donâ€™t know what to do anymore and wish I could just end it all. I know of/when Covid is gone my life will never be the same. I cant handle how socially isolated I am lately and continue going back and forth between missing my friends amd people terribly and wishing I could surround myself with people again to just wanting to be alone. Craving being alone. Wishing more than anything that I could self-isolate and give up my responsibilities and not have to speak to anyone. 

If you read this far thank you for caring. It means so much to me as I feel like I have no one I can talk to about this.
