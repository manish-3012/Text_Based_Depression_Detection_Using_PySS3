Why continue? Ready for suicide.Hello, to whoever reads this. I'm constantly sad, I constantly think about killing myself. It's practically every day now. I've gone to psychiatrists about this, didn't help. The only good thing that came from going to them was lowering my anxiety. Talking doesn't really help, nor the medication that they've prescribed me. I've been on fluoxetine, Sertraline, and now on... I don't even know what. They don't work. I never get excited about anything, nothing at all gets me excited. I have no dreams, no desires, nothing. I don't see what's the point in living. I really don't. It's not all that great. No matter what activity I do, I don't enjoy. The one thing that I truly loved was to play video games, I absolutely loved them, but now... Not even that gets me excited. I don't like that I don't get excited for anything. I have no friends, but I do have a girlfriend. She's gonna leave me soon though. Something about her not being happy with me, college and shit. She was my first love. Been with her for almost two years now. Now I'm not gonna even have that. I was already sad, and what not, but now even more so once she leaves. I'm 18 years young, and I plan on killing myself once she does. There's nothing else for me. Whenever I think about death, it's always calm, and very peaceful. Only then can I truly be happy. I don't have a horrible life, didn't get raised in a messed up way, no drug abuse, or anything like that. I'm just sad for no reason. I'm so sick and fucking tired of it hinging me down, getting worse, and worse by the fucking day. I cannot take this anymore. I really can't, I'm sure plenty of people have endured a lot more than I have, but this is too much for me to handle. I plan on emptying out my bank account, give practically everything to my family and blow the rest on drugs. Then, end my life.
