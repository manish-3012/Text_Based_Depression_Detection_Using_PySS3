Everything is overwhelmingI hate everything except my bf and my dog. I donâ€™t wake up anymore. I wish I would just die in my sleep. I want it all the stop. Everything feels like tidal waves crashing into my soul. Tearing me down, clawing my skin off, and I just want to scream endlessly. I want all the sadness out of my body. I feel like everything is smashing me into the ground and Iâ€™m just a pile of bloody feeling and pain. 

What makes you happy?? I just want to sob.
