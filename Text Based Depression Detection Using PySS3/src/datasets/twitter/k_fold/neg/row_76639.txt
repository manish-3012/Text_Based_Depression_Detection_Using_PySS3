Getting sleepyI've taken a tramadol and have been drinking alcohol with it. Things have slowed way down and I can feel myself getting very tired and my brain is getting a little foggy. I gotta keep binge drinking though to make this successful. I've also got xanax to take before I get too far gone, just to really finish it off. I'm feeling very at peace with this. Hopefully this will be my last post âœŒ
