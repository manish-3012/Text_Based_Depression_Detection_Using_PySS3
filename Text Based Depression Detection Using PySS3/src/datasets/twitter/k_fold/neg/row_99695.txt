Can't functionSo my boyfriend of 16 months left me on Friday and he said because he needs to find out if he wants to be in a relationship and figure out who he is and what not, I'm grasping on to little hope here because he said there's a 10% chance of getting back together at this point. I'm completely crushed, its only day 3 and I have went to his house each day, he's only let me see him once out of those times. He's been so helpful and he hasn't turned me away on talking to me. We still love each other. I don't eat, I maybe consume more than 200 calories a day, I try to drink water but I don't believe that I drink enough. My therapist can't see me for another 2 days. I've considered going to the a psychiatric emergency room but I don't know what I would tell them, I don't know what they would even do. I've considered suicide a few times and I feel like the urge to do so is rising. I don't know if this is even the right group to talk about this, I don't really know what group to post in. I can't accept the fact that he and I are no longer a couple. It's just so hard for me, I'm not on medication and my psychiatrist appointment isn't till the 26 of October. I had to take work off for the week which isn't great at all because I'm financially in debt. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I try to take my mind off of him but I can't do it, I try to occupy myself but nothing works. I feel the most comfort when I'm driving to his house and sit there, even if I don't see him. My depression is the worst it has been, ever and I miss the one thing that made me who I am and I don't wanna go on without him being in my life.
