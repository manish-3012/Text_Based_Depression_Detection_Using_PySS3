Part of my futureI read someone talking about how they almost had no real goals, because they knew they were going to off themselves one day.

I want kids. I'm always wanted to be the parent my parents couldnt be. This is ALL I want. But, because of this being my only goal,  I feel as though life will find a way to mess with me. I fear I will never be able to have kids. As a big fuck you to me, ya know? 

I also think about how awful things are  in this world. Do I want to bring kids to this world?

Kinda got off track. I don't have too many goals. Right now I tell people that I will become a yoga instructor. But I honestly don't think I will be around for too much longer anyways. I'm still here chilling but I'm gonna leave here one day. I have yet to be pushed to that moment.
