I might just fucking do itI literally canâ€™t live like this anymore I canâ€™t take a single day more in this fucking body literally no one cares about me no one will ever love me all because Iâ€™m transgender... I never asked for this I have gender dysphoria itâ€™s a literal mental health condition. If I canâ€™t even be born right why should I try to live I shouldâ€™ve been dead from the start. I am so fed up with having to live day to day pretending like it will get better that people will see me for who I am BECAUSE IT WILL NEVER FUCKING HAPPEN I MIGHT ACTUALLY SLIT MY FUCKING THROAT every morning I wake up and when I see my reflection I fucking die on the inside I donâ€™t want to exist any more I donâ€™t want to have to live a life that will only have pain I really just wish I was dead and the only thing I can guarantee to actually do right is to fucking kill myself. If Iâ€™m dead at least Iâ€™ll finally be free from pain from the suffering because there will be nothing left at all. Itâ€™s the only way I see out of this. Not even my family cares about me anymore all because I tried to be myself. The only thing I am thinking about now is how I am going to fucking end my life.
