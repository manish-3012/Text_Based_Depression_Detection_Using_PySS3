As I sit here, I don't understand.After more than 30 years seemingly treading water in the proverbial ocean that is life, I find my body is losing its ability to continue the fight.  I feel as if my mind is breaking at the seams from the continual compartmentalization required from being a friend, neighbor, husband, father, stepfather, distance-father, brother, son, coworker, leader, boss, financier, etc.

If anything else, I don't know what I don't know.  I'm not in any immediate danger but I know these types of feelings.  I've had them before and I brushed them aside until I was staring at the inside of a barrel admiring the gentle slope of the curves as they eventually compacted into a near completely indistinguishable shape.  I knew I needed help then, and I know I need it now.

I just don't understand it anymore.  So...help?
