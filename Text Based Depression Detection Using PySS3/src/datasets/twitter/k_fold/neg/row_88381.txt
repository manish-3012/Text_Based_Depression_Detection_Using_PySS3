Soon ill start taking heroin again, and i hope i will die soon.Im autistic and life is not made for people like me.

i stopped going to school, i will never be able to work, and the last hope i have is almost gone.

i even started doing music so there is something left of me.

Soon i start with benzos, then opiates and the great brown stuff that makes me feel like normal human.

And at the end i will mix it and overdose, planning everything.

and dont tell me i will waste my "potential" because im autistic, im litterally stupid. Cant get myself do to anything brings me to the death cycle.

i have no talents, my death will be like a fly dying.

im sorry for whoever will need to clean me up, ill try to not make a mess.
