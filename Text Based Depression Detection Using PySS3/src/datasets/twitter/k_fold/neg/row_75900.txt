I survived an attemptI am so done with myself. I sucked at living and i couldnâ€™t manage to off myself. I hung a rope with so bad knots thats when i finally pushed the chair beneath me it got loose and i was on ground. After that it took me good 40 minutes to get my breath back as i was going through shock and couldnâ€™t move my body. After getting into my senses i called my friends and told them about it. Then i was moved to stay with my aunt. All everyone wanted then was a reason so that they could help me with it. I wont be able to make them understand that i was done with myself. I hate myself to a point that no matter how good i do i eventually end up fucking everything else. I have recognised that i have a self destructing behaviour and i simply cant go on with it. I donâ€™t know what kind of help i need. I was kind of grateful that i survived but its been 12 days and i feel that what i am living right now is just borrowed time and i donâ€™t belong here. I have no intentions to do it again because now i know that our body fights back and i am too coward to choose any other way. Maybe i need to learn to be happy with myself. I honestly donâ€™t know what to do but all i gotta do is live and not die because i wanted to.
