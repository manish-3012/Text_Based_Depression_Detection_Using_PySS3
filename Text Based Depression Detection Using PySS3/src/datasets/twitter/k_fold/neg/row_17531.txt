Just TiredItâ€™s not like I want to kill myself. Itâ€™s that Iâ€™m tired of being alive. Itâ€™s just gotten progressively worse. Now I can barely focus on even the most menial task because itâ€™s feels pointless in the scheme of things. I never do anything or go anywhere. Iâ€™m the least favourite friend. The only thing that really stops me at this point is that I donâ€™t want anyone to have to find my body. I almost reached out to a teacher but I donâ€™t want my parents to know whatâ€™s going on. I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d understand and I donâ€™t want to let them down. Sometimes I have a random good day and that makes me feel like this isnâ€™t real. Like Iâ€™m faking. I donâ€™t feel like I belong anywhere.
