I'm so tiredIn March I was laid off due to covid. In June my husband left me for someone else. In October my divorce was finalized. Last week he married the girl he left me for. I'm struggling with so much. Finding a home. Working constantly. His betrayal. He has the nerve to come around me wearing his new wedding ring and bringing her around me. And every single time it's like a knife to the chest. I just want to take a drive and end it all so my children aren't the ones to find me. Then it's all peace and freedom. Today has been one long struggle. It's our 1st holiday alone he took our son with her off to family meals while I'm home all alone. I dont feel like there is anyone to talk to about any of this. And if there was I feel like they are just tired of me crying over him so much and dont want to listen to me. I want so much to just be free. Just not have to struggle so much. To not have so much pain. I just want released.
