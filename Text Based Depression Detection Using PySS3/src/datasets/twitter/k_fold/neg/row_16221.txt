I truly want to dieI'm 24 and have been depressed for a long time, pretty much my whole life. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). I'm at my ropes end finally. I recently got out of a mental institution where they changed my meds and I thought I was doing better. After my girl left me and now I'm alone again I just don't know what to do anymore. I was committed to a mental institution by a therapist I went to see, they helped me a bit and diagnosed me with extreme GAD like I knew and severe and recurrent MDD, which I knew but never seeked help for. Now that I'm out and in the real world I just feel like they blew smoke up my butt. All I hear in my head all day everyday is "kill yourself", I'm sitting here and I just want it to stop. When I got committed my family and friend found out my problems and now always check on me and say they care about me, but I don't feel it. My family and friend also have some problems going on right now and I'm trying to help them and don't want to make things worse, but I just cant live with the constant feeling and voice in my head yelling "kill yourself". I truly want to die, I feel like I'm to far gone and can't be saved.
