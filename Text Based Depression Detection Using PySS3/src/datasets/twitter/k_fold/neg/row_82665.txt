I do anything right, I cant even be in a relationshipI've had a hard past few years. I am 19, I am unmotivated, lazy and in college. The first semester kicked my ass hard, but I think part of that is because I have a hard time waking up early and have scheduled around that. I don't have any close or good friends, and I feel like I am that guy who people don't care if they tag along or not. Right now I am dating this really cool girl. Things are going slow and I don't get to hang with her much. I like her a lot but I havn't dated in about a year and a half. My two major relationships were for over a year and both ended up with me being cheated on and left for someone else. Now I dunno, I can't even do it. I have so many worries even though we are barely dating. Like what if we become serious, and then she hurts me? I over analyze everything and I struggle not to be sad around her. But I am finding myself always anxious and worried

In addition I have struggled from depression for about five years now, nothing from drugs to counseling to changing my mindset has worked. I struggle to wake up, I struggle to enjoy things. I struggle to find happiness. I am always anxious and I don't even know why, my life is better now, I used to be in a pretty bad home, now I am in college and persuading my dream. Why am I always sad and wanting just to die?

I can't do anything, I can't date without feeling like shit. I can't hang out with people without feeling like shit. I can't sleep without night mares. I can't do anything right, I just can't live. I hate life so much and I just want to die. I just need an out. I'm always so off for no reason. I don't know what to do.
