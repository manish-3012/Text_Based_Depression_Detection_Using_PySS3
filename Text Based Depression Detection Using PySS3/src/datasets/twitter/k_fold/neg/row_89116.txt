I donâ€™t want to do itbut sometimes I find comfort in it. Itâ€™s a fantasized version. I imagine being dead as if Iâ€™m just sleeping, forever. Never having to face my problems. Free from the suffering of having a body, feeling urges. Just existing in some ether space where I can just breathe deeply, and rest, forever.

I feel like Iâ€™ve ruined everything with the people I am closest with. I feel like Iâ€™ll never be understood. I feel like Iâ€™ve been put in some sick and twisted game. I live in endless frustration, helplessness, jealousy. Therapy helps, and makes me feel like Iâ€™m not so crazy, and that my feelings are valid and they make sense. But once a week, feeling like things are okay and Iâ€™m a worthwhile and understood human... The relief dies soon and itâ€™s back to the exhausting nature of my existence. I have things to distract me, and sometimes it works better than others. Sometimes I have certain thoughts that fill me with the deepest emotional pain Iâ€™ve ever felt, and I wonder if Iâ€™m ever going to get over it, and if Iâ€™ll ever get back to the mental state I used to be in.

Iâ€™m not going to do it, because I donâ€™t want to. I have hope, I have reasons to keep going. I canâ€™t imagine death is anything like the fantasy I created for myself, either. I donâ€™t want people to miss me, or be angry with me. And I donâ€™t even want to do it in the first place. I have reasons to keep going, no matter how hard this shit is. Even though this shit is exhausting and defeating and I feel this urge to cry but I am too exhausted to even have that release. I just hope it gets better soon.
