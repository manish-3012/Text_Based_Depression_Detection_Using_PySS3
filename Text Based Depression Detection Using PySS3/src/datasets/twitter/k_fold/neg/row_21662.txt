Please talk to me.I don't wanna deal with my pain anymore. I'm so goddamn sad. I don't know why the girl I love left, she didn't even tell me. I tried my hardest to be my best for her and in the end even my best wasn't enough to keep her loving me. It hurts so much to think she can just give up on me and move on. Like I didn't make any impact. Like I never mattered to her at all.
