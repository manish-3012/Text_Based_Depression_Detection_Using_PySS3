Committing suicide without dyingFor the past 6 months, Ive basically been dead.  I donâ€™t plan on killing myself but donâ€™t plan on living either.  I have the luxury of not having to do anything to survive right now. I am basically rotting alive. I do not want to put forth any effort to live the traditional â€œgood lifeâ€ anymore, as Iâ€™m faced with a health predicament that Iâ€™m not suited to tackle.

For now I will spend my days on reddit, drinking tea, sitting outside, and thinking.  

Hopefully a solution will arise in my mind.  If not, I will continue to do nothing.
