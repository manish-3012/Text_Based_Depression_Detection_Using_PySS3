Everything is pointlessEverything is pointless, I take no interest in anything and have no feelings towards anyone. I have friends, sure, but they are nothing. All my interest in hobbies and school as gone elsewhere, I just lay in bed all day or sleep on the bench in the park.  
  
What now? I've done everything I've wanted. I don't feel anything. I'm dead inside. It's been like this for months. The day long train rides to nowhere are getting boring too.  
  
Don't have the balls to kill myself either. I'm in limbo.
