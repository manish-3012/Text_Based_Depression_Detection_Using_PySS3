I almost did itI had to house sit for my older brother over the weekend by myself. Throughout the day I realized Iâ€™ve left my phone charger at home and I started to rummage around my older brothers drawers looking for an extra one. In one of the drawers, he had his pistol in it. And right then and there, I stared at it. Knowing I can end my life in an instant. Itâ€™ll be easy, right? Just pull the trigger. â€œJust pull itâ€, is what I kept telling myself, â€œno one cares, Iâ€™m a bother to others, Iâ€™m better off deadâ€ and â€œthis is it, in a minute from now, Iâ€™ll no longer be aliveâ€

But I realized I couldnâ€™t do it. I broke down shaking and crying. I was afraid because I knew how easy it wouldâ€™ve been had I done it.

And Iâ€™ve come to realize, I have reasons to keep on living...
