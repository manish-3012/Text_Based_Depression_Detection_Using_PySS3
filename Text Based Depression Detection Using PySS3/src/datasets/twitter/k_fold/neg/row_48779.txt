One foot from the edge.I couldn't help but think how easy it would've been. Just step off, lean forward to land headfirst, and it'd be over.

The last four months have just been a litany of failure after failure, disappointment after disappointment. My four-year relationship ends. My advisor (who graciously keeps advising me after I've graduated) tells me I won't have a realistic shot at med school until the 2018 application cycle. 

I'm 24, recently unemployed, living alone in a new area where I don't know a soul, while my parents pay my rent and post-grad tuition so that I can get mediocre grades, all the while lying to myself that I can be a doctor someday.

I had a job interview a few days ago that I thought went well. It was my turning point - great pay, great location, and I had two years' experience doing the exact same thing to boot. The pay would've been significant enough for me to start pursuing hobbies again, being social, doing things! I've battled depression before but was able to get myself out of it by doing just that.

But no word. Second interviews conclude tomorrow. My turning point was an illusion. It's a sign. I woke up this morning after drinking and smoking myself into a stupor so that I could sleep. When I opened my eyes, I'd hoped that this was just some nightmare I'd wake up from. But no, this is my life now.

The next time I find myself up there, drunk and alone, surrounded by nothing but the gorgeous view, I'll just step off, and I won't have to wake up to...this.
