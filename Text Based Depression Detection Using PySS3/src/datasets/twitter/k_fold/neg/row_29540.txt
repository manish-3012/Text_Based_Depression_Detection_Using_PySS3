Question About Recent Suicide AttemptSo recently I tried committing suicide, tell me how much my life matters, it's not going to change me. Anyways, I chose suicide by hanging and went downstairs and used a belt, I slowly stepped off the chair to feel what it would feel like, before I could even register anything I woke up covered in blood laying a very good distance away from wear I tried hanging myself, belt around my kneck and chair way across the room, I had to get 6 stitches in my chin because I had a gash so deep. I'm not sure if I thrashed around and untied the belt by itself or the belt was the thing that cut me.
