I want to sleep and never wake upI used to be that type of girl that never defended or stood up for herself. During the last year I realized that I donâ€™t want to be treated the way I was treated by my parents and older brother. So yesterday I snaped back. My brother hit me and even spit me in my face. He told me that Iâ€™m a 25 year old who didnâ€™t achieve anything in her life and he wishes that I would leave and never come back. My mom said that it was all my fault and that I provoked him to do and say such things. All my dad cares about is me going to university and the fact that I still have no diploma makes him mad. 
My birthday is coming up and all I can think about is to make my brothers wish come true. To leave and never come back. To go to sleep and never wake up again.
