Winding down my last few weeks...I placed an order for the regulator I need for my preferred method. 

It should be here in the next week or two. 

I have a sense of a peace knowing that my time is coming soon. 

I'm dead serious about this. I'm going to make sure I do it right. No "cry for help" for me. 

It's do AND die. 

I don't know why i post in here. The loneliness I guess. It's the only place I can say how I truly feel. 

Every day is a struggle and I'm losing every step of the way. 

I'm just not stable. I'm a problem. I have a terrible reputation and I am my own worst enemy. I can't trust myself. 

I'm so tired. So tired. Nothing brings me joy anymore. Nothing excites me. Everything is tainted by my terrible thoughts. I hate being me. 

No one can help me. No one will ever love me. I'm empty. I'm bored. I'm scared. I just want out.

I wish this thing would arrive tomorrow so I could check out this weekend. I'm so ready to go. So ready.
