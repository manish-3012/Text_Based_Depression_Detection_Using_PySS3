Current discourse on suicide is really unfortunate and not helpfulThe problem (and subs like this add to it) is that society has heavily stigmatized suicide, which is very unfortunate, because people should have a choice in deciding whether or not they want to live. Because of this stigma, anyone who is suicidal knows better than to freely talk about it in an open manner (hence why I made a throwaway account and would never tell anyone) and either freely commit to their choice or get relevant and contextual advice that may give them second thoughts rather than the "see a therapist" garbage that is often spewed by people who do nothing more than virtue signal than offer any real help. Not only does that stop people from talking about it before committing (and possibly providing closure), but it gives validation to attention seekers who actually don't want to commit suicide and have nothing to gain but that attention that these people provide. Both of these elements work against people who are very troubled and truly are considering ending their life in allowing them to give closure to those who are close to them and even seeking better methods of going through with their choice in a way that doesn't hurt others through psychological trauma, lack of closure, etc.

It is easy to see how someone, dealing with serious mental trauma, would not be able to process all of this, and under overwhelming pressure simply take the path of least resistance and let everything work itself out.

I wish suicide wasn't so heavily stigmatized. I wish people were free to discuss ways in which they could give closure to others, better methods which don't inflict pain on themselves or others. I find it ironic that we have "safe injection sites" where people can "safely" destroy themselves with horrible substances in a clean manner, but we don't even allow those who are seriously considering the CHOICE of ending their life to freely and openly discuss it without silencing their choice and forcing them to seek "treatment". I hate that this same method gives validation to attention seekers and makes it even less likely that someone who is genuinely considering suicide to come out.
