I Promised Myself I Would Make this Post."Every single day I think about killing myself, how great it would be, all my problems gone in an instant. Now, I am in therapy for depression, but I don't share those thoughts for fear of being institutionalized, even briefly as a danger to myself. I don't think I'm a danger to myself, I've had those thoughts for quite a while without swallowing pills or a shotgun, so..."

I assume that sums it up. The comment responding to it explained how the person was a happy person, like me, yet was depressed. 

I don't understand exactly what is going on. Ever since about two years ago I've been feeling depressed, I have good days and I have bad days. I feel like everyday though I cannot shake the feeling of my ultimate sadness. I am insecure and I am tired of living. I am the happiest person some people know, and I hate myself for thinking I am depressed and suicidal because I feel like my sadness is not justified because people out there are so much more sadder. My father tripped and hurt himself today. He went to bed early. I care so much about my family that I wanted to hurt myself so he'd feel better. I do that sometimes when I am mad or did bad, I would hit my leg in anger or hurt myself (not cut myself.) When I went to take a shower I just burst out crying. I needed that so bad. My brain is so rattled I can't think. I worry so much about school and grades, I want to kill myself. I want this constant blanket of anxiety to come off me. It has come to the point where I feel numb about it. I want to go to sleep and not wake up. I hate myself, I deserve this, I'm not good enough, I keep telling myself I'd get better but the days go past and I feel walls closing it. I can't even explain it. I tell myself every day before I get out of bed that today will be the day but I'm too much of a coward to do it. The future scares me so much.
