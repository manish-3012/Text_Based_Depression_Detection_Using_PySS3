I don't know how to copeI'm not sure how to put this. My life from the outside seems really awesome. I have a long term boyfriend, I get my school payed for because I get good grades, I have a $12/HR job, etc. I don't know why I'm feeling this way but I always have. I am worthless. I am a sack of shit. I don't deserve my boyfriend, he's so good to me and treats me like a queen. I'm starting to have a hard time keeping up in school. I'm stuck in a car lease for $400 a month and I can't keep up with it while saving as much as possible to finally move out of my boyfriend's house. I'm a fat slob and can't seem to lose weight. I'm always fucking exhausted no matter how much I sleep. I want to drop a class that's causing a lot of stress, but  then I'll have to pay for it, which I can't afford. I'm always sick and I'm pretty sure everyone thinks I'm faking it because I shouldn't be sick this much. Everyone I talk to lately is so unbelievably rude. I've always known what I wanted to do with my life, but I'm starting to doubt everything. I've already put so much time and money into schooling for biology, and now psychology, but people keep telling me a psych degree without med school gets you nowhere. I'm so lost. I'm ready to die. There are no negatives whatsoever to dying except my boyfriend will be upset. I don't want to put that on him, but I'm just done. please help me
