I don't have anything to live forI don't have parents who I would worry about disappointing. I don't have a job or a home that I care about. I've all but given up on my PhD program -- academia is basically a pyramid scheme and there are no jobs in my field anyway. I don't even want the stupid degree anymore; it's caused me so much stress and pain. I grew up in a really poor, abusive household and my whole life has just been me struggling so hard to make a life for myself, only for it to end up being a life that's unlivable. 

I don't have anyone who would notice or give a shit if I was gone, only one person, and I feel like I've fucked that up and am going to disappoint him so much that he won't want anything to do with me. I don't get enjoyment out of anything anymore; all I can feel is the anhedonia. It's just a big fucking hole in the center of my brain and no matter how many times I try to get help and get better, things just get terrible again. 

Like I feel like I have such bad luck that my life is just crisis after crisis and it's been overwhelming for a long time, but I've just given up on even trying to deal with it or make things better now. I thought that going on antidepressants would help, but all they did was take away the panic -- now I'm just looking at my life from a measured, relaxed place, and seeing that it fucking sucks. It's so much fucking work to stay alive and I have nothing. There's nothing that I care about enough to live for.
