What to say to pull them off the edge?Iâ€™m a supervisor. One of my employees has been expressing sheâ€™s having really rough time and mentioned she attempted suicide in the past. She has been emailing me and will give very little information verbally.  She says she doesnâ€™t want to be alive anymore, she hates life, and tonight said she had a plan but was a coward. I sent her a long email telling her how much she improves my life, everyone here, and her kids. We donâ€™t realize the impact we have on people or the lack of her in our lives. she says sheâ€™s tried medication and she doesnâ€™t want to talk to anyone professionally. Iâ€™ve related to her and told her that Iâ€™ve been there and a therapist really helped me out. I called my bossesâ€™ boss and asked for help. He said to make sure she knew I cared about and supported her. Tell her what her options are and phone numbers. Iâ€™ve done that. Legally, in my job, Iâ€™ve done what is required. Thatâ€™s not enough. She sent me a good bye email. I tried talking to her in person but she wonâ€™t, she shuts down. 

I know I canâ€™t say anything to fix it. But what I can I do or say to at minimum, get her off the edge so we can get her help.? I have to do something before she goes home in the morning. She has shut down now and not talking anymore. I need serious help. What would you want someone to say to you to get you to reconsider suicide?
