Secretly hoping I'll OD and dieI'm so depressed. I hate my life. I hate myself. I feel as though nothing is left for me anymore. I'm terrified my boyfriend is cheating on me. That's not the reason I want to die though. It really just adds to it.  

The past month I've gotten heavy into drugs. At first I enjoyed it but now I only do it because I know I could die. I mix them, hoping for a fatal combination. Sometimes it's hard drugs. I just don't want to be here anymore. People try to help and they can't. I won't be happy until my heart stops beating. 

What's most ironic is my mother is in rehab currently.

I don't know why I even bothered writing this. I just wanted to vent I guess. All I want to do is drugs because I hope I die.
