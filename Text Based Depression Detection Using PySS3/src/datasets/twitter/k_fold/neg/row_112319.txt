Why can no one like me?I've never had a friend last more than a little while that wasn't abusive.  I've had one girl ever not reject me and she abused me physically and mentally, as well as cheating on me.  I hate myself, but only because that seems to be the consensus among everyone who meets me. If I had an easy way to end it, I would.
