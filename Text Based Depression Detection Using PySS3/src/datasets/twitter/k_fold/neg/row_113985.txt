My dad tried to take his life yesterday. I havenâ€™t seen him yet, what do I say when I do?Iâ€™m 18 and my dad attempted to take his life yesterday. Heâ€™s in the hospital right now and getting help and hopefully I can see him soon. 

I just feel bad because my parents are going through a divorce and I was being bitter towards him which I shouldnâ€™t have but thatâ€™s the past. I truly do love him though and I want him to know that. 

What are some things I can do and say to express my love without coming off insincere or forced or possibly triggering for him?
