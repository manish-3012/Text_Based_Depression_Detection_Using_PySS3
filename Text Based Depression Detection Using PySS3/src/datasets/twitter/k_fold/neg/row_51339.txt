I'm at the point of my life where I would rather kill myself because it's cheaper to die than liveI'm twenty years old and I have been trying to find a job since January. I have had a few interviews but no job offers. 

My money has run out. I don't have enough money for food. I tried to buy some today at the store but had to put it back. I was so embarrassed.

I feel so pointless right now. I had a interview for a great job but they told me they hired someone else yesterday. 

I can't afford to live anymore and I don't know what to do.
