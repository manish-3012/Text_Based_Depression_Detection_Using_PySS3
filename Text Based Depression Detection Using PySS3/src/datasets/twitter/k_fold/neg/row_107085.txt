Happy to suicidal in 5 months. Iâ€™m nearly there.Iâ€™m sick, and have been for the past 5 months. The disease wonâ€™t kill me and for many people it barely effects their lives, but not me. The doctors arenâ€™t even 100% sure what I have, most likely an autoimmune disease that causes pain. I can deal with pain, but I canâ€™t deal what comes with the disease: never-ending, debilitating, and severe fatigue. Iâ€™ve been dealing with it for 5 months straight and it doesnâ€™t appear to be going anywhere. The fatigue is mental in nature, and makes my mind so so weak. I canâ€™t cope with it and I canâ€™t see myself living with it for the rest of my life. I think about suicide daily, and every day I inch closer to it.   

I donâ€™t know how this happened. Never been depressed before, never been suicidal before, and from the outside I have a great life. I own a business and make good money, I have the best wife and great family support, I have great friends and am well liked. Before getting sick, I was happy, healthy, and motivated. But I see the writing on the wall, eventually my business will dry up since I can barely work, I wonâ€™t be able to provide for my family, my wife will begin to resent me, I already resent myself for becoming ill, I wonâ€™t be able to put in the time and effort to be a good husband and become a good father (which I am not a father yet). Iâ€™ve worked so hard in my life for everything I have and I worked extremely hard to have a good future, and all of it, every single thing I worked for will be destroyed all because I got very unlucky and developed an autoimmune disease and even more unlucky that I experience it worst than others.    

Iâ€™m a logical person and I donâ€™t see the reason to continue living. Iâ€™m only going to bring more pain and suffering to others in my life. My wife doesnâ€™t deserve to have to deal with me being sick forever, thatâ€™s definitely not the life she signed up for. Iâ€™m only going to disappoint her by being unable to do most things. I donâ€™t want to be a burden to anyone, financially, physically, or emotionally. I canâ€™t handle that guilt. I realize that if I die I would cause great pain to many people that love me, but I donâ€™t think it would be selfish for me to do so. On the contrary, I think it would be selfless. If I stay, I would very well be causing pain for others for the rest of their lives, whereas if I go now others can have a chance to move on.
