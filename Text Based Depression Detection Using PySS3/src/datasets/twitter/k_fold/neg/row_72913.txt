School is making me suicidalI just dont wanna be alive because i am forced to try so hard and i stress so much about things that wont affect me in the long run but i will always be stressed about middle school then high school will be worse then college then work and it never stops but all our stress and hard work does is make other people rich and i feel like a peasent just working for everyone else and people will always have high expectations that i cant exceed and they will always be mad and then kids at school are always bullies and never leave you alone and find any reason to make fun of you and nobody does anything about it and i work so hard and stress so much to keep my grades and i just get one C but everyone is mad at me now and i disappointed everyone and whats the point of being alive? The point of always stressing and working so hard is so that i can afford to have a house and live but whats the point of living in the first place when you will work so hard to barely get by and hate life forever why wouldnt you just end it
