I find no joy in life anymore.Im 17, I was smoking weed since the beginning of last school vacation. I never found myself very sociable, but weed helped me and my social life got pretty good. It wasn't abusive use, I bought it when I had money, and wasn't high 24/7 but smoked once a day and it was enough. However around 1.5 months ago my parents found out. They are very anti drug and did not listen to my arguments why It's not bad for me. Since then I don't talk to them, if they don't accept how I want to live my life. My grades in school were good, smoking hasn't influenced my education at all. Recently they started to take my phone and computer for night, which was my only entertainment, since they don't let me go out in the evenings. All the shit makes me very stressed, my life now is only school, and I have less and less motivation to take it seriously. I just don't see point in living. I'm from eastern Europe and there are no opportunities for youngs. I know it all sounds pathetic but that's how it is and every night I think about killing myself. If my parents would be supportive and would let me enjoy my life, then I would be very happy. But that's not the case and it just overwhelms me. Any advice would be appriciated.
