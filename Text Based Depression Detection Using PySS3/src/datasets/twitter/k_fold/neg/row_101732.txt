I feel like a parasiteMy happiness relies mostly on others and it's been this way as long as I can remember being depressed. Some background, I'm a 19 year old woman that has suffered with severe depression and anxiety for almost ten years. I've been really struggling with my mental health especially since I graduated high school in June of 2016. 
I feel like I have no purpose no matter what I end up doing. When you're depressed this long, your interests and ambitions have long disappeared along with your happiness, which fucking sucks. My life is going absolutely nowhere in a job or education sense. 
I've been seeing a man for a few months now, we'd been friends for over two years before this. I love him more than anything but it's so draining because I feel like I'm only existing for him. His life is progressing beautifully and I feel like I'm holding him down. I've fucked up a lot of people's minds in the past when it comes to my suicidal tendencies and I absolutely cannot hurt him like that. It's driving me mad that I have to deal with these emotions day in and day out. 
I feel like I'm wasting his time, and I just want him to be happy. Even if I ended up staying alive I don't think I could fulfill the happiness he deserves. He's the most beautiful and compassionate person I've met in my life and the last thing I want to do is traumatize him. 
I hate being stuck. I wish I could just get in a fatal car accident so no one would feel like they were to blame. Or maybe I'm just delaying the inevitable. Maybe I should just take the plunge. I'm tired of feeding off of people.
