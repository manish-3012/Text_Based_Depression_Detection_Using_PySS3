Guilt is eating me aliveSo a couple of weeks back my mother had an episode because she stopped taking her pills. I cared for her during the whole episode and eventually we had to bring her to hospital.

She was there for about 2 weeks and I didn't visit. I just presumed that my dad was going to let me know when we were going to be visiting ( I can't drive btw). I was on the phone to her a good few times over the 2 weeks to make sure she was OK.

So I ended up not getting to visit her while she was in the hospital and now the guilt is eating me alive and I feel like ending it
