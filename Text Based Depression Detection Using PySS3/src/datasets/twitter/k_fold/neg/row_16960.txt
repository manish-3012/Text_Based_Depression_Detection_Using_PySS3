Not again please I can'tAnother friend of mine is telling they're going to kill themself, what do I do? A lot has happened lately, my mind is full of thoughts, going at lightning speed trying to comprehend everything happening right now, but it can't. I feel like I can't help her, like I couldn't help another of my friends. What do I tell her? I can't think of anything and I don't want to lose another friend. Someone please help me, what do I do?
