this is a post about my problemsThe last few months all i've done is complain about my problems, that's not something I used to do. I've been hoping that someone understands. But everyone keeps saying stuff like "just put more effort in" or "it gets easier" and i don't believe them. I don't believe anyone actually, a simple lie can cause me to go overdrive and think everything I've ever known is a lie. When I mention suicide to my friends they just say "oh, when I fail this test I'll commit suicide" and i hate them for it. I'm not funny anymore, I'm not the kind, trusting person I was. I think I've lost  them as friends although i never was a good friend to them. I'm actually too drunk to write this but oh well. There's only one good friend I've ever had. I can relate to most of the things that have been said on this sub which also makes me sad. There are so many things that go through my head, none of them are positive. I know this post has no stucture, I don't care. I love alternative music. I hate my family. I fucking love gaming. Its like a skip button to me, press button to skip day and i don't have to give a care. I hate responsibility. It's taking me hours to make this post. I hate pop pusic.
