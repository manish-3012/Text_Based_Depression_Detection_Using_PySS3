It looks like Iâ€™ve hit that dark place again where it feels like thereâ€™s only one option left.Recently my lifeâ€™s got even worse than usual, Iâ€™d lost most of the people who I cared about. The one person who kept me going is now gone so I feel like itâ€™s time. Thereâ€™s no reason to keep going anymore.
