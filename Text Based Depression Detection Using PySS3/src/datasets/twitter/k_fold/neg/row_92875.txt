tw rape. life is shittycopy and paste from post before as I feel that I probably posted in the wrong subreddit before

throw away account. cant remember my old throwaway so oops
excuse the grammar ahead of time

2019 was been a shit show

- got raped multiple times by a cousin 

- cousin still in contact with me

- told my parents about the rape as a singular event and they responded extremely poorly (my fault, whore, cousin fucker, I wanted it, I deserve it) and still have him around me

- caught my mom cheating on my dad (hence the divorce)

- almost failed out of nursing school but didnt but lost my scholarship due to my gpa hitting the floor for a C

- new years was shitty 

- parents getting a divorce and throwing me in the middle of it and they're so on again off again

- grandma moved in with parents and constantly calling me having breakdowns over it. granted I'd have breakdowns too if I lived with my parents right now too

- lost a few friends due to me not reporting the rape granted I can see how they feel helpless so I've moved to trying not to talk to people about this stuff and rely on my counselors for that

- gained 20 pounds 

- mom encouraging ED behaviors since weight gain

- mom telling me she wishes she never had me

- had a friend commit suicide 

- shitty roommate situation which thankfully I manage to avoid the conflict but the tension is exhausting 

and now I'm just fed up. 
I've relapsed completely with my bulimia and cutting. flashbacks are out the wazoo and I feel like 75% of my day is me panicking unless I'm binging, purging or cutting. and at this point I'm so exhausted from trying to fight coping like this and feeling like shit on top of shit every day. I'm just so overwhelmed and I feel like nothing is going to ever get better. and if continuoully getting abused is what is in my future then I dont care. I feel so disgusting. even now I feel like I can't breathe properly because i feel like hes here

and I'm trying not to give up solely on the basis of my counselors being super supportive and motivating me but jesus this is so hard

I feel so broken and like damaged goods and like I'll never feel whole again
I dont even recognize myself spiritually, mentally or physically even more

I feel like every part of me has been destroyed and I'm just tired

edit: format and more whining
