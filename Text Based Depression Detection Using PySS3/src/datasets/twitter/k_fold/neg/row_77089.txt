Just another suicidal 19 year oldNever posted on a forum before and I donâ€™t even know if people will respond so I donâ€™t wanna write my entire life story just for no one to see it. Basically Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a long time now and the only thing stopping me from fully committing is that my mom has said to me that if I do it she will do it too. This is the ultimate guilt trip and I have no reason to doubt her as she has bipolar depression just like I do. After a falling out with my father and sister, breakup with my ex, as well as pushing away/ghosting all my friends and extended family, my mom is the only person left that I love so this makes it a tougher decision than it already is. Do I hate myself so much that I would knowingly throw my mothers life away just to end my suffering? Idk where Iâ€™m going with this or what responses I expect to get...
