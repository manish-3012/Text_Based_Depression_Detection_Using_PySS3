What am I even struggling for anymore?Iâ€™m about to begin work and for what? To just stay depressed and lonely and upset but in work and providing for my parents? To go and do the things that Iâ€™ve been doing already but not enjoying for some reason? Itâ€™s all just a massive crock of shit. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m going into work never mind staying alive at all.
