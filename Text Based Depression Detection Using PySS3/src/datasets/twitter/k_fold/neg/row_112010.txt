There is no more happinessI don't have the will to live anymore. My life has been a series of mistakes and bad decisions. I have lost everything, my kids dont like me, my girl is through with me, I am out of shape, I dont sleep well, my teeth are fucked up, I am an alcoholic, I will never be financially stable. I am a bad father, son, friend and partner. 
The will to go on is gone, I can see that now. I am ready to go, but I'm still scared of dying. I don't know how to do it without fail, I dont want to fail at this too. I keep imagining being like steve carrells character in little miss sunshine. 
Im tired. I have no joy left inside me. No one likes me, its why I have no friends. I dont see life improving ever, in fact, it just gets worse and worse. I live in misery. Im not good at my job anymore because I dont care anymore.  The light in my eyes has gone out, I am a walking shell.
