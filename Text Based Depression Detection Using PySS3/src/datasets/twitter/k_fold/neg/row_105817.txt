Bf says hes "not enabling me anymore." Am I being abused?I've been having suicidal thoughts on and off all night with some mild research/planning in between. I do have drugs I could over dose on, but it's not looking to be the ideal option for quick and painless. 

But for now-- I would just like the validation of strangers on the internet. 

My ex (now) and I both have cptsd. We've both done a lot for each other (ive helped him in a shit ton of personal growth like coming out as trans, starting transition, exercise) hes helped me... escape one abusive house in a purple state so i could stay in a slightly less abusive house in a blue state-- but now I'm sure whatever loss in abuse I was experiencing, he picke dup the slack for. 

I have trauma around having being given comfort by someone unwilling, or uncomfortable doing so. 

My ex promised to tell me when he was hurting so I could avoid this situation. He also promised to tell me if i was hurting him or if he had a problem or felt upset with me (a basic relationship necessity).

But this problem has not once been kept. He drops bombs in the middle of fights to control them and make it about himself, so he can avoid criticism and responsibility. He blames me for being unable to tell me when hes upset or hurt, and during our last fight he told me in the middle, yelling, "You traumatize me every time we fight." 

And as I slowly became paralyzed and began to hyperventilate, he complained that I wasn't being fair to him. 

One promise we made to each other was to tell each other when we are planning to commit suicide. I did so. In response, I got this. https://imgur.com/a/hZ1dCLk
He hasn't said a word to me since, and I've never felt more abandoned and unwanted in my life. 
Since then two unrelated friends have talked me out of it, but I haven't quit feeling the punitive desire to kill myself just to fuck him over for how unbelievably cruel that is to say to someone who just admitted they were planning to kill themselves. 

Every day that passes I just feel more hopeless and alone and powerless. I just want to die. It used to seem appealing for no other reason than then, at least it'd make people regret treating me so badly. But the more my life goes on the more I desire it simply so it can be over. I'm past 25, no college and no income, and I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere with yet more abusive people just to survive. I don't want to survive. I want to be happy. But I don't think happiness is possible anymore. 

If this sub can offer any support, please post opinions of what you think of my ex's behavior towards me. I just want my feelings to be acknowledged.
