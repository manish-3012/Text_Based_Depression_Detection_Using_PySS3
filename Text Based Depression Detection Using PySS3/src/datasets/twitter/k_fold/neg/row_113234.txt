Kind of want to dieIm very miserable. I just want to kill myself. I have a history with self harm but I've been clean for probably 2 years now. I am so wildly stressed to the breaking point all I can think about is killing myself every day. I try to tell people "I am not doing well. I really need help. I am so fucking stupid and I have no more self esteem, I am fat and ugly and I hate my body and I cant do anything right." and I just get told "no you're not" i can only fantasize about killing myself again. i wake up and my eyes feel glazed over and my consciousness is shoved back inside my head and it feels like I am simply spectating a body that isn't mine. OH well. What do I do.
