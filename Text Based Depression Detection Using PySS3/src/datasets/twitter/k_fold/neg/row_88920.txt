I just wasn't meant for lifeNothing ever works out. I push everyone way or scare them away by being the screw up I am. I'm too damaged to form proper relationships and just be normal. I hate myself so much. 

If I could just stop being trans, if I could just fix myself, a huge weight would be lifted off of my shoulders. My family rejected me, so I went back in the closet to please them, but I can't do it anymore. Every day I feel like dying. I'm not living as myself. This isn't life. I'll never be myself. I'm sorry. I'm so selfish. Why should my stupid feelings matter? Why should anyone have to respect me? They don't owe me anything. 

I'm a failure. I'll never feel a mother's embrace as she calls me her son, I'll never be my little sibling's brother. I love my family even though I can't change myself enough for them. I don't know why I can't get it through my head that I'm not a man and I can't be. 

I'll just be another stupid girl who killed herself. I'm tired of hurting everyone. I hurt everyone just by existing. 

If I'm myself, I shame and dishonor my family. If I'm a fake version of myself, my mental health is so bad I can't function completely well enough anyway. I hate this so much.

I'm so good at acting now, so good at repressing my feelings. I just wanted to make them happy, for them to accept me. Anything for them. I can't do it. This is the only way. 

My mother, I'm just so sorry. I'll write her something more proper. I'm sorry I couldn't be your daughter. You will be okay. I am truly the happiest I could be this way. 

I can't do this. Writing out notes to family members makes it so much harder. I never cry anymore, but I can feel a bit of tears forming at the thought of leaving my little brother behind. 

It's best for everyone if I go. Maybe I'll get a moment of peace, with nothing wrong. My ashes will be with nature, I hope. 

I wanted more than 17 years of life, but it is enough. I just wasn't meant to be here.
