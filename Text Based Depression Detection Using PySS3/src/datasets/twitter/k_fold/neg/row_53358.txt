little cousin tried killing herself, only wants to see meI received a call from my Uncle that his daughter was taken to emergency last night due to an overdose. She has been discharged from the hospital. Sheâ€™s presenting signs of depression and has had recurring suicidal thoughts over the last few weeks. Sheâ€™s not talking to anyone and only wants to see me. Iâ€™m going to visit her soon but I honestly donâ€™t know how I can make her feel better. Iâ€™ve been in this situation myself many years ago and but I am still not sure whether to ask her to talk about it or just take her out. Any recommendations?
