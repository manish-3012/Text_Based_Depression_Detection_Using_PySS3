I have nothingim stupid, ugly and fat. i have bad grades. i have bpd. no one likes me. i have a toxic mother and I don't feel loved. Im always wrong and my parents don't let me do anything because im fat. My graduation photoshoot and ceremony are coming up and my dad won't let me go because im fat. I dont love myself and no one does either. This isn't fair.
