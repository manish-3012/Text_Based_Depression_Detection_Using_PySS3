I'm not safe and I don't careWell fuck whatever remains of my life. I am too goddamned depressed and hurting from a combination of my adoptive parents (father specifically) being infantile jackasses to my lack of any love life whatsoever to I don't even know what. That I am just fucking done and refuse to go on like this. In two weeks I will hang myself on a nearby bridge and just fucking end it. No more pain or misery and hopefully if my plan works the way I think it will then my neck should snap and I quietly pass and fairly quickly as I won't be able to cut myself down at that point so once I jump that's it no turning back not that I plan to anyway. Thank you to all who have tried to help me through my shit. I don't blame any of you for anything. I love you all but I can't take this crap anymore
