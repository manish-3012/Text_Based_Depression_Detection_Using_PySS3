I've been feeling horrible and I don't see hope.A month ago I went to the train station and stood next to the tracks, too chicken to jump. Some bitch saw me and dragged me away and called the cops... Ever since then I've just wished I had jumped... I know nobody on here actually cares but I just can't take it
