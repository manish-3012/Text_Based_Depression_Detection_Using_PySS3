The only way out is through pain.For some background, I myself am suicidal now and speak from experience.

Our problems wonâ€™t fix themselves. It wonâ€™t just magically get better through time. We have to fix it, and to do that we must endure the pain and go through it. Iâ€™m tired of hearing people say it will just â€œget betterâ€ as if it will fix itself. For most of us it will just get worse if we donâ€™t do anything about it. 

It can be more than worth it on the other side if we go through that pain though. Itâ€™s the only way to end our pain now and live a life worth living.

Best to you. These are my thoughts; disagree at will.
