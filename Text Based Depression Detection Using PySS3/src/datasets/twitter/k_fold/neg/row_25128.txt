What is the point of surviving?That's all I'm doing. Surviving. Existing. Merely going through the necessary processes to 'live' on a biological level.

Every person must find their own way. But what of those that have given up the journey? You can't make me walk, you can't change my neurochemistry.

You can't find my reason to live for me.

But I can't find it for myself.

I sought respite in selfless service and found it to be unsatisfactory. I sought respite in expressing myself artistically and through creative endeavors and soon it all went gray. I keep seeking, even if it's only small steps for one simple reason.

If I snuff out my own light, I better have exhausted my ideals. I better have walked many paths to dissatisfaction before deciding there is no purpose or ideal that can galvanize me to live.

Life should be about living, not surviving.
