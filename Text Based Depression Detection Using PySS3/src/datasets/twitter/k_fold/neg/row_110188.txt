i need to say somethingi need to say something and I'm going to submit this first and then edit it so I can be sure I actually submitted something even if it's just this.

edit 1:  Ok now I have submitted something.  I have problems reaching out to people.  it feels like I can't say anything, I mean I dunno.  

edit 2:  if I say something it's going to be dramatic right?  and no one wants drama so I shouldn't say anything.  my mom who I live with or she lives with me doesn't want me to talk about the stuff that goes on in my head because she says I wouldn't want her to talk about the things that she deals with in her head? ok.

edit 3:  i just need to keep typing and saying something.  it's just i need to I dunno.  Ok I feel better after having said some stuff.  Like I feel like I'm not in the right situation, I'm going to college but I don't have a goal here, I don't even really want to be here, I'd like to try a trade but I don't feel like I can do anything because I'm dependent on a trust that supports me only if I am in school or working and they've been hard to work with, and I need to submit bills to them that are overdue by now, but I don't want to submit one of them because it relates to being trans and the trust managers are based in arkansas which is a conservative state even though the trust is supposed to take care of my medical expenses.  it's always hard for me to do anything with them.  and somehow they messed up my insurance application which i offered to do for them because it would be a lot easier but they wanted to do it so now I don't have health insurance.  and the therapist I was going to I don't really want to go to anymore, I forgot that I had an appointment yesterday and when I called her then she called me back, I felt a little bit like I was being chastised I mean yeah I did forget to go to the appointment and there's no point in making appointments if I don't go to them.... ugh

edit 4:  ok so some of that stuff is now on the internet and I never put that on the internet before so now it's there in case someone wants to hurt me in the future and they figure out that this profile is connected to my real identity.  oh well I have to get it out somehow.  it's killing me not talking to anyone, it's really hard, it's like I can't really connect with anyone, I'm just a faker, it feels like.  and like pretty much every day is just wake up and struggle through the day.  every class which is three days a week is incredibly boring and I've already failed.... thre semesters at two different colleges now.  i just don't feel lined up for school, i did well up until about 9th grade, everyone was always telling me how smart I was but it feels like lies, like I don't see any proof for it, I haven't contributed in any way to the real world, I haven't created any wealth or improved anyone's life, so... I dunno.

edit 5:  man there are a lot of thoughts swirling through my mind, there is a lot, uh, I guess I don't have as bad a need to say something... man my mom keeps telling me you're getting better!  you're better than you were!  and i mean I guess yeah after i came back from my first college and then i lived with her and my dad for a year and that sucked badly and then the trust came into effect after my great aunt who i had mixed feelings toward died and my mom I dunno, she said I had a concussion and I disagreed and there was a therapist my dad and I saw and we agreed I should try to move away and I told the trust that I had a concussion and so I was going to get concussion treatment at the local hospital, and so I'm here on a lie and then I'm settled here because now that I've been in this state for a year I qualify for lower cost tuition, I guess.  and my mom is living with me because... i dunno maybe she has a reality distortion field more insidious than my dad's I mean she has no income, she's been working on these lawsuits where she was supposed to get a big inheritance from her dad but some relatives didn't feel she deserved it and stole it for themselves and she's my only source of info on it so she could be lying... but I mean she files the papers and such and it keeps proceeding, and it wouldn't proceed if she was wrong I guess... still.. I feel like I'm doing a lot to support her and the only real reason I have to do that besides "she's my mom" which at this point isn't very strong to me is that there's this promise that if I support her, it'll improve the odds of her winning the lawsuit(s) and getting that money, and that'll make sure she's safe and I'll get a benefit from the security having a suddenly wealthy mom would be uuuggghhh, it feels so weird and wrong, and I'm taking my life in a direction I don't want to go because of her, I'm sort of lying to the trust, and depleting it a lot faster than I would really like to to support her, and spending it in ways I would rather not. god it feels so weird, these are not problems that anyone deals with, i mean who has a trust and also has a litigious justice-boner inheritance-cheated no-income disabled parent, or something.

edit 6:  well anyways, there's that, and it feels like scraping on in school and misusing my trust is enough to sustain me and my mom for a while, and it makes me complacent, so I don't get out to do anything, because I don't REALLY have to, but I really should.  And I feel horrible because it's just, ridiculous, this is where I start getting flashes of shit like winding up homeless (kind of again), I mean I guess it's what's going to happen unless I do something or my mom puppets me to do something.  

edit 7: and over all this I feel really ashamed.  I should do something.  but every time I think about something like that I get afraid.  and I see that like I'm not going to do anything, and I'm only going to wind up doing something when whatever stupid reward mechanisms work in my brain say I should do something, and it'll be too late and things will start falling down, and it'll lead to a spiral of me doing dumb shit and then eventually.. I dunno, something.  well then again that's what young 20's people do right is stupid shit?  and I do in fact have a proxy "parent" to bail me out sort of in the trust.  if I don't abuse their trust too badly. (a-ha-ha)

edit 8:  well I feel numb now.  I feel like I'm afraid of whatever someone's going to comment on this.  Like this is a really weird writing style and the content is dumb.  But I guess the evidence is opposite, so far, thanks for the kind comments, er.  all two of them.  yeah... I mean maybe that is why I'm afraid of saying something, and why it's so hard for me to say things, is I'm really afraid of what I say being meaningless and just a drain on someone's time.  or like... there's also this paranoia that whatever I say, is fake, or whatever they say, is fake.  like... if someone says something nice and encouraging, that means I can't trust it because why would someone say that without some sort of manipulative intent behind it?  oh and then:  but what if that way of thinking, and then saying it out here, is some sort of attention seeking?  what I'm just wanting to parade my weird ass thinking out here and then dare people to not laugh at me or something?  and then someone does and I'm just an idiot?  man I really drive myself up some bizarre chains of logic!

edit 9:  well that was... I, a little nice, I wrote out of my head instead of for someone else's.  like a lot.  You know I used to write a lot on a weird forum for people who believed in the UFO angels coming to save us in 2012 or some shit.  Basically I argued against them.  I was really into the paranormal for a while.  But skeptical at the same time.  I met a few really good friends on there who had paranormal experiences but were also skeptical.  I don't talk to them very much anymore, a couple of them I do a bit, it's just that writing in this way kinda reminds me of when I wrote on there.  That was the last time I ever actually made any friends.  Well I need to sleep for tomorrow, cause school y'know, I'm completely unprepared for English tomorrow, and economics is boring since I've had three intro econ classes already... Even though there's this econ theory I really want to geek out with someone about.  Probably may or may not could check this again and write more, maybe tomorrow too.  Or something.  Maybe I'll do this again, I mean it's probably not frowned upon right?  Well gnight.
