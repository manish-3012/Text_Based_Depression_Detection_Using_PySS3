Please help. I feel devastated.I feel so burdened by my mistakes and countless traumas. , i have always been completely alone, I was literally raised by the tv. I never saw my parents, my mom was working 24-7 and my dad didnâ€™t took responsibility and left. I grew up completely alone and confused. When I was 15 I tried to take my own life. I had a drug induced psychotic episode in front of my family when I was 16. This caused me PTSD and OCD, I lost my hair in pieces because of this. I am exhausted of being always alone  completely exhausted of myself and my stupidity I canâ€™t stand myself no longer, I always tried to be the best person possible but all my life went to hell. I am completely abandoned with no work or direction. I donâ€™t want to continue living but I also donâ€™t have the balls to take my own life.
