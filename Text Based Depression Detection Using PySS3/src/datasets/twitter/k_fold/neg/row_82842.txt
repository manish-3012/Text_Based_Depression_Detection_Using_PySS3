whatâ€™s wrong with mei used to be happy and cool. i was popular and could talk to everybody without problems. 

now i canâ€™t talk to girls. i have literally never held hands with a girl. a girl has never gone out of their way to even talk to me unless itâ€™s asking to copy my homework or something. why am i so pathetic.

whatâ€™s so wrong with me that nobody even looks in my direction. i know i donâ€™t deserve to have women love me, but getting no recognition really hurts. i donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s so bad about me.

it just makes me think that everybody else hates me as much as i hate myself, which i guess is relieving because i know that iâ€™m right in hating myself.

ik i sound like an uncle iâ€™m not trying to, itâ€™s just hard for me to express how i feel. i donâ€™t blame anybody but myself, i just want to know what i can do so i can finally get some sort of attention before i inevitably kill myself.
i just donâ€™t want to die a kissless loser with no friends
