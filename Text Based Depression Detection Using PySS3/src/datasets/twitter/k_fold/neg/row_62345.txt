Waking up for school everyday is killing me.Everyone there is mean and nasty. The entire place is toxic, and How i've survived over 14 years of this I can't even comprehend. 

My only way out is Drinking, I drink on the weekly because its the only thing that makes me happy. I have no friends, I have no interests that I want to pursue.

My parents tell me, "Some people would give everything to have education." Not in my case. I used to barely attend but the welfare officer got involved, so now I attend everyday and have for two years.

The days are a blur at this point. If you want to hear my schedule, its literally.

1.Wake up.
2.Go to school
3.Endure insults, and overall hell.
4.Go home
5.Enter bedroom, lay on bed and debate hanging myself for a good 50 minutes.


The high point of my week is when i get to drink my spirits on a friday.

I'm seriously not seeing the point in going on much longer. please help me
