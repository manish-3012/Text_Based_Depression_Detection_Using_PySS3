This isn't a cry for help but a question I'd like you to look at.Have you ever felt like you were faking it? 

Has there ever been something to happen to make that feeling stronger? 


Here's a bit of info into why I ask this. I've been suicidal for about 2 years now. Sometimes I doubt myself and think I'm pretending but then I tell myself. There's no way I'm faking it. Who would go to such lengths of hiding it from everyone and actually attempting suicide. Who would cut their thighs and hide it and not tell anyone if they were faking. 

I ask this because today my girlfriend broke up with me and I'm actually happy for once. Like genuinely happy. I haven't felt this way in sooo long. After she broke up with me I was broken but it gave me the motivation to want to better myself. I picked up my laptop and started teaching myself JavaScript. Something I've been dying to do but never had the will. Her breaking up with me seems to have kick started me into the right direction to improve and make myself more desirable. 

Maybe today was just a good day and I'll start to decline again. I hope not. I want to continue this and beat my depression.
