I found the light at the end of the tunnelSo I recently got out of my suicidal depressed rut and I'm not sure whether my depression is seasonal or not, but with my new job being the next step up to the career path I'm trying to walk things have been looking up for me. I'm gonna unsub from this sub-reddit because it kinda makes me sad but I genuinely hope that all of you somehow find your way out whether it be dying at peace or finding a good way to live out your life (hopefully the latter) because I know earth can be hell and it really feels like a punishment a lot of the time, and to be quite frank I still almost believe that earth is a place in hell but I hope your souls can find a way to make the best of it :)

Might be back next winter but until then, my best wishes!
