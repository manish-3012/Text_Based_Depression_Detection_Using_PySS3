Sometimes I just want to die from the pressureSometimes I just want to die from the pressure

So all my life, Iâ€™ve been a very feminine girl. That was very convinient for me in terms of societal roles. Though I was very passionate about my hate of gender roles and didnâ€™t want them to exist. I knew they were just constructs that werenâ€™t â€œrealâ€ so to say, and I found them so dumb and didnâ€™t understand why people didnâ€™t question them, were ok with them and just followed them. I come to discover 2 months ago that I am not cis.

Oh, that makes a lot of sense now...I actually am a very femenine boy. So thatâ€™s why I hated gender roles so much. The only masculine things about me would be the flat chest and male genitalia that I want and my male pronouns, literally those are the only things.

Now, I really dislike being called and seen as a girl, but I prefer to stay in the closet because I feel the pressure to be masculine and the expectations that come with being male would be way worse for me. I feel all this pressure and discomfort towards society no matter what gender Iâ€™m seen as. Even if people knew Iâ€™m a boy, they probably wouldnâ€™t even consider me one because they think feminine immediately and undeniably equals the female gender. Thereâ€™s no other way around it in their heads. This is even worse and stronger in my culture, Iâ€™m latino. Most people donâ€™t even accept gay people here (which I also happen to be), much less trans people. There are hate crimes committed against us and the authorities do nothing.

Someone could tell me I could move to the US or whatever but since Iâ€™m latino, thatâ€™s terrifying. I way be white passing to some people, but I want to live with my sister whoâ€™s not. 

I just feel like thereâ€™s very little people in the world that would truly see me and accept me as I am. That makes me feel depressed, Idk if Iâ€™ll ever be able to truly be myself.
