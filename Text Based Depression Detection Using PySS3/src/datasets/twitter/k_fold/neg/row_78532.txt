i... i dont really have anything. my life is worth nothing to everyone, and something to nobodyi posted a comment somewhere around here 2 months ago, as a last ditch effort to see if i could ever get the help i need from someone. but no, someone came, said they wouldnt leave, then left when they realized i was serious about suicide and didnt want to be friends with me when i eventually died bc it would be too much for them. so pro tip, if u dont like negativity or the thought of death then fucking this subreddit alone. i dont care how nice u are or if u want to help. if you cant handle these things then youll only make it worse. well now im back to being alone,no job or future, no friends or family, in a country that kills all hope. and im back to my original plan from before. and idk what to do now except wait for that moment where i lose my sanity for long enough to actually do it
