Making final preparationsThird post (thank you by the way to the person who reached out to me last time)

As the title states, Iâ€™m basically making my final rounds and tying up loose ends. Got confirmation today that my healthcare application for myself (who cares) and my kid went through and weâ€™re covered retroactively as of September 1st so thatâ€™s good. Iâ€™ve been out of a job since the summer and we lost our healthcare. I used to be a city employee so I filed the paperwork today to remove my funds from my retirement plan and updated my beneficiary to her name since itâ€™s going to take time for the funds to be sent anyway.  Her Halloween costume has been delivered to our house so thatâ€™s good too.

Tried reaching out to my ex but heâ€™s done with me. I texted him that I just really wanted a hug but I didnâ€™t tell him about my plans. Attempted to slice my radial artery yesterday afterwards but it was way too painful. I was a cutter for over a decade before I had my daughter and several years ago got a tattoo to cover my self harm scars. Ironically, thatâ€™s the arm I went for yesterday, so now there about a three inch cut over the tattoo. 

Today has been eerie sort of calm, like Iâ€™m on autopilot. Basically went on a wild goose hunt for a book Iâ€™m never going to read but I just wanted the satisfaction of putting it on my shelf and adding it to my Palahniuk collection. I own everything heâ€™s ever released. 

A homeless woman approached me at shake shack and asked for money I offered her a meal instead and she accepted. The guy behind the counter said I had a beautiful soul. (Funny thing is Iâ€™m basically a shit person and if I had never cheated on my ex I wouldnâ€™t be here to begin with.) 

I gave away a swipe on the subway to someone else who was asking and helped two people with directions on the subway when usually I just say â€œIâ€™m not sure sorryâ€.

The comment from the guy behind the shake shack counter has really stuck with me today. Iâ€™ve kinda always lived a double life I guess. I used to work with children in poverty and in crisis. My former colleagues would probably say I was a kindhearted and giving person. I always went above and beyond for the students I helped, even offering some of them my time after graduation to help them with school work in high school. I fed them, clothed them. Organized a thanksgiving meal for them every year because many of them wouldnâ€™t have had one at home.

Before I worked with children I worked in grand central station and often provided the homeless population there meals. One thanksgiving I prepared a meal for my staff, many who didnâ€™t have family of their own which is why they offered to work the holiday to begin with. After we closed the store that night we made plates for the homeless and served them. Those people would probably also say Iâ€™m some great person.

I just donâ€™t understand why I can be such a â€œgoodâ€ person to complete strangers and yet I did such a horrible thing to my ex. I have BPD and spiraled and cheated several times. He doesnâ€™t believe I have BPD he says Iâ€™m a sociopath or a narcissist and essentially all cluster b types are the same thing.

Sometimes he messages me saying that Iâ€™m a worthless whore and that everyone we know knows thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m good for. Thatâ€™s what I mean by living a double life. Any colleague Iâ€™ve had in the past would attest that Iâ€™m one of the most selfless people they know. However to my ex and people I grew up with Iâ€™m just a selfish whore that isnâ€™t good for anything else. 

Lifeâ€™s weird huh? 

I know we arenâ€™t supposed to discuss methods here, Iâ€™ve already mentioned I live in a big city, I considered going by means of public transportation but I donâ€™t want to ruin anyoneâ€™s commute or end up on social media, which in this day and age would be almost certain. But Iâ€™ve got my plan and fingers crossed itâ€™ll happen so quickly people wonâ€™t have time to pull out their phones and Snapchat it. 

I guess at this point Iâ€™m rambling. So I probably should just go. I donâ€™t really know what else to say. But thanks for listening.
