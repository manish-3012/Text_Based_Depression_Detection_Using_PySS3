Male; mid-late 20â€™s; no college degree; no skills; no friends; unemployed for 4 years; physical, neurological, and emotional handicaps.Iâ€™ve been in therapy all my life, have tried every prescription under the sun, and been institutionalized twice. 

I canâ€™t get the right help (not even sure what it would be at this point), and canâ€™t form any relationships or build any kind of life for myself.

Every day my life just gets worse and see no road to recovery or how anything will ever improve for me. I donâ€™t understand why I even keep waking up and Iâ€™m not sure how much longer I can.
