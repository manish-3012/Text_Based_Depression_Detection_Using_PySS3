Why notNever really had the balls to post it. Why is my brain so fucked up? It not like everyone has to suffer like this. My friends aren't like this. My family isn't like this. Isn't it convenient that there's a window right beside my bed? I can just roll to my right and all my problems will just disappear. I won't have to worry about the lows. And who even cares about the highs. I'm sick of it all of it it's fucking stupid. 

I need to stop touching acohol... I don't often but man it always fucks me. I can't even tell how much I'm screwed and how much I'm just making up in my head. I'm always to ashamed and I don't want to bother anyone. Nobody knows how bad it is. Nobody knows about the time I just stood at the edge of roof just standing there thinking how easy it would all be to just fucking jump. Right after my cousins wedding too. 

I'm a fucking failure. Nothing in my life is even going wrong right now. What the fuck is supposed to keep me going. The only thing that's kept me alive is the fact that I don't want to make my friends and family feel shitty. What the fuck am i supposed to do?

Sorry for such a long post
