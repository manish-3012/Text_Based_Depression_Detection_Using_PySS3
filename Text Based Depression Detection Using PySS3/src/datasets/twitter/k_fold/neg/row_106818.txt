Should I kill myself if I am stupid and useless to humanity?This question has been weighing on me for a while, actually. I'm not very smart and seem to be quit useless (I clean toilets for a living; my job is rather unimportant). I don't really see how I can benefit society. I keep hearing smarter people lament stupid people in large numbers saying how they ruined the world. So, would it be morally right for me to just die so that humanity can get better?
