I really don't know how to title this.I've attempted suicide twice in my life. To this day I still think it would be easier to just end it. I know I should get help and probably be on meds. But the thought of telling anyone this in person just terrifies me. 

I can't even keep a job because a couple months in all I start to do is think of how I'm going to fudge things up and I just end up feeling physically sick. It's like I'm broken and can't be fixed.

My life is falling apart and I'm pretty much homeless. The thought of being on the streets again has been making me contemplate it even more. I have no control over my own life anymore and honestly I'm scared.

I have no clue why I'm sharing any of this and heck it probably won't make any sense when read and for that I'm sorry. Bye
