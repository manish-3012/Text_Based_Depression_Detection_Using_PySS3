I should've gotten cancer instead of my auntMy aunt loved life more than anyone I know. Every day was met with a smile, a new adventure, something to look forawrd to, even on her deathbed she was smiling as long as she could. She never once complained that this awful disease was taking away her comfort, her ability to walk, her ability to talk, literally everything from her.

She's been gone for almost 4 months and life is so much darker without her, no one is the same, nothing feels the same, nothing feels worth it.

I just wish it would've been me. I don't value my life, I'd give it to her in an instant if given the option, she brought so much joy and laughter to others, its not fucking fair that she had to die and I'm sitting here, healthy, wishing every day for some kind of accident or disease to take me out so I don't have to do it myself. She didn't deserve the untimely end she was dealt, and I don't deserve the healthy body I was given.

I've reached out to my boyfriend, friends, and family looking for support, I've either been left on read or given an "I'm sorry" before being left on read. I'm running out of steam and its growing increasingly obvious that I would be less of an inconvenience six feet underground.
