At least she told me how she feltIâ€™m a junior in highschool. Iâ€™ve been suffering from Major Depressive Disorder for three years, and its gotten worse to the point where i can barely haul myself out of bed. My mother doesnâ€™t understand it. She never did.

I stay home from school only when iâ€™m physically ill or on the verge of an emotional breakdown. Today it was the former. I wanted to stay home because i couldnâ€™t breathe well and had a killer headache among other things. When i contacted my mother to suggest i stay home she informed me that she believes i am a failure, who will never get accepted into any sort of college and who will most likely just drop out to stay home all day, among other things. 

I feel so broken right now. Iâ€™m ready to give up life because I already feel like im going to amount to nothing. Not even my mother thinks highly of me. Iâ€™m ready to leave.
