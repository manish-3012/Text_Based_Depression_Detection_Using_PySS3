cant remember the last day i havent daydreamed about dying.i grew up a normal child, was a few inches shorter than everyone else, but that didnt matter. now im 19 years old and can rarely find a girl that is my height or shorter. ive got my friends, and we lift, but i can tell deep down they think im a joke. the only time ive been complemented by a friend in the past year is when we were drunk ontop of a parkade talking about suicide. after that night he saw me in a different way. im in school but ive got no direction. they tell you to network network network or you wont get a job, but i havent even started to do that and dont know how. ive got a sister who is shorter than me but of course guys love that so shes got a boyfriend whos got everything in his life, and ive got nothing but items. even after a great night i imagine killing myself to end my life on a high note. i dont think i could actually do it as this point in my life, as everyone i know would be confused. i sometimes fantasize about being hit by a drunk driver and dying on the side of the street, or some other way of dying without the guilt that comes with suicide. just wondering if anyone else feels has these thoughts? i know they arent healthy but i love the idea of dying. back to sleep.
