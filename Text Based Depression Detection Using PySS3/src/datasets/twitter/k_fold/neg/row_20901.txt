I just don't care anymoreSo here I am, 25 years old, been married for almost 3 years and been out of the military for about 2.5 years. Lately I've just been losing interest in doing anything. I've stopped caring. I spend every day of every week of every month in constant pain in both my back and knees. I don't even care about getting my monthly allotment of painkillers or my occasional adderall, which hasn't been giving me the usual feeling of energy and happiness anyway. My wife always finds a reason to start and argument and is constantly saying how she wants a divorce, something which I again just don't care about anymore. The more I think about it, the more tempting it is to just put a .357 through my skull. I've been fighting with these kinds of thoughts for over half my life. I've never been good enough, and have always been working at being a failure. I just don't know what to do. As I said, I don't and can't care about a single fucking thing.
