Should I quit my job and leave?Late 20's, male, and extremely bored of life. I don't do much of anything besides work and sit around watching YouTube and playing video games. I don't really have friends, definitely no girlfriend. I feel like I have wasted the prime of my life and haven't really "lived." I have had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember but it was never really serious until now. I'm approaching 30 and haven't done anything with my life. I should be married with kids by now... not even close. It's time for a major change.

I have been thinking for a while now about quitting my job and traveling until I get tired of it or run out of money. I have saved up quite a bit so I think I should be able to go for a while. I haven't seen the whole US so I first plan on taking a solo road trip and seeing every state and all of the sites along the way. Then possibly head abroad. 

The plan is to get a camper shell for my truck and sleep in the bed, take showers at my gym which has locations everywhere, and make food as much as possible to keep it on the cheap. 

If I choose to do this it will probably be around March when the weather is nice everywhere so there is still plenty of time to plan, or back out...

I don't really know what to expect from this adventure but I figure I've got nothing to lose at this point. Maybe I will meet some cool people, maybe I will see some cool stuff, or maybe not. All I know is that my current situation isn't cutting it and I need to do something or I am going to end up jumping off a bridge.

Am I crazy for wanting to do this? Anyone have any tips?
