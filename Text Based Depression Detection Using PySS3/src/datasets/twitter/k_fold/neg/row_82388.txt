Looking for advice on depressed friend, but we're long distance now.My friend Bill started going out with a close friend of ours Sarah. They broke up after 3-4 months (this was around March). For 2 weeks after this, Bill was extremely down. He never responded when we would try to hang out. Another friend of ours Liz went to go see him. He lives in a single apartment by himself. Bill would never respond to me, but Liz would regularly reach out to him and he would respond. She was the only person who ever was with him when he was in depressed mode. After 2 weeks, he seemed back to normal and all was good. He would hang out with us like normal. Then about 6 weeks ago, communication stopped. He kept talking to Liz sporadically and she told me he was now worse than ever. He doesn't respond to anyone but her. We're all college students so we're all at our own homes now and none of us live near each other. Bill is at home with his parents, but supposedly there has always been a disconnect between them because they are hard about his grades and never approved of him dating.

Liz has no clue what to do and says he really needs to talk to a therapist. He hasn't responded to me since the time he seemed back to normal. Bill confided in Liz to know that she would be the only friend that would know how bad he was feeling. As far as anyone else is supposed to know, he just hasn't been around to hang out. I don't know if there is something I can do. If I reach out, he would lose trust in Liz and she seems like the only person he has to talk to. If I do nothing, he might fall deeper into depression.

His parents know that he is depressed but I don't know what they're doing about it. What should I do? Just keep trying to communicate with him (not about his depression), reach out, or just let it handle itself?
