I want to break my legLast night I fell on accident but it felt so good. I slipped and banged my leg and head against the wall, and it sounds crazy, but it felt amazing. I mean, I was limping a bit, and had a migraine, but it just, felt, wonderful.

I know it would hurt to have a broken leg but I want to break it. I've been wanting to kill myself because there's no other way out and I figured something out. Pain is what I need.
