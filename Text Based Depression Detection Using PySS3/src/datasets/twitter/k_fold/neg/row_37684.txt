I have no reasons to liveI just want to die. I have no reasons to live. It's either I kill myself, or run away. And if I run away, I'd probably just die a slow death. So there aren't many reasons to live now. I'll live and die in pain. It's better to get it over with than live in pain. If I tell anybody, I'll go inpatient again. I can't let that happen. Please have fun and be happy with your lives that matter. Mine doesn't, and I've realized that over time. Please be happy and please notice the positive things in life. Nothing matters to me anymore. I want a grandeur way of suicide. Then I'll matter. Please be happy. I wasn't happy, so please be happy.
