I just did thingsI'm not sure if I'm proud or disappointed, relieved or stressed. I'm not even feeling that suicidal. I never really wanted to do this, maybe because I was afraid, but I guess it's kind of like a pain killer. The cuts are tiny, I cleared them with soap and wiped them out so that the scabs aren't too visible. Pretty good job I think, looks just like a standard cat scratch. At least now I can say I'm doing something for myself aside from whining inside like a little pussy that I actually am.
