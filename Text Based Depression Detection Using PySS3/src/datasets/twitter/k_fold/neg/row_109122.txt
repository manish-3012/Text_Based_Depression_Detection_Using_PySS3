Is it better to keep living to just become a failure?Right now I'm reasonably successful. I think my parents are proud of me, and I have a good, well-paying job. And I'm not happy at all. I keep screwing my life up. I'll keep being a failure until I'm fired, and then everyone will see me die in disgrace. Isn't it better if I just end it all now, so at least their last picture of me is as a success? I'll hurt them either way, and at least this way is fast.
