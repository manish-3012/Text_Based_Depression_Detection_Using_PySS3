I get such huge moodswings that I feel suicidal!Honestly I canâ€™t take it. It doesnâ€™t have to be about something big or anything at all, I might see a girl and then I start feeling really down because I feel like Iâ€™ll always be alone or that Iâ€™m a freak for looking at her, or I just start feeling sad for no reason. It just comes over me like a cloud, it has ruined my life for years, I just want it to go away, I want to feel stable and normal for once!
