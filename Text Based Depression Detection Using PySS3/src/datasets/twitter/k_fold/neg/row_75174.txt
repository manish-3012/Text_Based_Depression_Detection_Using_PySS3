I don't want to kill myself butI also dont want to be alive. That's different right? I have no way to explain it other than that I want to go to sleep and not have to wake up to the realization again. Sleep is the only place I'm not sick to my stomach and crying and when I wake up it's like I realize he had sex and a relationship with someone else and nothing can change that...he's made it part of our story. I gave him my virginity and he took mine and the end of this month is our 20 year anniversary. We have three kids. All I ever wanted to be is a wife and mom and I suck at both because he says I'm too hard on the kids and I didn't have enough sex, but then I started having tons of sex and trying every new thing and he said he was so happy with our relationship and then he told me and the kids he was going to Seattle for work but he went to visit his Internet whore.  He said he didn't intend to end it, she was fun on the side and he was going to let it run it's course and hoped shed back off before moving to be near him. All the while he's pumping me full of semen and telling me he's never been happier in our marriage.  How do I get the thought of him screwing this piece of shit loser (she knew he was married with kids but she has no friends and no integrity obviously) out of my mind? He wants to do whatever it takes for me to forgive him but how? I can't navigate this, I don't want to face it. I JUST want to sleep but it's the one thing I can't do(that and eat) I have prescription stuff from the dentist and I want to take enough to knock me out for a long long long time but I don't want to end up dead. My kids act like they love me and I know they don't deserve to deal with a mother that took her own life but the physical grief is so strong that if I didn't have them I'd have done it yesterday. How can I escape my life for a while without ending my life?
