wish I could die in my bed and never wake upall friendships and relationships are like this: you provide entertainment for them, they provide entertainment for you in return. if they dont give back then you aren't friends with them. 

I just want someone to care about me. wish I could rant to someone and still have them respond to me, wish they wouldn't act awkward and weird about it and start distance themselves from me. understand me, I wish someone understood me, I wish someone was cool and wanted to be my guide in life. or maybe I just want someone to care about me and talk to me about my problems. 

I hate how joking around is the only form of social interaction people wanna talk to me for. I hate my mum for being so needy and constantly begging for my attention or for me to visit her, then judging the way I act, every single detail, forcing me to correct myself into a socially acceptable human fucking being. 

I hate acting all the time just to make other people want to talk to me. I have no energy left. the only thing helps is abusing alcohol and then talking shit to people online cuz I can't be bothered to be nice anymore. my appetite for the past month was 0. 

all I want to do is fucking stay in my bed and die there.
