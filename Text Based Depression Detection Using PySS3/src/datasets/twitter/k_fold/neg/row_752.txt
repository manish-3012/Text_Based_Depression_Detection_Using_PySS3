Iâ€™m not good enough and I never will be.I hope Iâ€™m posting to the right subreddit, not sure exactly where to put this. 

I will never be good enough for anyone. Iâ€™m a failure. Iâ€™ll never do anything worth while in my life. Iâ€™m constantly getting yelled at and pushed around and no one understands what it does to me. My entire life Iâ€™ve been left by people, my biological parents, my adoptive dad, my step dad, my ex boyfriend. Friends come and go like crazy and no one seems to want me. I do everything to make people happy, to make people stay, but they donâ€™t. Iâ€™m in university, not doing well and tracking on a dead end degree. My weeks are the same, dragging through classes and drinking it all away on the weekends. I donâ€™t see a future. Iâ€™m tired of people telling me, itâ€™ll get better, keep trying, find new hobbies! Iâ€™m bad at everything. Iâ€™m a piece of shit. Iâ€™ve been self harming for the past seven years but Iâ€™ve never gone deep enough. I donâ€™t have access to any pills. I donâ€™t know how to kill myself but I donâ€™t see another way. I try to find little things to make me happy but once I close the door to my room and Iâ€™m all alone, none of it was enough. I always end up feeling empty and alone. No one is gonna wanna be with me, Iâ€™m depressed and negative. Iâ€™m not particularly attractive and the people who do show interest only want a quick fuck. I just want someone to want me but who would ever want me?
