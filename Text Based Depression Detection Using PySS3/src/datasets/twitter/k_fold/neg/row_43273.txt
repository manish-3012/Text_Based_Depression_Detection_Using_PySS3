I'm strangely calm todayI feel like my life's gotten progressively worse every passing year. Really toyed with the idea of suicide after I found out I got cheated on. It's been almost 3 months now. There was a time when I laid out the plan in detail. I think about dying before going to sleep. It's just so calming. I'm not even afraid. I feel like it's just going to be another task that I do that day. 

What a strange calm day today. Weather was fine, wasn't very cold.
