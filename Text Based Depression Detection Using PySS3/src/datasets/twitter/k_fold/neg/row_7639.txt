Planned death date on my birthdayMy birthday is very very close. Iâ€™m turning 18. I feel like such a burden and Iâ€™m so done living and feeling hopeless. Nothing in my life is going right nor has it been going right for the past few years. Everyone tells me being 18 will be great for me and Iâ€™ll feel much better, but itâ€™s just another year of misery. Iâ€™m about to graduate high school and Iâ€™m terrified. I barely have any friends and at school Iâ€™m a loner. Iâ€™m hanging by a thread and nothing is really motivating me. I wish someone would help me because Iâ€™m too much of a coward/tired to help myself. Iâ€™ve tried so hard but nothing has worked. My parents no longer get concerned when I tell them Iâ€™ve had a suicide attempt. I feel like no one cares.
