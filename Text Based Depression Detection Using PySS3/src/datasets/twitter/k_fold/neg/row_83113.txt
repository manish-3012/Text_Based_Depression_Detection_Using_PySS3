screw it, i'm doneTonight, I'm taking two Tramadol opioid pills mixed with two tylenol pills and I'm done. There's nothing left for me here. Today I tried for the FINAL time to get my film funded and investors STILL won't give me a chance, so I'm done. If I take the pills right, I either won't wake up or will wake up, get dizzy and then pass out and be done with this. I posted this to tell people that......life is useless, if you're poor and friendless and only have your dreams and goals to keep you going, life is useless because the world will NEVER let you achieve our goals and dreams. So...bye
