ExHAUSTED of life.I'm constantly trying to find a reason to live but I can't find one.

I live. For no reason (that I can tell).

I DO a few good things for the (few) people who haven't forgotten me, I am a "musician"(played guitar&amp;bass[also piano] for 12 years)

I like gizmos and "different" things, android, linux, just "different" gizmo stuff.

*fuck*

I'm just **tired** of life.

I don't feel crazy emotional like I have to die, I just feel like I *should* ya know?

I used to cut (almost 10 years ago) and it felt great and I miss it.

I was a "person"(contributing member of society) once.

I am **TIRED** now.

No motivation, no happy, no life.

I am only a burden on those I feel have love for me, and I feel awful about that. I feel sickened that I inflict that on those few, wonderful people.

Anyway this is a ditch on a throwaway I thought up a while back, so I could imbibe liquor as I am now (finally)

Just lost, looking for some answers.




If you read all that you have my thanks, and suspicion.

I hope you have a nice life.
