I can't get thru the holidaysI refuse to see my dad (He's beyond abusive and my mom is a narcissist/enabler) but I don't know what to do on Christmas. It's a painful holiday no matter where I go &amp; I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts/sui attempts since I was 12 or 13(?). I'm thinking about getting a hotel room and killing myself sometime before Xmas so no one I know will find me and I won't ruin the holiday for everyone. I've been unemployed &amp; living with friends (barely able to contribute) for over 2 years, I feel mentally crippled &amp; like a parasite but I don't know what to do besides dying. I dont think posting about it will even help I just can't express this to anyone irl.
