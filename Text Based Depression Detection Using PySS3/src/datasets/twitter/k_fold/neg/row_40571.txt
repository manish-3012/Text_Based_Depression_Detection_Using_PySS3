This has probably been the worst and weirdest winter break.I honestly wish that I could just die. My first week of winter break was just stressing over my grades and being sad and disappointed at myself. The next week was Christmas and I spent the whole week alone and when my mom was off work all she would do is belittle me and yell at me and blame me for everything. On Christmas Day I went to a family party and basically was ignored most of the time and spent most of my time upstairs alone sleeping or cuddling with my uncles dog. I donâ€™t even have friends to hang out with over break and nobody even said merry Christmas to me. I believe Iâ€™ll never be enough for anybody or myself and Iâ€™ve been thinking of ways to kill myself, but I canâ€™t find a way to get the things I need to end it. I guess what Iâ€™m saying is I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself very soon.
