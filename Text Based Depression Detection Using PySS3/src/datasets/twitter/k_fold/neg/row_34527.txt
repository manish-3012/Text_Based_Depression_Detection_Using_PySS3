Dumped the day before Valentine's Day, a month away from the one year death of my best friend. I'm done.I just got dumped. Just as in maybe an hour ago. I thought this boy was the love of my life. But I guess it just became a pity relationship after my best friend hung herself almost 11 months ago. I feel so stupid. My (now) ex and I had our one-year anniversary about 2 weeks ago. Today he told me he started feeling bad around then but still fucked me and said we've had an amazing year. Thinking about that makes me want to throw up. 

On top of that this semester, which should be my last, hasn't been going great. I've missed a lot of class and haven't really started my senior project or put much effort into anything. I don't have any prospects after graduation because I haven't done any internships or work experience related to my field.  My best friend's death happened right as I was getting back to life after being sick with mono. I don't really have any close friends. Mine all graduated from their respective colleges this past year and have their own lives and things that I'm just not really a part of.

 I have nothing and I want out. I don't know how I'll do it but I just know I've never seen myself living to be old and might as well get it over with now. 

**update:** Earlier tonight I took an xacto knife to my leg, nothing deep because I'm such a baby I can't even hurt myself properly, but there's a collection of red scratches that will leave scars. I also tied the rope of my bathrobe to the metal bar in my clothes closet to see if it could possibly work as an exit route, but my feet touch the ground so it probably won't work. Same with tieing it to my bed frame. My body started to freak out so I guess I was doing something right but it was too easy to back out. I just want everything to stop.
