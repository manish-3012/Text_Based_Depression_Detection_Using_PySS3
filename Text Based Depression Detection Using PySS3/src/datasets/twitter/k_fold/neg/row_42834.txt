Telling people didn't helpI felt so depressed and worthless since around my 18th birthday late last year. In February, I broke down in front of my mother and told her, I thought that would be the first step to recovery and everything would get better. Looking back, I was wrong.

My parents were understanding, I started going to a doctor and a therapist and within a week I was on antidepressants.

Antidepressants just fucked up my mood even more, I don't feel like myself most of the time due to the constant mood swings. One day I'm feeling content and loved and motivated but then it just disappears for no reason. (You can probably guess where I am right now.)

I've told my 3 closest friends recently, all girls (I'm a guy) and of course they were caring and kind, all amazing friends who really do care, but it hasn't helped at all. They're all I have and I'm sure they're the only thing keeping me from hurting myself. I feel that it's not healthy to have such a dependency on them because we'll all be leaving for college next year and I'll be alone again.

All the other guys in my (all male) school have formed their own social groups that do things together, and I've tried to edge in with them but I don't think they really want me to. I haven't left my house for a week in the height of summer because nobody's asking me anywhere. I feel completely isolated both physically and emotionally.

In a desperate attempt to feel loved I had hookups with 5 guys in 3 weeks between March and April. I didn't even get hard due to what I think is the antidepressants fucking up my libido, and I'm uncertain of my sexuality right now. I put myself in dangerous positions knowing that I'd either end up getting fucked, or ruining/endangering my life by meeting up with complete strangers.

I know this summer is going to pass by and I'll be back in school come September having done pretty much nothing. Is there any point to it?

Thanks.
