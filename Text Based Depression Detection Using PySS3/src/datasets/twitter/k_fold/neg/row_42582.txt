Feeling some type of wayIâ€™m not quite sure what it is Iâ€™m doing or supposed to be doing anymore. My depression used to be very aggressive, but these days I donâ€™t even feel it, really. Just the big empty now. In a way it is better, not feeling the rage and despair; but in other ways it is not. I also donâ€™t feel love, happiness, the other things I used to be able to describe but just canâ€™t seem to remember anymore.

The biggest disappointment was that getting clean did not help. They all swore that that was my problem. Too much pot. Too much LSD. Too many cigarettes. Well, I donâ€™t know what else to say now except that being sober is a bummer. Being high wasnâ€™t healthy, yeah, but at least I lived in a different world all the time. 

Where do you look that you donâ€™t see either the most absurd levels of excess, whether it be material, violence, hatred, or ridiculousness, or emptiness. At least for what Iâ€™ve been looking for, the world is empty. There is no place to lay my head and forget about the very serious nonsense weâ€™ve surrounded ourselves with. There is no time to think about the beauty of what is when we are constantly throwing ourselves at what could, should, might, wonâ€™t, canâ€™t, and will be later on. 

And on top of it all, I got married in January. This is literally the best time of my life and itâ€™s just... nothing. I donâ€™t know what kind of husband that makes me but I can assume not a great one. She wants to have a baby. I donâ€™t even know how to describe how confusing that is to me. Iâ€™d never wish life on another being, let alone purposely. But it seems to be my fate. Either that or I disappoint the only person who has ever really helped me feel less bad about being me by not being me anymore. 

I donâ€™t know that this made any sense. I donâ€™t know that I really said anything at all. I can only imagine what reading this is like and for those of you who do, sorry. For everything and nothing and whatever lays in between.
