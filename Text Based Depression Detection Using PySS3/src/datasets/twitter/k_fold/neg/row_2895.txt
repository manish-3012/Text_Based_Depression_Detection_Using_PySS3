A burden, a waste, a posI'm going to end it before I can go inpatient. It would be months for me to just get into recovery, there's no point. I can't do it anymore. I know I should be sticking around for my partner but this shit is just so hard and it just doesn't get better. I've heard all the motivational speeches but that's all they are, motivation for those who know how to and can put things into action. Whereas I just try and fail repeatedly. 
I don't have any purpose besides my partner, and at this point I'm just a huge burden on them.
