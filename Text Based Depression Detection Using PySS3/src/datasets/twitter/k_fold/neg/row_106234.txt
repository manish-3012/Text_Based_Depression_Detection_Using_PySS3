I canâ€™t breatheWhy? Just why?

I know life is unfair but why her?

She never did anything wrong. On the contrary she went out of her way to do good.

She saved me from myself â€” from the intrusive thoughts and the constant need to mutilate â€” and from all the daily abuse.

She gave me a different perspective to life, always trying to look things in a more positive light. At one point I found it annoying, why are you creating this oh so grand and beautiful world in you mind? Earth is a shitty place with shitty people.

She used to say that she knew there was bad in the world but life wasnâ€™t meant to ponder over that. She believed that life was about living it to the fullest, everyday doing everything you can so you donâ€™t regret it later.

It was a quite interesting and I learned a lot from her, unfortunately I did not adapt such a positive mindset but every new day didnâ€™t seem so painful â€” at least when she was there.

But life likes to make the best people suffer the worst and now my dearest friend has left me alone in this dark hell.

It is suffocating yet Iâ€™m numb. I feel like I should be hysterical but Iâ€™m apathetic and that makes me mad. Why can I not mourn her proper life? It feels like I have failed her.

Itâ€™s cold. 

As much as she would want me to live, I feel like I have lost the only thing keeping me going.

Now she wasnâ€™t the only one to help me, she brought a whole network of friends with her. But initially she was the first to actually acknowledge me. 

And as much it brings me pain, I might not be able to keep our promise after all. 

May you rest in peace and I hope that whatever you see on the other side is as pleasant as you were.
