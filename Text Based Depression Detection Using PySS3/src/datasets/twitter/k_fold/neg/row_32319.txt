Iâ€™m lost.I donâ€™t want to exist anymore. I was finally happy and I have an amazing boyfriend and an amazing family and amazing friends but Iâ€™m not happy anymore. Yesterday I woke up and I just was hit with the realisation that Iâ€™m just a failure, I canâ€™t do fucking anything at all and Iâ€™m never gunna get anywhere In life. I got drunk last night because of it and I relapsed after almost a month clean.. again!and my boyfriend is gunna be so annoyed and Iâ€™m so annoyed. I deleted all my social media from my phone (except Reddit) and my mum is panicking because she doesnâ€™t know where I am. But Iâ€™m just thinking. Like I know Iâ€™m not gunna kill myself Iâ€™m just really confused I think.. I donâ€™t know.
