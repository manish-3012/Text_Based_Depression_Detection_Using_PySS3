Why do I want to Kms all the fucking time?I always have negative thoughts and I want to slowly drown myself. I have trouble sleeping and my parents just broke up. Whenever I feel happy a negative thought comes in and ruins everything for me. No one at my school knows about this and people are so mean to me even when they donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going through. Every day I wake up and donâ€™t want to get out of bed because I know every day will be just as crappy. I donâ€™t enjoy things as much as I used to anymore I feel so alone and lost someone please help me!! Iâ€™m only 11 years old and I need your help!!
