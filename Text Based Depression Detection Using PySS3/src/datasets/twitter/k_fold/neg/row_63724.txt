HopelessI'm a sixteen year old who suffers from depression. I'm currently on medication, but I don't feel like it's helping. It's giving me severe appetite loss, so since I've started (four months ago) I've lost 15 pounds from starving myself. I've been depressed since I was 13, and I recently started self harming on Easter. I'm not religious, so I don't know what the date of that is. Anyway I've been losing more and more hope these past few weeks. I take excessive amounts of pills (Exedrin, Advil, NyQuil) and it's getting to the point where these thoughts are everything. The voices in my head are screams, and I've recently been "visited" by my demon. I was having a dream and I smelt death, and I turned around and this dark figure was standing behind me. I awoke immediately to find it standing by my bedside, and I can never forget the feeling of it's stare. I know it's what's been telling me to do these things. I'm considering the thought of a mental institution because I don't feel safe around myself. I only have hope from this one girl who I really like, but I've been distancing myself from her. My point being that I don't know how much longer I can take this. It's all I can ever feel. I'm hanging on a twig that can give out at any second. I don't know what to do, or who to talk to because I have severe trust problems. I don't talk to anyone like my family or psychologist. I just don't trust them. I don't see it ever getting better for me.
