Almost did it todayMy verbally abusive narcissistic mother started a fight with me, but I got blamed for it (as per usual). 

Only reason I didn't do it today was to not ruin Christmas for my little siblings.

Gonna wait until closer to New Year's. I had the needle of insulin in my hand ready ro inject. My friend talked me out of it, but barely. 

I'll stay alive, but only for now.
