I want to die because I did something horribleMy brother (M25) roommate/friend (F25) and I went out drinking I got waayy to drunk to the point where I blacked out and apparently I tried to get in bed with her.
I know it's not an excuse that I was drunk I don't need anyone to tell me this I already feel bad enough.
We have been living together for the better part of the year and I have never done this to anyone ever. I don't even know what happened my brother just tells me that I tried to get with her.
I apologized and naturally she was very short with me and refuses to look at me and I completely understand that.
I don't know what to do I'm guilt ridden to the point that I only function on automatic I'm numb, I don't eat I only get out of my room to go to work and barely talk to anyone at work once I come back I isolate myself for the rest of the day and I'm very seriously considering taking my own life. 
How could I do this to one of my dearest friends?. I know I'm a pig, and I don't deserve to live.
