This is itThis is my note, I guess. Right after I post, Iâ€™m going to end it.

To all I knew who may find this: Iâ€™ve slogged on for long enough. Hell, weâ€™re in the middle of the fucking apocalypse. Iâ€™m surprised I made it THIS far.

Iâ€™m finally too tired. I suppose 21 years of living in the wrong body will do that to someone. Also having ADHD and a ton of other likely incurable mental illnesses too. I made one last huge push to fix things this year and it failed. Just know itâ€™s not anybody elseâ€™s fault.

I donâ€™t want a funeral or anything. Especially not anything religious. Also, my name is Ray. Please donâ€™t use the old one.

Last of all, Iâ€™m sorry. I realize this is going to put everyone I know through pain but I simply cannot do this anymore. It may be hard or impossible to understand. I hope you can forgive me for what Iâ€™ve done.

I love you all. I go to peace.
