Every single night, when my parents are asleep, I cut myself with our sharpest knife, waiting for the day I'll muster enough courage to lacerate myself deep enough to cause my death.I know it won't be tonight, and probably not tomorrow, but I can't wait. It also gives me something to look forward to everyday. Every morning, thinking "today might be the day I stop existing" fills me with anticipation and gives me just enough energy to maintain a faÃ§ade of happiness.
