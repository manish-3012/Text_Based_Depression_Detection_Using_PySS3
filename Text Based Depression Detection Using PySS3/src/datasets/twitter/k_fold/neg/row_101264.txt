I didnâ€™t expect to be alive right now... but thatâ€™s a good thing.I intended to end things in the early hours of the morning on the 19th of this month. Exactly 4:01 CST July 19th 2018 I had intended to take my life. That idea has obviously changed.

I had found a new determination in life, and I Desire to stay around a little longer then what I had initially planned. Since this month started Iâ€™ve gone though many changes, and I had nobody and I didnâ€™t want the help. Things are different however.

I want to be the freest person in the world. Not Bound by things like, race, religion, gender, and disability. I want to help people, because Iâ€™ve already been freed from my suicidal thoughts. Thatâ€™s thanks to everyone here who helped me, and the one friend who stayed by my side till this moment. 

Things arenâ€™t all Bright and Sunny just yet however, since I didnâ€™t expect to be alive right now... I kinda didnâ€™t buy enough food beyond that point. So I havenâ€™t eaten much lately; thereâ€™s also another thing that needs to be done. I hurt my very best friend in the whole world. I made her cry, and Iâ€™m still full of regret because of that. I want to make it up to her, so we can be friends again.

That is my dream, and it fills me to the very brim with determination. I only wish I had the time to help more people here.
