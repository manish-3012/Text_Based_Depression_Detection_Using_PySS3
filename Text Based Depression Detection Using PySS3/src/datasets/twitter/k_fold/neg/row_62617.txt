I want to die painless and in a legal way(euthanasia)I'm 100% sure that I want to die. Does anybody know where I have to go to receive assisted suicide? I live now in Dallas, TX.

I'm 23 years, male and married. Not sure if any of this matters.

Also are there any costs? Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this.
