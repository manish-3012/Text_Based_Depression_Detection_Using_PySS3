Hug me Iâ€™m scaredI lost three people to suicide last year and they were all people I consider stronger than myself. 

I kind of expected two of them to leave that way and I know itâ€™s bad to say but after the initial wave of sadness I was happy that they were finally at peace. The third... I did not expect. Itâ€™s officially been a month since he passed on and thereâ€™s been no feeling of relief. Whenever I think of him I feel panicked. 

I thought he would make it. Him and I were extremely similar and seeing him randomly go and do that scared me. Iâ€™m still scared. After that I started to think of all the other people who left us this year and it really hit me that Iâ€™m going to kill myself one day. It never goes away and one day when my luck is running low Iâ€™ll end up dead just like him. I constantly want to die but thereâ€™s always small things that hold me back. I kind of hope my reckless habits will kill me before â€œIâ€ can so nobody has to hold that sort of sadness or guilt in their hearts. Iâ€™m scared to hurt people by leaving but itâ€™s all I want to do.
