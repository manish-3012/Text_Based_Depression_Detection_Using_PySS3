Passive ideationIt always fluctuates. I have days where I come close to attempting, and days where I might not think about attempting at all. But it never leaves completely, and itâ€™s hard to imagine it ever doing so. Even if I became happy in the future, should I have one, Iâ€™d still be aware of where I came from, and how possible it still is to fall back there.

It might not be today, tomorrow, months, years or even decades from now, but my suicide feels inevitable. Iâ€™m too good at being miserable. I feel disinterested and dissociated from the world and the people around me. My life isnâ€™t terrible, but thereâ€™s just so little here. And what little there is just upsets me. Itâ€™s just a series of anxiety-inducing frustrations and annoyances. I just wanna fall asleep and not have to deal with it anymore.

Iâ€™ve been directly told I should kill myself six times on this site for being a trans woman. Although really it was just three incidents, but one comment telling me to off myself had four upvotes, so that brings it up to six. I donâ€™t even go looking for the shit, all it takes is being openly trans, one time someone DMâ€™d me just to tell me it. And Iâ€™ve seen dozens of indirect comments echoing the same sentiments. The last time was a week ago. Hell, one time I saw someone come onto this subreddit just to encourage a trans person to kill themselves.

It doesnâ€™t hurt me. It doesnâ€™t affect my self esteem. Theyâ€™re idiot scumbags. All it makes me do is resent people more. I wish they could be subjected to the pain they inflict on others. If anything I feel reluctant to kill myself just because doing so would make them happy.
