A lineological reflection of my depression12 - ok, but searching, something's amiss, life isn't clear, confusion, light sadness

14 - fun and tormentuous, nice highs and deep lows, self-esteem inducing depression. I don't look like the others. Not in a good way. Light attempts at taking life. Suicidal ideologies. Cutting. Creativity. Confusion. Sadness. Talking to friends about it, some understand others do not. Writing clearly about my feelings.

16 - confusion. Sadness, I'm not who I want to be, life is controlling Me. I'm along for the ride. Some good days. Still able to communicate my feelings, which is a good thing. Sometimes it feels like it's the end of the world.

18 -20  try to turn it around, day by day struggles. Some months of no depression, other months of overwhelming sadnesses. Able to communicate about it to others. So scared I will kill myself and scared I can't feel better ever again.

21 -25 many failed attempts to live the life I want,  many pitfalls, not resilient to life. Many mistakes. Much sadness. Somenfun times, exploring life, meeting people. Keeping feelings about it within, sometimes able to speak about it. Feels heavier than it used to. I understand some days are worse than others, still it's very scary!

25-29 more fun, more mistakes, sometimes on it, mostly not, mistakes, jobs lost, sadness, depleting of energy, looking back, looking back, wish it was different. Don't speak about it to anyone at all. Feels very heavy. I understand that the dark days will pass, like a cycle, so I look forward to days ahead.

30-35 Everyday it hangs on, over everything I do, still I push through. I failed My version of success out of fear, but I am kind. Stuck in a cycle of anxiety and depression. I do my best. I am politer, yet not a push over, I am realistic and more mature than ever before. More capable of doing life without externally complaining. No one would ever know, because I never speak about it. Silence is sufferance. It makes no difference to talk to anyone, it is purely something inside of me that cannot be altered by outside influences. I know the dark feelings will pass, but it's very annoying and scary while you're inside of the feeling.

And depression does look really pathetic on the outside. Like an adult child throwing a tantrum. An adult unable to regulate their emotions.

Real problems are the ones inside your own mind.

One day it will be better, even just for a moment, thank god for that.
