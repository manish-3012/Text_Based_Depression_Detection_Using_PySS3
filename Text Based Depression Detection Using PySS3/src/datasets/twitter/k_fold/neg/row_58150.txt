On his death dateYesterday marked 13 years since my boyfriend was killed in a motorcycle accident. Itâ€™s always a bad day for me, however I usually have friends who will do things with me to keep my mind occupied on the good times. This year itâ€™s different. I just cut all ties with a toxic friend group which cut out a good maybe 10 people from my life. I also am not as close with my ex-roommates so theyâ€™re both doing their own things. I have one friend who lives 900 miles away and is dealing with her own problems. The only person left is my friend who was just released from jail and is addicted to heroin. I spent the day alone. I planned out what I would do to end my life so I could have the same death date as my boyfriend. I just had to go see him one more time. I went to his grave and smoked a cigarette while playing Free Bird. Thatâ€™s when I noticed a blue jay nearby. Heâ€™d fly closer and watch me and fly to another location near me and watch. He did it through the entire 9 minute song!! No one can convince me that it wasnâ€™t him. I know he would want me to live.... I just donâ€™t see the point of living anymore.
