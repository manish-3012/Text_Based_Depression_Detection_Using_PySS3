My life is going horrible and I need helpRecently it has seem like both my parents are abusive and manipulative so I was so excited when I was supposed to go to Germany today on Friday, June 3 but got an email that I canâ€™t because of the virus. Also my debit card with a bunch of money went missing and my dog has just been sent to the vet and might die. Ive fucking had it. I want to die but Iâ€™m too afraid to. I still have my brother in my friends who are nice to me sometimes but I still donâ€™t want to live. Iâ€™m signing myself up for therapy but all of my friends tell me that it doesnâ€™t even work. I am super depressed and I just want to have a better life but I canâ€™t so I have suicidal thoughts but I am still am to afraid and I donâ€™t know what to do
