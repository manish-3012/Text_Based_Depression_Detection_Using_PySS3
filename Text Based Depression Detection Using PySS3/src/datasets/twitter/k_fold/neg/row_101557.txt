I just don't get the point to life any longer. I am 18 an life has not gone well at all so far. Both my parents are addicts who could really care less about me most of the time. I have been on my own since I was 16. I have been living with a boyfriend and his family. I just want out of this relationship and I feel trapped. The only way I could have somewhere else to live is to possibly move in with my on relaible father. I am still in high school and graduating is my number one goal but my father doesn't live in the town I go to school in. I just want to stop struggling. I don't see the benifit from continuing with this life.
