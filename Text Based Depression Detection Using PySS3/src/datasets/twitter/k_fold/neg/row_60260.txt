20 male college student need some help badlyI don't really know where to start with it. I have always felt fairly depressed for the past few years but have never done anything about it as I thought it was just the standard teen depression thing. As I grew the depression grew, I never made any friends in high school and I have trouble talking to people and am uncomfortable doing so. Most people don't understand what I mean when I say I am uncomfortable talking with people. I cannot bring myself to talk to people. It goes beyond social awkwardness. It is something that troubles me very very deeply, just having to say hello and make eye-contact. I've been ridiculed for my lack of eye-contact by my peers. Now I have become very very suicidal, I've begun cutting, not in a "I want to die" kind of way but in a "If i was to press a bit harder this could all be over".

I should also mention that I used to have a 4.0 gpa but I've now not gone to school for 3 weeks missing all midterms/homework etc. I was also on scholarship but I doubt I'll be able to keep that now. I'm already in a ton of debt and have people still coming after me. I still live at home but even then it isn't enough to offset the costs of school (I lived on campus last year and an apartment for a bit). I feel like offing myself is the best option at this point. 

I have no health insurance nor do my parents and I don't feel comfortable talking with anybody in person about this, but eventually I'm sure it will come out but I'm not sure in what way. 

I'm sure many will say go to your school's counseling center but this goes back to what I said earlier about my extreme reluctance to talk to anybody about anything magnified by the fact that I don't want to talk about my situation.
