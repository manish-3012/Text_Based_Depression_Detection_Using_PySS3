I want to go away.I want to go away, so far away. I donâ€™t want to go anywhere though, I just want to be gone.

I canâ€™t, though. Iâ€™m stuck. Feet firmly locked in this place, because my parents swear that theyâ€™ll kill themselves if I do such a drastic thing. That makes me feel even more stuck in this prison. I understand why they say it, but fuck. I donâ€™t want anything bad to happen to them just because Iâ€™m so desperate for a taste of peace.

Then thereâ€™s my girlfriend, honestly the only person I really care about whatsoever. You might say â€œBut you just mentioned your parents,â€ theyâ€™re innocent bystanders to me. Of course I care. I donâ€™t like the idea of my death bringing them an eternity of pain, should there be an afterlife. Nobody deserves that, other than me. But my girlfriend, I love her. A lot. Too much, maybe. Iâ€™m beginning to realize she might not love me the same, though... she might not even love me at all. I donâ€™t know where to go, who to turn to. I donâ€™t want new people in my life, I donâ€™t want anyone to say â€œAre you okay?â€ or be worried. I donâ€™t want any of this shit. I want out. If I wanted sympathy, Iâ€™d post on all my social media â€œI WANT TO KILL MYSELF!â€ and let it rip from there. I donâ€™t want that though. Preferably if I went through with it, nobody would necessarily know. I think the biggest thing holding me back right now is just wondering if my girlfriend would miss me, if sheâ€™d wish I were back here rather than the oblivion that I dream of. Sheâ€™s the only person that ever made my life feel worth living, and sheâ€™s the only reason itâ€™s worth living right now.

I feel so much guilt, anguish. Itâ€™s nobodyâ€™s fault that I want this except for my own, and I donâ€™t understand why I want it so bad right now. I just want to flutter free. I donâ€™t know who I am, or what to do anymore. I just want her to hold me, one more time. But I canâ€™t. Sheâ€™s out of town. So maybe I have to wait all weekend. Maybe I have to wait longer. I feel sick. I feel fucked up. I feel lost.

I donâ€™t want any sympathy, I just desperately wanted to rant without anyone who knows me growing concerned.
