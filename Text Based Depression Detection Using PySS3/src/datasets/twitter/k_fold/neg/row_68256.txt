Cursed birthday, and maybe iâ€™ll drink myself to death on Sunday.Hey guys, iâ€™m turning the big 17 on Sunday. Not a good thing, though because whenever my birthday comes around, everyone is either doing something else or left. This year, my boyfriend moved back home (because heâ€™s been staying with me for a month) but he then texted me heâ€™ll pick up his stuff tomorrow. I hate him. So much. Heâ€™s been there through my birthday last year and i basically cried because my brother didnâ€™t come. Itâ€™s like my birthday doesnâ€™t matter. He knows what i know about what happens on my birthday. 16th birthday, i got all dressed up and everyone ditched my. 15th, i was by myself with my mom at work, 14th, same thing but ten days later, my dad died. Almost everyone in my family died near and around my birthday. Iâ€™m so used to being alone with just my mom and uncle on my birthday, but itâ€™s almost like they HAVE to. I just need to end it all.  I want to. really.
