I feel like I don't existBeen actively suicidal since I was 8. No good reason for it, no trauma, just became convinced I was an inhuman abomination that needed to be taken out. 15 years later this is still the case. I literally do not think I am a person, and on many levels I feel that I'm not real at all.

When I look in a mirror I can't recognise it as myself - it belongs to someone else, a shell I've invaded. I can't accept affection because it's not for me, it's for someone whose body and life I've stolen.

I know it's not logical but I can't shake this feeling that I'm trespassing someone else's life. My existence just feels so fundamentally wrong. My need to punish myself is so strong that I've even started selfharming in my sleep. I want to die, I want to be killed, I deserve a painful death and I want to do it to myself.

That said, I'm too incompetent to even kill myself. Lost count of my botched suicide attempts and got out of hospital for the last one 2 days ago. Meds, therapy, helplines, hospitalisation, none of them have made a difference.

I'm tired. Pretending I'm human is so much effort and I shouldn't be here anyway. I want to stop breathing and forget that I exist. The person whose body I stole can finally wake up and have their life back, and I can finally disappear entirely.
