A different type of painI donâ€™t know what it is, but itâ€™s a different type of pain that Iâ€™m feeling right now. And I just want someone to understand my mind, to understand me and make me feel like itâ€™s okay and itâ€™s safe. But, I donâ€™t know. 
 
Everything seems hazy right now, I just want someone to understand my mind. I got told by someone I loved that â€œmaybe I shouldnâ€™t be so complicatedâ€. And right now they are ignoring me as I reach out to them for them to try to understand me and hoping they will tell me to stop feeling suicidal. 

I just, i hate this. I hate feeling so alone and tied down to nothing. I feel like nobody understands me and itâ€™s all my fault. That I canâ€™t be loved, that Iâ€™m just hated when all I ever wanted was to make friends and try to be honest. By far, I am not perfect. I have made many mistakes in my life, but I try to give advice and be there for others and understand them. 

But now, nobody understands me and the person I love the most in this world is just ignoring me when I need him. I donâ€™t know if this post is allowed or not, I just wanna feel heard for a second. I wanna feel like someone else understands me and I wanna feel like Iâ€™m not alone for just a split second. 

This is just a different type of pain. A pain where i am so frustrated with not being understood and why I am the way I am, that it makes me cry. That I canâ€™t breathe and my head hurts because Iâ€™m just crying to the point I donâ€™t wanna feel what itâ€™s like to be human anymore. I donâ€™t want attention; I meanâ€” I do. Who doesnâ€™t? But, I want to be understood. Thatâ€™s all I want from this post, is someone to just understand what Iâ€™m saying and be able to say that Iâ€™m not alone.
