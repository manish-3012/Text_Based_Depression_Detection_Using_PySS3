No one will probably bother to read this, anyway.My fiancÃ©e just got admitted to the inpatient psych department in the local hospital for the second time for anorexia nervosa. She developed it due to my rage disorder along with the stresses of medical school, but I'm certain it was me that caused the disorder to manifest. She's always been high strung, but never at a point where her brain developed a disorder that resulted in regular self harm (which for her causes a sense of euphoria, but that's a separate discussion over the nature of eating disorders). It was my rage issues that resulted in me flipping the mattresses with her on the bed flinging her against the wall. It was my rage that caused me to lash out at her unnecessarily time and time again. I've been in therapy for the past year and 4 months and on an SSRI that has been quite beneficial, and have since gained a lot of useful insight into my triggers and how to prevent them, but the damage I've done won't go away. I'm currently sitting in our condo (which her parents paid for so that she could go to medical school) alone, drinking myself into a stupor bawling my eyes out and wishing for nothing but to erase everything I've ever done to everyone I've ever known. I want to stop being a burden to those closest to me, but everything just seems so futile. This probably didn't make any sense, but I just want someone to acknowledge that this is all my fault.
