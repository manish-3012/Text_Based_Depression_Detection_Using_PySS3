I know I won't be able to resist killing myself before my birthdayI'm doing that stupid whiny loser thing and begging someone to say something and care about me and stop me, but like... no one responds, because who would respond to that shit?

Anyway, no one cares about me, no one's ever cared about me. I didn't have some big breakup or whatever, so I don't deserve sympathy, I've just never had anyone. No friends, no family...

If you want to see more details (which you don't) check my posts, I'm sick of typing it over and over again.

Anyway, I know I'm not going to make it to my birthday. 


I just cut myself. I've never cut myself before, just smacked and punched myself. It was because I saw a post on a writing blog that said writers need friends, which I've known for years, that you can't do anything alone. I've been trying for almost 10 years to find friends. 10 years since I cut off the people who called themselves my friends, but never did anything but steal from me. I haven't been able to find anyone. 

I just want someone to actually acknowledge my birthday. Whenever I see anyone else getting a birthday gift, I want to die. And yes, I do give other people gifts.
