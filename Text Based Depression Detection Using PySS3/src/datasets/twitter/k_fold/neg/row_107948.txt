Killing myself in small amountsAll I can do is self harm. My life is one cringy mess. 
I'm 24 year old female living in the states.  I have no job, never had a bf , I'm overweight, have no social skills, no friends, live with my parents still, was raised in a religious cult that robbed me of my childhood and above all im completely miserable and alone. I'm a coward. I should of killed myself a long time ago. Instead I cut myself I'm covered il n scars and no one knows. What difference does it make? People preach about mental health awareness but the truth is it's all a lie. It is a weakness and no one absolutely no one can understand it or deal or treat it. It really is a burden and no one wants to hire someone like that. No one wants to hear that because its negative and brings people down. 
I want to die and someday maybe soon I will. The most disgusting part is my parents get off on my pain. They literally have a hard on watching me suffer. They put me in this in first place and now blame me for being depressed and unable to move forward. All they do is compare me to other people they know my age , they see their cars their travels etc and I spent my young days asleep in doors unable to move forward.  
They are both extreme narcissists. I have on best friend in even worst situation and sadly I feel she too has only brought me down. Her extreme negative life has taken a toll on my socially and only till recently I have become aware of it 
I have to kill myself.
