I dont wanna do thisI'm a 17 year old girl. Im graduating high school soon, only I dont see myself living to graduate.

Nothing feels worth it anymore. Ive been selfharming since i was 10, suicidal since i was 14. I just want all the pain to end.  
Everyone leaves me and it would be so much easier for myself if i just left before getting hurt again.

I dont have a bright future so i dont see the point in having a future at all.

If I dont find a reason in 14 days, ill do it. Im giving myself 2 more weeks of this bullshit before i end it.
