the gun is loadedthe gun is loaded. it has been loaded for months. i suppose i have a fantasy in my mind that it will be meaningful when i pass, that i will be missed and remembered for my death more than i was for my life.

but the reality is that it doesn't matter. it doesn't matter whether i will be missed or not, it doesn't matter if i have made a difference to anyone or not. what matters is that my dreams are dead. i've been left alone by the only one i finally ever trusted. a year has passed and there is no lessening of the bleak air that compliments the constant rain.

i move downstream, and i always will. i peaked long ago. i'm already dead.

every night i drink until i can't feel anymore. every night i lose a little more of what made me worthwhile. every night i pull the trigger with the safety on and i imagine if it were off. soon i will know. 

or maybe i already do.
