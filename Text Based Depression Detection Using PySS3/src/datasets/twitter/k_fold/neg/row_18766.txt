Sitting alone with a firearmI don't know how much more I can take. I was sitting here after a bad week and I just had a thought of shooting myself. It wasn't just a thought, like a small urge like when you see something on sale. At the moment, I want to live, but i'm terrified of the future. If this post isn't allowed as i'm not actively wanting to kill myself. Tell me and I'll repost elsewhere.

I can't go to therapy or take anytidepressants. The reason why?

Therapy: I'll lose my job and be judged by the close minded community I live in.  Everyone who does is judged.

Antidepressants: I'll lose my job, and my family will overreact and start restricting me. I won't sacrifce my firearms or other weapons. The main reason for that is I live in a place filled with where the police are hours away. The one person who openly admitted that he didn't believe in owning a gun got robbed 4 times in a month.

I need someone to talk to.
Can anyone help?
