I feel like Iâ€™m not a good person.Externally Iâ€™ve always struggled with just trying to be nice. I canâ€™t keep shit to myself or not say some rude comment, itâ€™s led me to be ostracized almost entirely even though I care a lot, or I think I do. My closest friends are nothing but amazing for me and I love them a lot, they mean the world to me. But now Iâ€™m completely alone. I have no one and I canâ€™t speak to them. Iâ€™m living in fear of anything and everything I say or do. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to get past my current situation thatâ€™s led me to be so alone. I just want to be with my friends, I just want to have a supportive and loving home, I just want to not have these terrible thoughts in my head anymore. I want to be able to walk into my room without having an episode and being denied the ability to use my own body or feel my own feelings. Iâ€™m suffering so much and everyday the whole suicide thing sounds better. I wonder if she knew that it would be like this for me.
