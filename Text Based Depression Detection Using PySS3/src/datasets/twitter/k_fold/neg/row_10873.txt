classmate from last year killed themselvesa friend of mine who graduated from my high school last year killed himself by jumping out of his dorm room window. apparently, two students were there when he did it.

im freaking out because i want to know why they were there, how that happened, was he drunk? was he about to jump off and his friends tried to talk him out of it and then he slipped and fell to his death? like i dont know and im freaking out. im so mortified that this happened, it just seems like something out of a movie.

ive been feeling suicidal lately and this scares me because i wonder if things will ever get better, if ill be trappe in this depressive state of mind for the rest of my life. i live in a city where it's always raining, grey skies, people who arent warm and dont really give a fuck about helping anyone or strangers, and if i dont get accepted to any colleges out of state i might off myself because this city is full of horrors that remain untalked about. i mean fuck, i saw the warning signs in him now that i take time to reflect, but we all passed him off as the clumsy asian kid who was always late to everything because that was just his nature. now when i think about it, was he late to almost everything because he really struggled to get out of bed? because he didnt want to live another day but he forced himself up? he was always unkempt and greasy hair but i just thought that was him being a typical teenage boy, but the lack of self care i can see it now.

anyways, im scared, i dont want to do anything right now. i wasnt super close to him, but i broke the news to his best friend and her sobs and disbelief are tattood in me.
