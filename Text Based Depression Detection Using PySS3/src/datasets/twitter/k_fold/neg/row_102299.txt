What does 'Ive attempted suicide' really even meanI've wanted to die almost my whole life and I see people who've survived pills or jumping off bridges, but how far does someone have to go before it becomes an attempt and not just a fantasy? I tried drinking myself to death at a party in highschool and wound up in the hospital. I also tried hanging myself with wires I found in the school's theater but I wasn't off a stool or anything. I just tried it around my neck and let my legs go slack but after a few seconds I couldn't take the pain and stood back up. I did that a few times. Those were all about 5 years ago but today I woke up feeling like I wanted to die. I tried cleaning and planning a shopping list as it's my day off but I just cried. When I calmed a bit I walked into my car and drove to the nearest bridge but when I got to a parking lot near it I just sobbed in my car. FML I'm a mess I don't even know why I'm posting this. So many of these posts get overlooked I'm sorry to everyone else's suffering.
