...No matter what, there are things that I feel that I have no way of expressing; I don't know what to say but I need to say something to keep myself from exploding.

 I've been suicidal for a while. I attempted a couple years ago but I was stopped by a close friend. He was concerned but I somehow convinced him that it was just because I was drunk (the alcohol might have had some role that time) but it was not the only thing that caused me to want to jump off a balcony. I'm thankful for him because he cared but I just didn't feel like I was worth the concern. I still don't.

I've fought with my head for a long time, and I'm convinced that the fight never ends. I want to give up so badly. I'm fucked up. I'm not worth the fight.  If I could go without hurting anyone else, I would.
