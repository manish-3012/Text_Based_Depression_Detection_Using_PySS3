I don't want to fight this anymore.I honestly just don't want to fight this feeling anymore. It's been years of worthless fighting just so I could get cry so more, be content for a few hours, maybe a day? then it's just downhill from there. 

I really don't think my life is to bad, I don't know. I just feel so alone, so sad, my anxiety gets pretty bad and that doesn't really help. I don't see myself going anywhere in life, I'm in a shitty situation with another person that hurts me alot. I just feel like one day.. I'm really going to take my life, no matter what anyone says. It's just so hard to feel like this all day long and people say to keep pushing but they just don't get it.
