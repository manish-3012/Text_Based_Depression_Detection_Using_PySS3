Strangulation. Possibly addicted?I engage in self strangulation, usually by either wrapping cords, fabric or my own hands around my throat and keeping it there until I'm on the verge of passing out.
I will also hold my hands over my mouth and nose, causing myself to pass out.

While I am a year clean of self harm in the form of cutting, I've recently turned to this form of taking out my anger and stress.

I think I've become addicted to it. At random points, during homework, watching YouTube, eating, etc. I'll just pause and try to suffocate myself.

What should I do?

I do not have access to a help group or therapist.
