Losing the will to keep fighting thisIt's been about a week since my fiancÃ©e and myself broke up, we were together for almost 5 years and have a 6 month old child together. I've had depression since my early teens and am now moving toward my mid 20s, i was never diagnosed until about 19 and by that point i already had a self harm issue and multiple failed suicide attempts.
My ex tried for the first 3 years of our relationship to get me help which was extremely difficult for her as i was in denial and basically refused to do anything about it which almost ruined our relationship several times. Before we got together i had serious commitment issues choosing to sleep with everyone i could in hopes to boost my terrible self esteem and even during the relationship i cheated multiple time of which I am not proud of and hate myself even more for doing so. I've been on anti depressants for about 2 years now which have improved my will to live quite a bit though I still had my bad days but now i feel I'm slipping again and am going to end up being continuously drunk and probably trying to end my life again.
