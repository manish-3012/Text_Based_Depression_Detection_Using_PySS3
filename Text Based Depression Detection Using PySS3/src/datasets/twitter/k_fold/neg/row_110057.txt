Pretty sure my entire future just got fucked.Teacher decided to retroactively change the due date on 25% of my grade. Which means I can't get the grade I need to keep my financial aid, which means I can't keep doing college, which means I don't have anywhere to live, don't have any real future and have no chance of ever doing anything I can stand. 

College has been the only thing keeping me here. My mom is fucking psychotic, I don't have any friends, I don't have anywhere I could go and thanks to covid, thats literal. There is NOWHERE AND NOTHING for me right now. I can't even feel sad. I fucking expected to get fucked over at some point. Thats how pathetic my life has been, I EXPECTED to get fucked over.
