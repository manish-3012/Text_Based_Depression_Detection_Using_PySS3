Maybe I should get help?Im tired of hiding so much. Of not knowing who i can turn to. I feel like im just drowning within myself. That no matter what actions I make Im just slowing drifting into my depression. Some nights just sitting starring at my table and thinking why push on?What man me come to here was sitting and of how to split my shit and of a will and a final goodbye.
