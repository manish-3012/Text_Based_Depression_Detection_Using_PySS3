Horrible Birthday todayToday is my birthday(I know how it says it's in November but I messed up while putting in my bday) and so far it has been awful. For starters my mom got angry at me because apparently I'm now failing in math and my tutor has not met with me for 2 weeks. A friend also got angry at me today and started an argument and was made fun of multiple times today. When I get home I plan on overdosing because my life has sucked for a long time and it's only going to get worse. I also have to deal with being yelled at constantly and being neglected and I hope my family gets into a car accident and dies. And dont even think about trying to convince me not to do it or say some bullshit like "its would hurt your family and friends or " you have so much to live for" because I made up my mind and I have no reason to stay alive other then be abused and yelled at
