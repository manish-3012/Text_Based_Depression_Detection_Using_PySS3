The date is setThis Thursday, 16th  of April 2020, a young non binary person will be found hanging from a doorknob or on the floor holding a few empty pill trays, I was going to a while ago. Angeline Rose I was going to legally change my name to in a few years time, when I finally turn 18. I've written a letter to my friends, but because everyone in the world deserves an apology from me, I'm going to post it on here as well.

 I'm sorry for fucking up your life. I'm sorry if you thought I was faking. I'm useless to the world, useless to you, useless to everyone. I've been told by a lot of people that I'm faking my depression, faking my anxiety, hell, faking my god damn adhd, just that I'm faking everything. I've lost all will to live. Everything has gotten too much, I'm sorry. Before I found out about Quinn, Ellie, Jade, Lilith and James, Daniel said the one thing that made me feel so much less valid "They/them is plural, you aren't multiple people." Dilara told me I was Aromantic not Asexual when I came out as Ace and tried to explain my own sexuality too me. I can't push through these fucking voices, they won't stop telling me I'm annoying you, that I'm going to fail at everything I try, that all of your lives would be better without me, that my parents would have less stress without me. Iâ€™ve made you worry and Iâ€™ve made you upset and Iâ€™ve made you angry, Iâ€™m sorry for all of it. The more I tell myself that the people I look up to could push through it, then I can too, the more voices come up, the louder they are, the more persistent they are, they're harder for Quinn and Jade to help me through. I'm sorry, I love you but the end for me is soon, not today itâ€™s Easter, I will this Thursday.
