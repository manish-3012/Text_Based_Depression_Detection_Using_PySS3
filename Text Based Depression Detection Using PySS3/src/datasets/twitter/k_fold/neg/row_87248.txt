It sucks more when the wrong people leave youI was only 14 when I got into a relationship. You might say that 14 is pretty young and immature, but I was sexually abused in that relationship. I was dating this senior, because I looked like a junior my freshman year and it lasted for 7 months. I showed her kindness and love. I rode the bus for 2 hours and biked to her house just to see her everyday afterschool and during the summer. But she didn't do the same for me. I was always pushed around and emotionally abused by her. She wanted sex and I let her have it the first time, but afterwards I said no. But she would always push me. I couldn't reach out for help, because I loved her, I valued her. After the first 2 months, it all fell apart. She went to college and she started getting high off weed and having sex with other guys because I was reluctant to do it with her. She would always tell me about how her family always called her a slut, and now i know why. When she left me, it left a scar on me that can never heal. I always feel so lonely and I've tried moving on. I've asked other girls out, all to say no. My friend tried cheering me up by telling me that half the world's population is girls. Because I was a victim, I started to sexually harass other girls. I, as a victim, was victimizing other people and making their lives miserable. I had become like my girlfriend. My life sucked. And now I feel lonelier and more guilty than ever. Not only is my life ruined, but I ruined other people's lives. I almost got kicked off one of my sports teams for it. Idk what to do with my life anymore. I have random wants to kill myself because of the loneliness and sometimes I just feel lonely. I have great friends that surround me, but I still feel lonely inside. I feel that I'm meant for intimate relationships with other people and I feel lonely without one. But I've so far only gotten rejections and people getting creeped out by me.
