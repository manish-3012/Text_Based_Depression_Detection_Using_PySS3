End NearingIâ€™ve been losing myself more and more, everything is falling apart Iâ€™m losing everything thatâ€™s important to me and my anxiety of screwing things up worse is making things worse. Idk how many more days I can go I feel like my head is pounding with voices berating me and reminding me of my flaws and mistakes. I think my love has found someone else and just not told me yet. Their hanging out together more frequently and my anxiety leads me to believe itâ€™s more than a simple friendship. I wanna just take this knife and cut or grab the gun and end it all I donâ€™t know what to do.
