someone ruined my life.it was a domino effect. She spread lies about me. My career is over. My social life is over. I canâ€™t believe this. Everywhere I go thereâ€™s someone she knows. Every new group I meet thereâ€™s some kind of connection to her. I need to leave cities but I know this will follow me into my career if I gain even moderate success. I canâ€™t believe how effectively she just completely flipped my life. After 2 years of dealing with the fallout, I think itâ€™s time to just take my life. My concern is my family but iâ€™ll think of a way to leave things okay. When youâ€™re a kid you think whatâ€™s right will always prevail but I think some people were just born to lose.
