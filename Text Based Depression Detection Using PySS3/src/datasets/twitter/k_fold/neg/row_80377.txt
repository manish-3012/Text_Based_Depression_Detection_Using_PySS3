I donâ€™t care about my life anymore :(Hello,

I am in my 30â€™s and I am tired of struggling with my life. I have not been happy in this life. I have a very unsupportive family and the one person I thought cared for me took advantage of my help and stole money from my credit card. It was not a lot, but there was no apology or attempt to even pay it back. This person owes me so much money over the past few years, yet I am told that I am abusive and passive aggressive when I want my money back. (Yes this person is not financially well off, but that is not my fault and I am in university with hardly any job) I am not rich, I am in university, I have no parents to help me and no family that cares for me. Actually its better, because they are toxic. This person was family that I helped, but I thought they were different. Anyways I donâ€™t talk to them anymore, though I am not better for it.

I am in a lot of debt (not just from what I gave to this person), I have hardly any friends, I have no family, I have no future. I donâ€™t even have a job that is reliable. I thought going to university would help me, but its making my depression worse as I canâ€™t even focus due to my depression and anxiety. I canâ€™t handle the mood swings anymore, as right now I canâ€™t even think to do an essay. I really hate this life and in general I donâ€™t like people, because I get screwed over by them. It doesnâ€™t matter if I try, getting screwed just happens. I havenâ€™t had much luck with people.
I donâ€™t get permanent friends, only temporary. Maybe I only have one, but this person is not in a position to help me (they have done enough and it shouldnâ€™t just be one person).

I donâ€™t want to hear my life is worth it, as I have no idea what I am doing with my life anymore. There is nothing. I canâ€™t even work as I donâ€™t like people in work environments  and I donâ€™t have much job skills. Even if I did I canâ€™t get more than part time minimum wage, which is not enough to survive or pay my debts. I also have had bad experiences in work places and find lower paying jobs mostly toxic environments. Not good for a person with depression or anxiety.

I just see myself losing what little I have and ending up on the streets. Thatâ€™s not a life I want, I would rather not live. I donâ€™t even do drugs, or smoke, so why would I want to live on the streets? I am afraid I wonâ€™t be given an option, as my life is about people and situations screwing me over. 

There is nothing for me. I have 36 years of constant failure, even my childhood was failure. I had to watch my single parent mom be on welfare, no job, no supports and unable to even take care of me at times with her issues. I suffered due to this and It made my life harder. I have received no help from anyone. I had to do everything myself and no one helps me. At least no one helping me is constant. (But apparently I have to give all my savings and credit cards to help a person until I am in danger.)

I canâ€™t live this life anymore, anyone would have already killed themselves already, or something else. I just canâ€™t do it anymore. My heart is broken, my mind is tired and I donâ€™t like myself enough to continue on, unless I am a masochist. There is nothing hopeful about this life, I am a mess due to it. Taking some meds wonâ€™t treat it. You canâ€™t treat an awful life. Going to the hospital wonâ€™t treat it. For me, it will make it worse. Therapy doesn't work either, I am trying, I am not getting better. I need help everyday. To be honest I donâ€™t know how long I can go to therapy, because I donâ€™t have much money.

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore and I am at the end of my wits.
