Sorry if im in the wrong spot. Just a quick question.I suffer from depression and anxiety pretty severely and am thankful for a decent support system. I donâ€™t want to end my life, but sometimes in my really dark nights I yearn to speak with someone anonymous just to get through a really rough few hours or something. Im curious if there is a hotline esque thing akin to the suicide hotline that is for what might be considered a â€œnon emergencyâ€ relative to someone close to putting themselved in danger. I donâ€™t necessarily need something immediately but if such a resource exists I would love to have it on deck. Again i am sorry if this post does not fit here and will remove it if need be. Thank you to everyone and im sending my love.
