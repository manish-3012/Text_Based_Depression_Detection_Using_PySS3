Couple more weeks of this bullshitStill have work to do but have made my steps to the end. Will is in order, life insurance suicide clause has expired, and Iâ€™ve organized a ton of stuff for my wife so sheâ€™s not totally lost on logistics (bills, logins, etc) and stuff with our kids. 

After lots of thought my final exit must be a situation where suicide wouldnâ€™t be ruled 100% as cause of death. Looked at spots in my area where fatal single car crashes happen the most often and am planning on doing it that way. Iâ€™ve struggled with this most of my life at this point. Was hospitalized for a failed attempt as a teen and now, a father of two and husband in my 30â€™s, this shit has never gotten solved or fixed or better. Just more of the same. I legitimately donâ€™t understand why anyone wants to be around me and to be honest, Iâ€™m typically the most expendable person in the room. Almost every outcome Iâ€™ve been involved with would of pretty much happened the exact same way if I never existed. 

Thereâ€™s no point. I donâ€™t want my kids growing up with a parent like this in the house and my wife will be totally fine. Sheâ€™s a lot more optimistic and positive than me and has a great support system. I for real feel like theyâ€™re all better off without me around and now with the pandemic, and the fact that funerals arenâ€™t really happening, itâ€™s truly the best time to do it. 

In a couple of weeks my wife and kids are taking a trip with family and Iâ€™m staying back. Itâ€™ll be the perfect time to close this whole thing out.
