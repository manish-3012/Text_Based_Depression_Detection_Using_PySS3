I want to cease to existI am such a pussy.. I won't ever have the balls to take my own life. No matter how much I want to. I don't want to hurt those left behind. Family, younger siblings. My mum has put through a lot just to care for us and I feel that it would be so fucking selfish for me to add to her pain. I didn't ask to be born. But now that I'm here, Im stuck with what seems to be no way out. I am so alone, I'm beyond lonely, no friends, no personality. I have lost my real self trying to fit in with people who do not give a fuck about me. Nobody cared when I was struggling with drug addiction. Nobody asks about me. Sometimes I wonder if the people around me would notice my disappearance if I was to die. Would they care? Who will miss me? I find myself staying in the same spot rough spot after many, many years. My suicidal thoughts started when I was just a kid. I wanted to die back then, and I still do til this day. The feeling of being a burden just never seems to stop. I am so worthless. Why do I exist?
