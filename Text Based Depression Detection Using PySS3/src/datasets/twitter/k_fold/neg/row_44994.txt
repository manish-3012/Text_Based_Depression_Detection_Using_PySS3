I want to live so bad and donâ€™t want to kill myself , but I canâ€™t liveWow Iâ€™m 17 and this is what Iâ€™ve become. When I was in 9th grade I had my future set , I want to be an entrepreneur and have a six figure income, have a big house with a pool (my parents never let me get in water) , have a backyard I can smoke marijuana in, have frequent grilling parties, have a YouTube channel, purchase guns to shoot because I love call of duty, and have a sexy wife and kids. Now? I donâ€™t even look forward to anything anymore. Everyday I get more and more into the depression hole. I canâ€™t cope. Iâ€™m going deeper and deeper until I terminate myself. I havenâ€™t been happy in so so long.
