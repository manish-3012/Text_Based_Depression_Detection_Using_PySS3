I feel like my life has been a struggle because Iâ€™m inherently a bad person.Or broken or something. I try so hard to be friendly and a good person but it never seems like enough. And like Iâ€™m not even allowed to feel down/depressed because I feel like Iâ€™m entirely responsible for everything bad that ever happened to me (abuse, toxic relationships, etc.) I just want it to end. I want to be good enough. If I were good enough I wouldnâ€™t be so alone. 
I hate myself so much.
