I have been kicked out of my friend group today and this has been happening to me for years.Hi, Redditors, I am crying as I'm typing this post. Once again, I have been kicked out and left alone in school. My name is Trent and I am 14 years old (Freshman in high school). This is going to be a long post of the key events that have happened throughout my life and what has happened now, so please bare with me, reader. 

I've faced many betrayals throughout my life and because of that, I've come to believe that I have developed paranoia within me because I suffer from trust issues and I am getting fearful that everybody except my family is out to get me. A "friend" of mine who I will call Bryan, who I thought was one of my true friends in the 6th to 7th grade betrayed me mid-way through the 7th grade to become popular. He became popular due to pity because he was a very "nerdy" person that had social anxiety. When Bryan gained power throughout this school, he rounded everyone against me and accused me of bullying, which I hadn't done anything to him. He was made the victim and I was casted out by every group in that school. There, I was whisked away to the bottom of the "food chain" in middle school's social hierarchy. Pushed to the point where I had to be alone and I limited my speaking to teachers and everybody (isolating myself) from people in the school - a depressive/unsocial stage. 

Eventually, I repaired my reputation in the 8th grade, as Bryan had moved to Las Vegas, and I opened myself more to people and found a new group of friends who I thought were perfect for me. They shared the same political, religious, and other types of views as I did. We stayed together and were the best of friends until 9th grade (this year) came about. A new person to the group, who I will call Shane decided to join the group and seemed like a fine addition to our group and fit right in. I welcomed him into our group and shook hands with him, made him laugh, helped him in his time of need, etc. The same thing that I do for all of my friends. He found me to be a really great person until I found out that Bryan had returned to our school from Las Vegas. I was appalled that Bryan had returned to our school and I just told Shane my story with Bryan and I moved along my business. 

A few months later, Shane began to hate me unexpectedly, and was telling everybody else in the group that I started drama with Bryan in the 7th grade and just began to defend Bryan. He told the group our story and felt that it was my fault he betrayed me. He began claiming that I instigated the betrayal and that Bryan just wanted to get away from me. The group believed Shane and has just today told me that they are cutting all contact from me, because they don't want me to start drama. This is the part where I attempted to reason with them and that I am not going to start drama. Apparently, Shane was talking about me behind my back and was telling them that I'm a liar. My former "friends" had indeed cut me off and now, I had began to express myself on this website by this post.

I thank all of you for staying for the long post. I apologize that it is this long, but I really need people to understand me and to help me through this. I am crying because I'm just ashamed that I have to go through this whole cycle of being unsociable in high school and being depressed. I've been thinking of sitting alone for the rest of this school year. Right now, I ask for your help, readers. I hope I don't do anything to harm myself in any way. Anyways, I truly am appreciative for any help that you have given me and most of all, for understanding me and at least reading through what I had to say in this post. Thank you, everyone. And please, if you have any questions on anything, please ask me. Thank you, everyone, once again.
