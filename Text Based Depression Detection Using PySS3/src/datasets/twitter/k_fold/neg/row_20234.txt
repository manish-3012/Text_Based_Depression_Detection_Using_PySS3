i dont know what to do anymorehey. im in a really bad place right now. theres some family issues, some friend issues, some health issues, some brain issues... i think about killing myself almost every day.. iâ€™ve been clean from self harm for years but the past few months i just sometimes miss that feeling so much, so i do things to chase that high again. and im only 17. im about to go to college and room with someone who broke my heart, but im too afraid to ask for help.

i think i just need someone to tell me that theres a way out of this, cuz i keep looking around and im just not seeing one. im so afraid that in 5 years i will be the same person i am right now, with the same people and the same job and the same degree. i dont think anything scares me more.

im probably just being dramatic. i have therapy on wednesday. until then, i just have to keep trying, right?
