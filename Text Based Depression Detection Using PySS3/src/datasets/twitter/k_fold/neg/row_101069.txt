Got an idea, note by snap storyThey would finally know what I feel and think because they would have to listen. Each part a specific person. Short and to the point. Literally have nothing left to do  . I'm ignored, alone, and nothing is helping. I have no reason to live because all I live for is everyone else. What do I want,  what do I need,  what do I feel? Barely any one knows and even less have any idea on how to help
