I should be working right nowIâ€™ve posted here before on a different account that I since deleted because I thought I felt better. Here I am again. Iâ€™m struggling with pills and self harm. Iâ€™ve tried making positive changes but nothing sticks and from the bottom of my heart I donâ€™t feel like itâ€™s going to get better. Iâ€™m married to an incredible person who deserves nothing but the best and I am struggling with my self worth.  I feel like I lack in every single way. I can tell myself all I want that itâ€™s a phase, but I canâ€™t get myself to believe it and I just keep thinking â€œgotta get through this dayâ€ every day and at what point is that not worth it anymore?
