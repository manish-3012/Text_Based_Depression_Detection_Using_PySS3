Tomorrow after work, im going to finally do itIm fed up and tired of this now. The pain is too much for me, im tired of everything. Tired of the few people who say they are my friends but arent there when I actually need them. Im tired of feeling isolated, treated by society like a piece of shit. Bullied and not having many friends and not having any SO. Isolation is one of the worse things which is why we give criminals it, even if you hang around with bad people you dont feel as bad as being isolated. Im tired of not owning a family since half of them dont care for me and the ones who did are no longer here. Ive gone to commit before as you can probably see in one of my earlier posts but didnt because i was too considerate for others but im done now. why should i be considerate when no one irl is considerate for me. You guys are great on here, but there is only so much you can do.  I guess it just wasnt meant to be. I will reply when i can, as im at work in a few hours and then ill probably sleep before making my last journey on this earth. I want to wish you guys better futures because nothing is worse then feeling like this.
