So many documentaries about the struggle of those left behind from suicide. There isnâ€™t as much about the struggle of those who make the choice because of their struggles.I want to listen to you. I frequently have suicidal ideations. I want to hear from others who are depressed, struggling, and considering that option and I want to hear the story of how you feel and what itâ€™s like.  What feels unfixable for you? Even though it obviously seems like there is no realistic fix, is there a magic wand type situation that could help? My examples of things that are unrealistic, but would help No more financial worries, no more obligations of places to be where I look happy, someone to help me eat food so Iâ€™m not overwhelmed with what Iâ€™m going to eat, not being so worn down and fatigued because I donâ€™t have the ability to plan nutritional healthy food, being able to more easily figure out what Iâ€™m going to wear instead of every day beating my head against a wall because my weight fluctuates so much that I never know whatâ€™s going to fit. 

Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s more. How do the rest of you feel and what are the things that seem standard and easy by most standards that you struggle with?
