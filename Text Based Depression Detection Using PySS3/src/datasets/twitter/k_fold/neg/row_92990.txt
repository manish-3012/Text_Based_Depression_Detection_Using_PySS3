Panicking, i have till tomorrow to make a move.Im going insane. TL;DR: Im 20, totally normal, untill last night when i molested my best friend of a decade's girlfriend while drunk. No excuses, i  confessed when she confronted me. Shes also one of my best friends. Hes going to find out tomorrow, im a fucking monster. I have three options, run away, fucking kill myself, or try to face him, and face living with them.
