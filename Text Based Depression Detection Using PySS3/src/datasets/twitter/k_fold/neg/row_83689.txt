I've noticed a decline in my life now that I see a psycohologistBasically what the title says, I've been extremely suicidal for a while, and when I stopped going I've noticed my life was getting better for a while, now that I'm back in her office on the mondays I feel like a worm, she exposes my illness and digs into my mind.
The more she talks the more I notice how much I need help, the more she tells me I need help the more I feel depressed, the more I feel depressed the more I feel suicidal, I feel betrayed, she knows too much about me, she knows what makes me mad, I feel like she is using it against me, even tho I know she isn't
