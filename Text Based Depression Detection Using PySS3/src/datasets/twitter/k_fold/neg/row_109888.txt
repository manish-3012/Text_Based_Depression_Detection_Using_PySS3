Lost my son and just struggling to even eat This past week I lost my son to cancer. I'm struggling for groceries to live and my light bill is getting shut off tomorrow. All my savings were  used for expenses for medical and recent service cost for my sons treatments  while being on bed rest in hospital . Due to my job being a 30 day per hitch offshore job  in the oil field working away I had to choose my sons side and it was the father thing to do.. Is there anyway possible to Maybe borrow something for groceries and my light bill. I sincerely can pay it back on my first paycheck which will be in December. We get paid biweekly so since I don't go back until near 3 weeks it would be December 15 ish until I can pay back and will give more with any interest. 
I don't need free money I am requesting a loan to be able to survive. I just lost my world and beg you to help me.
Sorry if I bothered you 
Thanks dearly
