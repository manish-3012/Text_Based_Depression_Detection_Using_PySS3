A BucketListI have realised I don't wanna go through with all this ...
I am 35... I am not interested in living anymore.
But before dying I would like to complete my bucket list
1. Go abroad  for a vacation( for me from India, going abroad I a very big deal)
2. Have a proper sexual intercourse (consider myself virgin, although a childhood incident )
3. For one day, live as if there is no tomorrow (No inhibitions)

I have this year to do it. Let's hope I achieve them.
