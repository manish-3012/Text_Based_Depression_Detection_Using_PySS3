I keep making excuses and Iâ€™m tired of itIâ€™ve been trying to kill myself for the past several weeks but every time I try I just think â€œIâ€™ll do it laterâ€ or â€œtomorrow is some random persons wedding I canâ€™t do that to themâ€ and my favorite â€œI donâ€™t want my supervisor to think I just didnâ€™t want to work todayâ€ I put my gun against my forehead and put my finger on the trigger and Iâ€™m ready to do it but I keep making excuses.. I got shitfaced drunk last night so I could do it without thinking much but I still couldnâ€™t.  Iâ€™m probably just gonna pull the trigger fast instead of slowly pushing my thumb down.
