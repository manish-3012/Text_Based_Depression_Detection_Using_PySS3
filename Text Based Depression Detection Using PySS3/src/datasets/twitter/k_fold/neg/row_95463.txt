The Bottle BrokeNot a month goes by where I think about killing myself. I try and I try and I try to make people happy and comfort them and be friends but it never works out. I don't know if it's because of what I say or do. I feel like I'm just a nuisance to everyone and I haven't effected their lives at all positively despite me trying to be friendly or give them a laugh. Here's the thing, I never told anyone about it for years.  No one knew I was suffering at the hands of my own mind. I overthink everything, I get anxious easily, I have a side of me that is fucking up my life because of my anger, I hurt myself to see if I can still feel or just because I deserve it.  I've never told anyone, not even my girlfriend who is now an ex because I fucked up and failed in the relationship. She was part of the reason j had second thoughts about ending it all, how would she react, how would my family react, how would my friends react. Now that's all gone, and my family isnt supportive of me and are too blinded by their bullshit to see that I'm in pain and that they're part of the reason I'm depressed and hopeless. God I'm such a fuck up. I can't keep anyone happy. I've bottled it up for years because I didn't want to self diagnose myself and have it be fake and I didn't want anyone having pity or empathy and instead have them focus on their happiness. I know not everything can be sunshine and rainbows and no one can be happy all the time, but even for a few seconds a day, a laugh or a smile can make a day better. I've tried that for other people, to make them happy for a second or smile for a bit, but now that's gone. I couldn't keep her happy because I wasn't trying enough. My family looks at me different now because of my meds. All this bottled up, and now the bottle broke. I don't know what to do anymore.
