I don't think I can do itI can't explain what happened. let's just say it was traumatic and unexplainable. If I tell anyone, they just think I'm crazy and it was a psychotic episode. It fucking wasn't. I know what happened. I don't think I can cope with it. I can't talk to anyone about it. I am fucking consumed. Everything I was has dissapeared. I have no fucking clue what I am and how I'm going to get over this. I think I have to kill myself.
