My days are numbered now, I'm dead set on committing suicide - is there any reason why not?My days are numbered now, I'm dead set on committing suicide - is there any reason why not? I know people close to me will be absolutely distraught but surely they wouldn't want me around knowing the suffering, pain, self-hatred and guilt I was feeling? 

I understand this subreddit's angle is meant to be such a way to persuade or to help people see that suicide isn't the only solution, but what if it truly is the only solution? I often see the common narrative that "suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem". If the problem is also permanent and has the effect such as to ruin ones life I believe it's justified.

I'll throw up another post here and on another subreddit before I go just to say goodbye, but for now I just wanted to see if there's anything I'm not in the right state of mind to see right now. I have a couple ideas as per a suicide plan, I've been keeping notes and documenting my thoughts and feelings throughout the process which I'll attach when I go.

I don't want to commit suicide as such, I wish I was able to experience life just like everyone else but I am unable because I'm fucked up and my brain doesn't work properly. I'm a plague to this earth and I wished that my life could've been given to someone else. I've ruined all my potential and lost all my friends. I have nothing left, no direction, no future, nothing to keep going for. Coupled with my cocktail of mental health issues, it makes for a bad time to say the least :)

I've been having suicidal thoughts as symptom of the things I am suffering from for half a decade and I have attempted once already. This time I will not use the same method as I have since taken care to ensure the way I will go will not take too long or cause agony. I do not enjoy life and I have nothing to live for.

Thank you for reading, I'll put a TL;DR below.

TL;DR - My life is ruined, I'm fucked up, my brain is utterly fucked up. Suicide is not a permanent solution to a temporary problem in my case, it is a permanent solution to a permanent problem, thus freeing me from my everlasting nightmare and suffering that I can only imagine will deeply upset people who care about me but I am unsure whether they would want me alive knowing how much pain I am in. It's been a long time coming after my previous attempt and half a decade of suicidal thoughts. I do not enjoy life and I have nothing to live for.
