End my painI don't know why I fucked everything up so badly but I did ... It started out with me wanting a break from my boyfriend so that I could find a therapist to help me with my bipolar disorder.. But over the break I cheated on him with an older man and I ruined our relationship .. Along the way , recently , it seems like I've been messing up everything in my life. Just my presence makes people feel sad. I cannot help that I sometimes feel sad without reason, I can't delete the scars on my arm, I can't hide my pain anymore.. It seems like the world turned on me all at once. I wish I wasn't so fucked up and I think my death will leave many people feeling relieved because they are better off without me. I've tried so hard to be perfect, perfect in the eyes of my mother , my friends , teachers, but I just don't have the strength anymore. I will NEVER be enough , and I learn that more and more everyday. The world we live in truly is a cruel place.. I think I'll kill myself this week, but the thought of living after I swallow a bottle of pills is what stops me. I wish it was easier.
