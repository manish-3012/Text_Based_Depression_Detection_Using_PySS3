A step out of syncSo in the past few weeks Iâ€™ve realized a lot of things.  I wonâ€™t be able to afford the dr visits nor the meds Iâ€™m on. While I have some of the best friends on the planet I feel like a broken record to them and I think Iâ€™m starting push them away. Iâ€™m ready to sell all my stuff, not that I have much any more.  I believe Iâ€™m subconsciously preparing for the inevitable. 

Iâ€™m to old and to broken. No one wants damaged goods. 

I feel myself slipping away one day at a time.
