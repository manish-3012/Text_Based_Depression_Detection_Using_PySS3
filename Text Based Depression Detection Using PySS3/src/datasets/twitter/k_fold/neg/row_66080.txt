I honestly don't know if I can continue living this way.I don't know if I can continue like this, Every time I do anything wrong, my parents flame me to shit for every little thing. They expect so highly of me, they think I can be such a good person, and they always say they *love* me, but in all honesty, I can't feel that love. They are all just pieces of trash in my head. They don't do anything to make me feel better. If I do anything great, they will find a way to make me feel worse, by changing the subject or something of the sort. I'm depressed and considering suicide, and I don't want to, but I do. I have friends in my class on suicide watch-lists, and I don't want to be added onto there, but - I don't even know if i can/should continue living this shitty life- all I get is trash, I slowly but surely am loosing friends, and I just have nothing to loose anymore. My grades are going down- and my parents are killing me for it, but I have zero motivation anywhere to even attempt to get them up- ever. I know that I can get them up, but I don't want to. My mind understands things, but doesn't ever do anything. My friend recently attempted suicide, and she survived it, but it made me want to just kill myself more. 

I'm not sure what to do.
