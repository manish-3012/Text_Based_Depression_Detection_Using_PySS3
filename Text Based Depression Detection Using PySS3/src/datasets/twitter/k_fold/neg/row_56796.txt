Why does everyone say, "it will get better?"I remember the first time I felt depressed. I was around 12 and got my first phone, I was talking to my friends and one day told them I don't know what to live for anymore. I felt like I had given up. They told me to chin up, that I was only 12 and there was so much to live for. It really hasn't changed, I keep hearing that same answer. You're only 17, it will get better. You're only 18, it will get better. Why the fuck am I told this? Is there a justification? Did they wake up one day and said, oh look, life is better! No? Yes? I have been suicidal for years and no one told me how to get through the suffering, how to cope with it. How can I look to a few years from now when I can't even look through one day? How can I look through a telescope when the glass is broken? I feel angered by it all, by the depression and anxiety, by everyone telling me not to worry. Why couldn't I just die in peace when I had that gun to my head? Why was I so scared to pull that trigger? Where is my hope now, where has it gone? Am I just a man watching the street, waiting for something interesting to actually happen? 

I apologize for this I just had a lot on my chest. I'm just done with life.
