cant think of a titleIm 52 and pretty much at the end of my rope. I have a family. a wife and two kids. I sadly lost my job a few years ago and cannot seem to find work. No one wants to hire the older guy it seems. My son is now off living his own life and my daughter just seems to resent me these days.  My wife and I are no longer in love, even tho she tell s me she loves me its obvious to me she doesnt. 
Ive been taken for granted for way too long, either that or I have outlived my usefulness. Funny thing is Im kind of active on this sub under my other name. 

Ive been feeling like ending my life for awhile now and have a plan. I guess im just waiting for that final confirmation that Im sure is just around the corner. I stopped believing in second chances a few years ago. This world will break you down over time. It did with me anyway. I dont have any other family to turn to for help and Im tired of being a burden. At least they will get my life insurance. ( and for those who will say policies dont pay for suicides, dont waste your time)
Thanks for reading and sorry for rambling
