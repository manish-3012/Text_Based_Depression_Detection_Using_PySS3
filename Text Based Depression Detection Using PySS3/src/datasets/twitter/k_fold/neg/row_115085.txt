I just don't know what to do...Since I have never posted here I guess I'll start off from the beginning. I am a 19 year old male who has PTSD. My PTSD has been treatment resistant so far and I have been getting treatment for about a year now. I was officially diagnosed when I was 18, but I have been having flashbacks since I was 15.

My therapist said this is the last legal treatment she can perform. If this doesn't work I'm down to three options. 1) Go the illegal route with her and buy the purest MDMA I can find and go to therapy and try it with that (I'm not sure about all the details about this so I don't know what would happen). 2) Move away to get away from everything that reminds me of that past event. 3) Suicide.

I don't mind trying the MDMA treatment, but it is an amphetamine, and amphetamines (granted MDMA isn't in the same class of amphetamines) played a huge role in my PTSD and I'm not sure how I will react if it comes down to that. If I puss out, then I will either have to live on with the constant nightmares and flashbacks that affect my daily life. If I don't puss out and it still doesn't work then I am left with moving away or suicide. That is the difficult part. I moved away from one area once where it all happened and now I am having to move again and I am so fucking tired. I find myself constantly thinking about slitting my throat or what would be the least messy way to go out if it comes down to it. I don't know why I wrote this, probably a cry for help since I hate letting people that I know what I am thinking and feeling and the one time I tried to they turned it into making me feel selfish for wanting to end all of the suffering. Whatever I have a day marked for where I make the decision for the first three. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post as well as for how scattered this post is.
