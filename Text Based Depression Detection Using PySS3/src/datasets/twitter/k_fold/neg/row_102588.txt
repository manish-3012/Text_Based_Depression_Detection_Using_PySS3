It's only going to get worse.Preface this by saying: I'm not on any drugs or alcohol. Maybe I *ought* to be. I don't know.





I woke up at 1 AM after falling asleep at around 11 PM, after pulling an all nighter. My insomnia has made this normal for me, and it's been going on for about 2 months now. Significant because as soon as I awoke, I had the most fucked up panic attack of my life.


I'm utterly depressed and perpetually anxious but I've attempted to conceal this in order to avoid reactions such as the one I recieved from a PANIC hotline - misinterpretations of my current situation, obviously solvable by going to a hospital: **no**.



- My mom and honestly, my last source of support was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer very recently. I can't do much but smile and assure her everything is okay - she can't be stressed or bothered in any way due to how frail she currently is.


- Left a two year engagement on **extremely** bad terms.


- Dealing with chronic pain from an accident that's worsened substantially over the last month due to another incident.


- Had to move within very short notice; was immensely stressful and caused a breakdown at the end of it.


- Dealt with social issues that included stalking, harassment, etc.


- Had to stop seeing my psychiatrist - as a result was stopped on my prescriptions of 5+ years.



- Financial situation went from affluent to currently considering food banks and moving to a less costly state that where I am, and have grown up my entire life: California. May I have to move back in with parents after 3 years of being on my own.



- Grandfather passed.



- Grandmother very ill, looking as if she may pass as well - currently hospitalized.


- Had to drop my school year to attend chemo sessions with my mother. 


- Childhood dog was put down due to complications with her colitis. 




- Being physically hit by a family member. My younger sister is as well. This family member HAS to be around however, because my mom needs them. (Non-sarcastic.)

Life is pretty terrible right now. And, I suffered from an intense panic attack earlier tonight, on top of it. Which resulted in me dashing from my bed at 1 AM to attempting to open my car door desperately, despite not having my keys, all while assuming I was about to die/have a mental breakdown. I sort of did have the latter, in retrospect.


How in the world do I cope?


I can't/won't turn to friends. I'm afraid to.


Also... Honestly, I'm scared that if I do, it'll make me run away, like I really want to at the moment.
My mom could die. 


I know I'm the type of person who would run away if given the option. I can't have options.


&amp; beyond that, right now I can't afford taking my attention away from her either; I ended a few tentative relationships for this reason, but now find myself absurdly alone and isolated emotionally.


My sister doesn't know just how bad the situation is, and I've been forbidden to let her know. I'm envious. She doesn't have it easy, but she has it easier. 


At times, although not suicidal upfront, I feel apathetic towards living. Which makes me very confused when I was terrified about dying during my panic attack - after gathering myself, I don't see dying as a scary thing at all, but one that comforts me. I've felt this way very strongly for the past two months, and especially so now. sometimes the thought of dying is the only thing that calms me down enough to sleep. 


Totally fucked up, I guess? I don't know anymore. 



I can't afford professional therapy/help and hospitalizations, even ones where I don't check in myself will cost a fortune, which honestly would make my situation worse, such as causing me to be unable to afford food or rent afterwards. It would make life unbearable, if right now it's just a misery.



Life is only bound to get more difficult as my mom grows more frail/chemo's side effect occur, and mentally I'm not strong enough to deal with this. I haven't had ONE moment to breathe between these awful life events. Not a single moment, and again, the only thing that comforts me is the knowledge that if this gets any more painful, I don't *have* to keep going on. 


Part of me, from being educated in psychology objectively understands how bad of a sign contentment is when discussing the subject of ending one's life. I figured I could at least see if anyone had suggestions on alternatives, because I'm honestly at the end of my rope. 



Why would life be worth living?
