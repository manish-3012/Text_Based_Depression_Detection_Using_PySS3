How should I handle someone whoâ€™s solution to everything in his live is suicide?Every problem that happens to him he start raving about ending his live, it has been 3 years but every time he has a fight with family, problem at work, lately he lost one of his cats and been like that until the cat came back
Two days ago another cat of his died and thatâ€™s all what heâ€™s been saying
