I actually smiled a bitI was thinking about how I eventually learned to cut myself in weird places so no one would question the random slices. 

Before that, I would give my mother ridiculous excuses if she saw cuts on my arms or wrists. I always laughed at her behind her back for believing my stories. 
Then I thought about how my bf would totally believe the exact same lies, even though I have told him about the random excuses I told my mother. Lol. 

I was planning to to cut somewhere hidden again, but I would rather be able to see it. It reminds me of what I am, and it comforts me. I am pretty good at making sure that I don't end up with scars now. 

It's been a really really long time. It took me a while to find my pack of knives. I also found my pack of needles, so I am going to wake up with a few new piercings in the morning as well. I could never actually kill myself with a knife. It's more of a suicide prevention. Not that I would recommend this whatsoever. 

I dream of going to sleep and and never waking up. But I am too scared of pills failing. Fml.
