I just need some adviceI'm so overwhelmed and tired and angry and sad and there's so much going on in my head that I have quite literally thought about ending it multiple times today and I just need ways to feel a little better. I dont have the money for a therapist, I have no friends to talk to, and very few people would miss me if I went through with it.
