Struggling to find a reasonI'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I'm struggling to find a reason to live, just wanted to get this off my chest.

Background: I'm 17y/o and I've had a fairly good life. You could say I'm fairly "popular" at my school, whatever that means anyway, but I've never excelled at anything I've always been average at everything I do never the best at anything. I'm not even sure if I'm suicidal right now but i have thought about it multiple times. It's just that when I really think about it...what's the point of living? I mean all I do is schoolwork and sleep and eat. It's a boring routine that'll only lead me to another boring routine when I find a job and graduate, sure I'll have some good times but the good times will be forgotten and then I'll grow older maybe have kids and then I'll die. But what is the point? There's no end game, no reason, except to pass on your genes and have kids and they will die and be forgotten and I'm just really struggling to find any reason at all to continue with this boring, normal life.
