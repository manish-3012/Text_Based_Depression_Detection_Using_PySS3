Will never amount to anything.I really have no idea what I want or want to do. I tried to do many different things that people expected of me. I failed in all. There are people who love me n care. But that just makes me feel even more ashamed of myself. I will never be able to take care of them. I'm living off my family like a leech. I try to forget all n start afresh. But soon loose momentum. I start thinking abt the failures and realise no matter what I do I will fail. Then I have to face all these people again. I wish I was some dumb person. No one would have put so much expectations on me. I'm not dumb. I'm not extra smart either. May be not death. But I wish people even my family forget I exist. It would be good for all.
