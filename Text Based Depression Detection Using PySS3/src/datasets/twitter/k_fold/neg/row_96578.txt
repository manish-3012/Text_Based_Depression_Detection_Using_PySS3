My cousins random questionI have a cousin, who i love dearly. She is 12(im 13) so we hang out alot. Both of us are depressed, but once, as we were walking to the park, she said something like "Cente, do you ever feel like you want to kill someone?" Thinking she was joking, i said "Yes, people who are cruel to me". She then said "what would it feel like to be murdered by someone else?" . I stopped walking for a second. Looked at her and she had an empty expression on her face. I just thought to myself, why? But then it hit me, as sky was sociopathic (similar to me, but i have more self control) she would quiet happily kill any of my or her bullys. I started walking again, and sang "HUSHH" to her, she sang along and we forgot about the question. (She's homeschooled by the way, so your all fine)
