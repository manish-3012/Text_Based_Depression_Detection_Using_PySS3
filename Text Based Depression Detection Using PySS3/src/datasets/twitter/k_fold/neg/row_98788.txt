I physically canâ€™t commit suicide right now, but I donâ€™t have a reason not to the first chance I getIâ€™ll probably feel better in the morning, and hopefully my erratic posts will be gone by then. But now itâ€™s all hitting me that Iâ€™m probably gonna be alone for the rest of my life and Iâ€™m probably gonna die that way.

I had a dream I died alone in my car one day. Nobody even found me for a couple of days. My family would be concerned if I were to die in my car one day. But then I wouldnâ€™t have to burden them anymore financially and with my terrible housekeeping habits.

Thereâ€™s no point in living if I have to do it alone. Thereâ€™s no fun. Thereâ€™s only loneliness and the negativity of the world around me
