Jokes arenâ€™t jokes anymoreâ€œLol I guess Iâ€™ll just kill myselfâ€

â€œRIP me I guessâ€

â€œYeet time to dieâ€

â€œHhaha. Kill meâ€

Suicide never seemed like an option.

It was always a punchline

A little jab to casually imply a desperate need for help and attention but always knowing in the back of my mind that Iâ€™d never actually do it. Always just out of reach with plenty of plausible deniability to veil the reality from my loved ones.

Itâ€™s not a fucking joke anymore.

Iâ€™ve denied my real feelings for so long and pasted over my issues with fucking jokes.

Now nobody believes me.

Itâ€™s just another joke.

Itâ€™s always a joke.

Iâ€™m a fucking joke.

Iâ€™m just not the one laughing anymore.
