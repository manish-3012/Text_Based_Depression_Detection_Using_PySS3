Elliott Smith and a Subway trainIâ€™ll sneak out, and walk to the nearest station. My subway card has been loaded with just enough money to get where I want to go. Iâ€™ll board, ride to a specific station, then get out. Iâ€™ll start the playlist I made with a bunch of my favorite Elliott Smith songs. I like how perfectly hopeless and mellow and calm his music is. His voice is angry and sad, but resigned. He knew his fate, and accepted it. Iâ€™ll wait until I see the next train arriving. Then, Iâ€™ll jump when itâ€™s still fast enough to kill me. Iâ€™ve recently come to terms with the fact that this is the only way to make everything go away. My parents will be okay eventually- once they realize how much better their lives are without me. Itâ€™ll be like a burden has been lifted off their shoulders. Iâ€™m resigning to my fate.
