I am a failureI am a horrible father and an even worse husband I canâ€™t do anything right. I donâ€™t feel anything anymore the mask that I wear everyday is starting to fall away. I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. I want to divorce my wife so that I can get away from her and the kids so that I can just end this. The pain in my head is excruciating I want to hide from everyone and disappear.
