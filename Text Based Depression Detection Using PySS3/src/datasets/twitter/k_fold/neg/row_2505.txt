I donâ€™t know what to do.Iâ€™m 17. I have been having suicidal thoughts since I was 15. At first, I told myself I just wanted attention but itâ€™s got to the point where Iâ€™m up every night, thinking about how much I hate myself and wishing I were dead. 

I tried to contact a teen suicide prevention line, but I donâ€™t have money for a phone plan so there is no way for me to talk to them. 

Maybe this is all for attention, Iâ€™m not sure. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
