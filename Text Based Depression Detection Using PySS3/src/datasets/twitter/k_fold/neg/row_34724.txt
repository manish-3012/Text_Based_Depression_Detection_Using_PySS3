I am so lost..please helpI don't know what to do. I am a physically disabled, very chronically ill thirty-something year old female who has been through two terrible divorces. I am currently trapped in an often abusive engagement to a guy whom I very strongly believe has been unfaithful to me, because despite completely negative STD test results a few months ago, I still have severe unexplainable symptoms that only align with that of an STD. I have no friends nor family to turn to for help. My partner and I have lived with his mother for a couples of years now, and of course, she believes that her son, despite abusing me and leaving me during our fights, would never cheat. Yes, he gets defensive and rageful when confronted about prospect of cheating. He is a narcisist. 
My mother passed away on my birthday last month, and my father and I simply do not get along at all, on any level. Please don't suggest that I should "bite the bullet and go stay with my Dad or other family". I have tried that several times in the past whenever my other relationships when downhill. It was a disaster, another sort of hell I cannot handle either. No, I do not use Facebook. I quite literally have nowhere to turn. I am about to begin counselling next week which simply means taking to another complete stranger about all of my problems. She will not understand the complexity of my circumstances. I cannot stay at a shelter because I am considered a liability. The fact is, I am stuck here with "him", STD or not. The only way out of this is death.
