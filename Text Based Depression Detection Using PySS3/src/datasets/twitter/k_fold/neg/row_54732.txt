Yet another post.I've posted here several times before which I guess is a good thing and a bad thing. For one, I'm still alive but the thoughts keep coming back. And they're coming back more and more each day. It's gotten to the point where every breath I breathe comes out as a sigh. There are so many ways to explain why, but at the core of it all, I'm just lazy and stupid. No simpler way to explain it. I feel like a waste. I shouldn't've been born in the first place. It wouldn't've made a difference. Oh, and I'm 15. I've already been told I'm too young to end it so early but those words can only last me for so long. It encompasses my thoughts. Eventually it encompasses how I see my future. And it looks fucking bleak. I just want someone here for me. Like literally here. With me. I feel like that'll make me feel a little better. But I don't know, it's practically guaranteed now that I'll go back to feeling like this regardless of any form of help. It'd be easier for me to go.. I hate myself for thinking like this. Which only makes everything worse. Aaaahhhhhhh. Fuck me.

TL;DR I'm completely obliterated when it comes to hope, pride, and optimism. I have no idea what to do anymore.

Too depressed to even check my spelling and grammar in that last chunk o' text so forgive me for any errors.
