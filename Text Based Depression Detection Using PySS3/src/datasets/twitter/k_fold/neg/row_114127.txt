I lost the girl I was to propose too.Throwaway here. I lost my girlfriend of nearly 3 years by a night of stupidity on my part. I had planned on proposing to her in 2 weeks on the celebration of our 3rd anniversary.

I met up with her after a day/night of drinking and was acting like an idiot. Left the bar and went home. She has no not given me any contact. She has just sent me texts telling me to leave her alone, and that were done. She's dropped all my stuff off that was at her place as well. She won't take my calls and has blocked my number. I had planned and bought tickets to a trip to San Diego where I was planning on proposing. She knew of the trip, I already had the hotel booked and everything. Now she tells me if I don't stop contacting she will contact authorities and file harassment charges. This was the love of my life, she completely has shut me out and I can't do anything about it. I've driven to her place and knocked to no reply. I obviously had nothing else to do as I am in no place to do something stupid and go to jail, i'm smarter then that. 

Now the same day after my drunken stupidity, my father (my best friend) was admitted to the hospital he suffered a stroke. 

I have no one to go to, I don't have the 2 closest people in my life right now and I just don't feel like anything is worth living for. I don't like my job, all my friends are caught up in their own lives and their own career and I'm hardly as close to them as I used to be. My girlfriend &amp; my family has been my life. And I feel like I've lost any will to live at this point.
