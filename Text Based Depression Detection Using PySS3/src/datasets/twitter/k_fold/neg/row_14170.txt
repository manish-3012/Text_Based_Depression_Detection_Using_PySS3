I don't know who to turn toI don't know how to properly word things right now because my mind isn't working very well, but I need help, maybe just comforting words from a stranger, anything would help right now. 
The person I've been in love with for five years just left me. I think it may be for good. 
It was my fault. 
I feel like part of me is gone. I feel like someone I love more than anything has died. I'm terrified. 
At this moment, I can't imagine continuing to live. I know there's a lot to live for, but right now I don't think I can do it without him. 
I feel physically sick and mostly just scared at the thought of living my life without him. 
It doesn't seem real. 
I feel like I'm in a daze, I don't know what I'm doing, I'm sorry for rambling. I don't even know if I'm posting in the right place. 
Any comments will be appreciated. I just need to distract myself because im scared of what I might do in this state. 
All I want is for this to be a bad dream.
