I want to end my life but I'm tornI'm 29 and live with my parents. That right there should be enough to tell you how badly I've fucked my life up.

I don't feel like a victim, I know I'm the one who's done this to myself. There's too many failures in my life to list, but suffice it to say it ended up with me in this position right now. I've actually had a positive attitude recently and have been applying to jobs with several interviews, some which I knew went well, but with zero results. 

My only deterrent to suicide would be that I know how bad it would hurt my parents, but I fear that I will eventually cross that line. I don't want to be a burden to them anymore, and all I've been is a disappointment to them my entire life. 

I just see no way to improve my life at this point. I can't stand the fact that I live with my parents at this age and further accentuate my disappointment upon them, but I still deep down have the need to get out of this hole I am in. But I just can't see any way through, and feel like I'm near the point of just ending the burden I am upon them.

I'm sorry for the long post, I don't know if anyone will read it but I appreciate it if anyone does.
