I am doneLife has pretty much backed me into a corner and Ive run out of options.
I lost my job 5 years ago because an ex from long ago decided to make good on  her threat of ruining my life. She contacted my employer and  made up a story about me meeting women and then raping them.

The police were involved and it went no where because NOTHING HAPPENED.

I have not been able to recover from this. My entire personality has changed and I am now terrified of so many situations. After five years its still hard for me to even leave the house.

I cannot continue living like this. No matter what I do I cannot catch a break nor can I seem to find a job. I do however have life insurance and if I die my family will at least get that. 
I have this planned and it will not look like suicide so no worries there.
 Ive really learned who my friends are and Ive also learned no one wants anything to do with you when youre down
