Hopeless, hurt, and aloneI have no purpose, there is no one that needs me, no one that sees me, not even my best friend. I am single and have tried dating apps, only to be told by guys that â€˜Iâ€™m not what they are looking forâ€™, â€˜I have an interesting lookâ€™. So much rejection by people I donâ€™t even know, my best friend, my job. My heart is so hurt that I have physical heart pain. I have stopped eating because whatâ€™s the point. There is no one who would even notice I was gone until Monday when I didnâ€™t show up for work and they would be pissed I wasnâ€™t there because it would be an inconvenience for everyone else. I have gone days without someone texting me. I reach out to people but they are too busy to respond back. There is no point to live another day with this pain, I just want it to stop.
