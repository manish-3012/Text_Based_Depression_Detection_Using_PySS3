I got everything I wanted and lost all sense of friendship, camaraderie, and belonging along the way. I'm more suicidal now than I was before.I'm a game developer, and I'm making a game now and I'm really, really proud of it! A lot of people like it, I've been able to form a business around it, I have a great dev team, they're all very talented people. I might be able to get the game published next year. 

But I honestly want to kill myself, and I'm sure that when I finish the game, I'll be at an even higher risk of doing so than I am now. The game really does feel like the only thing I have left to hold onto anymore. And I hate the game as much as I'm proud of it. I've lost so much ever since I started working on this, and the amount of time and money that the game requires prevents me from doing...anything else. 

People are complaining about being stuck in doors for a few months from quarantine. I haven't left my desk in two *years*.

And I don't want to hear any "just drop the game and live your life" speeches. I can't, and I'm too tired to explain why. Just suffice it to say that the only reason I made this game was because I ran out of every other option in my life and thought to myself "fuck it, I'll make a game." This *is* my last option for surviving in a capitalistic society.

Anyway, I hate the game, but it's not why I *really* want to kill myself. I want to kill myself because I'm so goddamn alone. I don't have any close friends, I don't have anyone I can connect with, I don't have anyone who I feel like "gets me," as a human being. I'm the third wheel in every friendship I have. Everyone else is BFFs with each other or dating each other, I'm the only single person in the group. And it's not for lack of trying! I keep trying to date, I keep trying to reach out to people, I keep *trying* to find a friend I can be close to. And I keep failing. For thirty goddamn years, I've been failing at finding a human connection over and over and over again.

I'm so tired. I'm so tired of being alone. I'm so tired of being misunderstood. I give up. I'm going to just, finish this game and end it.

At least I'll have a few months to sort out my legal affairs and find someone to give the rights to.
