I donâ€™t know what to do.For 4 years, it seems like there hasnâ€™t been a single day where Iâ€™ve been happy and content by the end of the day. For the 6 months Iâ€™ve been getting therapy, and itâ€™s helped a good amount. I went from thinking of suicide everyday to thinking of it every third day (not actually, just estimating) which felt like a good improvement for me. But now covid-19 is in my province, and even though thereâ€™s only 4 or 5 presumptive cases, everything is closing. Including where Iâ€™m going for therapy. Because of this, Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™ll have no one to talk to. I donâ€™t know what to do. The last couple of days, everything has went downhill. Hockey helped me get out of the house and stay active and Iâ€™d watch NHL to distract me from problems in my life, but the NHL season was suspended and all of minor hockey in canada is shut  down. And now, after march break, school is closed for another 2 weeks. I feel like I should be happy about it, but school was really the only reason I still get out of bed (hockey was another reason but like I said it was shut down). And I know that I said I want people to talk to, but it never feels the same doing it online. I just needed to vent. Thanks for those that read this whole thing.
