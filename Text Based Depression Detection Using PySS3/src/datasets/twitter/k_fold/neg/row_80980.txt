Why do I even bother?Everyone seems so happy when Iâ€™m around them. Filled with laughter and joy while Iâ€™m dwelling on past mistakes that haunt me everyday. Why do I even bother to try to go to school when all I think about is sleeping and dying, but cant do either? Iâ€™ve made mistakes in my life that have stopped me from living the future that I so desperately wanted but couldnâ€™t achieve. Iâ€™ve lost a lot of my motivation to really do anything recently. A lot of it stems from the trauma that Iâ€™ve endured as a kid starting before I was even born. Parents fighting constantly like they were about to murder each other. Drug addiction to the point where I havenâ€™t seen my father in over two years. Worries of dad going to jail and dealing with my unstable mother. Itâ€™s literally just a cycle of going to school dealing with kids who act like theyâ€™re better than you and point that out when they talk to you because they have better grades, trying to make you feel inferior especially when itâ€™s true, after that I go to my broken home where I would drain out the constant screaming in my headphones while on my computer. Why canâ€™t I be like my friends? With the other friends they have, the happiness that they show everyday, fulfilling goals with good grades, Dream schools and a future that will be fun and enjoyable. Even the teachers and janitors are more optimistic than me and my school is just depressing in general.
