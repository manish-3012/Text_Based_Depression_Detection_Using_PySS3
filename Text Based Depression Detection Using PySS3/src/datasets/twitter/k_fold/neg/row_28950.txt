I know my life doesn't matterHave you ever felt so incredibly in despair that every breath feels like you're heaving for oxygen? Like you're drowning, and wondering how you can be so lonely when there are 7 billion people in the world?

The only thing keeping my sanity in check now is the fact I could take my life at any time I want to. I feel a distinct sense of calmness in this vast ocean by imagining no more pain, no more gasping for breath, no more living. It's easier to run.
