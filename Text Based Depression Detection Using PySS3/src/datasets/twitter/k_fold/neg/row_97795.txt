I deserve to dieI'm not going to be poetic about, so I'll be blunt. I don't deserve to live anymore. I don't want to die, but I should. I have no one that understands. No one will listen. I'm just making this up, right? That's what some think. I should fade into darkness and never be seen again. I don't know why I keep posting here across multiple accounts and expect someone to fix all my problems. Simply reading positive messages won't help.
