I dont want to do anything anymoreI just hate that everything I've done in life is a failed attempt. I just want to sit and hide. I am a compulsive liar and I sabotage everything around me. I probably have a personality disorder of some sort and can never set my life straight. I'm late for work, drunk like I have been for 4 days, and I think instead of going I'm just going to lay on the ground in my bathroom and chug all of the alcohol I have in my house and cut my wrists open.
