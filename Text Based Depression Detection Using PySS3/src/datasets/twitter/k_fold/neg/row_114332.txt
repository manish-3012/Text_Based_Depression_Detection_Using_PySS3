How to move onHow do you move on when you lose something even after you did everything you could to keep it? It seems like my entire life I've fought so hard to keep good things around but then I'm forced to give it up despite my best efforts. Is it just that I've always been fighting for the wrong things or am I really just too weak? I thought if I tried as hard as I could things would get better but it's been 10 years and things are only getting worse. I've resigned myself to believing that I've lived the fullest life I could at this point and there's no reason to bother hanging on. I doubt it will help but I've clearly got no one else to turn to, even just for idle chat, so I'd appreciate hearing what you all have done to move on from things like this.
