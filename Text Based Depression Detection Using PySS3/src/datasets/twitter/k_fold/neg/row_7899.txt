SorryI'm not here for advice I'm here to say sorry. I feel like when I was held at gunpoint at my lowest point a couple years ago it should've been the end, everyone told me things would get better. I have nobody now to tell me anything or even talk to me. I failed everyone most of all my family and they are the only reason I stuck around this long. I can't live knowing the only people who sorta care have to because I'm related. My story will be the kid who was bullied early on, alone in high school. Sold drugs and finally thought I made friends. Lost the only person who loved me because she found out I cross dressed, got raped and robbed, moved away and failed yet again at being someone. I hate who I am and nobody will accept me, even if nobody reads this at least I had some way of releasing what's been eating me alive. Good luck everyone. 13 minutes.
