I don't think I can go on any longer...Hey there Reddit. I'm a sixteen year old male and I live in the United States.


This is my first post here, so I hope you'll hear me out. I hope you'll also understand why I think I can't go on any longer. This is my story, and it's a long one... so please bare with me.


So... I think I first started becoming depressed when I was a little kid. The earliest I remember feeling this way was when I found out my dad was cheating on my mom... I was a little kid, so I played a lot of those free to play online games, like Club Penguin and stuff. I signed up for a new game that looked cool and used my dad's email because I needed a parents approval. I didn't want to wait to play my new game until my parents woke up (it was early in the morning; I woke up early as a child) and my dad's email was already signed in, so I logged in and went to go confirm the email so I could start playing... I see messages from Craigslist in the inbox... I get curious and click on one because I'm a little kid and naturally curious...that's when my childhood was ruined. I see a nude picture of a woman with her legs spread...typing explicit messages to my dad, asking him to do explicit things...I click out and see a lot more from other women and even a guy... I also notice a Yahoo Messenger window is opened where he's in a bunch of chats with other women and men he wants to have sex with... Even with me being like 8 or 9, I realized what was going on... My dad was cheating on my mom. I was immediately devastated, depressed, and sick to my stomach. I knew this wasn't right...and that I had to tell my mom...but I was afraid of my Dad...he would yell at me and hate me...I finally work up the courage a year later to tell my mom...my dad calls me a liar and says I want to ruin their marriage. My mom doesn't believe me at all...she goes to check the computer for the emails...but they aren't there... because my Dad had deleted them to cover his tracks... A few months pass and I catch him on Craigslist; trying to find new people to cheat on my mom with... I tell my mom right away this time... He tells her he was actually on the laptop section of the site... looking to buy me a new computer... This is an obvious lie because I saw the nude pictures on the screen... but my mom believes him and he buys me a new computer to make his lie seem true... The last time I caught him was a few weeks later, when the cable box reported that someone had ordered $15 worth of porn channels for one night... I showed my mom because I was confused about it. She confronted my dad, who blamed it on me and said I ordered all that porn... keep in mind I'm only 9 or 10 years old and don't watch porn... This time, she doesn't believe him and he gets caught for ordering porn and is forced to apologize to me. I accept his apology, but in my head, I couldn't care less if he apologized to me... I mean, he lied and said it was me first... Also... I was still upset he hadn't gotten caught cheating on my mom... She didn't deserve to be cheated on, she didn't do anything wrong... To this day, my mom still doesn't know what he pulled and my dad still lives here, still married to my mom...


A few years pass... I'm now in fourth grade. I don't have any friends, I'm not popular, not into sports or anything like that, so I'm instantly an outcast. I was fine not having friends or being popular or anything like that... I mean... I was a little lonely, but that's not really that bad. Then... I started being bullied. The popular and sporty girls and guys would call me names and make fun of me and tell me how I'd never get a girl and that I was gay... I didn't let that get to me, even though it did hurt a little bit. One day at recess... I decided to try out soccer. I had never tried doing a sport before so I did this for fun. I got ridiculed by the sporty kids and yelled at for missing "simple shots" and was told how "retarded" I am. At this point, it was starting to hurt more, so I decided to tell my mom... We went into the principals office where they promised they would do something about it. They called one kid in and talked to him. That's all they did, that kid didn't even get punished, just told to stop. The next day my mom drops me off at school. We have to stay outside and wait until the morning bell rings to go inside. He decides to attack me and beat me to the cement. I throw him off me, but the whole fourth grade watched as I got attacked and even some teachers watched... Nothing happened... he didn't get in any trouble at all. I told my mom and we talked to the principal again. The kid who attacked me got in no trouble at all, he didn't even get talked to... I suffered through the rest of my fourth grade year, not wanting to go to school anymore, in fear of getting attacked. This is when my first suicide "attempt" happened... Sometime later that year, everything that had happened went to my head... I went home and bawled... I grabbed the biggest knife I could and held it to my wrist in front of my parents... I told them: I can't go back to school... I don't want to live anymore... I can't do this anymore... Stuff along those lines. They took the knife away from me and left me in my room alone bawling... We never spoke of this incident again.


A few years pass by and I'm in seventh grade now... My first year of middle school. Everyone tells me it's going to get better and that I'll love it in seventh grade. They tell me that no one will bully me and that I'll make friends and everything. I start to believe them and start to have some hope... The first half of the year goes pretty decently... But then a certain rumor starts that ruins the rest of the year and some of eighth grade. The rumor is that I jerk off in math class. I was in seventh grade, so I did know what jerking off was and all that, but I had never done it at school, and especially not in class. It started getting really out of control, people would even say with the teachers in the room... They would hear it but wouldn't care... We went to the principal. Since I was in middle school now, we had a new principal and we were in a different school, so we thought the new principal might actually do something. He didn't really help much... He called a few kids in, but there's not much you can do about rumors... I went the rest of the year and a lot of the eighth grade year feeling humiliated and hurt... I had no one, and all the girls made fun of me tons, because they all had heard the rumor... No chance of anyone being friends or dating someone who has apparently jerked off in math class...


A few years later is my ninth grade year... I meet a few friends who have my interests in common, which are listening to music and playing video games... I become really close to some of them... Ninth grade went pretty well... Better than most years...


This year was my tenth grade year... it was horrible. I started the year off by losing all my new "friends" who decided to ditch me for better people, just because I started to lose interest in the video games they liked and I didn't want to be around people much anymore. I started taking an interest in making music using my computer... I didn't think I was that bad, but my so called "friends" said that gaming was way better and that they were going to become famous YouTubers or pro gamers and that it was pathetic that I gave up gaming to make music... I ended up going to a few sites online to meet online friends once my other friends left me... This was one of the best decisions I made. I met some online friends who are some of the most amazing people I've met. Almost all of them are still my friends today. I even found my first girlfriend online... Anyways, My mom started to notice I was growing more and more sad everyday and distancing myself from everyone, even my family members. She said we should go see the doctor because she thinks I'm becoming depressed (I had known that I was probably depressed for awhile, but I hadn't seen a doctor about it until this year.) I talked to the doctor about everything I was feeling... and even about how I wanted to hurt myself and how I'm so anxious constantly... My doctor told me I have severe depression and anxiety. She placed me under essentially suicide watch for two weeks and prescribed me Lexapro. I wasn't allowed alone in a room for 2 weeks in fear I would kill myself. All sharp objects were confiscated from me and I was watched closely by my parents. Lexapro worked for awhile, but I started to self harm while taking Lexapro... My parents still don't know about that... 


Later on this year, I started questioning my sexuality... I'm still questioning it... I still don't know if I'm bisexual or not, so if someone could help me with that, I would be grateful... I've had to hide it from my parents,because they don't approve of LBGT... I got myself into a few serious relationships as well... Obviously, we dated online, because I have no one in real life, even to this day. Me and this girl knew each other for months and decided we both liked each other, so we decided to date. We dated for almost two months...it was going pretty good... Then I find out she's been cheating on me the whole time... I'm devastated... We break up and I'm even more depressed than before... I read online you can self harm with pencil sharpener blades, so I take the blades out of a pencil sharpener and cut my arms up until they bleed. I regret this immediately after and wear long sleeves for a while to conceal my cuts... I take a break from dating for a couple months... I couldn't handle another relationship for a long time after me and that girl broke up... Finally after around three months, I decide to try again... I meet a girl who I hit it off with immediately... We end up dating for around two months as well... I find out she's been sending nudes to people behind my back... I've never sent nudes to her or anyone else, but she had been sending nudes to other guys and not even her own boyfriend (even though I didn't want them anyways, that's child porn.) She broke things off with me and left... I did similar things to myself with the blades... That was about two months ago... I don't know when or if I will be ready to date someone again, my trust has been completely shattered too many times...


After me and my ex had broke up, I realized my meds weren't working very well considering I still felt super depressed; and also my anxiety was starting to affect me a lot more. We went back to my doctor and changed me to Zoloft. I have been doing a lot better with Zoloft, in both the depression department and anxiety department. 


A few days ago... I got my first job. The job is okay and all, but I'm starting to realize that I'm growing up and that I'm going to be in eleventh grade next year. It's depressing me how fast I'm growing up and I'm not liking the thought of leaving my mom for college... I need the job because I need money for a new computer and for college, but it's so strange having responsibilities and not being able to sleep in every morning in the summer... I don't like big changes, they make me very depressed... sometimes even suicidal. 


Ever since I started this new job, I'm starting to get the urge to cut or burn myself again... I don't want to live anymore and reflecting on all of my life is making me realize how crappy my life has been and that I don't feel like it'll ever get better... I feel alone... Like I have no one... A lot of my online friends have left me... I only have a few of my closest friends left, and some of my other closest friends have left me after I opened up to them about my depression and anxiety or they have left me for other reasons, such as getting in a fight at some point over something stupid and they don't want me back as a friend. After dating a few girls, I realize how lonely I am without a partner. I don't know if I'm ready for another partner, but I feel alone without one... With everything combined just crashing down on me...it's just depressing me more and more and making me want to end it all...I think I would rather be dead than be alive anymore...


Thanks for reading my story... I know how long it was, but I wanted to capture every little detail I could remember. I don't know if I can go on anymore, I feel so alone and depressed right now and I don't even know what to do... but thanks for hearing me out.
