today is the dayI think today will be the day i finally end it. I got my rope tied up (not sure if its perfect). The sun is shining and the air is warm outside. I think it is a wonderful day to die. There is nothing left to live for anymore, Im a hopeless human being and I think I'm finally ready to let it all go.
