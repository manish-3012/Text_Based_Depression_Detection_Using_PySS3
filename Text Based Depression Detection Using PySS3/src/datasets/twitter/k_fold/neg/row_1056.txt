I'm going to do it. I know I have to now.I have attempted suicide 3 years ago, senior year of high school, but wound up confessing what I had done to my parents.  I was hospitalized, put on meds, and was somewhat under control for the past 2 years of college other than a few months of self harm. 

This semester has been a roller coaster.  I broke up with my boyfriend of two years, and was feelin good about it for a while.  But I don't know, something snapped and I found myself going through phases of being so happy I felt unstoppable, to being so weary and lethargic that I couldn't even get out of bed or talk to people.  I would hide in my room all day because the thought of speaking with people genuinely made me feel terrified.  I would go days without eating simply out of laziness.  I wound up doing horribly in my grades-  I got a D in one class and a C in another and I'm taking this as reassurance from the universe that it is time for me to die.  I'm going to wait until after the holidays for my family's sake..but I really cannot go on knowing I've disappointed my family in this way.  I don't deserve to live, I've ruined myself.
