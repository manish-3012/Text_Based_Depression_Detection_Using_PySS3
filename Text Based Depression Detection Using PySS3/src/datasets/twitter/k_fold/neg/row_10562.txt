I just want to say this to everyone on this forumSelfish does not equal suicidal
Suicidal does not equal selfish

Depression makes you feel like a burden
Like the world would be better without you in it

You arent a bad person for feeling this way

Suicide = severe mental distress

You are human. People want to commit suicide want the pain to stop.

If someones pet had terminal illness, and weren't likely to survive a surgery, they often think that putting them down is the kindest thing to do.

If a human is terminally ill, they can choose not to proceed with any more treatment because they want to die in peace.

It's okay to be skeptical of your happiness, of life. I also know that you have so much strength and the human brain can change. It's hard to practice self care to try to regulate your mental state when you have mental illness. Especially if you dont have the motivation or dont feel like you deserve it. 

I dont know you, but I know and I strongly believe that you do deserve happiness. Even if the odds are stacked against you, I will still believe in you. Even if the people around you dont appreciate you. Dont understand you. Dont support you. I believe you have value.
