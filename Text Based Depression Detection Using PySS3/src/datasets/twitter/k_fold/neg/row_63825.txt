Can't FocusI'm in a really bad state of mind right now. I thought about self-harming but I feel like even if I only do that I might go the extra mile. I'm trying to distract myself with movies but I've switch between 3 so far because my mind keeps wandering off to those thoughts. I can't even eat or sleep because all I want is for this pain and thoughts to go away. And the only person that understands and makes me feel better doesn't even want to talk to me right now. Can someone tell me how to distract myself away from these thoughts?
