Its been a month and two days since I found my stepsons mother dead by suicide.I don't even know where to start, I have so many mixed emotions and I am sure this post is going to be all over the place. A day has not passed by that I don't think of her and all the what if's. I miss her everyday and at the same time I am so mad at her. I am mad at her for doing this to our son. I am mad that I found her. I am mad that ever since that day I have this fear of everything, looking into cars, being alone, the dark.  I am mad that all the "mother" responsibility now falls on me alone. I am scared that I wont live up to her expectations When it comes to raising her son. I am even scared to have children of my own and what my stepson will feel. We had a great team all together and I feel like she just quit on us. Now my bf and I are alone and it feels so scary without her, my bf use to say he was only a part time dad and that thanks to her he was never stressed about parenting because she was always there to solve help or even solve all the hard parts about parenting. She was my role model when it came to being a mother and just a women all around. I know its weird and that not many people have the luck that I had to have my bf's babymomma not be some crazy ex gf, but instead become a friend. I hate myself for not reaching out to her and falling for her front of being okay when she really was not. I hate that I thought I had time. All though its hard I am glad I am the one that found her and not her family or my bf or worst my son, no one deserved to see her that way, and I don't believe she would of wanted anyone else seeing her that way.
