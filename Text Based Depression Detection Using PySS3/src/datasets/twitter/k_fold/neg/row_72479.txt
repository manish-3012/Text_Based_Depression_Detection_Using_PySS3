i hate when people say things just to make you feel bettersometimes, just sometimes i want someone to say â€œitâ€™s ok to feel the way youâ€™re feeling, iâ€™ll stay with you if you need to talkâ€ instead of the old reliable â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€ because honestly, i donâ€™t give a fuck if itâ€™ll get better in 24 hours. thatâ€™s like an eternity when you feel trapped and alone in your own head. just once at least, i want someone to comfort me and make it seem like they care about how iâ€™m doing. iâ€™m so alone in my head everyday and i canâ€™t escape. i donâ€™t want to hear â€œjust push through, itâ€™ll clear upâ€ because iâ€™m so close to being done pushing. just once man, i just want one person in my life to let me tell them how iâ€™m falling apart, thatâ€™s all i need. for now though, iâ€™ll just throw some Mac Miller on and pretend everythingâ€™s gonna be okay.
