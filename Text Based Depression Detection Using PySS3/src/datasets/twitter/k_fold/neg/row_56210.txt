I think biggest part of me being suicidal is that I'm not wanted or have that many friends...We're not meant to be alone all the time, but under circumstances we are and it sucks and we're supposed to just deal and be happy? Fuck that. People with friends and plans all the time gatta be a little bit happier then people without it. Fuck I hate my life
