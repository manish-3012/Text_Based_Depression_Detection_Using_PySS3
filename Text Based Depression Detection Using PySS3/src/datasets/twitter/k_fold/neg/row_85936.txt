Realization about impact of killing myselfI look at people who passed away and how over time, people just move on with their lives. I was at a school and they had this memorial for this dead teacher who died 10 years ago. Her memorial looked shabby and unkempt. Anyways, I came to the conclusion that my death would hurt some people but they would move on with their lives and probably pretty quickly. Sad, but true.
