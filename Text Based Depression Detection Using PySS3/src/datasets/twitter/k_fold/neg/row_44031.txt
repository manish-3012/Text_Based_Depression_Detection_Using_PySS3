Now I'm drinking to cope with the pain. I can't feel. yay.literally drank an entire bottle of wine in half an hour or less just to not feel. 

i feel so stupid for not trying harder or wanting to feel better. because i don't i want to die. i'm so stupid and pathetic for not wanting to be better. i hope i don't get better. i hope i die tonight.

what kind of stupid pathetic loser am i,
