I'm ready to caveI want to kill myself but I'm scared. Do you think it hurts? What if hell is real and that's where I go? But what if there's nothing? Is that going to feel good or will my last thought be fear of the nothingness and regret? Is there a quick and easy way to die that doesn't give me enough time to change my mind?

I need to die. I'm scared of what comes next, I don't want to face it. My life's just going to be down hill from here. Please death is the only way out, how can I make it not so damn scary? I tried earlier to impale my heart so that I wouldn't have enough preparation time to think about it, but in the end I was scared of the pain. I don't know what to do. I have no hope, I squandered my chances at hope. I want to sleep forever, I want to close my eyes and not ever have to open them again. Is there a way that I can go in my sleep?
