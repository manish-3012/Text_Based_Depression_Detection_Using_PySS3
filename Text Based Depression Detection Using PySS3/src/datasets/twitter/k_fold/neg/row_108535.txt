People say pain is temporary but not all pain is.This isnâ€™t. Thereâ€™s no healing or growing past this. Itâ€™s me. I am the pain. Itâ€™s in my head. How does someone escape the pain without dying if the thing that causes the pain is themselves? There is no answer because thereâ€™s only one way to escape yourself and thatâ€™s death. Itâ€™s the way I act, the way I look and talk and think. Oh god, the way I think, that has to be one of the biggest sources of pain. 

Nah, you canâ€™t escape that. Itâ€™s the way my thoughts jump from one thought to the next like youâ€™re skipping through tv channels too fast, all complete nonsense. You try to think but all you get are these random clips of songs, past events, stories, quotes, noises, static, pictures and movement. Always moving, but completely still at the same time. Thereâ€™s no escaping that. 

And then we have the toxic personality. The victimising narcissistic personality who craves attention but canâ€™t stand to be in the spot light. The pulling and pushing away of people. Ruining everyoneâ€™s lives and causing drama and being completely unnecessary. You are unnecessary, thatâ€™s it. Unnecessary and weak and god damn pathetic. 

When Iâ€™m in the dark, I can see things move around. Little shadows grow big and move towards me, everything goes black and I go cold. I canâ€™t see because theyâ€™re everywhere, blocking me in. I canâ€™t move or make a sound because, tbh, they scare me. The longer I look, the more trapped I feel so I lay there with my eyes closed, donâ€™t look else they will get you. Iâ€™m probably just tired. I can hear and feel my heart beating. 

Iâ€™m sorry.
