dunno what to title this-I've been having a rough time lately. Between heavy family issues, being constantly blamed for things that were my father's fault, the overwhelming stress of exams, my all time low self esteem... I can't take it anymore. I joined Reddit because I heard of r/suicidewatch and i really just needed a place to rant. I've been planning this for a while now, but I'm heavily debating drinking rubbing alcohol. As much of it as I can manage. I really don't want to live anymore, and I don't know what to do. Asking for help hasn't done anything. I have deep scars all over my arm, they haven't done anything. Nothing helps. Nothing makes the pain go away. And I'm not sure what to do about it. So, the only resort seems to be suicide. Ending it all. Even if it's selfish, stupid, wrong... I don't belong in this world. I can barely compose myself in public, talking to people is so tiring that I end up crying or on the verge of tears if someone tries to strike up conversation. It's stupid, really. I know people have it worse. I know it's wrong of me to be this selfish. But I don't want to be alive anymore. I want to be alive, in a way, to finish school, get the job I want, live in my own apartment, have the freedom to my own privacy...but it just won't work out.
