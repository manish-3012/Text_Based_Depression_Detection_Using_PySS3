Please helpIm a 20 year old faggot. Everyone kept telling me in school that "it gets better", i left school 3 years ago, moved in with a few of my mates and its getting worse. Ive been on 4 different anti-depressants and seen 3 different councillors and 2 psychiatrists over the last 6 months. I dont really know why im posting on here, i fully expect that nothing said here will have any effect on me. I feel like im just waiting for a really bad thing to come along. My boss knows im dealing with mental illness and threatened to fire me if i didn't get my shit together and up my performance. I used to be her best worker, put in so much effort and now she doesn't even give a shit. I feel down all the time, think about suicide daily. And im scared that when the bad thing happens im going to do it. 

The last counsellor i saw said i need to "get over" my sexuality. I tried meeting some random guy on grindr. I parked infront of his house and just couldn't do it. How can i be this fucking broken. All the people i have ever met or seen on grindr only care about fucking. And the fags i know in real life are arseholes. I dont want to be a part of it. I regret coming out. I should of just faked it and dated girls. When will it get better. Ive seen what suicide does. There are people in my life that it would destroy. And just looking at what ive written this is just a whiny rant from a weak faggot.

I drove 2 hours to the nearest psych hospital and they discharged me after 2 hours. I dont even know what i need to do to get better any more.

Ive been holding out, waiting for it to get better for years. I cant do it much longer. Ive attempted once. If the day comes where i want to again, i wouldnt fail.

Im sorry for all this.
