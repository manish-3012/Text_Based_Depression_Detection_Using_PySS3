How do I stop suicidal feelings and depression?I don't want to be cliche about this, you probably can't care less but, might as well try.

On November 8 2011 my Dad and Aunt died in a car crash, I was 11 years old when that happened, for the first time in my life I felt depressed, my mom who I have not seen in 9 years took me from Azerbaijan to Crimea Ukraine (at that time). Me and my brother switched schools, I used to go to an English school (TISA) and changing schools to a completely different type of education is very dificult, that fueld my depression even more. In 2013 I stared education face to face with the teacher, so basically i had nobody to talk to, I didn't talk to my peers. Last year I started attending high school and my undereducation is very obvious I barely pass subjects with 3s and 4s (very bad grades) and I started to think about how I'm not going to be able to have a future, the only thing I'm good at is English. Now, with every passing week I feel the urge to end it all, the only thing stopping me is the fact that my mom will be sad. What should I do, should I get psychiatric help?
