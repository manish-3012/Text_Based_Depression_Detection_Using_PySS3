More afraid of a failed attempt than actually dyingI own a hunting rifle and I'm more afraid that it won't work.  I know a person who attempted suicide that way and the bullet passed through with little damage.  The person has lost some motor function in different areas, but is alive and well and fully capable of caring for themselves.  I've read stories about failed attempts and have seen the pictures of the multiple reconstructive surgeries.  I don't want that.  Right now, that's the only thing holding me back, and it's not going to last.
