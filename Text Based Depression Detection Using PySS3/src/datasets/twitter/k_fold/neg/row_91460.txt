OverwhelmingHi,  this is my first post here,  I used to be suicidal and unfortunately things are taking a turn for the worse. I'm so frustrated, it just seems every time I start to make progress something comes along and knocks me back down again.  I don't want to feel so lost anymore and I'm writing here to keep myself accountable, so I don't do anything drastic. The last two months I've gotten nothing but bad news,  debt, low paying job, family issues, family deaths,  things just keep hitting me over and over again. I'm just so tired. So very tired.
