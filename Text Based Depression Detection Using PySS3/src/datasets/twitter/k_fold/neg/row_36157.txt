Someone please help me. :(Just got dumped, year long relationship with the girl of my dreams, there was a guy she used to talk to and i trusted her, until one day she confessed they talked sexually, but she did not show me any more, so i found out myself and they both wanted to have sex, they both described in alot of detail what they would do to eachother, and they both came. we broke up because i added a random girl and she thought she was "hot" so she went and unblocked this guy and told him she misses him and wants to be best friends again, and now all shes doing is telling me to fuck off, im so broken, someone please help me. I really just need someone to help me and advice please, please someone help me get her back, i know i shouldnt even try after unblocking him and doing that, but please i need her, i have noone else, she is my entire life, please someone help me.
