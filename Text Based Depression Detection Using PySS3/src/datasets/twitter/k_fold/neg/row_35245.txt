I'm so scaredmy boyfriend is in the other room on his pc laughing with his friends. he wouldn't have even noticed if I'd have killed myself yet. i could be dead and the only other person in the house wouldn't know.

I'm 22 and the only reason I'm alive is my family. i have no job, no money and no friends. everything is so fucking worthless. i lost my entire teenage-hood to depression and everything is so godawful that I never want to be apart from my mum.

what kind of life is this? how do I kill myself without ruining their lives?
