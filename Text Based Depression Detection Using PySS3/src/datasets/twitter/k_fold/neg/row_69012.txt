What is the point of living a life alone?If you don't believe in an afterlife like myself, then what is the point of living alone? The only meaning to life is creating good relationships and leaving positive impacts on the people around you. I can't do that, I will never do that, so why live? Sure, no more of the good parts of life, but exempting all of the heartbreak and loneliness sounds pretty good to me right now. I just graduated high school and I honestly foresee myself committing suicide sometime in college.

I tried going to therapy, but was too socially awkward to admit my true feelings of suicidal thoughts. I wore my mask through the whole session, and paid a guy $100 to listen to me for an hour, just to tell me that I "don't seem to have the tendencies of someone who is depressed."

I literally have nobody to talk to, so here I am typing anonymously to a forum of sad strangers about my problems. I literally paid someone $100 to listen to me, and I still am alone. And it's my fault.

I leave town for one fucking week and the girl I was seeing has now gotten back together with her ex. Time and time again I am never enough for people, male or female. Peer or parent.

So what's the point?

I'm just going to live my ~75 remaining years working, never marrying, never having kids, never having friends, just so I can post sick pictures to my instagram of me travelling alone every year? Then retire and die of loneliness at an early age? Then be the end of my bloodline and be forgotten in a decade?

There is no reason for *me* to live.
