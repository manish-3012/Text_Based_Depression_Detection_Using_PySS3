I UnderstandFeeling Suicidal: Hey! I get what you're feeling. I really do! I'm not here to tell you some sort of recovery story, mainly because I don't have one. I'm just here to tell you that, I get you. I want to kill myself too. I know that feeling of utter despair and torture. Having to wake up everyday to endless unhappiness and pain. Not wanting to die, but wanting to sleep forever. I want to kill myself, but I can't bring myself too. And I hate myself all the more for it. I know what it's like to feel no joy anytime of the day. It's emotionally painful. I understand how it feels like to hold my tears in until I reach my bed, where I pour everything out. Living isn't worth it anymore. But at the good times, I wonder if I can keep going on. So, I get it. If you want to die that much, go ahead. BUT! Know this. Yea, you're right. I don't know you. I really don't. You could be a dumbass for all I know. I don't know you anyway whatsoever. But even though I don't, I care about you. I care about you, the reader, because I know the pain. I really do. And that's why, I'm asking you, rather than hurting or killing yourself, post a comment below. Tell me how it feels. Because I know the pain. Even though we might have utterly different reasons, we share the pain and agony. So, tell me how your day was, and what your problems are, and maybe we can talk about it! 

I may not know you, but I will tell you this. We share the pain, and if we share it together, maybe the burden will lessen.
