helpI had a deadline for work this morning that I've missed (they expected me to finish Friday, but the hard deadline was this morning.) I'm about to enter into a PHP (partial hospitalization program) this week so this is all I had left to complete. Only my boss knows and I've been reporting to someone directly above me for the time being. I spent all day yesterday depressed as fuck and then all evening contemplating killing myself then and there. I woke up extra early to get to work after not being able to do anything yesterday, but still have about a whole day's work ahead of me to complete this. I just got an email from my supervisor telling me they need me to turn in my work ASAP and I'm really trying not to fall back into a hole so I can actually finish by the end of the day. Anyone, please help with some words of encouragement.  I feel like I've royally fucked up. I mean I have, but I can't let it get to me unless I really do just plan on killing myself now.
