I'm an arrogant prick and I'll never be better than thatThe only reason I ever got out of the gutter and tried to do something with my life was because one person figured I might be worth the effort. But now they're gone, and there's no one left with any expectations for me. I don't have anyone to make proud anymore. 

And I've gotten so damn arrogant about it all too. I'm not a smart person, I'm not a hard worker, I'm not a charitable and responsible young adult. It's all a fucking farce, a scam. I bluffed my way through school. I'm completely unable to keep a partner satisfied without them cheating on me. I'm a piece-of-shit schizophrenic heroin addict, and I used it to get an advantage. I got leniency where I didn't deserve it, extra time on exams when I could have finished without it. All of these things I never earned. People think I'm clean and on medication, but I'm not. They think I'm working hard, but I'm not. I only help people so I can convince myself I'm a good person, and even then I'm shit at helping them. I'm a shit teacher, they're just all too polite to say it. I'm dragging myself along all day and convincing people that I'm somehow better than they are. 

I'm not better or stronger. I can't keep pretending that I belong anywhere but in the ground. I was going to kill myself when I was 8 but just never got around to it, that's how unorganised I am. I was too curious; I wanted to see what would happen next. But I can't keep being curious because this game isn't fun anymore. I've made all of the moves I'm capable of making. Now I'm just prolonging things because I'm scared to die, and that isn't good enough. I knew this was coming, I've had 22 years on Earth to prepare for it. 

I'm bored of the game and I think I'm done hurting people.
