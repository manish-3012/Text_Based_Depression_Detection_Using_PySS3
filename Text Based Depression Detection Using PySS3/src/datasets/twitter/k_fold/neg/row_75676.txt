Iâ€™m completely doneIâ€™ve lost all my friends, Iâ€™ve lost the love of my life, and now my friend just fucking died. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I could deal with shit when I had people, when I had at least a shoulder to cry on or fucking SOMEONE but now Iâ€™m just fucking alone. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t deal with this anymore. I need my close friends, I need my ex, I really fucking miss my ex. Fuck you for leaving me I still donâ€™t know what I even did. I just give up. Iâ€™m just going to do it eventually. and now my friend is dead. It wasnâ€™t ever her fault, she got hit by a car. It was a fucking pedestrian death. She didnâ€™t deserve it. I wish I could have taken her place. She impacted so many people while Iâ€™ve been crying for 3 weeks straight
