Getting real closeThrowaway cus my close friends know my username.

25M, dropped out of college at 19 after depression/anxiety/ an almost attempted suicide and my life has been a constant downward spiral since then. I thought when I left school that I'd be doing things "my way", but I've been beaten back down time and time again solely out of my own choices. I still live with my family, lie to my close friends about my employment (havent been able to hold a job for more than 2 months at a time), and have perfected faking happiness in front of everyone. Theres no way with my job experience to get a job that would allow me to improve my place in life, pretty much stuck leeching off of my parents for the foreseeable future. I hate my family because although they're loving and supportive, they take a "head in the sand" approach toward my mental health and I cant handle the guilt of knowing theyll have to live with their oldest son killing himself. I dont bring anything positive to existence, just lies and fake happiness. I'm already too far down the rabbit hole of depression to come out and I've chalked myself up as a loss already. My friends are having kids and starting their lives and I'm still stuck existing the same as I did when I was 16. Just sick of trying knowing that I'll sabotage my chances of success at every turn. I'm truly broken and useless, and like everything useless, I feel like I should just cut myself out of the picture to solve my problems. Maybe the next life will be better, because God knows I already royally fucked this one up enough.
