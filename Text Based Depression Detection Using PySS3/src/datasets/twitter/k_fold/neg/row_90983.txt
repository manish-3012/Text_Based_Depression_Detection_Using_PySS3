I feel bored with life and as though I've already experienced as much joy as I possibly can get out of it in my short miserable time here.My life is in such a dead end right now, no job, no boyfriend, I have no real hobbies or interests to speak of, I'm always panicking about the state of the world, what's the use, I've had a good run, I've had many pleasurable experiences, or at least I've tried to in my own pathetic way.  I don't see much interesting about life anymore to keep me motivated.
