Prob Spam since I posted beforeI still just don't want to be here and alive.  I know people who I care about are lying, and every time I give them the chance to come clean they decline. They think I am dumb, and I am, but I have seen the stuff they are lying about.

I feel so alone. I feel like I am a burden on everything and everyone. I feel so sick of my life and I have been feeling this way for a long time.  I have no reason to stick around. I offer nothing and over all I just feel like I don't have any reason to be alive.  It seems to be to much effort to end it, but I have no real desire to live. I just feel like my life is slipping away, and I don't care to extend it.

  
Sorry to bother you.
