I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doingI am a 23 year old who almost completed a bachelors degree in fine art art. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing. Every thought I have and every action I do brings me to the conclusion that I should kill myself. My basement has ceilings from whic I could hang myself but Iâ€™m 6â€™3 and I donâ€™t know what to do. I have been drinking but I feel this way every day, every second. I donâ€™t know what it is I want. I donâ€™t know anything. I have an ongoing problem of masturbation, I have no drive or creating anything. My girlfriend tells me that no one has any idea of what they are doing, my parents ask me to just make something. I donâ€™t know what my passions are. Am I passionate about anything? I donâ€™t have any drive anymore. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m lookin for. I have accrued an incredible amount of debt, my thesis show is in May, I smoked weeed and fucjed around and now I think Iâ€™m fucked. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Why is it so wrong for me to want to die. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore
