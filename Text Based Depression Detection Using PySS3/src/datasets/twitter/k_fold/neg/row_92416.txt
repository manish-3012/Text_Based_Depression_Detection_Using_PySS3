There is nothing left for me I am getting nowhereI am 20 ,Nothings getting better for me... I tried, it sucks it never gets better.

I have no dreams and whatever dreams I have are killed because of my anxiety I dropped college to clear a competitive exam but i always avoid the exam centre cause I don't study and I don't wanna look like incompetent. I have wasted 2 years of my life and all of my friends are on their final year of college and their parents keep calling me failure. My parents and cousins believe in me but I can't lie to them. I don't want then to give them false hope.  

My best friends have stopped contacting me since last year, I am stuck here . I try to improve but in the end I am back here, feeling incompetent. I try and think I have improved then I go online and everyone is better than me, even 13 years old know more than me.  I feel incompetent , unwanted, unrequired and pathetic I feel like I won't be as good as them and I will never get anything more than this. I am ugly dumb and poor , people look over me and always patronising, my language sucks.

I have social anxiety, health anxiety  and inferiority complex. I don't improve at anything and everyone gets better than me.i just want to quit. I don't like coming back here. It feels like I am being punished because of my parents decision. 

I don't see any reason "why it is even worth it to live?".

We are heading towards nowhere and if I had to go there like this then there is no point in continuing cause it is all senseless and foolish.
