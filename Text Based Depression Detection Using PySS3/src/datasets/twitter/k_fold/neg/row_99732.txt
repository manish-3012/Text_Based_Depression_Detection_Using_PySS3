I tried but Iâ€™m done.Iâ€™ve tried to stay strong. I tried to live a good life. I tried.
I tried working on hopes and dreams. 
I tried to stay positive that there would be a better tomorrow. 
I tried..but...
My family doesnâ€™t want me or care because Iâ€™m adopted. 
I have no friends. 
Iâ€™m alone 24/7
And love had only brought me pain and agony. 
Iâ€™m tired. Tired of waking up in the morning. 
Tired of being alone. Tried of the endless meds that donâ€™t do shit. 
Iâ€™m tired... 
tired of life.. tired of everything. 
I donâ€™t want to be on earth anything. I donâ€™t want to stay awake.
All I want is to fall asleep and never wake up.this is the week and Iâ€™ve never felt more ready. The sad part is that thereâ€™s no one to say good bye to
