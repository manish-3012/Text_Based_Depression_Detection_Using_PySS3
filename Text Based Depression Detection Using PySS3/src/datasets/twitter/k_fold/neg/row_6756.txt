When does it stop!?I don't think I'll ever do it, I'm too much of a coward to go through with it but for years now I wake up and i want to die, it's rarely off mind all day til I fall asleep. I get brief moments of respite from it but it's always there in the back of my head. My depression developed cos of my own fault, I cheated on my gf and not long after my father died, we tried to make a go of it but after a year or so she left cos it got too much and her parents bought her a new house in the city so I couldn't blame her for taking the opportunity and running. As I said it's my own fault and it's not just cos I lost her and the kid I raised for years, I blame myself for my dad's heart attack, I am in mg mid 30s and have no career or kids of my own, I feel old and gross and like im only going downhill and the only woman who ever really oved me is lost forever. It's all too much and all I want is for it to end but I can't do it. I've been close but I'm always too much of a coward. I tell myself I'll only hurt the people close to me even more by doing it but then again when I'm gone all the shit I bring into the lives of the people I love will go too. I want to stop feeling like this but then maybe this is what I deserve
