Im fucking losing itI dont fucking want to be alive. I am filled eoth so much fucking contempt for this life and for every single person i know. I seriously dont want to fucking be here. Im going to get some rope or wire and hope i can bring myself to try just one more time. I want to hang in the woods outside my house and let the world burn without me. It doesnt need me anyway. No one needs me. Thats okay. I dont want to be needed. I dont want to be wanted. I dont want to be.

If i cant die then i want a fucking lobotomy. Why cant i sign some goddamn papers somewhere that will allow a doctor to either lobotomize or kill me? Im just gonna have to take matters into my own hands as soon as i work up the courage.

Only posting here cause i cant say this shit to anyone without shit happening. I want to express this but i also want everyone to mind their fucking business.
