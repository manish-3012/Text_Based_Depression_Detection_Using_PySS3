Older, tried a lot, still failed. How to go on?So im a late 30's male going through the motions of settling affairs. I've already decided on my method, purchased what I need, tested everything, and have a date shortly approaching.

I have tried a number of things to deal with these feelings through the years, hundreds of hours of volunteer work, medication, therapy (a long time ago), got sober, exercising/eating healthy, relationships, etc, and nothing worked. I dont really want to die, but feel that i have been limping along for so long, that im just tired and want to sleep. I miss the home, a place of safety and comfort, that i haven't known for a very long time. 

While I felt this way throughout my life, its been brought to a head with a 6 year relationship over (my fault), laid off from work (also kind of my fault), and really have nothing to keep me here. I have a social network, but we're all older and have our own shit to deal with. I messaged my friend last night, asking him how he does it, but have not heard back. I tried to contact the suicide helpline, but it only made me feel worse.

I guess im just looking for... well, anything. I guess i'm just looking at what others thing about it. I feel that I tried, for decades, and failed, failed on everything. It's highly unlikely it's going to be getting better at this point and death feels the only way out, the only way to not feel so broken and alone anymore.  
  
What do you do when you tried so much, how do you go on from there?
