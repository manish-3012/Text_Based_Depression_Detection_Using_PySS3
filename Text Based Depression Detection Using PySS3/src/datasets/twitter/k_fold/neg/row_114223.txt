My Boyfriend Won't Slow Down and I Might Lose EverythingI want to kill myself because my boyfriend doesn't want to slow down with our relationship. He told me that he wants me to be comfortable with him and be able to do things with him but I'm not ready to and he doesn't think it's fair to him. I asked him if he was going to break up with me and he said "I don't know," and hung up. I'm terrified that he will and that I'll end up losing everything because any friends that I have are friends with him and may end up stopping contact with me after we break up. I have no friends to speak to. I have been wanting to kill myself anyway for a while but haven't had the courage to do so. I really wish this would blow over but I don't know what to do anymore. Everyone that I've spoken to doesn't believe that I'll kill myself, so why not show them that I will.
