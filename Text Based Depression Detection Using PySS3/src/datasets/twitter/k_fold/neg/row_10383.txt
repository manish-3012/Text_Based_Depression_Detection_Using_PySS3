Constant suicidal thoughts (anxiety,ocd)Iâ€™ve had a very long history with social anxiety and bouts of depression but nothing like this.
For the past three months I have been overcome with severe anxiety and obsessive thoughts. It all stemmed from a few events that Iâ€™m obsessing about in the past (spare you the details) that in hindsight make me very uneasy to say the least. Iâ€™ve spoken to my psychologist and psychiatrist about it and they have both reassured me that what happened is not that bad, but I canâ€™t shake these feelings of intense guilt and shame. They say itâ€™s symptomatic of ocd, and since then Iâ€™ve been put on a cocktail of mirtazapine, Effexor and olanzapine/seroquel for anxiety, but it isnâ€™t making any difference.
I feel like giving up. Everyday I wake up to panic and misery and the only thing that makes feel better is thinking of ending it. 
I even admitted myself to a mental health rehab for a month and although there were â€˜goodâ€™ days there, the suicidal thoughts and intense anxiety came back quickly. They seem impossible to evade.
My life has completely fallen to pieces and itâ€™s now starting to seriously effect others in my family which is something I canâ€™t bare to see. If I ever did something to myself it would destroy them, but my existence is just pure never ending suffering at the moment.
I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m reaching out because I feel like nothing can change the situation Iâ€™m in. I just need to see if anyone else has eventually gotten through something similar. 
Thanks.
