I can't keep doing thisSo everything has been getting worse since I found out someone was impersonating me online awhile back and doing horrible things. My paranoia is out of control, the thing that lives in my head and shouts at me is so loud, and its all way too much. Last night one of my friends said everyone was scared of me because I'm suicidal and left me with a message saying to phone one of my irl friends - I don't have any. I'm terrified right now in case someone from here thinks I'm the person who pretended they were me. Its ruined everything, I hate it. I can't keep going on like this, I don't have any support in my life right now. I'm scared and hurt and done. 

I just want it to end.
