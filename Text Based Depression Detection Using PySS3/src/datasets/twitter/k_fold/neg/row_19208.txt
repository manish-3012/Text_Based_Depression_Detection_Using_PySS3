Does this sub really work?I've been dealing with depression my whole life. Diagnosed in the 3rd grade. 36 now, it has been hitting me worse than ever. I'm a dad, have a good job 80k, married, house, nice truck. The American dream right? Yet,  all I wish for everyday is to die in a car accident. Or die by some other way. Some way for my family to get my life insurance. I'm just done though. I feel so empty inside. Like a hollow shell. I come home every night and drink until I fall asleep and repeat the process the next day. I feel a failure that has no purpose other than to keep a roof over my families head. My wife doesn't touch me. My son hates me. I just don't want to do it anymore. I wanted to die in a way out of my control but now I don't want to wait any longer. I feel I have no one to talk too, to tell them how much the pain and despair inside me consumes me. I'm tired of faking the smiles. Faking that everything is ok. Will anyone really care when I'm gone?
