Mentally ready to dieAfter being alone for a decade now, I'm accepting that there's no reason to live anymore. The rage that's building in me overtime is ready to explode. No one talks to me, and when they do, it's usually verbally abusive. Suicide has become my only option, cause I'm at the point if I don't kill myself soon, I'll start killing people, and I won't stop til I'm shot dead. Be careful what you say to people, cause sometimes that's the only thing they hear.
