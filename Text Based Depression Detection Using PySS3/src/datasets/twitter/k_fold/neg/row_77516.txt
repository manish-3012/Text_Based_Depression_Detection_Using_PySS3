I don't understand this systemWhy do bad people get to be happy and live longer and why do good people get shit and die of suicide or depression?. I don't know who created this system God or whoever but it's all bullshit.

I mean i wasn't a bad person growing up just a bit narcissistic and self absorbed maybe thats why i don't have friends. Anyways i did everything that haded to be good but wtf did i get in return? NOTHING. My high school bullied is doing better then me and has a hot ass girlfriend maybe I'm envious but i don't give a fuck. It's the end of the line for me now, I'm just waiting till i can't take it anymore for being such a pussy and not killing myself now and when I'm gone from this world I'll finally be at peace.
