Why aren't more help lines sent here to learn?I'm really surprised at the lack of services and support at these phone lines.  I called before in distress 5 years ago, 10 years ago, and more recently.

I have had 0 help with anything, and mostly end off worse than I expected.

Suicide Prevention just want's to talk, not help with the problems.

211 is too rude and untrained to deal with a distraught person.

I've spent 100s of hours and back and forth phone calls.  Still 0 help.  All phone numbers they give me don't answer, and I'm not going to walk for miles (out of gas) just so I don't have to eat pop tarts and supposedly the "Happies day of the year,"

Saddest day of the year in my opinion, but that's just me
