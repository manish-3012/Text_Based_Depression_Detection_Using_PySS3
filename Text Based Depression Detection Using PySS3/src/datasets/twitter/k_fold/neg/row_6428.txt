How long before I can admit this is actually what I want?The first time I ever imagined killing myself I was 8 years old. Since then all Iâ€™ve ever done is hurt people and been hurt by people. Even before then, all I can ever remember knowing was abuse. Iâ€™m sure there were good things.  I know there have been good things since... but when 90% of all you ever know is wanting out.. when do you just admit itâ€™s what you actually want?
