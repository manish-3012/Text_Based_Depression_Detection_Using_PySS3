I feel abandonedDue to some "mental illnesses" I dropped out of school where I felt that people cared about me and had a actual care about my existence. But since then (about 2 months) I've realized no one cared. People texted me all the time and I thought they had a general interest in me but I was wrong and just needed the homework.  After I dropped out no one has texted me. Yesterday was my cake day and not a single person texted me. I would understand if they didn't know but it's all over social media (Snapchat, Facebook ect.)
I realized that no one has been texting me and I figured they were all busy so I decided to text a few of my closest friends and none of them seemed to have any interest in talking to me. One of them said "you're alive? I figured you were dead." And now I feel like maybe that is a good option.
