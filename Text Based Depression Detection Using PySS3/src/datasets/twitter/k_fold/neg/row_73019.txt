I'm okay for periods of time, then it all comes back.It's so hard to feel happy and mildly okay for a little. I can go for about a week, maybe more, of life seeming worth it. It makes me question why I ever think about suicide. But then I'll realize that's not accurate. I'll see that everyone around me hates me, I'm hopeless in every aspect and I have no future or point of even being here. How do I deal with these back and forth shifts in mood? Is this just life?
