Methods that look like an accident if I donâ€™t die.Iâ€™m worried that Iâ€™m not going to die. My parents would judge me and they would treat me differently if I survived a suicide attempt. They donâ€™t know that Iâ€™m suicidal, and it would be extremely easy to trick them into thinking that it was an accident. Is there any good methods that can be played off as an accident?
