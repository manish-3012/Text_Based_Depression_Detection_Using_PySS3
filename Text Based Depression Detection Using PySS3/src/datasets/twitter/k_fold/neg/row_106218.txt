Is there a way to mitigate pain caused by hanging?I've heard that there is a way to mitigate the pain when you hang yourself. Supposedly, you need to put padding on the rope, and the hang from the side. I've heard that if you do it from a certain side, you don't die by choking. You die by a lack of blood flow to your brain. Can anyone back me up on this to see if this is true? If true, which side of the neck should the rope be digging into?
