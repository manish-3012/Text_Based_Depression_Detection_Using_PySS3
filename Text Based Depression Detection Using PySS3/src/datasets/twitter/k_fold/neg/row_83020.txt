20 years old and still feel like a helpless childI turned 20 in march.. to be honest it doesn't really feel like I am a 20 year old man I still feel like a scared kid who hides behind there parents legs. The last 3 years of my life specifically have been a total waste, I dropped out of highschool at 17 because I was hurting so bad on the inside and had zero friends nobody to help me get through school. I spent every day alone and I just couldn't do it anymore. I just don't have the social skills someone my age should have, I don't know how to communicate what I feel and worst of all I don't know how to unconditionally be myself and be okay with that. 

I just don't want to be alone anymore, I wish I knew what to do with my life from here. I think the only thing keeping myself from pulling the plug is just thinking back on the old days. Fuck man I really used to love life but for some reason everything fell apart somewhere along the way. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm being sucked in a black hole. If only I had just one good friend I could spill my heart to I wouldn't feel over consumed with this crippling loneliness. Who knows maybe one day I'll wake up and the last 6 years of my life will all be a distant nightmare. If this keeps up I doubt I'll live to see 25. Sorry for wasting your time if you actually read all that. Anyways peace gonna go bump some bones
