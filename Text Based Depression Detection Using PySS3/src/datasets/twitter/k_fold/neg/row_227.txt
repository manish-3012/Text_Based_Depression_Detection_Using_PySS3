I'm Done [m16]I've recently returned from a certain summer camp (which will remain unnamed so I don't end up hunted down and thrown in a padded room) and it was a generally good if not underwhelming experience, but it was the only thing I've cared about for the past year. Without that to look forward to my life is back to its typical aimlessness. I'm back to hating everybody I talk to and feeling only fleeting instances of an emotion that could only loosely be described as positive. I'm posting here because I'm too lazy to write a note and don't care enough about anyone to address it to them, so I felt obligated to let a few strangers on the Internet know. The shotgun is calling me.
