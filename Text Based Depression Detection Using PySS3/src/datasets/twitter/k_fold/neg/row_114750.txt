It's when everything is quiet that the thought is the loudest.so here goes, i've always kind of struggled with fairly brutal highs and lows. have never seeked professional help and no intention to. i have anxiety and control issues so never tried drink or done any form of drugs. so it has really never been numbed either. about 20 or so years ago during a fairly severe low the mutter started. opting out became a valid option. just as natural an idea as going out to pick up some milk. the thought comes up alot  but most of all when things are quiet and stable, the muttering gets louder that i should do it now. when all around me isn't going to shit, end on a high note and just stop the ride and get off. i can honestly say i'm at peace with the thought of doing it. i'm sorry for the block of text but it feels like this is what it's finally come to. (if you read this, thank you)
