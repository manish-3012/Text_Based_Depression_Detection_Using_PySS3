.Never met my dad or anyone on his side of the family. Mom left at 4. I was raised by her brother (my uncle) and her mother (my grandmother) I was in foster care by 14. Grandma passed away at 16, uncle at 19. Have been alone since. I have never really had a major connection with a single person. Basically have been renting rooms on Craigslist from random people since. 
Had a couple relationships past 8 years mostly empty, pseudo in-between relationships, most recently I "broke up" with a girl I really liked because there was no emotional connection. I liked her a lot but the feeling is grinding me down emotionally I feel empty except fear. I never wanted this. I've been lifting weights since 15 which I started to protect myself against other kids in the homes. Stuck with it, and I became a personal trainer at 24 and got a union job a year later working as a carpenter. 
My life is completely empty though. Online dating is soul crushing. I don't drink so the bar isn't an option. I'm mostly in my room. I read, I like math, science, ect, I'm writing a book, I enjoy to learn. I'd love to have a child, but again I have no idea where to find someone. I'm just emotionally wrecked and want to cry in a corner. I haven't heard I love you or even had a meaningful hug from someone in years. I'm really hurt and I'm mad I'm hurt and it's just a spiral. It's so frustrating. 
Again I just want to care about someone/be cared about 
I'm honestly not suicidal. Just completely fucking lost and have no guidance or even someone to talk to. 
I've spent the last 3-4 hours just pacing in my room having some sort of anxious/existential crisis. 
I'm 27 now. I don't know what to do.
