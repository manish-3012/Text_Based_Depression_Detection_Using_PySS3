No plans after graduationIm about to be a junior in highschool. Terrifying. Every day I have panic attacks and manic episodes. My psychiatrist doesn't believe I'm Bipolar but my therapist does. My mom agrees with my psychiatrist... to make matters worse due to my recent manic depressive episodes and getting myself stuck in a mental hospital for attempting suicide, numerous accounts of deep self harm, and overdosing, I am severely off the track of graduating with my class. I'm failing, I'm becoming an alcoholic, I'm mostly a loner, and I honestly don't want to live. Life is lackluster for me. I don't have plans for college or uni because I didn't plan on being alive. I'm completely stuck in the mortal realm and it sucks ass. What should I do?? I want to end my life but I've failed so many suicide attempts already I fear I'll just be stuck in a hospital for a few weeks again. I can't take it anymore. Maybe I'll try something more effective?? I didn't want to be alive. I didn't want to make it to 16.
