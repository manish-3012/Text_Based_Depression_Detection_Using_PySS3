RantI really donâ€™t fucking understand people saying that itâ€™ll get better. Right now, the mind numbingly repetitive useless school system that punishes you for not enjoying the mental equivalent of grinding your testicles into a fine powder for no good reason makes me want to kill myself. Once Iâ€™m done with that, I get to go to college, where I get to continue to be stressed and not enjoy anything or anyone. Once Iâ€™m done with that, I get a job where I get to continue to be stressed and not enjoy anything or anyone until I die. Why not just get it over with now?
