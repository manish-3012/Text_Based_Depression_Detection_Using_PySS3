What do I do?The only option left for me is suicide. I know it is. You can try to convince me but idk. I'm going to suicide by next year, probably after my birthday. It sounds scary but at the same time makes me feel happier. I feel like I can get rid of my emotion less style. I have no empathy for myself anyways, so it can't be that hard. I've tried to tell people I know but I've just learned that trusting friends can be a major downfall. Only two friends (people I frequently talk to) have helped me. I don't want them to be sad for me since I know they care, but once I'm dead I won't know. 

Anyways, I'll probably overdose on pills. Sounds stupid I know, there are many side effects and shit if you live. But if I play my cards right I'll definitely die. I would jump, but there's now many open access tall buildings. 

If life gets worse within this year, expect me to die this year. I know I'm young and fucking dumb, but this is all I see. I'm such a selfish fucking bitch, I know. Anything's fine, just don't be too rude and I'll reply.
