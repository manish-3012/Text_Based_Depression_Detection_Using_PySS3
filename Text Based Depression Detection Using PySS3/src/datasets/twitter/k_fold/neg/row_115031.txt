Goodbye everyoneI'm a leech on this world I lost all my friends due to my mental illness and insane behaviour..everyone who I knew blocked me or no longer talks to me because I simply can't stop lying to them..everything I say is a lie and I'm disgusted my self I tried to change so many times and for so long but I feel like it is ingrained into me

I have no one around me now and no one left to talk to ... I did this all to myself and I completely deserve it... I deserve all that is coming for me.

On August 1st I'll be doing it ... I already planned out how and the details of it as well

I'm thankful for everyone who read it and I'm sorry to this world I didn't live the way I was supposed to live

I'm incredibly sorry to everyone who I disappointed and everyone I deceived I feel like I hurt so many people on the way because of my own selfish reasons and I hurt so many friends that at this point everyone would rather avoid me.
