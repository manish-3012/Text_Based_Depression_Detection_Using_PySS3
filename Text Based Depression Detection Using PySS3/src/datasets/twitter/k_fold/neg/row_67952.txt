hate work, hate school, just want to sleep all day without disappointing anyoneI will never be able to hold a job

I just started a new position today. I've been looking forward to it all summer, and worked 4 hours today. I can't hang. I have to quit. I'm constantly overwhelmed by work and school, and I should have graduated by now. What's the point of even trying when I could just retire now znd be done with it. I'm tired of sleeping 10 hours and being exhausted. I just want to not wake up
