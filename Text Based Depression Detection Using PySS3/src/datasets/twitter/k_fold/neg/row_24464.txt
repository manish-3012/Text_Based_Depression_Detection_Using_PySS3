I'll never be a normal personAll my life, I've had a hard time relating to people. It's not that I was a loner, or didn't enjoy talking to them. The contrary - I consider myself extroverted. I enjoy talking to people. I even enjoy public speaking. I just can't make friends. It's not that I act in an off-putting way: I dress normally, shower, talk to people, and do all of these other things human beings are supposed to. People don't instantly reject me, I just don't form bonds to them with months of contact, while normal people do in hours.

A while ago, I spoke to a psychiatrist about this, as well as depression. She thought it sounded like I have (high-functioning) autism. She conceded that this was unsolvable, but that I should strive to resolve things, since being unemployed is bad (and, also, won't pay her bills).

Now, I know what the stock response to this is: autism is a part of your personality, if you cured it you wouldn't be you anymore, embrace the weirdness. But here's the thing: I don't want to be weird. I don't want to be a freak, I don't want to live in a group home, I want to be able to hold a drivers license without perjuring myself. All I've ever wanted in my life is to be a normal person. Imagine an accountant with 2.2 children in a stable, loving, monogamous, heterosexual marriage; that's the sort of life-style I'm going for.

In light of what I've understood, it seems like I'll never be able to accomplish that. Normal human relationships will simply be forever off-limits for me. There'll always be the disclaimer, like the ballcap: "Please be patient; I have autism". Put bluntly, I'll always be the outsider. 

It's commonly said that there's no cure for autism, but this is, in fact, not true. It's just a matter of what side-effects you're willing to put up with. In this case, sadly, it seems like anything is better than the status quo.
