I was ready to do it tonightI had handful of pills ready and a tall glass of vodka to wash them down. After I got 2 of the pills down, my floof ball, Mr.Spock (one of my 3 kitties) jumped up on my lap and started loving on me. My kids are grown and don't need me and my husband is mad at me because I don't know why I'm so depressed, but my fur babies Pitch, Mr. Spock, and Ahura still need me. I think Mr. Spock just saved my life, at least for now.
