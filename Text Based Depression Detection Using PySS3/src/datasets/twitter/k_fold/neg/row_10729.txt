I'll have to take responsibilityI need help guys.
I live in Italy, really close to the center of the coronavirus.
Here is the problem, my dad is not only old (67) but also has heart disease and is immunosuppressed.
Not only that, my sister also started cutting herself and developed anorexia.
My mom used to be depressed (she still takes antidepressants) and I'm afraid everything that's happening will destroy her.
I'm scared because of my dad and my sister.
I need some support because I've always been the "strong" son without problems, but in reality I have been depressed for a long time too, I never told anyone tho because we already have a ton of problems.
I just need some support, I'm afraid I'm going to lose everyone I love in an instant
