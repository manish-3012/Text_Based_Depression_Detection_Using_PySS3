Only purpose for existing has left me...My girlfriend of 7 months just broke up with me last night around at midnight. It didn't bother me much at the time but then the next day (next fucking day) I she posted a picture of her and another guy which devastated me on the inside. I don't know what to do anymore besides killing myself. I want her to feel remorse for what she did to me. And if she doesn't, it certainly won't matter because I'll be dead. At the very least I just want the pain to go away.
