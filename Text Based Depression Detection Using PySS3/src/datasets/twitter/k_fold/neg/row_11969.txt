AcceptanceI believe things will never get better and, that some people aren't meant to be here. This sadness inside of me never goes away. I've never seen a point in living. I'm so empty and lost. When things look better, it crumbles. I'm incapable of feeling happy. I just don't think life's for me anymore. Everyday is a struggle. No matter how hard I try to get help, no one can. I'm so alone. No one understands how it feels this far gone. No one. I try so hard but I let everyone down. I ruined my six months clean two weeks ago. I want to do it again and actually die this time. Or take a bottle of pills or throw myself off a bridge. I'm just so done
