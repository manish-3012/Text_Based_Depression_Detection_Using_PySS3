I need some advice

I have extreme trust issues I donâ€™t trust my family, I donâ€™t trust people I go to school with and no one in general. Itâ€™s more serious with my family i donâ€™t trust any of them to the point where when my dad is cooking and he has a knife even just next to him I assume heâ€™s going to try and kill me same with my brother and a little less with my mother she seems mor trustable. Iâ€™ve been thinking about killing my self but donâ€™t really see that as the way I want to die, and I want to go to a therapist but I donâ€™t trust any one in my family and they are the only ones who are kinda inclined to take me to one. Also I donâ€™t know if I have a mental disorder. Anyway just need some advice.
