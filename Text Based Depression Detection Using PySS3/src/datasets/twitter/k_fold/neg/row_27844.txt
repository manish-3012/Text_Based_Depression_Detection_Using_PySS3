I've been depressed for a long time, but the way my dad treated me on Sunday might be the last strawPlease read my previous posts for more context. He choked me and threw me into my shelf for no reason and everyone in my family is saying it's my fault. Fuck all of them. If they hate me so much, I should end it all. My life is shit enough as is.
