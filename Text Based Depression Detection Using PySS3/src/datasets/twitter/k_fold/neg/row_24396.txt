I'm planning to kill myself during spring break.I really don't see the point in my life anymore. I'm 20 and am on the verge of dropping out of college for the 2nd time because I've lost all determination to do better. I have no friends and my family is always disappointed in me. I have no money, can't find a job, am in debt I can't pay off, and don't have a license. Everything I try to do to make me happy just never works out and I'm so sick of it. I don't even want to seek therapy anymore because it just no longer helps me. Even the things that I think should try to make me feel better I can't even do because of financial problems.

My spring break is in a week and I'm planning on an OD. I'd honestly rather just die than continue living like this for another twenty years. I'm done.
