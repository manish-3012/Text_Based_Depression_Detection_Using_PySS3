I cannot forget the events of earlier this year and I've given up all hopeMy ex did some real shitty shit before he kicked me out and I can't stop reliving all of it. It wont get out of my head. Everything I felt then just bubbles back up and I start to cry and choke and my heart pounds. I know theres women who's exs or s/os beat them but shit this might as well have been a beating because why why why?? I thought my life was finally starting to turn around for the better for once and the one person I trusted the most, loved the most, fucking made things shit again. It seriously just took away all of my hope for relationships. They all end up this way and I dont understand the point of trying anymore if everyone's just going to kick dirt in my face and leave me in the dust. I'm tired of this. It's too repetitive.
