I hate how i look, i really doThats basically a issue that is on my mind 24/7, no matter where i am what i do im constantly worried that i look worse than i normally do and try to hide myself under as many layers as possible. At home i diet, i exercise and stand infront of the mirror for sometimes up to hours, or avoid them completely. Im fat, im ugly. Also please dont try to say that looks dont matter, they might not for everyone, but for me and alot of others they really do and i have heard it so many times.
