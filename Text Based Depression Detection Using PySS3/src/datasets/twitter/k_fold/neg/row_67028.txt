Even my wife can't helpI used to always be able to talk to her, and she would talk to me if she needed.
I'm only alive because of her, without her I couldn't face this god awful shit show. She is the moon to my stars, my light in the dark and looking at her for the millionth time makes me just as happy as I was when I saw her the first.
But we both have depression.
And it's been getting harder to fucking fight it every day. We tried to kill ourselves in February. When it didn't work we promised we'd try harder and not get to that point again. And yet here we are.
I've been slipping for a long time. I've relapsed on cutting myself and burning my skin, just to feel something to escape my head I can't take it anymore my dreams are scaring me and I can't tell her about them and the meds aren't working and I can't tell her about that and the coping skills aren't working and I can't fucking tell her.
We just keep feeding off each other's pain. I just want to go away so she won't keep hurting when I'm hurting. We're too empathetic with each other.

I want to kill myself soon. So that she can move on. I'm weighing her down, I'm just making her own mental health worse and I can't be strong enough for the both of us, and it's clear that she's not strong enough for us either. But it's always bad, and neither of us want to fight. She too afraid of trying pills again.

But I have so many tempting pills in my drawer. Such evil, bliss. I want to die. I'm tired, and I want to let everything go on without me. 
It's just that one question on my head again, the one I've been asking since I was a child.

When? When will it be enough?
