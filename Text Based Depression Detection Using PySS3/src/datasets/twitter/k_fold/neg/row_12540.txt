Had an urge yesterday so I decided to take the highwayCouldn't do it because I was too busy thinking about what would happen if I didn't die in a car crash. Fucking anxiety. It always prevents my suicide. 

I remember when I was still hopeful. Thought there was a way out, that I could recover somehow. Everytime I go to subs about mental illness and I see people talking about how they got triggered by their SO or work or at the bar or whatever. And I just can't stop thinking "dude I *wish* I had your problems. You have got your life together, you're upset over things that are so minor to me, fucking hell. 

I have a concrete plan now. It's the first time I have one. Before it was just the wish to kill myself. Now I am going to do it, when I feel ready. There is no way out. Fuck everyone who says recovery is bumpy and hard. Fuck off. You have **no** idea.
