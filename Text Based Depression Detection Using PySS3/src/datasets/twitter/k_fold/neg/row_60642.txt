My last wordsI don't care if you call me a coward. I don't care if you call me weak, pathetic, a fuck up that took the easy way out of a situation that isn't even bad. I don't fucking care anymore. I don't care if you make jokes about my death afterwards, hell - at least people care after I'm dead. Fuck you mum. You never fucking believed in me, you always took out all of your anger towards dad on me because I'm the only other fucking male in the house, you demeaned me to the point where I wanted to fucking kill you when you were drunk on endless cans of beer. You swore at me, hit me over the smallest fucking shit, and you compared me to every fucking other person alive. Hell, now that I'll be dead, you're happy that the disappointment is gone, and you can spend all your money on your glorious little daughter, right? A huge fucking burden lifted off of your shoulders! You are the biggest fucking narcissist I've ever met in my life, and I hope you get fucking murdered. I just wanna say thanks to my best friends. You guys were the only ones keeping me alive in the days that I climbed up to the roof with a suicide note and nearly jumped. You guys were fucking awesome. Thanks for being my friends, thanks for putting up with my stupid shit, thanks for making me laugh, thanks for talking to me about whatever. Thanks so much for existing - you guys are wonderful people. Sorry.
