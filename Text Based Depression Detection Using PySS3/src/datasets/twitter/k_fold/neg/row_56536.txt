I feel somewhat lostSo life has been a real roller coaster for the past couple of weeks, and some things have changed of course. And i got off "seronil" because it made me feel like i'm not alive. Socially things are super fucking great at this moment :,) But the real problem kicks in when i actually do feel like okay and stuff, but still id love to just disappear so i could get my head straight. Because like i said things are okay but there is still a lot on my mind. Id love to just get a break from everything and get things sorted "in my head". I don't know, i guess it sounds pretty stupid out loud? but that's really how i feel. What do you guys think? love yall. -J
