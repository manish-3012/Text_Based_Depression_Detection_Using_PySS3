Not sure how long I can keep winning this...Don't know how to start this, every day is just getting harder and harder. Had our first girl 2 years ago, she's the best and the worst thing to ever happen to me. She keeps me shackled to a  life I hate yet is a beacon so bright the thought of leaving it all tears me apart. I used to ride motorbikes around the world, I used to climb mountains, now I'm reduced to the provider of a fucking pay check. My wife went through breast cancer 3 months after my daughter was born, no one gave a fuck about what I was going through. Now I'm out on the sidelines, a walking fucking paycheck shackled to a life of misery by the only thing that actually brings me any joy in life. The wife doesn't pull her own weight with the baby and I'm so fucking tired from her keeping me up all night that I yelled at my daughter. Which in turn hurt me more than anything anyone else could do to me. 
I'm scared about what tomorrow will bring, every day just gets harder and harder, the edge just gets closer and closer. I could get through yesterday, I just got through today but soon it's going to just be one more step than I can handle. The scariest part is there is no one out there who can just scoop me off the floor and fix me. 

I'm going for a run, don't normally do it, might just go and run until I hurt and fall asleep. Maybe if I disappear for a few days people might miss me.
