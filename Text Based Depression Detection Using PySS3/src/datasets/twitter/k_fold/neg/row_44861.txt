My dad died, then two days later my ex who Iâ€™m still in love with sent me a picture of her positive pregnancy test.. fun!!My dad died of cancer, now my ex who Iâ€™m still in love with sent me a picture of her positive pregnancy test. Her and her boyfriend are pregnant. Iâ€™m not allowed to say I feel like Iâ€™m cursed apparently, but maybe some deity out there just hates me. Iâ€™m tired of life.
