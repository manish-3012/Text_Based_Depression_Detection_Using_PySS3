Considering going off meds, any advice/experience?When I first went to the doc for generic anti-depressants (I think it was about 3 or 4 years ago), the doctor wanted to send me to the hospital instead because I was very suicidal.

Lately I've felt much better! Have a full time job, living at home to save and pay off college debt (mom is great to talk to, dad...eh), a few friends and family I talk to once in a while, but overall focusing on myself.

Side effects of the meds make me feel like I'm only ever 80% there, plus the other common side effects I'm tired of.

Was just wondering if anyone here had experiences (good or bad) going off meds?

If I do go off meds, it will be under doctors guidance.
