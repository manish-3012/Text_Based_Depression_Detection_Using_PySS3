Will I go to hell because of severe chronic pain? I want to continue living and there is so much I want to achieve and explore in this world. However, Iâ€™m in severe chronic pain daily due to a surgery. I have consulted plenty of surgeons and many did not understand why. A few of them had wrongly diagnosed drugs to me that did not work. I have seen over 3 therapists and none was able to help. 

I feel suicidal everyday after the surgery and I am not the same person anymore. I donâ€™t talk to my friends and family anymore cause Iâ€™m so mentally drained and I donâ€™t ans to hurt anyone. I pray to God everyday to heal me but the pain is getting worse and worse. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Will I go to hell if I kill myself due to chronic physical pain? Where will I go? Thank you
