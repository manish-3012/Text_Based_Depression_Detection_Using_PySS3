Desperately want helpI desperately need help. I'm at the point where I'm self harming every day and almost constantly thinking of suicide. But I do want to get help. The issue now is that I have no medical insurance, and would never be able to afford mental health care without it. I've begun looking into clinics but I desperately need advice on how to find one that actually knows what they're doing and could also help provide low cost/free medication.
