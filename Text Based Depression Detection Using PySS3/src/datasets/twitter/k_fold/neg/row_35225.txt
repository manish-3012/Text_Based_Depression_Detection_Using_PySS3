I stopped eating and drinking, for some reason I'm posting about it hereSorry in advance for the language and bad writing.

Hello, I'm a 22 year old college student and I've been pretty fucking down for a long time.  I don't really feel focused enough to write a nicely formatted post so fuck it.  Basically, I've been depressed for about 6 years with the initial catalyst being my girlfriend leaving me for my best friend (at the time).  My depression and ADHD have always led me to perform beneath my perception of my abilities, but I can't tell if that's because I'm a narcissist or lazy.  I've self-harmed and made attempts on my own life in the past, struggled with addiction, practiced lucid dreaming to combat frequent nightmares that I suspect stem from two very uncomfortable instances of a sexual nature when I was a small child, put hours into practicing meditation and working out, and sampled many psychedelics. 



   But nothing has really cured my depression for more than a few weeks (I tried an anti-depressant too).  I've never talked about most of this with anyone; I feel like I could imagine a person's response to my description of any of this, so why should I allow myself to be vulnerable if it won't result in the acquisition of novel information? 






  I'm sleepy and I feel like I'm rambling with poor formatting, so I'm going to lie down until my back gets tired or whatever.  I'm not exactly suicidal but I haven't really consumed anything since sometime on thursday.

Does anyone have any advice?
