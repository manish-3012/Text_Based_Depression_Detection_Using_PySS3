I can't take anymore of this.I'm not gonna write a novel here. She was my first love. We're long distance. Long story short we connected after being forcibly disconnected three years ago. She tells me she loves me. Now she tells me it was all a lie. That's not the girl I fell in love with. I feel so betrayed, so hurt, and all I want to do is die.
