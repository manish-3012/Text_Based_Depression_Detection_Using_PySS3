Itâ€™s my birthday tomorrow and all I wish is for someone or something to kill meI canâ€™t stand my fucking family and in this fucking quarantine Iâ€™m literally stuck with them 24/7 which is driving me insane and turning me more suicidal. I want to move out but Iâ€™m a fucking loser with no money. I hope I die in my sleep so I donâ€™t spend another birthday pondering why Iâ€™m still alive.
