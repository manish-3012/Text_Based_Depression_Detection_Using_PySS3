heartbreakI dont need anything from anyone, and I never will again. I dont need attention, affection, kindness, compassion, understanding...they only want to manipulate me, take my body, rip things from my skin, dissolve my limbs to create a soup for their children. I will not allow anyone ever again to be anywhere near my heart
