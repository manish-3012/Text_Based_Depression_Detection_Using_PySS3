Tomorrow is the daySo I've decided to end my life, tonight I got fired, did a little self harm, more to come, and I no longer have anything to live for, my family hates me, my friends hate me, my roommates hate me hell even my cat hates me... Its clear the problem is me, so I'm going to solve the problem I've been trying to solve my whole life... Tomorrow I end my life
