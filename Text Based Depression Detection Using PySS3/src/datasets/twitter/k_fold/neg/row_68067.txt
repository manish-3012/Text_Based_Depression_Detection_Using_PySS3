Nobody listens until is too lateI have been suicidal most of my life, have always think it would be a relief to be gone. Sometimes, when i feel really weak about it, i tell somebody, but they never seem to take it seriously, and i just dont mention it again. The thing is, i feel closer to do it every year, i have lookfor ways to do it, look for the things i may need online and in my house,  and made peace with the remorse i feel for the people i would be leaving behind. Today i told my husband i was thinking of leaving behind everyone or killing myself, we were talking about another theme and this was my solution about it. It didnt seem to really resonate in him. I think he thinks is not going to happen, but i am not so sure, it seems like the only way i will be in peace and without pain. I am just tired of living, living has been hard. I am tired of letting people know that i am not okay, it never seems to make a difference. I need someone in my life to advocate for my mental health because if is up to me, i know i wont make it far, i dont have the energy, i dont have the strength and i dont love life as to make all that heavy lifting with my so tired being.
