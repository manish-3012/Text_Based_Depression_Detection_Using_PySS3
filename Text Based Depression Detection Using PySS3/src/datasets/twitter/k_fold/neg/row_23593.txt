Checking out.I don't want help anymore. I don't want to try. Popped my pills already, chased them with a drink, and I'll probably smoke a little and let it all hit me. I just feel helpless and hopeless, and I don't give a fuck anymore. 

I feel bad for putting all this on my boyfriend and his family, since they were so kind to take me in after I was kicked out of my house. I don't think I'll mention anything to him; I'll just fall into a cold slumber by his side tonight.
