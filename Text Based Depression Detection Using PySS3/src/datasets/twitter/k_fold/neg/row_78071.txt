I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna kill myself anymore.Weâ€™re both 15 year old boys. 

Iâ€™ve done some thinking and Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™m not gonna be dying anytime soon because thereâ€™s one single person who needs me here and I canâ€™t let him down. I want to at least get married because I donâ€™t want him to think my love for him was only temporary. I donâ€™t want him to kill himself either (I know itâ€™s hypocritical but itâ€™s the best Iâ€™ve got) besides I love him too much to never see him again even if it means living a miserable life for longer than I wanted to. So yea thereâ€™s exactly one thing I have to live for. Itâ€™s not worth it to me to let him suffer alone. Iâ€™d rather suffer with him. Besides, we have good times together. Even during the constant misery that is life itself, it would be a lot worse without him, which probably means we should stay together. So being here together has more perks to me than being gone. We canâ€™t be together if weâ€™re both gone, so... 

Thatâ€™s about it. Sorry if Iâ€™m breaking any rules or putting people down. I just figured I should tell someone about it.
