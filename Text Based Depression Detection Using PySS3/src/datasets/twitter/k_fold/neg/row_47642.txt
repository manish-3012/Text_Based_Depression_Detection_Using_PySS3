Psychologist thinks I should kill myself if exposure therapy doesn't workI went to The Black Dog Institute in Sydney late last year because I was having suicidal thoughts largely due to anxiety. The psychologist recommended exposure therapy and said that if he thought it wouldn't work for me, that he'd talk to me about committing suicide because how I am now is no way to live. 

I'm thinking that was his clumsy way of trying to say that he really believes in the effectiveness of exposure therapy...?

Anyway, exposure therapy didn't work, and all I can think of now is that this psychologist also thinks I should kill myself. 

It was over a year ago and it's all I can think about, especially when I'm at a really low point.

I think it's mainly because I thought that my depression and anxiety were making me think illogically, but this guy was basically like "nope you're life sucks, definitely kill yourself if this doesn't work".
