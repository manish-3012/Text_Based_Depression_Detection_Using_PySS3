Everything is pointlessI am done i see things clearly now i make everything difficult for everybody im a dissapointment to everyone that meets me i dont know whats wrong with me but i know what i have to do i know i dont matter i know that everyone will move on without me i am an extremely small part in everyones life i will be forgotten i will not be remembered everyone will be free of me like they always wanted everyone prospered as i failed people said they wanted to help, were going to help but never followed through never asked about it again when i said i was fine they just walked away even though it was clear that wasnt the case people dont open up you have to make them they dont want to for whatever reason they cant unless it is forced out of them goodbye
