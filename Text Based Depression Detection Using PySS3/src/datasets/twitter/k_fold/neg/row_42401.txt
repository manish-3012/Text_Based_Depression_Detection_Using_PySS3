I need helpI feel nothing but want to stop feeling at the same time.

I think everything in my life is a lie.

I hurt the people i love because i can't let them in.

I've done shitty, hurtful things that I don't know why I've done.

I've been having increasingly active suicidal thoughts but lack the willpower to carry them out.

I just want everything to stop. My head to be quiet.

I have absolutely no idea who I am.

The only thing i can do is go to work, it's like a switch flips and I'm capable of doing my job but the second i clock out I'm back to feeling like this. It's been starting to creep its way in while I'm at work too.

I think I've damaged my most meaningful relationship beyond repair and have no idea how to undo/fix it.

What is the best thing to do? What us the most effective way of getting back in control of my own mind?

I have been putting off registering with a doctor for months and i don't know why, i know it's something i need to do, i just can't bring myself to do it.

I'm doubtful about therapy because i am incapable of speaking my feelings, my mind just goes blank.

I feel like medication might work but i guess I'm scared because medical help is my last resort and I feel like if it doesn't work I won't be able to cope anymore.
