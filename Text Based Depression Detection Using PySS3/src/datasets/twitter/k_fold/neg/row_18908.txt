Why should I live?!So I'm 26 years old... living with my parents for the 4th year after my divorce to my ex-husband who was abusive. I ran away at 19 to a guy that I thought would save me but it ended from homelessness in St. Paul, MN to an abusive lifestyle in Jacksonville, FL. I finally found the courage to move home when I turned 23 and came out as lesbian... than a year and a half later... Transgender. I transitioned in 2014 til now getting everything but FTM bottom surgery. I dated few but this last girl was my true soul mate and somehow I fucked it up by getting drunk and raging about an issue I wasn't ok with but when I was sober I'd say I was 'ok' with. Now I'm single... back to where I started.... I have two more semesters until I graduate college and am elligible for a good job so I can move out... but that seems so far away and I just want this pain to end now... I'll never be good enough for anyone and even if I am who I feel I am... I"m still a fuck up... I'm so close to just ending it all and not giving anymore fucks.
