Need helpI'm 23M and has never had a gf before. All my life I've wanted to be in a loving relationship but unfortunately never found a girl willing to give me a chance. Im a very shy guy and can't approach most girls and whichever ones I do approach text me for a couple of weeks and then disappear. The girls that do text me back I get obsessed about and I end up thinking about them every hour of the day constantly texting them, this could be why they stop texting. I don't know what to do with my life, I constantly walk up and down trying to find things to do but I just end up in a loop. I feel psychotic but I don't have funds for a therapist. The past couple weeks I just feel like ending it all, I'm scared cause this feeling is getting stronger daily. How do I change my life around? Any habits I should incorporate in my daily routine?. I'm desperate and will try anything to become better
