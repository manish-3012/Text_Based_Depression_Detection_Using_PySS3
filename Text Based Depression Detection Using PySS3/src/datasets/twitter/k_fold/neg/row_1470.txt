to stay alive u gotta kill ur mind 8~~)The first and last time I took benzos (non-RC) (4 mg of alprazolam for my 49kg body lol) I hated it. I didn't remember the whole day. I had just few flashbacks when classmates told me about my funny behavior that day, but that's it.

I hated it 'cause it reminded me of times when I used to do RC (synthetic) stimulants almost every day for over 6 months. 'Cause of them I can't remember most of last 5-4 years of my life.

I hated them more when my ex-classmate commited suicide by eating clonazepam and sipping vodka. The same guy who introduced me to drugs. But he was a good person. F

Anyway - now I want to abuse them. I've never felt such desire for "the worst" drugs like right now. I want to get addicted, forget every single day, be apathetic, dull, anhedonic. Any way of slowly destroying myself is good 'cause I'm too much of a pussy to just kill myself at once.

Unfortunately I don't have money for that. Gotta find a job.Â Â  Codeine syrup will have to do for now.

Ur turn to describe ur present life.

Lmao I just realized I'm such a cloud rapper - lean, xans, suicide.
