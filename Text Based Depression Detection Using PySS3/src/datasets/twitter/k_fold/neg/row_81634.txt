My Suicidal BrotherHello, I am really worried about my brother. His girlfriend broke up with him, he has a big debt and has tried suicide 3-5 times now. In my country he can't be forced to have treatment or anything like that, and I would like to know what can I do to make him feel better. Thanks for your support in advance!
