I'm scared I'll take another overdoseI got real close to a friend of mine of many years, everything seemed to be falling in place after I had 2 bad years since my best friend died. Last year I took an overdose and this actually how I got closer to this friend. I think they have some commitment issues and I have been rejected and now I feel like I did before my last overdose. I'm scared of myself
