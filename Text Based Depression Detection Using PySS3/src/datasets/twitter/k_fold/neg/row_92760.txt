TitleHi. I just got some really bad news! I have to pay 2400$ to get out all four of my wisdom teeth. And honestly whatâ€™s the point of me getting them removed if Iâ€™m going to die? 
I really canâ€™t handle being alive anymore. Being dirt poor sucks. This covid stuff has shown me I canâ€™t trust anybody and Showed me Iâ€™m really really depressed. I really only have my parents because none of my friends follow covid guidelines. And right now my parents arenâ€™t really being emotionally or physically there for me. I havenâ€™t socialized with a decent human outside of my family in months. It feels like Iâ€™ll never find anyone that isnâ€™t family that I can relate with. Nobody has the same spiritual believes, nobody researches stuff, nobody has the same dedication to things. Iâ€™m usually a really motivated and dedicated person. It just feels like itâ€™s not worth it to be alive anymore if I canâ€™t afford it. I want a therapist but they cost too much money and googling how to kill myself didnâ€™t give me any answers either. 
I made it to 18 having told myself I was going to kill myself by then but itâ€™s looking like that is a possibility still. 
I donâ€™t really have a question honestly I just... I just want to know if truly it gets better.
