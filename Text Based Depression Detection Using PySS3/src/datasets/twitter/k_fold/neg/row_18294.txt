I didn't even eat much...I ate a handful of raisins and a handful of sweet potato fries, and I felt lightheaded and sick. A while later, I started getting suicidal. Even though the wind was like 40mph and it was absolutely pissing outside I went to the tree I plan to hang myself off of. I got to the rope I hid 50 feet up but fumbled with it in the freezing rain and dropped it and I fell from 35 feet trying to get back down to get the rope.

I didn't break anything, I hope. Everything hurts and I wish I'd just done it or wore gloves so my fingers weren't so numb. Can't fucking hang myself right what the fuck.
