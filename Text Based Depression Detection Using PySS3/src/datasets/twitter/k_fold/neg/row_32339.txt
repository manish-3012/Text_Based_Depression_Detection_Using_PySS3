Family who do not understandSo I am going through a terrible terrible divorce. I have lost my kids due to alcoholism and had to complete a parenting agreement this week for my divorce than was less than ideal. I am currently living with my parents while I recuperate and save money. I have been off  of work 8 times this year due to 3 times in rehab and in a mental institution 5 times for alcoholism. This morning I was suicidal and my mother did nothing but yell at me that Iâ€™m going to lose my job. I yelled back that what does a job mean if Iâ€™m dead. I hav been in the phone all morning trying to find a dual diagnosis facility. She has been on the phone all morning telling people what a horrible person I am for yelling at her. Making a suicidal person the bad guy is pretty fucking low. I donâ€™t even know what to do. Thanks for reading.
