Handcuffed and thrown in the back seat of a police car for suicidal Idealation.Yes folks, when you are suicidal and tell someone you are treated like a criminal.  Escorted and forced to go to the hospital,kept there and observed by cops and transported to the loony bin handcuffed and thrown into the back seat.  Then stip searched, loaded on meds.  You have no say in what you want to take, when you want to sleep, and have nothing or do but wander around and watch whatever they play on the single television.  Then you ar ekept there until you lie and and pretend you are no longer suicidal, or your insurance runs out.  This has happened to me twice.  Two other times I lied during my evaluation at the hospital to avoid being commited.  

Great insight into how our society handles people who are in tremendous pain and suffering huh?
