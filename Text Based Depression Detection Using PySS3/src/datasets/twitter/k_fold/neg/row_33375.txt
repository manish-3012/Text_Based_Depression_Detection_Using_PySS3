I Am Going to Kill MyselfAll I do is spread unhappiness.  I can't possibly be happy myself.  I tell those I love that I don't love them.  I purposely love women that don't want me.  My mom hates me.  I'm unstable.  No one takes me seriously because I'm so depressing and intense.  I've been depressed since I was 13.  I've been depressed for over 9 years.  No one can help me.  The people who understand are just as unstable and I'll be dishing out love to them until they've taken all I have and gone.  People who don't understand are boring.  And they have their bullshit little quips.  It's so obvious they don't think about anything.  Worst part is that I'm smart.  You can't be smart in this world anymore.  So just to top off my lonely depressing life, the world is in a shambles and going to burn very shortly.  The people in charge are doing whatever they can to make a buck while the world dives into poverty and environmental issues. _x000D_

No one understands me.  I can't believe that anyone would love me.  I'm afraid of happiness.  I've excelled at a lot of things.  I was athletic.  I've lived.  But I just can't do this anymore.  Living without being able to believe anyone loves you.  It drives you crazy.  I have to keep moving and not thinking about anything.  Just entirely in the moment.  It sucks.  There's no point to life.  I'm just a fucking failure.  By choice.  I don't want to be happy.  I want to keep failing.  Until maybe I'm shooting up heroin.  Maybe then I could see some sort of willpower in myself and change._x000D_

Bought 3 bottles of the cheapest vodka the liquor store had to offer.  Got ahold of some xanax and oxy.  First the pills, then the liquor.  Thank you for trying.  But to be honest, I'm just answering your questions to humor you, as honest as they actually are.  I would just like you to know that I DID live a happy life, before I remembered that I would have to reflect on it before I died.  And when the reflection started (rather, was forced, by the one girl who said she loved me and really meant it), I found too many problems to cope with.  I lived in the moment as much as I could.  And it lasted a while.  For everyone else, live in the moment.  Love those around you.  Remember: Dish out all of your love before you decide to off yourself.  I have nothing else to offer, otherwise, I would be out helping too.  I am essentially without a soul.  This is the only sane choice i can make.
