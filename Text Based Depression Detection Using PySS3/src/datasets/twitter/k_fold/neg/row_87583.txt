Today, my mind showed me a fake memory, one where I'm dying and I have only one person aside by meThat clear image, her words, her tears, that hurt me so much, do I really want to die?

the moment I saw that image, my body felt as if my temperature had dropper and I just started bawling, I took a hot shower, but I still feel really, really, really cold, even though I'm covered by a blouse and my warm sheets, also, the temperature at my city is really, really nice, like a solid 23-24 degrees.
