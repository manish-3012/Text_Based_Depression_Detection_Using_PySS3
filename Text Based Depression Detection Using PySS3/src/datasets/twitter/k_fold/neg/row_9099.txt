Sometimes it's a struggle.I'm a coke addict.

it's one of, if not THE main reason I tried to kill myself on boxing day 2 years ago.

I've had help with the drug addiction but I'm still using, sometimes I think I should have found a higher bridge to jump off, death means I don't have to take this horrible drug anymore. Everytime I go a few weeks or an entire month without using I relapse. I need to understand why I do this? without this answer all I'm doing is edging closer to that edge where I'll try and finish off the job this time. Next time there won't be any second chances, this time I won't be waking up in hospital in ICU. The second time I do it, I'll make sure I die this time, walking in front of a train appeals to me. nice and quick, I just need to make sure the trains travelling quick enough for me to not feel anything. Throwing myself off a bridge didn't work so I guess that's the next best thing. I'm not at this point yet but if I don't/can't kick this drug addiction then i'll arrive at that point. it's just the question of when, not if. 

Sure, it upsets me that I'll leave family and freinds behind but guess what? The same thing I thought about when I last tried to end my life.

Once you're dead, you won't even know you've been alive so they'll be no hard feelings. I'd love for someone to tell me the answer to that one.

I'll cease to remember when everything goes black and my heart stops beating. I've always wondered if there's an afterlife. hopefully be alot better than being addicted to drugs eh?
