Whatâ€™s the point?What is the point of living? Why should I keep going through every day when I just donâ€™t want to anymore? I just donâ€™t see it anymore. When I imagine a future it doesnâ€™t bring me joy, it makes me dread living hundreds of more days. When I imagine what used to be my dream job I could not care less anymore. My hobbies mean nothing to me. I am weeks behind in my schoolwork with finals starting on Monday. I just donâ€™t see the point of it all anymore. Everything feels so miserable.
