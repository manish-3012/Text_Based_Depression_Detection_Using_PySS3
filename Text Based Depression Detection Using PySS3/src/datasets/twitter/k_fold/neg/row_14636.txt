I have no reason to die but I want to??Since 7th grade I've contemplated  suicide almost everyday for like 4 years. I actually have a good living situation. I'm good at drawing, clarinet, etc and have friends. My parents support me and love me unconditionally and I have generally  good grades in school, and a good life. But sometimes out of the blue I just think about killing myself,  how I could kill myself and what people would say at my funeral. Lately I've been thinking of suicide A LOT (like every 2 hours ).
Is this just a normal hormonal teenager thing or what
