I'm donei kick myself everyday for letting myself let her leave. how much of an idiot i was to let her go for a little while this summer expecting her to come back to me. i deserved all the shit that happened to me this summer and fuck if i just got one more chance to prove to her how i could love her i would. how i could be the person i promised i could be. but the answer was no. and its hitting me harder than i thought it could ever have. just a little while and hopefully i will be at peace with everything.
