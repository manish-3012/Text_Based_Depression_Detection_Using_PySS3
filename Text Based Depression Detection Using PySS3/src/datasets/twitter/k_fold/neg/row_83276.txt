Decided I'm just going to get it over withI'm sick of this. I don't even know why I'm posting on here. My personal life is nothing but hell. Just absolute pure hell. I don't know what to do who to reach out to where to go can't afford therapy don't even have the time for it since I'm always working. I try to get on here try to find someone to talk to when I need someone to talk to. I first got trolled on this sub. Told to livestream my suicide. I tried posting again on here and my post got immediately downvoted. So I went to kindvoices where this happened: https://old.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/comments/cs9z1v/l_28m_tried_posting_to_suicidewatch_my_post_got/

I'm at a loss. I don't know what else to do. I don't have anyone in real life to turn to. There's no place I can turn to no one I can turn to the world just bites back at me the moment I try to open up it seems. It's all purely pitch black. I'm done I'm throwing in the towel.  This weekend I won't have to deal with the kind of shit life throws at me no one can say though that I never tried to reach out to anyone because I did.
