I'm friends with a girl who will probably kill herself if I cut ties with her. What do I do? [Posted on AskReddit too]I'm friends with a girl that I met last year, and she's gotten kind of out of hand. She's one of my best friends, and is dating another of my friends, but he's going to break up with her. She has depression, and constantly talks about committing suicide. She's gotten quite. . . moody recently, talking about her boyfriend and saying things like " I'll destroy his entire computer. then he'll hate me" "He cant run anywhere" Which worries me a lot, considering she doesn't even seem to care about him at this point. She's also ridiculously needy and self-centered, talking about how everything is so horrible and how she's worried sick when her boyfriend doesn't answer his phone once. I feel bad for her, because she IS in a state of depression, and i know she has family issues as well. She does have a psychiatrist, but she refuses to tell them anything about her life. She denies all help we try to give her, and she still stays just as melodramatic as before. I feel like I'm in an abusive friendship, but I'm scared that she'll kill herself if I cut ties with her, and I care enough to not want that to happen. Any suggestions, Reddit? :I
