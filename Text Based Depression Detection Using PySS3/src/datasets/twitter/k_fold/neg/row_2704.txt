I'm going to kill myself.I don't fucking care anymore. My own family barely talks to me,. I have no friends, nothing. I can't fucking do anything for myself anymore. There's no point living in this fucking world and there's literally nobody that's going to miss me. I have to practically BEG my family to talk to me. How sad is that?? I barely see them, barely talk to them. It's ridiculous and sad. I have friends, but i don't think they're real friends. I barely see them too. Less than I see my family. I feel like I have no one I can fucking talk to about anything. I'm so sick of everything. I want it all to end. I'm done trying.
