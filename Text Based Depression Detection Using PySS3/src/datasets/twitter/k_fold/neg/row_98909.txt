i just got out of an institution for a suicide attempt and my boyfriend immediately broke up with mei posted here several days ago about how my boyfriend was replacing me. i ended up telling him i needed to go to a mental institute to receive help because i wanted to get better mentally. the one i went to actually lead to more trauma (it was a very cheap institute and handled terribly/i was put in the violent wing for being in crisis) but i got prescribed antidepressants to help me battle this depression anxiety im facing

as soon as i got out, he let me rant and rave about how much i missed him, how happy i was to see him and talk to him, how much i loved him, how i was thinking about him my entire time in there and how he was the only reason i stayed okay in there. then he broke up with me and, i was replaced by the person i was afraid was replacing me

im absolutely heartbroken and really want to commit suicide now but i cant. i cant go back in there, and i cant go back on this path im trying to stay on. i want to do so badly but i dont know what to do
