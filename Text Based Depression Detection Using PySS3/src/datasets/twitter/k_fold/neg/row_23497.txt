tired of lifenothings particularly too horrible in life right now, but nothing is good either. school is stressing me out, as i am failing almost all my class &amp; my social life is dwindling because i just sit in my room all day. i cant get myself to do anything. school work, chores, making plans. i occasionally go to class, &amp; lay in my bed all day. i donâ€™t even get food anymore if its not available in my room. ive felt shittier &amp; hated life a lot more before but right now i just feel empty and idk somehow it just feels worse not being able to be happy, but not having a valid reason to feel this depressed, if that makes sense. i already wrote my letter and theres such a slim chance i actually will go through with it, because of my family, but im just stuck feeling this way and i just want to die. ive had more, actual suicidal thoughts more these past few weeks than the rest of my life. i just want to be able to kill myself and not feel guilty or leave any loved ones behind, hurting.
