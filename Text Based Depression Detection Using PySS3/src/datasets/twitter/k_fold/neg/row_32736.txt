Iâ€™m in so much debtFirst thing first, Iâ€™m a little drunk but I need help

I am very depressed at the moment, I went on a holiday and spent too much money just to try and keep me happy. Iâ€™m in huge debt (loan off girlfriend, a $20000 for a car and I have two small loans that I used to help me earlier in life. I have come to the conclusion that I have way too much Debt and that the only way out is to kill myself. There is no way I can pay all the loans, plus rent and pay my girlfriend back and Iâ€™m not sure what to do. I have turned to drinking and Iâ€™m scared that when my girlfriend gets home, itâ€™ll push me and I will turn to suicide.

I also have my car registration to pay in the next week and if I donâ€™t pay that back, I wonâ€™t be able to get to work. I donâ€™t know what to do and Iâ€™m scared. Someone give me advice. Please.
Iâ€™ve asked everyone to help me to pay things off but they donâ€™t have any money to spare so Iâ€™m worried what will happen if I canâ€™t pay everything back. Please help, Iâ€™ve come to terms with suicide being the best way out even though I know itâ€™ll effect everyone I love. Iâ€™ve talked to my friends and family about my depression and it feels like they donâ€™t understand and that they think Iâ€™m overreacting
