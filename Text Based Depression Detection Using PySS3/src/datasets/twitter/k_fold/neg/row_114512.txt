I'm scared.I want to do it now. As soon as possible. I keep waiting for it to get better. Every time something bad happens I keep waiting. And even when nothing bad is happening I'm hung up on old things, or things that haven't even happened? I think I'm done now. But I'm scared. I'm not sure I have the courage to go through with it.
