Hey guys, Iâ€™m a 20 year old guy serving as the emotional rock for a family with two suicidal parents and I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.Hi everyone. 

This happened about an hour ago.

It would take days to explain all the issues in our lives that lead to tonightâ€™s occurrence, but Iâ€™ll try to keep it brief. Essentially I received a text from my mom while at work saying she â€œneeded my helpâ€.  A few more messages were exchanged until I realized she clearly needed me home. I left work and came home to a scene that will traumatize me until I die, my mom was on the kitchen floor with her wrists slit and the knife beside her. I instantly checked the injuries and pulled my phone out to call 911 before I realized they werenâ€™t all that serious. Hereâ€™s the backstory.

Our family was very well off financially for many years, but that all came to an end in 2011 when my dad quit his job in order to pursue another opportunity. Seven years down the road he is still unemployed and has spent almost $3,000,000 of his savings to keep us afloat. The well ran dry almost a year ago and he has now amassed almost $100,000 in debt. My mom still works full time making enough money for us to only be short around $2,000 a month, but needless to say it adds up. Tonight I think she just broke down from the stress of everything. She constantly has to maintain a positive outlook for the kids, work full time, and support my dad emotionally as he is severely depressed. On top of that, my mom receives lengthy texts and emails from my dad on a daily basis about his horrendous emotional state. According to her, heâ€™s said very openly that he intends to commit suicide in the near future. 

Going to elaborate further on the event that happened tonight. When I ran in the door I sat next to her and held her in my arms, and I didnâ€™t have anything to say. I didnâ€™t know what words would make her feel better because honestly everything she said was true, our situation is fucked and we both knew it. Iâ€™m a 20 year old kid, I donâ€™t know what the fuck to say with two suicidal parents. Iâ€™d really appreciate any advice you have because for several years Iâ€™ve been the emotional rock for my family and I have to stay strong even though I donâ€™t have a fucking clue what Iâ€™m doing.

Sorry if this post is poorly worded/explained I just wrote everything I was thinking and now Iâ€™m hoping for the best.
