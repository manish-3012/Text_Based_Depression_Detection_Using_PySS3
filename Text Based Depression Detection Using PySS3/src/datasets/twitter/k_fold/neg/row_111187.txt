I canâ€™t even imagine not being suicidalHow does it feel to wake up and be excited for the day? How does it feel to have a good family life and go to bed glad you were alive that day? Iâ€™ve heard so many people telling me lately with COVID that Iâ€™m lucky to be alive and how this situation helps us to be extra thankful for life, but Iâ€™ve never been. And I donâ€™t think I ever will be. So I donâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t just ended it, because I probably will eventually. I guess Iâ€™m just waiting for the right moment
