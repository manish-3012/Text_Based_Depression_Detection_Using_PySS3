After I'm goneI understand what will happen after I am gone. The pain my death would cause for my family and friends. I get that my passing will cause a great sadness in my loved ones, and that might not seem fair. Some people even consider it selfish to knowingly inflict that pain on others just to end my own. I think the difference is that the pain I leave behind has a cause. It would have a clear origin (me), and therefore can be lessened and coped with, whereas my chemical imbalance is impossible to reason with. I can't win with my type of depression, but I think they could have much better luck with theirs.
