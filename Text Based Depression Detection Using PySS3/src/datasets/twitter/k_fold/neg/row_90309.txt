Im just doneI understand how you feel. Im 23 right now and have been depressed since 11 when my mom died. I have a good family that loves me but i live a state away form them now with my boyfriend so i hardly see them. My boyfriend works all day to provide a good life for us and he doesn't understand my mental health issues at all. He thinks im lazy and have no drive and idk recently im just kinda done with life. Everything sucks and is so hard now since I graduated college and cant get a job i just feel lame and dumb and I feel like everyone would be better off with me gone. I think that im going to take out a $100,000 life insurance policy first tho so i dont leave my family with all my loan debt before i peace out.
