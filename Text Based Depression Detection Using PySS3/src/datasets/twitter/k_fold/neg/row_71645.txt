LDR Boyfriend is Suicidal but Wonâ€™t Say Anything To MeHi Reddit,

He and I have been dating for quite awhile now, but only recently did I discover he was severely depressed. Heâ€™s usually so chirpy and lively and optimistic and he vanished a week ago, and I only found out that heâ€™d attempted suicide last week four days ago. 

Ever since Iâ€™ve been trying to get him to establish consistent contact and communication with me and tell me everything about why he attempted it and if anyoneâ€™s aware, to which I only know the answer to the former and even then in a very unspecific way.

Iâ€™ve covered literally all the bases I can to get ahold of him. Instagram, Discord (where we usually talk), Rabb.it, PS4 Chat, and Iâ€™ve tried contacting people who I think are real life acquaintances of his through Instagram, telling them they need to get into contact with his father. Iâ€™ve asked a friend of mine to acquire his actual phone number through questionable means, because Iâ€™m becoming really desperate to ensure his safety and aliveness. 

Iâ€™ve tried flooding him with positive messages of love and support and reassurance and told him to talk to me, Iâ€™ve tried bargaining with him, Iâ€™ve tried telling him Iâ€™m not eating or sleeping until he talks to me. We made progress yesterday when he finally allowed me to call him, but he fell asleep in call and his phone died before we woke up. 

He hasnâ€™t contacted me at all today, and itâ€™s nearly 9pm for him. 

Iâ€™m breaking apart and I donâ€™t know what else I can do. Please help me. Please.
