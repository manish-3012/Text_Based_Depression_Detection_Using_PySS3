I will never be a real human being.I fucked up at work again. Everything I touch always rots. Happiness and distractions never last. I am not a person. I'm a tumor. I need to be excised from the earth before I lose money for anyone else. I wish my parents didn't care about me so I could go in peace without the guilt of hurting them with my death just as much as my birth destroyed them.
