I feel like death might be easier than livingI'm just so tired all the time and things have been getting worse. I cant see a way out and everything better is out of my reach. I feel so lost. I'm so tired of the two-cent crock of shit therapists say, that 'things will get better' or 'hang in there'. I'm 21 and everyone keeps saying 'life has so much to offer' and I wish it did, but I'm just tired of the constant pain. I have CPTSD and I have no idea how to feel like myself again. It has been a good nine years since I started feeling suicidal, but I hoped things would be better, and yet I am still an empty, empty shell of a person.

I try so hard to make everyone happy and proud of me and I am always made to feel like a disappointment or not enough. Nothing I do is ever good enough for my family and that's all I've ever wanted to be. I just want them to be proud of me. Instead what I receive is constant complaints, unwanted criticism, them getting rid of my things without my permission, or threats to hurt me or make me homeless or restrict my access to necessities or hurt me in some other way. I just want to feel loved and cared about. It's so hard trying to be enough for myself and just, be able to live without them hurting me. I want things to be good so much, but I don't think they ever will be.

I feel suicidal a lot and my family is cold and don't care, my partner doesn't know what to do and I feel anxious about saying anything (my ex was abusive and made me self harm when I felt bad so I get anxious about opening up to partners), and my friends don't know what to do and I don't want to bother them. I feel so alone. I don't think it ever will get better. I don't want to die but intrusive suicidal thoughts have been increasing and for the most part, I don't even mind anymore.

I'm sorry for saying these things, I don't have anyone else to tell. The helplines don't help.
