I don't know...I can't do this anymore. I just...can't. I have no friends. All I do is go to work or school and go home. That's it. I sit in my room and watch tv, reddit, read and that's about it. Then I go back to work. I have a boyfriend, but I only ever see him about once a week because he is too busy with his friends and only wants money when he sees me. I can't break up with him because well..who else who I have left? I've never been good at anything. I suck at school, sports, art..everything. I have considered suicide on and off pretty much since I was 13(I'm 20 now). I never had friends very long, they always decided they didn't like me and stopped talking to me. I would come home crying from school so upset because my friends didn't like me anymore. 

I just hate myself and I am just afraid of suicide because I simply don't want to hurt my mom like that... she is really the only person who matters to me but I give up. I just can't do this anymore. Things get a little better and then they get worse..I just can't ever win and I give up..
