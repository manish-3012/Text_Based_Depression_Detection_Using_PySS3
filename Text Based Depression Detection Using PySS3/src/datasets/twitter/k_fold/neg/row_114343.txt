I'm alone...She left me... One year, three months, one day, one hour, two minutes from the time she said yes in a text... I am too afraid of suicide but I want to die so badly. My life has been a torrential madness of nothing but heartache. I found my grandfather dead in a pool of his own blood, I self harmed at age fucking eight. I kissed my dead mother's corpse's cheek before going to school for the day 5 years ago on November 30 without realizing she had passed away of a heart attack in her sleep. I don't want to live anymore. I don't have anything I can look forward to at all in my life. I don't want to do it, I'm too scared to do it, but I would give anything to be able to shove plated metal into my mouth and pull the trigger.
