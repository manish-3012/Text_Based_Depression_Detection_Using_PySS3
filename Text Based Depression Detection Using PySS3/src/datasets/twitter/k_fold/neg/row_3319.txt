I don't want to do this anymore...This whole living thing. It sucks. Its pointless it goes nowhere. I want to cut to the chase. End it all. The final end.  I dont care about it anymore. And someone's going to be all "Hey man, talk to me it's ok." IT'S NOT!  STOP ACTING LIKE SHIT GETS BETTER!  TURN ON THE NEWS! OPEN YOUR EYES! IT GETS WORSE! I have no want to do it anymore. I no longer wish to need to be alive.  I want to end it. I want it all to be fucking over.  In the end im just another nobody buried somewhere and forgotten about.  So lets just skip the middle part!
