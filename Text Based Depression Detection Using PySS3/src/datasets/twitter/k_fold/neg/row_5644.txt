I can't handle itSo I want to keep this as brief as possible. I have been depressed for the past 5 years and one of the worst things I am tired of dealing with are the constant nightmares, and by nightmares, these aren't your average just spooky nightmares, these are most of the time so violently graphic and often include myself dying in them. I have only attempted suicide once, and I was legitimately going to go through with it but I fell for a clever thing one of my best friends did, which was inviting me to her dorm to talk and when I arrived the University Police were waiting there with her. I don't think that I will fall for that next time I get to that point, but I don't know I constantly think irrationally because I can stay awake for a week at a time before I have to sleep for at least a short period, it is so painful. I also think about suicide at least 5-10 times a day on a good day but have rarely acted on them. Any advice would really help me right now as I feel like I am heading down that path again as I started self harming myself for the first time in years today.
