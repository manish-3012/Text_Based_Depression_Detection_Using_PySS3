I'm ready. I just don't know how.I've started again and again and again in this life. It's the same venture, the same heartbreak, the same homelessness, the same world. Theres just a chance that smelling roses means I'll be somewhere happier. But it's a chance I'm ready to take. I just don't know how I want to do it. I don't know who I want to write the letter to. Im so done with everything in this simply painful life. I'll never have a family. My parents and now my ex has really shown me that.
