it's that time againjust a rant of sorts

fall sports are over :( i've got more time on my hands. training with my team, people i absolutely adore, was the only thing i looked forward to. scared of having all of that time. falling away. 

also, winter time, you know what it do, seasonal depression. usually the hardest time of year for me. my friends get mega depressed, too. i'm scared for their lives sometimes. couldn't stand to lose them. i attempted once this year, in the summer. i'm glad i'm here sometimes, but things can get unbearable. 

this year is weird because i am genuinely alone. i have isolated myself from everyone and am completely self-reliant. it's just an echo-chamber up in here. 

gotten into some bad things, bad substances with horrifying effects. i can remember the things i've seen so vividly that sometimes i'm convinced i'm still there in my goddam delirium cave. scary stuff. 

i've never had so many bad habits at once. i don't even know what brought me to this point. i'm just scared, but other than that i guess i'm fine. i'm oddly content. i'm in an odd spot haha. i hope my suicidal urges don't get any worse. i'm a good person, i want to live to do good things. i hope these habits don't damage me so badly that i can't do what i love. or kill me.
