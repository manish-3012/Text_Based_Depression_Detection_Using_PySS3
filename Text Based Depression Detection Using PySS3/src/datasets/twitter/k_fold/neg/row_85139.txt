What do I do?I have thought out 2 notes and want to stop living but everytime I bring myself to a cliff ledge on hiking trips or put a knife to my throat I can't do it and think about my dad and sister. I'm 13 years old in 8th grade and I don't know if life is really worth living for me! The only girl I ever loved and was in a relationship with, is a lesbian now and I can't find the will to love any other girls I know. I have no life plans outside of joining the Marines and maybe I'll die a hero. I have no diagnosed mental illness and when I tried to get help from the school the only thing they said was "how are your grades" the second I walked in the couselour office. I feel trapped and every night can't fall asleep because all I do is think about what is after death. I'm glad I found a place to tell someone all this but can someone please tell me what the fuck I should do
