Wow, I am so fucking disappointed. A letter to the psychiatric ward I just got released from.A metal slab bed and a cardboard pillow is all you get to sleep on, and whatever self-respect you had left is stripped of you as you walk in the door.  It seems ironic to me that it took me three days to recover from your refuge of therapy, your place of healing.  I had a grand total of 1 minute : 15 seconds of one on one face time with a psychiatrist and a psychologist.  Watch TV and shut up.  Eat klonopin until you feel good enough to leave.  Fuck you, this is bullshit.
