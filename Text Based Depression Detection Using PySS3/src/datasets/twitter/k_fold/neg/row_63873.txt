Every day just brings me closer to the deathI m 21 y/o working student, i want to kill myself, life is unbearable. I have no skills not talents and im absolutely boring person so i spend most of my free time alone. I really want to find a girlfriend but i see no way how could i find one when im useless like this. I used to go away from sadness by listening to music but these days i m bored of music and just want to go to sleep and never wake up.
