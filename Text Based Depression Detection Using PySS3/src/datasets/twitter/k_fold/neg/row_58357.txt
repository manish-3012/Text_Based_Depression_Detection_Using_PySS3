My plans have seemed to work, too well maybe ...Now, when I am gone from this life, no oneâ€™s lives will be changed in the slightest.  I have VERY minimal contact with anyone from past now.  Some may  be disappointed for a short time. A select few may even be sad for a short time.   But, once theyâ€™re back to their daily routines and lives,  life will go on and it will be like I never existed.  It is probably best for everyone that way, especially my dog, as my stressors have reached their boiling point and a short temper has ensued.
