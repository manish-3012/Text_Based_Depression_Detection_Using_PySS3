the third time 20MIt all started when I was in the army luckily i told my thoughts to my sgt. who was very respectful about this topic and sent me to the medic. they dismissed me from the army and just couple of days i felt like I have never had this incident. a few months later I started to go to university in a very small village and I was overwhelmed by the sam feeling only thyt i was not able to hold back my tears. I was just step aways to bring it all to an end. My beloved parents and sister understood the Situation and brought me back home as fast as possiple. I didnt told my story to any of my friends because i didnt had the feeling they would understand it so i was alone with my family. I searched help from a doctor who really gave me back my self respect and esteem. I met a wonderful girl but I was to stressful and she ditched me but i didnt really care because i am not able to love anyone anymore maybe because  i dont accept my self.

Now the third time I am studying in a city which I know with friends and relatives. But this time I cant stand it anymore. My parents tell me to grab my balls and start studying without bitching around. My sister is studying abroad so I dont really have personal contact only over skype. The first Times I was shocked about my suicidal thoughts but this time I just take them I dont see them as a problem anymore more like a way out.
Sorry for my bad spelling
