Sad life here and my desire to immigrateI actually wanna kill myself. Because life here, I mean in South Korea sucks I think. The reasons could be forced by my surroundings or be depressed by relationship problems. To be honest, I wanna move out to America, but sadly I donâ€™t know how. Anyone could give me any advice?
