I canâ€™t stand this crippling pain of depression!I canâ€™t move, I canâ€™t talk I canâ€™t do anything Iâ€™m stuck. My psychologist tells me to just go out and meet people, my father does the same but none of them have experienced this shit before, having to deal with mood swings, panic attacks, paranoia and chronic pain. It makes me want to die because there is no hope and Iâ€™m sick of hearing that it gets betters. Doctors canâ€™t do anything theyâ€™re more clueless than me, my psychologist says the same thing over and over again, my parents verbally abuse me. Iâ€™m shaking thanks to the pain, I canâ€™t move, Iâ€™m just stuck in my bed and I have no one who could help me!
