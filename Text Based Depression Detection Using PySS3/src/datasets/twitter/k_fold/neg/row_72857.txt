What to do when you feel suicidal?I donâ€™t want to act on anything so I took a nap and donâ€™t feel better. I texted a hotline and it didnâ€™t help. Therapy isnâ€™t helping anymore. I feel like a burden to family and friends so Iâ€™m trying to reach out less. Basically I just feel worthless and that my life is a waste. It never really goes away.
