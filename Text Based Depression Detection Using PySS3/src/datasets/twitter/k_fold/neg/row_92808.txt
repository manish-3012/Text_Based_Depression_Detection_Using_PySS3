This Moment is a great way for suicidal peopleHospitals are overcrowded, world is in quarantine, doctors are working to save people with the virus, which for suicidal people means two things:

-If you want to die, doctors wont have the time to save your life. 
- If you survive, they Will have to send you home because they cant afford to chose between a suicidal person and a sick person to have the hospital bed, and If you catch the virus on the hospital after a suicide attempt, you are dead.
-Psychiatric hospitals cant afford new patients from the outside due to quarantine orders.



I think i will finally try pulling the trigger today, there will be no one to help in my city.
