Afraid my sister might commit suicide

I have been really anxious these last couple of days. Iâ€™m afraid that one of my three sisters might commit suicide. It all started while visiting my oldest sister, when she told me she had beed suicidal some months ago. I know she have been suicidal before, so it makes me really anxious. She currently seems happy and I regularly try to keep contact with her, but Iâ€™m still really afraid...
