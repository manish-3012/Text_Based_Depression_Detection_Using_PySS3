How do I (25f) help my brother (23m) who attempted suicide?Iâ€™m sorry if this seems naÃ¯ve. 

My brother is so loved by everyone in our family and I feel like thereâ€™s something Im missing. He doesnâ€™t really talk about these things and I donâ€™t want to force him to. If thereâ€™s anything that was said or done for you that helped make things more bearable, please share them with me.
