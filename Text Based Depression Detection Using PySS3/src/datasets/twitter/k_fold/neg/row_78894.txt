Family broke up im tempted to end it allIm only 17 from philippines and dont know what to do

backstory 

My parents divorces when i was 2 and I have been living with my mom ever since. Life was ok for a while 
until my sister dropped out of college (she was able to get into the top college of the Philippines which has free tuition). This started to cause her and my mom to fight a lot (fights that last for months where no one talks to each other). Recently my mother and sister had a fight about whether she would go back to school or not and now my mother is about to move away, she told me to forget i ever had a mother. 

now 

Right before i was about to sleep my mother told me about how she was giving up on raising me and my sister. I think i can understand why, my sister was a star student in highschool and just suddenly dropped out of college while I (17M) only recently started college and am only doing average (im failing 1 class). So i donnt blame her for giving up on me and my sister, but i feel like she gave up on me too quickly.

She is packing her things right now and i dont know what to do

 i tried to talk to my sister what to do about it and she told me to go fuck mysyelf
