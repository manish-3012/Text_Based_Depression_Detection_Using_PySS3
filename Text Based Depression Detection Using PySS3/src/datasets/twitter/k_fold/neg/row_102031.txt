Should i contact him ?Hi,

Recently an old friend/ex has posted a photo of him in another subreddit explaining that he's suicidal (i discovered his account like that). 

I don't know if i should reach out or not. It seems cruel to ignore that, but i'm really not the best person to contact him since our history is.. complicated and i have no idea how he currently perceive me.

Maybe the fact that i already know what's going on without him having to say it might help him speak more freely ? I don't know, i might be able to support him but i'm also no professional and i'm scared that he'll take badly that i stumbled on this information.

However, acting like i don't know feels really wrong..

What do you think ? Thanks for your time !
