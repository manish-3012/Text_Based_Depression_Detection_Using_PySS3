Please feel free to downvote this; I'm just have holiday induced insomnia and just looking for someone to talk to...I doubt this will work, but it's worth a shot...I first looked at r/insomnia, but it didn't look like I would find anyone there. So, like I said, downvote this all you want since I'm just *using* this subreddit.

But if there is anyone who is bored, I would like to just have a chat. I'll even offer some topics.

I went to church today for the first time in about ten years, found it all kinds of weird...

I have a belief that I'm too logical to ever fall in love again, but dismiss the love I had in highschool and earlier as just being "kid love" or fake love because I was too stupid to know what real love is. Sometimes I think since that is the only love I've known, and quite possible will ever know, then maybe it was real love?

I'm currently in a graduate school for a health profession which constantly makes me think about death (I'm trying to pick something that might be interesting to the good people on this subreddit).

These are all just suggestions, please feel free to talk to me about anything that you may have on your mind too...

If you downvote, thanks for reading, or not, anyways.
