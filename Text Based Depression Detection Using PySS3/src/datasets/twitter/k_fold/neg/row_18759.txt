Question - extreme stress from suicide dilemma?Does it greatly stress anyone else this issue where you greatly wish to die, but because dying would cause others a great deal of pain you don't go through with it. 

Does it cause anyone a lot of stress? I also have academic and social stress but I feel like this is another.
