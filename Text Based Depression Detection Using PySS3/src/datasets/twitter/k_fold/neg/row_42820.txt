I've always told myself I wouldn't say anything when I decided I'm to a point where I may actually do something, I wouldn't say anything.I have been alone for a little over two years now. I'm still obsessed with that one girl. I've never had a real valentine. I'm just realizing that this valentine's day is coming up pretty quickly. I'll be seeing Deadpool this Thursday. But honestly I feel like that time that I don't say anything will be this weekend. Today really set me off on this train of thought. I just have such a weak, soft spot for girls. They end up being an emotional disaster for me.
