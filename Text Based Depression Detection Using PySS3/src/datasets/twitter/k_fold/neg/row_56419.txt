This is it.Iâ€™m still going to go thru with it. I cannot live with this pain. 


I donâ€™t trust any one. Not a single soul. 

I had a aha moment and I realize that this whole thing was some type of set up to see if I would love him. To see if I would change how I treat him. But the fact remains that we simply canâ€™t get along. Iâ€™ve texted him, Iâ€™ve tried to talk to him till Iâ€™m blue in the face and till My thumbs hurt from punching the buttons. And I get the same response.
