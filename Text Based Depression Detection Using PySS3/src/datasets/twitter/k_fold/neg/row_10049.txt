My social ineptness.I know this might sound stupid and vain but it's really affecting me. Basically all of my friends around me are social. I might even consider myself social but in certain situations but in others I'm completely inept. I'm unable to string a sentence together. I know I have friends and family who love me and care for me, but what's the point in me going on. I'm nearly 18 and I can't handle simple situations like talking to certain people. I often wonder what's the point in going on. We're a social species and if I can't handle these situations now how am I suppose to handle life in the future. I don't want to die, but I also don't want to be a burden to the people around me. I want to be able to get a job. I want my friends and family to be able to live a happy life without me weighing them down. If I had a choice I'd choose never to be born, so my friends wouldn't have to deal with my social ineptness. Their life would be easier without me.They could have fun going out without me being there, without me existing. They wouldn't have to hold my hand. They would enjoy themselves without me. I'd be happier dead knowing they could live a fuller life. They deserve better than me.
