I'm confusedI've posted here before, and times are getting tough again. In my last post I was saying I wanted to cry for no reason... it's back again except this time I've been shaking uncontrollably for no reason, and I seem to be short of breath. It started this morning when I woke up and I have no idea why or what it is... I'm confused and nervous ! Does anybody know what's going on ?
