Whats the point?What's the point of living? Im an atheist so I'm pretty sure once I die its over. Why shouldn't I just kill myself? Life if just pain and more pain with small little moments of happiness. Why suffer so much for little bits of happiness just to die and have none of it matter? 

What's the point?
