I don't want to be here or do thisIt would be so easy to just jump out the window of my bedroom and disappear.

I thought I was improving and I thought I was becoming more confident and I though I had got over my suicide idealation and yet here I am back posting here wishing i wont wake up tomorrow. I had 3 glorious days believing that I did actually want to live but it turns out that was just a little blip and now we are back to our regular programming of misery and shit.

I can't wait till my options shrink so much suicide is my only choice and I finally have the balls to do it.
