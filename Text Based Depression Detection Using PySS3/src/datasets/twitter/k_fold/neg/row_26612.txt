Redditor looks to be suicidal, I have no idea what to doI'm a subscriber to /r/rocketry (it's about building your own rockets and launching them for fun as a hobby)

Someone posted about wanting to launch a rocket for cheap. He said he was disabled, you know what let me just link his post.

I'm not sure why but I went through his history and it brought me to tears. This guy is terminal and in constant pain. He was just looking for a hobby because he sits in the same spot everyday and all he has is his laptop. No one cares. I sent him a message saying that I care and that he shouldn't hurt himself. I don't know what to do, I'm crying right now.
