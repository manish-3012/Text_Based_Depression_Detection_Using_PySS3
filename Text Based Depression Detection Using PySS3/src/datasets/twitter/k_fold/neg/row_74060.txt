Immediate help is needed.I was browsing Omegle under the tag of suicide, I did that to find people in need of help.  I meet this person who is outraged by a thing that's happening, an Instagram user by the username of intheasyluxm is a person who is need of help. I believe she is mentally ill, and it on the verge of committing suicide. When a person reaches out she sends pictures of dead bodies, weird voice mails, and pictures of her self harming. I am afraid I can't help her on my own and I don't live in America so I cant reach out to authorities. I have screenshots between me and the stranger but I can attach it here, it doesn't allow me. Anybody, please help her.
