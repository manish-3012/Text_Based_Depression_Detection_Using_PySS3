Desperate for the endI returned to my hometown about 3-4 days ago due to medical issues. Not one friend reached out even when they knew Iâ€™d returned to ask if I was okay. My mother and grandma have done nothing but tell me what a disappointment I am to them. They hate my SO as does my sister and father. I feel I have no one in my corner. Even my SO doesnâ€™t take me seriously when Iâ€™m upset and is usually no where to be found when Iâ€™m going through hard times. Iâ€™m ready for the end. How can I get the courage to leave this world? Iâ€™m desperate to know what awaits on the other side.
