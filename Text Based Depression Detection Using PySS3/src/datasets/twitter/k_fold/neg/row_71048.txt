I feel like I can't breathe any moreI've had a hard life, I was controlled and repressed most of my life,til I reached my early teens. I'm 17, and I live with my mom, she's really christian, and controlling, and I'm a wild child who just wants to be her self. I broke my ankle a while back,and I'm struggling to build up my strength,and my required range of motion so I can walk again. 
I never go out, I'm an introvert,longing not to be. I'm home schooled, so all week all I do is school,then to work, then home again. If I'm lucky,  I get to see my brother or sister, and that's it for friends. 
Some days I just want to end it all....I WANT to live, I WANT to...I need to...I just don't know how to..
