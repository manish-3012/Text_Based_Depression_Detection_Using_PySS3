Post suicide attemptA couple of weeks ago I posted about how much my life sucks. I also talked about how I was ready to end it all on a Friday. I made sure to say bye to everyone and even though it took till Monday of last week I attempted it. I took 30-35 sleeping pills put a blanket down in the middle of my favorite park and layed down. About 2hours later my body puked everything up. People started showing up to the park so I ran home. 

I was almost happy it did not work. But now I pee blood and my kidneys hurt. There is a 70% chance I a, having kidney failure now and a, not eligible for a transplant because of the suicide attempt. 

If you are feeling the same way I did please seek help or you will end up like me. Now I am slowly dying with such pain that I wish I never tried suicide. I will die painfully and slow.
