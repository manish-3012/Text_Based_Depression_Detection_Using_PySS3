I just want someone to listen. I feel so scared and depressedThis is just going to be a wall of text I'm sorry. I'm just so anxious right now. And sad. I hate feeling like this. I don't even have real reasons to be sad and I fucking hate myself for that. But I feel like I can't get out of this. The suicidal thoughts won't leave me and they just keep happening more frequently and more intensely. I feel like everyone would be better off without me. 
My boyfriend of 2.5 years has been so annoyed of me lately. He doesn't have much patience for my anxiety/depression bullshit anymore. I feel like he deserves so much better than me and he would be happier with someone else. 
But I'm too selfish to live without him. I can't. I love him so much. I think I am too dependent on him. I texted him telling him I'm having an anxiety attack. No reply. I think he is ignoring me and it is scaring the shit out of me.
My dad killed himself 2 years ago and I miss him so fucking much. I just want to be with him more than anything.
I have no self esteem I fucking hate my body. I am so ashamed of my body. I don't think I could ever let anyone else see my naked body ever again. Just thinking about it makes me want to throw up. I think my boyfriend doesn't like my body either, he is just being nice. I think I just found out I Have this deformity: (NSFW)

I started having an anxiety attack because I've always hated my breasts, and I knew they were ugly, and this confirmed everything I've believed in. My boyfriend says he likes them but I know that can't be true. 

I think I am too stupid for college. I'm not doing the assignments I should be doing because I can't stop crying.

I don't know where I am going with this. I am just sad, and anxious and I want to die.
