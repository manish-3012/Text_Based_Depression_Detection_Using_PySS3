Why should IWhy should I keep trying to fix this life? Itâ€™s so pointless to live in a world where people donâ€™t want change, where people accept the fact of living in a shitty world. Iâ€™m no saint , I have my demons but Iâ€™m trying to turn them into angels and itâ€™s a long, lonely world to accomplish that. I want to die everyday but I donâ€™t know how to kill myself. I donâ€™t want to deal with my life or this life. Iâ€™m so young yet so old and wise. I see the destruction this world is heading to. I want to change everything but people donâ€™t want to help. So why should I bother living?
