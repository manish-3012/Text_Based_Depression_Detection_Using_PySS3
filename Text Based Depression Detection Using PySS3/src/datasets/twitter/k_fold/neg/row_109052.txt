Fuck this shitAnyone from the uk want to talk just pm me. Anyone who can't live with what they've done pm me. Anyone in their early thirties and has had enough pm me. Anyone looking for hope and optimism look elsewhere. There's too many people on here with their own problems that my words likely fall on deaf ears. A smaller social group is a better idea. Not looking for miracle solutions, they don't exist. Just some like minded folk who feel the same.
