just got some very bad newsi called my doctor this morning and as it turns out, they can't give me medication for ADHD. there are no psychiatrists in network and i can't afford the ones that aren't. it was $200+ just to get diagnosed with it in the first place and the psyche in question didn't even sign the proper paperwork.

my inability to read cues and constant forgetfulness is ruining my life, and my rejection sensitive dysphoria (a very painful ADHD symptom) is ruining all my relationships. i am in a brain fog every day and I can't even drive very well, and don't have a license. 

i promised everyone i'd get better but now i feel like i just wasted all their time. i cried on the phone with my doctor's secretary this morning. i have been contemplating suicide for hours now. i'm also a victim of incestuous groping, childhood abuse, and isolation. my parents won't let me talk to my siblings because i left their house to stay with my grandparents and escape their homo/transphobia (i'm transgender, ftm, and yes struggling with dysphoria as well).

i have so many problems and no money to solve them and i feel like i'm just deluding myself to think things are going to get any better.
