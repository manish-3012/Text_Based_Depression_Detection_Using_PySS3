I'm gonna kill myself if my abusive dad gets custodyI have court tomorrow, for context I'm 17. Tomorrow decides whether I live with him or my mom. I'm absolutely terrified of him, he's never hit me but he's emotionally abusive. I just feel hopeless I don't know what to do, if I have to stay with him I'm gonna end up dead. I'm desperate, this mess is gonna drive me crazy
