I told someone about my thoughts and they didnâ€™t care. No one caresIâ€™m lost. 2 years ago today I tried to die in my sleep by chugging a lot sleeping pills. I was 14. Ever since before that I have been feeling overwhelmed and sad. I am not clinically diagnosed with anything. But I just need help. I live in a small country in Europe where the capital city is the name of the country (Luxembourg). There isnâ€™t much help to get here and Iâ€™m scared what I might do to myself. 
I told that person that hoping they would help me or talk to me but they just proceeded to discuss about her school subjects. I now know I have no where to turn. No friends. 

Can someone please help me?
Thanks
