Sister has tried to kill herself three times now that I know of, I just don't know what to do.The first time she tried I was away at university, it was a secret kept from me for over a month and it tore me up that I didn't even know until my family told me, late.

Fast forward a year and now I'm home, she tried again this Sunday when I was over at my girlfriend's and I just didn't know what to do. We hadn't spoken in a while and I didn't know she was upset.

Yesterday night my parents went out 'for a trip' when I was with some friends, she had done it again. I have no idea what to do.

At this point it seems like if we've had 2 days of good positive steps for her to regress back to this then she's lost. I am feeling so jaded from this, I don't know what to do. She's been in hospital all day today and I just don't know what to do.It's all to do with a jerky guy that has moved on from her, she's had bad relationships before and he was equally as bad a person, manipulative and nasty. But since this time we went out for drinks and actually had a laugh, we've joked and hugged and have been relatively normal siblings. My parents are falling apart, they found a letter today addressed to us, it clearly was supposed to be found if she had successfully committed suicide.

I'm angry, confused, I feel emotionally cold and exhausted. I need any advice you can give right now because I'm either never going to forgive myself as a result or the world around me will shatter.
