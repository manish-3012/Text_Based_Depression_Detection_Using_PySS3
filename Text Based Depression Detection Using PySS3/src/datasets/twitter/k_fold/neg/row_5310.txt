I have no idea what to do anymore...I am in a relationship with a girl , lets call her Victoria for now. She has depression and I've always supported her and helped her when I could, we are currently doing long distance as she went to mauritius for university studies and I plan on going there as well in March but over the course of the last 2 weeks (she started her medication of anti depressants around 3 weeks ago) it's gotten much worse. In the last week she's cut herself so many times... it hurts to even look at the pictures, I have no idea what to do. I cry myself to sleep just thinking on what to do... I sometimes sleep wondering whether I'll wake up hearing she killed herself... I mean we were skyping yesterday and I asked her what's on her mind and she said "I am thinking of ways to kill myself and make it look like an accident." I am dying inside and I have no idea what to do . :'( Someone please advise me here, I feel like I am going insane because the further it does, the worse it gets. Personally, I suffer from panic attacks and it's starting to affect them as well, they are getting worse and more in attacks . I have no idea what to do anymore. I've tried being her rock, giving her endless support, advising her, She sees a psychiatrist every thursday, IT'S KILLING ME!!! :'( . Most people tell me to leave her, but I CAN'T. I LOVE HER too much and I am probably her only anchor to Earth. Not even her own mother takes it seriously and honestly, I feel broken nowadays .
