The more I try to get help, the more I realise that it's pointless.I'm 24. I've done nothing with my life. For the past ten years I've known that I'd kill myself eventually. I just didn't want my family to go through it. I haven't had any family for about 6 months now. No friends. I never leave my house. 

A few days ago I decided to go for a mental health assessment. They recommended anti-depressants &amp; occupational therapy. To me, antidepressants are just false hope. It isn't real, just drugs to keep you from seeing through the bullshit.

Occupational therapy so someone can make sure I'm doing meaningless little activities to keep me 'happy'.   

I don't eat for days at a time because I can't afford to eat for the last few days of the month. I have no friends, no family, no ambitions and no motivation. What kind of life is this? Fuck it all.

I'm hanging myself on the 27th September. I have a few things to do prior, then I'm punching out. I'll install that ceiling bracket myself, tie my own noose &amp; end it on a beautiful day. Best thing? No one will even know I'm gone. I feel sorry for whatever cunt has to open my bedroom door to that one.
