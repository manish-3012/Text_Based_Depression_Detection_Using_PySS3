I just tried to kill myself.I snapped over something minor at my mother and father (who I was visiting) and just snapped, screamed some nonsensical shit at them grabbed my bag that had my bottle of Codine pills in it and stormed out. I got in my car drove about 30min away, parked to the side of the road and swallowed half of the pills. 

Unfortunately I ended up getting sick and vomited. So now I'm stuck feeling horribly sick and I don't know where to go from here.
