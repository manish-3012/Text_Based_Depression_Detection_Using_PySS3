I don't see anything to live for.There's been a major change in my perspective on life. I know I have a good life, it's pretty great. I've worked hard and now I'm in college with a scholarship. I've got a decent family. I've gotten through tough things (raped twice, abusive ex, bullying). I used to enjoy my life, but now I don't. I guess I just want someone to talk to. I do want to die. I know exactly how. The motivation is there, but I feel obligated to finish my exams for this semester first.
