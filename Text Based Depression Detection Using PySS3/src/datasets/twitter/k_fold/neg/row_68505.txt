I'm the happiest I've been, yet for some stupid reason I'm thinking of suicide more than ever.I've been through a rough patch the last 7 months, suicidal thoughts here and there. Nothing too unexpected. (Clinical depression FYI)

But recently, after school ended, I've been working on a new relationship with someone i really like. We've been out twice, i plan on asking them out on the 4th time probably. It's been great and I never thought I would be at this point of happiness.

But for some sick, fucking sadistic and twisted reason, i keep thinking of suicide over and over. "You can just die now while your're happy, at least people will remember the happy you.""You'll never be happier than this, and after the rise comes the fall, could just skip straight to the falling part." sort of thoughts. I have thought of this crap over and over and over for the last 6 weeks ors so. Probably 4-5 times a week. And i keep getting more and more scared. Because im in a really broken home right now and it would be so easy and they would feel the least guilty about it now than they would at other times. 

The usual only thought that comes to me is the person i plan on asking out. Is that it may absolutely mess with them. Me getting to know them, trying my hardest to befriend them, then out of the blue kill myself. 

Then i feel like i have 2 options with bad outcomes. 
Don't ask them out. followed by not feeling much better than now and only feeling as if this is as good as ill feel followed by the inevitable.

Ask them out. Which could go poorly. If it goes poorly i don't know. I can't even think of it going poorly. My eyes are filling with tears even thinking of it. I really dont want it to go poorly. Please...
