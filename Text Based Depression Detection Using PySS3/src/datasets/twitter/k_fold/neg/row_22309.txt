I don't know how I feel about this...Today, during work, I got into a "religious" debate - yeah, I shouldn't have but I got cornered into it - with my boss's husband. I'm agnostic. I was being polite and listened to everything he said. He's this arrogant, condescending bell-end  who thinks his religiously-based opinions are actually facts.

Anyway, he says something along the lines of, "If you don't believe in god, then your life is meaningless." I respond being saying that I thought my life was meaningful and I might not be important, but I thought my life had meaning to it. He said, and I quote, "Your life has no meaning. Let's sit down one day and you can make a list of the important things you do. I'll go through every one of them and tell you wholeheartedly that they don't matter and everything you do in life is meaningless."

Okay. I'm going to be honest - I started to tear up (I'm very "sensitive"). My boss, who was in the same room, kind of just stared at him while he's saying this. She starts to notice I'm upset and says how I'm intellectually smart or something like that. Then, prick says how I have to be smarter to debate him.

I've just felt like shit all day because of this comment. I know I'm not a "unique snowflake" or whatever that shit is, but I like to believe that I have a meaning and a purpose. This comment really made me think about how meaningless my life is. It just sucks. On top of major depression, I feel like everything I tried so hard to believe about myself just disappeared. I don't know if this is relevant to r/suicidewatch, but to me it is because I've just feel like this: "Okay, my life has no purpose. Then why should I be alive?"

Should I take this prick's comment to heart or is it just complete and utter horseshit? I just want some feedback onto what you guys think about it. 

Thanks for letting me vent.
