update on my girlfriend:first of all iâ€™d like to say, thank you all so much on all thÄ— advice and help with my girlfriend. sheâ€™s currently out of thÄ— country so iâ€™ve been up all night talking to her because of thÄ— time zone difference. iâ€™ve talked with her and asked her what i could do to help, she says me being with her is all she needs and our relationship has stopped her from taking action on her suicidal thoughts ever again. weâ€™re pretty sure she suffers from bipolar disorder. sheâ€™s been depressed the majority of her life but quoting her, this past year has been thÄ— happiest year of her life. again, thank you all so much for helping us and thÄ— kind comments.
