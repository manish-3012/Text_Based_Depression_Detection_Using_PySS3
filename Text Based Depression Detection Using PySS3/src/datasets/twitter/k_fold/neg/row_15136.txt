attempting to overdose, i can't do this anymorei  have no idea if this will even effect me but i have just taken about 35 - 40 propanolol pills (40mg each). 

i dont want to be here anymore. i have a wonderful boyfriend who loves me but everytime he tries to help me i just feel like i resent him a little bit more. i just want to be left alone.

i hate who i am. i hate my life. i love the people in it but im not strong enough to just stick around and stay miserable purely for them.

i push away people that i am close to and feel too guilty to reach out to them again.

i hope i dont wake up again tomorrow.
