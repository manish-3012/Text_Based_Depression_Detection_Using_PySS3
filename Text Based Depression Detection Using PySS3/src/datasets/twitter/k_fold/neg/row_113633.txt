Thinking of suicide as everyone seems to dislike meI never had a lot of friends. Every time I think I made a friend I lose them, as they either turn out to have disliked me the entire time or they found be better people to ditch me for.

At 30 now I never had a friend, girlfriend or any women attracted to me. It's fucking shit. It's lonely and humiliating. I don't think think it can ever improve. It's too late for this to ever be fixed. I'm irredeemably fucked up. The world will be better when I'm gone. The reason I'm alone and consistently disliked is because the world would be better if I died or killed myself.
