ECT for MDDIâ€™ve been seeing a therapist and doctor for my depression for nearly 2 years. Iâ€™ve tried several different drugs and combinations of drugs, sometimes it helps for awhile but then I always start going back downhill after months, weeks, or just days after a new treatment. Iâ€™ve just been referred to another doctor for possible shock therapy.  Has anyone here tried this and did it work? If so, how well?
