I am not scared to die, I am scared to suffer.I have been suffering since elementary school. I always thought about killing myself to make it stop but never found a good way too do it but I think I now have found one. I was planning to go donate some blood or bloodplasma and then just take the bandage of again. If I can get over this thought maybe my GP can help since I managed to talk to him like 12 hours ago but I didnâ€™t tell him about my suicidal thoughts. I think that was a mistake. 
I donâ€™t want to die I just want the emptiness too stop.
