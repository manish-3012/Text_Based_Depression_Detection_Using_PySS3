I got a text telling me they were going to end itI have a very close friend who told me they had never had such an inclination end their life as they had at the moment they were texting me.  I knew they had struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts, but now I'm more worried that they may act on them.  I am the only person who knows, and we are each leaving for college.  When I try to talk to them about it they cry and tell me how they thought they had beaten depression and don't understand why they feel this way.  I want so badly to be able to help, but I am having so much difficulty in knowing what to do.  I think talking about it may be causing more stress, but at the same time I feel that would be how I would want to deal with it. I don't want to force anything, but I've made it clear I'm there if they ever want to talk or need something.  I've been in this same situation multiple times with other close friends so I believe people feel safe around me.  I have been fortunate that all of the rest of them, to the best of my knowledge, have beaten depression.  But even with my "experience" I feel that I still am lost in dealing with this, likely because each scenario is different.  They have  tried therapy and medication with limited success, but are willing to combat their depression and have been actively working to.  They are no longer going to therapy or takings meds because "it wasn't helping" anymore.  This has been going on for months but they hit their all time low today and I feel that I need help.
