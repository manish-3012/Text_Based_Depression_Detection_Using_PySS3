My depression is inescapable, and people always drift away once they get to know me.I dealt with depression for 7 years straight with no interruption until this past fall. I thought that the only thing holding me back was living at home, but 6 months after moving out and starting over I am facing the same dilemmas, for yet another time.

In the past week my closest friend decided she hated me and started treating me like shit. Before this week, I had been telling people for a month that I wanted to ask her out. She told me that all of my friends are getting annoyed by me, that I am manipulative and not willing to accept blame. I am not a deliberately manipulative person, and some friends tell me I'm not manipulative. But the idea has been spread, and I have been losing friends one after one since then. Additionally, I am straightedge and do not go to drinking parties with the rest of my friends. Because I didn't explain that I avoid them due to anxiety, apparently the group reached the conclusion that I am looking down on them for going out. This is not true.

My anxiety cripples me and doesn't allow me to be who I truly intend to be. I tried to be a yesman, someone who did everything and anything for a time. All it did was make me miserable as I attempted to face my fears and fell flat on my face. I have been told I am undateable, unattractive and irresponsible, and I can't help but agree.

The only reason I live at this point is for my sister, not for myself. If I didn't have other people to worry about, I would end it right now. I can't focus, I can't date, I can't maintain friendships, I can't stop falling back into depression. I can't take it anymore.
