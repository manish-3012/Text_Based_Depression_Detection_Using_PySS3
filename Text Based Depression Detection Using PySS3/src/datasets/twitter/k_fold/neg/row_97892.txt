It dawned on me how easy it would be to go buy a gun and now the idea has taken overI have been trying my best to work on my mental health but by now itâ€™s clear that Iâ€™ll never allow myself to be happy. I donâ€™t want to live the rest of a lifetime like this, and Iâ€™ve been overtaken by the realization that I could just go buy an off switch. I am such a useless piece of shit and I canâ€™t fucking do this anymore
