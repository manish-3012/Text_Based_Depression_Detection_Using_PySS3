I did something wrong and now my arm is bleeding.I did something 'unacceptable' at school today and a teacher noticed. I'm most likely going to get reported. That could have extreme consequences that would destroy almost everything I had to look forward to in life. 

Naturally, I told my mother what I did, thinking it wasn't even that bad. She basically called me an idiot, a criminal even. She told me I should think before I act. I TRY.

All this happened too many times and every time I get so scared and sad, but this is the first time I actually drew blood. Not vertically. Not yet. I only did it because I felt the need to punish myself. I'm scared of death but I will never stop fucking shit up. I fuck up school, friendships, everything. Even now I have no way to hide the cuts so I'll have to explain myself.

The only person I could talk face-to-face about this is one of my teachers, but I'm terrified of approaching her. I don't know how to handle this anymore. It keeps getting worse every time but I can't help thinking of myself as a whiny, unappreciative bitch.

I've never been closer than I am now, but I was so happy just a few months ago.
