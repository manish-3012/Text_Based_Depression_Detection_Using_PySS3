Any coping methods for suicidal thoughts?I'm looking to see if you guys have any non-self-destructive coping methods to help calm myself down from emotional panics that involve suicidal thoughts.

I've been hit by a really hard low - the likes of which I haven't seen for a few years and I'm looking for some more ways to try and ease myself out of those emotional states that have a high probability of ending in a suicide attempt.

I know what I've got to live for, and I know I've come out of similar emotional states alive and have faced periods of recovery. I just need a few more coping methods to try and push out the negative thoughts and general feelings of 'I want to die.'

I already play an instrument and keep a journal to help cope. Am looking for other things you guys might use to help cope.
