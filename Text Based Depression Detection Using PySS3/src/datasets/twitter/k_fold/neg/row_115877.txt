I hit my hand with a knifeFirst time posting here,

i just dont know anymore. 3 days ago i had a shitty day. not my worst, but a shitty one. then all it took was fcking loosing in a video game. thats fcking all. i went to my kitchen and just hit my back hand with a knife. thats the moment when i woke up and realised what i did. i called the ambulance. i seperated the tendon of my index finger. clean cut.

now im stuck with a plastered hand for the next 3 month. i hate myself. im disgusted of myself. constantly i am thinking that i am a fcking psychopath who needs to be locked up and drugged. im scarred of myself. i feel so guilty, so much guilt. i am engaged; my spouse is the only one who knows the truth. i know she hates that i say this: i dont deserve her and i am a liability for her life. i wouldnt hurt her. i wouldnt hurt anyone. i would just hurt myself. i just dont know what to do. i promised her to never hurt myself again, and i value my promises very much, but i dont know what i can do if i loose self control again. i hate myself so much for what i did. there is this constant thought: "the fuck are you doing you stupid asshole? what have you done?"

the next 3 month there is no joy, no speedcubing, no cooking, no making music, very hard time typing (im studying physics) and gaming. now i just make work for everyone, for the people i love, while im lying to them and pretending everything is ok. even after my tendon is healed there will be scars reminding me what i am capable of, what a monster i am. i was thinking of killing myself, but i wont, i promised that. i keep my promises. at least as long as i am in control of myself. i just dont know how long this will be the case...
