Don't wanna do this anymoreI'm 14/M. I've lived in a well-off family and house for my whole life, we even went to water parks and to our/my grandparents in farther regions. Everything feels like it's based on an education, and every time I hear a loud voice it reminds me of the current and past times I've heard it. Went to a catholic school, but I kept reinforcing my own idea of angels on myself, to feel better about my situation. I don't think there's much of any reason to see why I want to die, even if I should be happy about where I am now.

I never really stuck to my decision, because of my cowardice and lack of methods.  While I'm typing, I have 9 overdue activities, few of which are due since *September*.   ..I forgot what the main topic was
