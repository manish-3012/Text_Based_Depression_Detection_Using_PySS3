Nothing new I thought 2018 would be my year but it's been the worst yet. I found out that I can't join the navy, or get a security clearance due to my financial and mental state. I lost my full-time job and haven't heard back from any of my resumes. I only see a future as a wage slave with massive student loan debt. I always told myself that I would kill myself at 30 if my life ended up like this. I guess 2018 is my last.
