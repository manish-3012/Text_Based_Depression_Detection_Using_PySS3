My life is badYa know you read these fucking inspirational quotes about how the sun shines after a storm. Maybe that happens for some people but not for me. I have bpd I have been dealing with alot with my family. Its not stop it never gets better and I'm always the bad guy  currently laying in bed because yesterday  was a meltdown day. Only reason I havent yeeted myself yet is because I dont have enough energy to get up. Fuck I'm having a hard time even getting up to let my dog back in the house. I'm on day 2 of not eating, I'm hungry I just dont care enough to eat. I have work tomorrow and I'm not going I dont care if they fire me they can fuck off just like my family can. I'm so sad all the time I only have like 1 friend 2 if you count my doggo. I just have nothing I've been lied about and lied to my whole life 
It's always my fault..... always 
I've been manipulated and beat up and just treated like garbage. I dont know maybe its something I did like ive committed some sin by existing in this world. Funny thing is when I was born I died from oxygen deprivation and was brought back. Man they should have left me cold and blue and saved me 33 years of this bullshit. I hate this planet
