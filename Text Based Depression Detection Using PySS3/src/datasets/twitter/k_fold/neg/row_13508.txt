Caught myself making a plan in the back of my mind againIâ€™m 38. Apparently post wall. Whatever that means. For a moment I had a fleeting glimpse of what it meant to be truly happy, where my heart was a growing radiance. He talked of what our kids would be like. He made me feel so safe and that it was finally ok to be vulnerable, I didnâ€™t have to maintain my fiercely independent facade. I finally slept the most peaceful sleeps in his arms. We laughed, I thought we loved. And then it was over. I put on a tiny amount of weight while I was unwell. He left me and went back to his red pill. 

I now recognise he lied compulsively while he idealised, devalued and discarded. I believe I met a person who cannot actually have compassion nor act with conscience.  They can only act with a god like complex of trying to do right or make right with no genuine understanding of the pain they are actually causing. Yet Iâ€™m still trying to empathise and understand what that could actually be like and what can it mean. 

You canâ€™t measure your lifeâ€™s value by someone else, but this isnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™ve been here and all the success in the world doesnâ€™t matter when your heart is empty. I have a 6 figure income and I only work part time but Iâ€™ve lost my mojo, Iâ€™ve lost my passion for my work. It all feels meaningless and Iâ€™m so very tired, again, still.
