What should I do?I was raised in a very overly negative environment. I was compared with others in things that I was never good at which almost killed every bit of self confidence I had in me. I feel demotivated and feel like it would be nice to kill myself and end this instead to live my life believing the fact that I'm a stupid. I believed atleast someone out there will help me find the way, but nobody came. Instead they mocked my mental health and made fun of whatever I'm going through. Why do I have to be the only one to suffer when someone else made me like this?
