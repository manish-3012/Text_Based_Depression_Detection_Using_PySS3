does anyone know any good councelling places or anythingi need help, i tried talking to a shitty helpline last night and they basically just shoved a couple links at me, told me to go outside today, and then ended the conversation. idk what i'm meant to type into google to get the help i need. everyday is so fucking hard. i wake up and cry all day, bother my girlfriend and hope that she might call me, just hearing her voice would make my day a bit better. i just want this shit to end. i just want my happy life back if that ever existed. i wish i appreaciated it when it did.
