There's no reason for me to continue livingThere's no hope for me to ever be independent with a source of income. I'm a high school dropout with no value, will never be employed. I will always be a vassal of my mother, always be taken care of by someone else, she ruined my life and she continues to ruin my life, she is sick, she raised me to be a vassal to feed her sick desires of a son. I need to get away from her but I can't. I'm living in a town where I was tortured with no escape. I promised I would never return but I am here. Utter humiliation. I must leave this world, no reason to continue living.
