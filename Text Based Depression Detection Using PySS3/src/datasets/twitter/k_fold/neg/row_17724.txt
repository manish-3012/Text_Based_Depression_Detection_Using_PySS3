I'm tiredI dont want to do this anymore
I read peoples posts on here and pray for them and hope I'd never end up to the point to having to post here 
my mental health is practically dead, because of which I cant study and my academics are ruined
my family is is so toxic the only thing I wish for is for someone to take me away from here
I'm scared I might actually do it this time but I dont want to, i have a mother battling cancer and a youngest brother with his whole life ahead of him
but I dont know how long I can keep up
if I fail my exams, which ik I am, they're gonna marry me off to some abusive guy
I'm scared, so so scared  
I cant type anymore cause I'm crying too hard and  hyperventilating and it's too cold in here but it's only 5 am
i have to pray now but I dont know if I'll be able to survive til november ends
I really really hope I do
