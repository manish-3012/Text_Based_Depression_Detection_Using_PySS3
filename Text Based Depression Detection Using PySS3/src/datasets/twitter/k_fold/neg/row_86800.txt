RantI am not going to commit suicide.

Not because I no longer have reason to. But simply because Iâ€™ve waited too long and Iâ€™m now in my 30s with people depending on me. Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself before in my teens and I was on intensive treatment and on suicide watch a few times in my late teens and early 20s. 

Many people grew out of their depression. I thought I would. Heart of hearts, I think I deserve a break, more than quite a few people. But fate thinks otherwise. 

I canâ€™t think of a moment in my life that would bring me to say â€˜I am glad I didnâ€™t kill myselfâ€™.  I have become envious of people who managed to do it. If I had died young, I would still have been a promising life cut short. Now Iâ€™m just a middle aged person who failed. 

The wait for the end is so long, so painful. 

In no way am I suggesting anyone to kill themselves.
