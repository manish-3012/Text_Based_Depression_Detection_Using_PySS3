Why do people like this shit?Iâ€™m tired of it always being my problem for why Iâ€™m not happy. Without fail, society always tells me Iâ€™m a loser. If it wasnâ€™t for the pressure I constantly feel from society, Iâ€™d be happier. 

But society wonâ€™t find its way the fuck out of my head. Everywhere I go, Iâ€™m constantly reminded of what I havenâ€™t accomplished yet. Iâ€™m at a point where I feel so defeated, that I donâ€™t want to accomplish anything  in life. Not even an exaggeration. I donâ€™t have a single goal. So essentially, I just want death. 

Iâ€™ve gone from 195 lbs to 162 since September. Iâ€™m not even working out. Iâ€™m just under-eating. For people to get the message that Iâ€™m incapable of dealing with the world on my own, they may need to see me drop another 30-40 pounds. Iâ€™m a guy whoâ€™s 6â€™1, so Iâ€™m already skinny at 162 lbs.


I have no clue what I want to accomplish with this message. Venting has never helped me.
