"You're being selfish"I've been looking for a online group like this for a while. 
To me, I have considered ending my life for as long as I  can remember, I'm 28 now. 
I'm sick of being numb. I'm tired of being tired and being the person I'm not for everyone else. 
Mu husband is firm on the idea it's selfish, but feel its selfish for everyone else who wants to keep me alive, miserable and in a constant state of "If I just hit the accelerator and turn to the left I'll fall down that ditch and hopefully I'll do it right that'll be it" or "If I just go to the river and see how long I can hold my breath but force myself into unconsciousness until I suffocate.
I've always had a plan, funeral arrangements the lot so when the time comes the "clean up" (not physically) is simple for those left behind. 
I haven't attempted, but have come very close. Each time I've been interrupted. I've been admitted hospital, done the whole psych thing. Nothing  and no one will change 28 years of waking up everyday and being angry that I'm alive to suffer another day. 
We have no children and I am not at all close with my family. 
My husband deserves someone who is happy and full of life (literally) he would  be better off without me. Why is that so selfish?
