It just hit meAfter 2 years of thinking my depression is better, finding ways to distract myself and holding my shit together, it hit me all this week. 

I spent thanksgiving alone. I canâ€™t stop dreaming about my last relationship from 2017. I have dreams of it every single night, and I wake up feeling like shit realizing itâ€™s not real and that I was ghosted. For over a year, I havenâ€™t really cried, the tears just wouldnâ€™t come, I kind of felt numb to things. But this week the tears canâ€™t stop flowing and I canâ€™t stop thinking how Iâ€™d be better off dead. The things I used for 2 years to distract me isnâ€™t even working all of a sudden. 

I read a post saying â€œwhat beautiful things would you have missed out on if you ended it a year ago.â€ And honestly that posted fucked me up even more cos I have no answer for that. Even 2 years ago, I have no answer and made me wish I should have just ended it all back then.
