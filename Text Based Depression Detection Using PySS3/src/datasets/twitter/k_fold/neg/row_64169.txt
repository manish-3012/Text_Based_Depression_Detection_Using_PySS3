Iâ€™m Ready To Go - I Cant Handle This Pain AnymoreHe couldnâ€™t even talk to me. Couldnâ€™t even have the closure conversation. So much time spent being the one making the effort. Being there for him. And he canâ€™t even talk to me.

Iâ€™ve felt suicidal my whole life, on and off. From verbal abuse and abandonment growing up, to other bullshit as an adult. All of the pressure, the responsibility. When is it my turn. When is it my turn to be the center of someoneâ€™s world worth fighting for. Worth giving something up for. Worth anything for. When is someone going to take care of me for once. Do something right by me for once. 

If you want backstory....feel free to read my few past posts.

Iâ€™m tired of being last. Iâ€™m tired of being not worth it. Iâ€™m tired of being left out in the cold. Iâ€™m tired of being ignored. Iâ€™m tired of fighting alone.

Iâ€™m ready to end it. I hate life. All of my happiness is gone. I want to do it tonight, but I canâ€™t figure out which medication my closet will let me pass out and feel as little as possible as it happens. Or if I should just...suck it up and sit down in my bathtub and tear into my wrists. 

No suicide notes. No one cares about those anyway. He certainly wouldnâ€™t.
