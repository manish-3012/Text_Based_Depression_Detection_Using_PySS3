What have I done to not deserve a normal life like the rest?I'm 18 years old and trapped in my house.Yes , I am literally trapped.  I feel like I'm under house arrest , Even though I haven't commited any crime. My situation is strange and very hard to explain , but I'll try . Anyways, I've been trapped in my house for about 5 years or so now. It's not my fault, if I could live a normal life and leave my house , socialize etc. almost daily like everyone else I WOULD ! But I can't! Why? I don't own a car, nor does my dad, or my mom, or my brother, or my sister. Thankfully, my grandpa lets us use his car , but it gets complicated since he has to use it for work and all, and my aunt/uncle use the car aswell. I don't have any friends here. Dropped out of school due to bullying, so now I'm homeschooled and I have NO CLUE how TF I'm supposed to make any friends in this situation. On top of that parents have no money ,  and i'd like to get a job and earn some money but again, no car!!! And haven't finished school yet/ no experience! I'm SICK of living like a hermit! Trapped! I'm TRAPPED! I want to LIVE so badly . So badly. I think life can be beautiful! But I'm not allowed to live! I'm denied LIFE! And experiences that every teen should have!  I haven't had a real life boyfriend or a first kiss. I've only had an online boyfriend which was a terrible , lonely experience. I think I am gonna go crazy. The only reason I'm still here is because of my faith in God and how he has given me a talent to sing. Only thing is no clue how I'm gonna be able to live my dreams as a singer if I'm not allowed to leave my house. Btw, my dad ignores me and insults me when I tell him this, and my mom is amazing but she can do so little. Maybe my existence is a crime and I deserve this miserable life?
