Or something...a few good days and Iâ€™ve already fucked up again
Im always just trying to say and do and choose the thing thatll make you happy
I ALWAYS guess wrong
Take up for myself fuck me
I will just continue to be the worthless piece of shit I am that just exists to disappoint
Talk down to me
Make me feel like shit
I am sorry I canâ€™t multitask my mind when Iâ€™m trying to work
Fuck why am I still here
Just fucking accept this is how it is and quit trying to react. Just be. 
Your tears mean nothing anyway. So donâ€™t cry. Just hurry up and fucking kill youself already
Donâ€™t think donâ€™t hesitate
Just let go and pull the trigger

I opened my big fucking mouth again

WHY HAVENT YOU FUCKING FIGURED OUT TO JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP

NO ONE WANTS YOU
NO ONE CARES
FUCK YOU
WHY TRY
WHY
WHY
WHY
DO I 
KEEP
FUCKING
TRYING
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
I canâ€™t
APPARENTLY

MY WHOLE LITERAL LIFE REVOLVES AROUND MAKING YOU HAPPY
I wish I knew how to stay quiet and just keep the peace
Donâ€™t talk anymore.
