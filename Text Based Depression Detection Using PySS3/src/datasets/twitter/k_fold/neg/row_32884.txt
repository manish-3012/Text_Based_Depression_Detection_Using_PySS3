HiHi my name is Elle ( not really but yes) and ive been clinically depressed for 6 years. Im 16 :) and yk what iM FUCKING LONELY AND IM REALLY FUCKING CLOSE TO LOSING MY SHIIT.
You can laugh lol. Im laughing. Because today isn't a particularly sad one but regardless im angry im frustrated and im alone. I wish i was neurotypical. I wish my brain worked the same way it does for not depressed people. I wish i cared about myself i wish I cared about school, my health or anything really. I wish i cared.
