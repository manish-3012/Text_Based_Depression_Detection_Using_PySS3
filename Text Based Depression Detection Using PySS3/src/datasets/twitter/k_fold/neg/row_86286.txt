Can't keep up anymore.I have told so many lies in my the past three years I literally cannot keep up with them any more. This is my only way out. I have given up on all of my aspirations and my massive academic potential because I am vain and vapid. Now my lies are catching up to me, and I cannot keep up with them anymore.

I don't have a job. My parents still think I do. My dad caught wind of the fact that I don't work anymore, and he'll probably go into my former workplace to see if I'm there tomorrow. I don't know where to go. His wrath is insufferable.

I have not taken school seriously in three years. I dropped out of my university and failed four consecutive semesters in my community college. I told all of my friends I go to a very good university in a very good program in my state. I drive up there on a regular basis to make it seem like I attend. I'll go out with my friends for a night and make a five hour drive home the next day. It's sick. It makes me feel physically sick to know that I have done this. My parents don't know about my failures at school and think I am on the right track to transfer to a school next year. I'm not. I don't even know how to begin to approach telling them.

I don't even know why I didn't apply myself when it mattered. It's not that I am stupid. I'm dealing with crippling social anxiety and I'd rather hide in the library than actually attend class. I can't tell my parents about this. Every time I try to bring it up, they think I'm "being dramatic" and using this as an excuse for my shitty behavior.

I'm a shitty human being. I don't deserve to live, anyway. All I do is waste space and oxygen. I don't think anyone would really miss me if I was gone, especially if they find out all the things I've lied about.
