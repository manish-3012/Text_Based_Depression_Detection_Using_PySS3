Kyrei eleison. Ego defecerunt.Alea Iacta est. My die is cast. 

Please understand, at present I don't wish to be subdued to not do it. I have written the only letter I wanted to write, which is to my little girl. My decision is final, she, and everyone else, is just better off without my taint.

My only regrets are adding another failure and a huge pack of sorrow to everyone who might give a damn. And failing my little girl. Not seeing her grow up... Man, I love that babe so much...

The reason for this message, you ask? It is simple. I wish to thank you. Thank you for letting me be part of the community. 
More than this, I cannot say. More than this I do not owe. 
Do not let Acta, Sopa, Pipa or any form of cencorship prevail. Keep the internet alive, free. If not for yourselves, for our children, for our future. Fight to the bitter end. Reddit, 4Chan, 9Gag and Memebase WILL win this cyber war. I believe in you all.
Thank you.

Oh, and a small PS: my favourite movie is "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf". Check it out! The roles that Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor planted transcend every movie that comes out today.
