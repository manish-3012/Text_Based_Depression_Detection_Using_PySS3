I'm alone and financially ruined and my baby is dead. Just ready to shoot myself.Had a miscarriage. Boyfriend left me. Told me he'd move in and be emotionally supporting if I had an abortion. I didn't want an abortion but miscarried. He left me because he didn't want kids and could see I did. Now there's no one here to help me and I can't tell my parents because of religious shame. 

He's not moving in and I'm in so much debt and it keeps piling on and I'm going to be financially ruined by this time next year. It all relied on him moving in. 

My baby is dead and that could have kept me going because I wouldn't be alone. But now I'm alone and my boyfriend is gone. 

My therapist hasn't been much help lately as far as helping me calm these feelings. They're so extreme and I don't know what to do. 

The only thing keeping me from going and shooting myself today is my dog. I'm all she has and my parents wouldn't take care of her the way I do. But I'm so close to just saying fuck it. This depression and loneliness and regret and fear isn't worth it. 

I am alone. I have nothing. No one. I have never been this miserable in my life and I have been quite miserable before. Thinking about suicide has always been more like a fantasy but it feels real this time. 

I'm so alone.
