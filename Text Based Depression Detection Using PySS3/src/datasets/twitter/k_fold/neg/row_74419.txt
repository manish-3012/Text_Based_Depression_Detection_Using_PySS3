Not sure what to do anymore.I have recently fallen into a larger pit of depression. My gender dysphoria has been getting incredibly powerful as I have been slowly defeating my ocd, and I have realized that I am utterly pointless I am as my iq is pathetically low, I have no skills, no motivation, and I even quit playing videogames as they remind me how incompetent I am at even the simplest thing in lift. I have had enough of my friends lying to me, telling me that I am an interesting, fun person, I have no idea as to why they even trust me let alone have me around with them. I have already cut off all contact with them, I want them to be better off without me, I just take up space, waste time, and exacerbate issues they confide in me about. So many people in the world and they choose to have me around, so idiotic that I cannot understand it, I know I will be replaced eventually. I wish I could end it already, but I do not want to put my family through pain, yet if I decide to live and transition, I will be a much greater disappointment and failure to my family. I cannot find a job, either. I have applied at a multitude of locations, yet my stupidity and ineptitude is an extreme deterrent for anyone with a brain. I have no purpose, I just want to be gone.
