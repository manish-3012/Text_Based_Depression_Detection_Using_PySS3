everything in life sucksall my insecurites keep on piling up day by day and life pretty much has nothing to offer for me. i couldnt go to a psychiatrist because my parents cant afford for it yet, and everytime i try to talk i get shut down or ignored. the only thing keeping me alive is playing school idol festival and it'll probably get old as time flies. i really just want to die by now people probably wont mind.
