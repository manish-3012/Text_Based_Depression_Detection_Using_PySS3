So my check didn't come in the mail today....A little backstory. I'm 27, and haven't exactly made the best decisions in my life over the past decade. I've been living paycheck to paycheck for the past decade, drowning in debt, never have enough money for the necessities, much less the luxeries in life. I can't remember the last time I was happy. So, here I sit in my bedroom, listening to As I lay Dying - An Ocean Between us(god I love this album, but love isn't the right word, I've never felt love towards anyone) just so I can try and keep my shit together for one more day. It's like, a day at a time, a day at a time, try again tommorrow, try again tommorrow, there's this hope that the light at the end of the tunnel isn't an oncoming train, even though it usually is. I was raised a southern babtist, and find myself turning to atheism. I can't believe in god, not now, especially not now. I tell myself, there's always tomorrow, the sun will rise on another day, and my paycheck will be in the mailbox when I get home from work on Thursday. Only today it's not there. I don't have anything for dinner, I'm out of bid(it keeps me sane, I don't give a fuck if its legal or not!). I've never been to the doctor, I know I should go. Bit I have this gear, it's like men aren't allowed to be depressed, so "man up" and suck it up. Christ, if I hear that one more time I'm gonna beat a motherfucker to a bloody goddamn pulp!  Anger is easier to deal with anyways. I'm sure I'm rambling on at this point, but I'm really just putting pen to paper, it helps. Sometimes. I've written thousands of notes, the idea of taking my own life, that "long term solution to a short term problem" is always in the back of mind, at least it is so long as I can get up out of bed and go to work. Fuck, some days it's all I can do to get dressed, and put on a face that might resemble a smile, and hope no one looks too close. Today was one of those days, I hit the snooze button at least 10 times before I managed to get up. I do this a lot, so I set my alarm early just in case. I was still late, but I didn't get written up. My direct supervisor knows, but I'm not sure that it was the best idea to tell him after all, but well see. At least he knows why I'm late from time time, why I go home early, why I'm unproductive. Anyways, enough of this bullshit, back to ad I lay dying. Maybe I'll listen to L.D. 50 next, I don't know....


There's always tommorrow, there's always tommorrow, there's always tommorrow, the sun will rise on another day, the sun will rise on another day..
