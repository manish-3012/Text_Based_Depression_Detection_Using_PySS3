Someone please helpToday I almost killed myself. I am living with such an awful mindset and I have done everything imaginable to helps and nothing works. I play in band and live a moderately public. My band is not huge but we are on the right track. Last year, on a day that my band released a music video, a woman that I cheated on my girlfriend accused me of rape on social media. Everyone saw it. My friends and family and supporters of my band. Thankfully, two women came forward to defend me with proof of my innocence. Regardless many people still believe I am a rapist or a predator of some sorts. I have never raped or coerced anyone into sex in my entire life and it eats away at me knowing that no matter what these allegations will always follow me. A few days ago allegations resurfaced and my friends are turning their backs on me. No one even cares to hear what I have to say because of the "believe victims" narrative. On top of that I live with such immense guilt and shame for how I behaved in my last relationship. I feel awful and now the thing that I love most - playing in my band - is being taken away from me because no one believes me and everyone thinks I am a terrible person. I feel awful. My friends hate me. My family is embarrassed of me. I cant find it within myself to forgive myself for what I have done. I want to die. I want to not feel like this anymore. What do I do.
