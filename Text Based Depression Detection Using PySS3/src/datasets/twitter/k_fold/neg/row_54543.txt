I'm tired of lifeHalf my life is now gone. I'm in my thirties and I finally left the religion that brainwashed me most of my life a few years ago. And im done. I'm a broken person who has no idea how to live in reality or be normal and im tired of trying. The best years of my life are gone and most importantly so are the developmental years where most people learn how to live that I just spent serving an imaginary friend. I have really tried the last couple of years but I'm just tired. I'll never be a normal. I'll never be able to relate to other people and I'll always just be sad and alone. My life was doomed to failure the moment I was born and started being indoctrinated. I'm going to use my credit cards to help my one sort of friend to pay for cancer treatment and then I'm buying a shotgun. My pointless existence will have accomplished one good thing, then I can have the peace of death.
