i feel like i have made a permanent home 'on the edge'every day it feels like i have to find reasons to keep breathing. and as long as things are going reasonably well for me, you can't tell as an outsider that i'm dying inside. but then as soon as something fucks up - literally anything even something tiny - i just lose my will to live. 

like, i ran out of soy sauce today. that was it. i just felt like 'what am i doing? why am i here?'

it's not because of the soy sauce (though soy sauce is pretty tasty) it's just because existing is such a needlessly difficult battle for me that the littlest hiccup reminds me how precarious my house of cards is.

all these people talk about it 'getting better' but they don't talk about you getting 'more resilient.' i could win the lottery, land my dream job, and get married tomorrow, and i'd still want to die if i stubbed my toe because the enjoyment i get out of successes is nil and the tether holding me to this reality is virtually non-existent. (it's the length of one very small dog. that's it. without him... yeah, nope. i'm gone.)

it's like... how do you even treat that? am i suicidal? well, i don't know, doc, how likely is it i'll get a papercut today?' people think you're belittling it, but it's not that at all. it's all really that vapidly superficial for me.
