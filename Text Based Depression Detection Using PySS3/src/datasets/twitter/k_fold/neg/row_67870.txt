Don't know what to doI'm not sure what's wrong with me or why it's so bad at the moment but I'm not coping again. My grandfather killed himself and uncle attempted so maybe it's just in my genes to want to end it. I won't, I won't put my family through that but I think about it often. I just went aimlessly driving and I'm in the hospital carpark at the moment considering putting myself in for suicide watch. I don't know if I actually want to or just want someone to care? Either way I don't want to waste people's time.

How do you pull through this? How do you get past this feeling? It feels like everyone around me is too busy having their own lives and I'm just left alone to die slowly inside?
