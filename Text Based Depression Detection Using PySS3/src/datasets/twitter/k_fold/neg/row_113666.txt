Ready to kill myselfI want to say so many things that I'm not sure how to write them down anymore. 

I've been fighting this battle of life for so long that I've just grown tired of it. I've tried to reach out for help but all those attempts just failed.

My only life plan has always been to commit suicide at some day. I guess i just was designed to live.
