Iâ€™m readyThis might be a last ditch effort but Iâ€™ve pretty much made up my mind. Iâ€™m sad. Idk how else to put it. My mind and heart are at battle and itâ€™s finally become too much to handle. I canâ€™t see it getting better because I know better. 

Iâ€™m a transgender man, just turned 22 and has suffered depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I was brought up in a very religious household. Where I was taught the Bible and the laws and principles laid out by God. 

I believe in it too. Itâ€™s getting increasingly harder not to trust in the word of God with all thatâ€™s happening in the world. But I know or I believe he wonâ€™t accept me. And I donâ€™t think I can change.

I have severe gender dysphoria but I canâ€™t make myself start hormones. I canâ€™t lose my family like that. So Iâ€™d rather not have to deal with it at all. 

I donâ€™t want to die but I do. Iâ€™m suffering so much. I canâ€™t help it and I want to die but I canâ€™t fix myself. I canâ€™t see any other way to stop this pain.

I canâ€™t even come out to my family because I feel like Iâ€™m gonna be preached to and/or disowned. I just canâ€™t see another way, even if I really really want to.
