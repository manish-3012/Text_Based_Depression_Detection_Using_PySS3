I can't stand life anymoreI'm tired, please tell me what I'm feeling is ok.
I don't want to hear anymore "You'll be fine" or "It's just a phase", I want the truth.

I want to know why I'm weird, I want to know why pain is the only thing that makes me feel human.

I want to know why I care about the people that don't understand me, the only reason  I'm not dead is to not make my family sad, because they like who I pretend to be.

I want to know why I'm getting obsessed over a girl I don't know the slightest as if she's perfect.

I want to know why it's so important for the voices to convince me I did something wrong and remind me of it for the rest of my life.

Or maybe I just want attention, so I'll have an excuse to post this.

I'll delete later, I don't even know why I posted this.
