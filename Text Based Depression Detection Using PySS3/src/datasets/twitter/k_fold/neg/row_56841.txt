Suicidal med student. Everything's set up, but I'm unsure if I really want to do this.My suicidal ideation is the worst it's ever been these past 2 weeks, and I think I might commit the act tonight. To drive myself closer to it, I badly injured my left hand with a hammer and stared at the sun for a long time today (I'm probably going to go blind later now if I don' commit suicide). I've got everything set up to hang myself, although I think there is a chance I fail. Also, with the way I've set it up, I think I'm gonna suffocate rather than die instantly.

I am feeling some resistance to going through with it. I feel like if I don't do it, I at least need to make drastic changes to my life. I'm so tempted to email my advisor requesting to withdraw from medical school tomorrow. I don't think medical school is the biggest source of my problems, but it definitely contributes a lot. But if I leave, I have over 100k in debt. I also don't have any immediate job prospects; I'd probably be unemployed for a long time. I did really like computer science when I took a few classes when I was younger, but my parents pushed me not to pursue a job in that field and I listened. I was wondering if I should maybe give it a try, delaying suicide for a bit at least, but it's probably just a case of grass being greener. It won't solve my biggest problems anyway. And maybe I start feeling regret about leaving med school, and then that becomes more fuel for suicide. Idk, it just seems like I'm doomed to live a poor quality of life from here on out regardless of what I do.

I feel trapped and hopeless and burnt out. I'm gonna try to at least wait till the morning before I make a final decision.
