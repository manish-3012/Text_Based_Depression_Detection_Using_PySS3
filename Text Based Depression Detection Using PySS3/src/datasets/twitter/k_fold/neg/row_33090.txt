Hello. I am lostIâ€™ve failed my finals, Iâ€™m getting dropped out this semester.


I was always a good student, my grades were always somewhere around 4 (the American equivalent is B). Sure, not the best, but everything came very natural to me. I never had any problems with any subjects.


I switched my school to a harder one and at the beginning I was the best student there. As my freshman year continued, I started to go down on grades. The program is too hard for me to understand, and Iâ€™ve started failing some of the subjects. Failing them made me discouraged to even try to get the situation improved, so they went down even more.


Then I fell sick for two weeks by the end of semester. All of the finals were delayed for me, but I wasnâ€™t prepared for them anyway. Iâ€™ve tried to prepare very hard, but that only lead to burning myself out to the point where I lost my mind. My last week was spent in complete apathy, I would get 2 hours of sleep a night at best. Everyday when I got home I had a very big urge to cut myself, but I figured itâ€™s not worth it and I have a chance.


I resorted to cheating on tests, and that actually helped me at first, some even didnâ€™t need a help from the little notes Iâ€™ve made to write off of. But the last two most essential tests were failed badly, on one of them the teacher caught me cheating and left me with a 1 (American F) without any chance of improving the grade.


Now I step closer and closer to self-harm, the idea of scarring myself scares me no more, and the fact that it doesnâ€™t concerns me.


Iâ€™ve failed my parents, I was the only kid that could lift my family up from poverty since my siblings couldnâ€™t manage to do so. Now I feel worthless, My finals decide my chances of enrolling to a university on a free basis, if I donâ€™t get good grades - my family wonâ€™t be able to pay for tuition, and getting a loan will only worsen their debt.


I am a burden, I donâ€™t see any logical continuation of my life. The only reasonable outcome is ending all this. I donâ€™t want to kill myself, I want to live! But I either end up seeing my household collapse entirely and live pay check to pay check working in a sweatshop of some kind or try to improve the situation for my family by discontinuing my life and reducing their expenses on my college, stuff I need, and other bullshit.


Please, reach out to me. There has to be a way out
