today i realized i truly have nothing to live for other than guiltim in partial rn and my case manager asked me to come up with a bucket list couple of days ago. i sort of had an existential crisis when i realized i have almost nothing to live for.

maybe the thought of how my family would be affected would deter me, but not for long... im extremely selfish so it wont take long to attempt.

i just hope i succeed.
