Im never going to be anything i cant wait until im finally deadIm failing basically all my classes because I have no motivation and my parents just think don't care because I don't want to tell them the real reason I don't do work. I just sit there in class and do nothing. I'm scared of not finishing highschool even though I don't need too. I wish I was never born so it wasn't such a struggle to end everything.
