After 10+ Years of Severe Depression I Feel I'm Slowly Losing the FightI have a psychiatrist, a therapist, and have tried more medicines than I care to think about. The sad thing is that right now I'm actually on a medication that works better than anything else I've tried. It's extremely frustrating. I've had to watch everything I care about slowly go out of reach due to mental illness - my education, my health, and the person I wanted to marry. 

Depression and anxiety have taken just about everything I care about other than my cat and my life. It's progressed to a point where, despite my best efforts, I'm lucky if I'm even functional. Right now my "goals" with my doctors are simple things like literally sitting in my backyard because my social anxiety only gets worse the more depressed I am. I hate myself, and everything about me, and can't stand that the only thing stopping me from having a degree, an amazing job, and a wonderful life is myself. I'm not stupid, I'm well spoken, and don't make foolish YOLO life choices. But I just want this all to end. For me thinking about suicide (not seriously, just it popping into my head as a thought) is probably a daily occurrence I've just learned to live with.

I feel like I'm just wasting away through life, and just killing myself in the form of "waiting to die". For brief periods of time I get to enjoy periods without depression, but it's always bittersweet because I know, despite my best efforts, the depression will always come back. If anything, my short periods of enjoyment are more unsustainable distractions. I've watched my peers move on to successful careers and it kills me to know that I could be right there with them if I could just... fix myself. 

Every year it just gets worse and worse. At this rate I won't make it to 30. Even now I fear my 24th birthday because I'm honestly scared that I might try to kill myself sometime next year and will succeed. I don't want to die.
