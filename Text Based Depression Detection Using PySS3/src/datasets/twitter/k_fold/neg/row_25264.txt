Do I deserve to be miserable?Did I do something to deserve my shit life? Did I do something to make everyone hate me? I cannot get ahead, it seems no one cares about me. Drowning in debt and seemingly no way out. No one helps me. 
Every job I get, is somehow worse than the last. I receive no respect, no praise, people everywhere treat me like garbage. I just want someone to give a shit. 

Do I not deserve to be happy!?  

I don't really believe in god but It's like I am being punished for something terrible I never did. I am constantly upset and contemplating suicide, and have **no-one** to talk to. Nobody's shoulder to cry on. I know it's cliche , but I can't help feeling lost and alone in this world.

I just want someone to tell me I did a good job. To care if I don't show up to work the next day. To just thank me for my hard work....but no, *nothing*. Why do I even try anymore?

I don't know how much longer I can suffer. I want out. I want to feel happiness again.....or to not feel anything at all.
