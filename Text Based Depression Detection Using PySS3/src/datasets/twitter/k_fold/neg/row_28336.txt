When was the first time that you heard your brain tell you to kill yourself?I remember the exact moment when mine started telling me. It was December, I was 5 years old. I used to be that joyful, over active, over achiever kid who was good at everything. There was a birthday party for my younger sister and she hasnâ€™t liked me ever (she used to bite me and hit me) and all the cousins, uncles and aunts were at home. 

I used to be a very sensitive kid (the irony) and my sister and I were running after each other. My sister tripped and starting crying and suddenly my dad almost hit me but like people were at the house so he just scolded me (but you know that mid air action where they are going to slap you but they just stop, yeah that happened and it used to happen a lot with me with my parents). 

In that moment I felt this huge ass emotion of self hatred that I still havenâ€™t been able to shake off and I just kept thinking how I wasnâ€™t good enough and how I should just die. Then my dad (like after an hour or so) was like why are you in your room? Go out and play/enjoy with your cousins. Since that day onwards I have always wanted to die.
