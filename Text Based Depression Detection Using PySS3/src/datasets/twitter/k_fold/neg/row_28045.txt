She's gone. What do I do?Yesterday, May 22nd, my cousin committed suicide. It was her birthday, and, needless to say, a complete blindside to friends and family. I knew of her struggles; she was forced to get an abortion by her mother, her mother left her with her grandmother and refused to talk to her (No phone number or address to reach her at, either). Our Grandmother constantly told her how she was failing, how she was always doing something wrong. The love of her life died and, upon attending his funeral, she found out a lot of what he was telling her was a lie. Fighting through depression myself, I had tried my best to cope with her, to find ways to keep her happy the best I could every time we talked. There was no letter, there was no indication the night prior of her intentions. All she left us with were two songs: Paradise by Coldplay and See You Again by Carrie Underwood. I have moments of clarity, but I can't wrap this around my head. I don't know where to go from here, I can't talk to my family without crying hysterically. Who do I talk to? Is there a number? How to I find council when I have no means of payments? I'm so lost.
