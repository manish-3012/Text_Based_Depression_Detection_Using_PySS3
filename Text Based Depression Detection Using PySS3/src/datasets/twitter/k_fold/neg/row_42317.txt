Am I selfish? I don't want to live anymore. Not specifically kill myself yet, I just don't want to live. I can't deal with what I've done and I feel like I don't deserve to live. 

I guess I should explain why. I, in essence, forced my (now sort of ex) girlfriend of 3 and a half years to have sex with me about a month ago. It was the night of prom (yes, we just finished high school) and afterwards we were at a friends house. The house was empty and my girlfriend and I were making out. I wasn't sure if she wanted to have sex or not, so I asked. She said no but because she didn't want to get caught. So I suggested we go somewhere else. She again said she didn't want to get caught. I said that we wouldn't. She agreed, we went and had sex. Things seemed fine. But later I found out she felt forced and violated. Now she feels worthless and says she doesn't want to live cause she wasn't able to completely say no for a second time. She had some issues with a previous guy during our relationship but it never got physical, he just guilted her into into having sexual conversations, sending him pictures, etc. I forgave her cause I could see he had her trapped in a cage and was guilting her into this stuff. I helped her out. Thats why this is the second time. 

But I feel so responsible for what happened. I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to live for what I did to her and making her not want to live. But she said that I wasn't the the victim here. I just don't know what to do. I can't not hate myself for what I did but hating myself for what I did is also the wrong thing. 

Is it selfish for me to want to cut again to punish myself and to not want to be alive cause of what I did?
Thanks for taking the time to read this.
