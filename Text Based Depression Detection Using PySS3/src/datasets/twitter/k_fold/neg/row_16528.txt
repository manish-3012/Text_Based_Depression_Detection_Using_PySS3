Chronic PainI've always had suicide as a monkey on my back throughout my life but never *seriously* considered it as most stressors were transient. Deal with it long enough and one can weather the storm. 

This...not so much. I have herniated discs in my neck that cause me immense pain and control a large portion of my life. This isn't something that will go away or even get better. I'm 25, and I'm already missing work and relying on benzos to function during the bad flare ups. 

How do I continue when I know things are just going to get worse?

There is surgery, but I'm scared that if that fails, I'll have nothing to hope for after.
