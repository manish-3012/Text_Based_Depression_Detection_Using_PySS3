WhyThe feeling that I'm not going to be here tomorrow has set in. I can't even look into my daughters face to get relief. Not sure what to do. Feel as if I'm slipping and can't get control. Nothing helps. Nothing stops it. Can't control anything. Depression has set in to new low. I feel like today is going to be the day..
