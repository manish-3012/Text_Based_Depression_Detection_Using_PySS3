I just want to die in my sleep tonightA very close and one of the very few actual friends (only friend actually close and not an online friend) of mine who I've known since February stopped talking to me? Why you might ask? Well I had deep feelings for him and tried having a relationship but he was very dl and it just couldn't work for him. So we remained friends with the occasional benefits. The guy was so sweet to me and honestly such a model. I'm not sure how I landed him in bed because the guy is more beautiful than anyone I've been with by a long shot. Well since we couldn't have a relationship I recently went on a date with one guy a month ago. I mentioned my friend and showed him his Instagram. I don't hear from either of them for a month. Apparently they both decided to go behind my back and fuck each other and actually be together like I wanted. I hate people so goddamn much all they do is hurt me and I'm so tired. I was never meant for this world I just want to die. Now since I found out they both cut ties with me. Yeah guess I'm just going to pop two antidepressants that don't work and go to sleep for 12 hours.
