PTSD is too much... Held a knife to my wrist while my BF was out.I have PTSD. I woke up this morning from a nightmare that was worse than anything I've ever dreamed. I wanted to die. 

I think that a lot, so I shook the thought off. Then I got unexpected horrifying news that had to do with my trauma, and I snapped. I found myself on the kitchen floor with a knife from the block pressed against my wrist. The only thing that stopped me was the thought of my boyfriend finding me. Tonight I've been counting my pills to see if I have anything that will work.  

I haven't been this close to hurting myself in years. But the pain of what happened is never ending, and every time I think I've learned to manage it, more bad news comes along or my brain finds a new way to replay the events as more terrifying as ever before. If this is just life until I die, I don't think I want to live it. 

I feel like I can't even talk to my therapist or loved ones about how I'm feeling because I know they'll freak, and I have too much going on right now to end up in the hospital. I don't think I'm going to do anything, but feeling this desperate for the first time in a while is scary.
