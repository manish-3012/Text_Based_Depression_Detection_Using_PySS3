Really Really Need Someone To Talk ToI'm 22 years old with social anxiety and depression. I don't want to put my life story here but basically I got married at 19 because of a religious upbringing and then left that religion a few years later and got divorced. I lost contact with my friends and family over leaving the church.

I have been struggling to make friends for also three years now, and I'm not exaggerating when I saw that I have no one who I can talk to. The loneliness has started to become unbearable. (I'm someone who never thought I'd be posting on a forum to ask for friendship or support but that's the point that it's gotten to).
