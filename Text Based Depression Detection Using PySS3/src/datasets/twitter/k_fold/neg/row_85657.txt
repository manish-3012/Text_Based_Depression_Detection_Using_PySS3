Experiences of Seeking HelpI was just wondering what your experiences of seeking help were?

In the past I had an awful experience of going to A&amp;E/ER (whatever you want to call it, Iâ€™m UK based) for suicidal thoughts/plans. This was about 6 years ago though. But more recently Iâ€™ve been feeling very low to the point of feeling suicidal and I mentioned it to my psych team and weâ€™ve discussed what I should do if I have any intentions of going through with my plans. These involve calling her (during 9-5 hours) or out of hours calling the MH assessment team. 

Iâ€™m not at the stage yet where my plans have become concrete but Iâ€™m worried for myself that they might, and Iâ€™m also worried about the reactions of medical staff if I turn up to hospital with suicidal plans. Iâ€™m worried about being fobbed off again, which only made me feel worse when it happened a few years ago.

So was wondering if anyone had any experiences and how it went.
