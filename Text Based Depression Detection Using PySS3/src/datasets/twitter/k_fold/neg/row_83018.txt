Should I Check Myself Into Mental Hospital?Apologies if wrong thread- thought this seemed appropriate.

20M.
Its been a rough year. Lost fiance, slowly getting her back. Dropped out of college  I transferred to for her. Disowned (partly me, partly parents), staying with friend. Part time job with irregular hours. 

Parents still pay for car and cell and I'm on their health insurance but I'm still pretty broke. Going to have to move somewhere when friend's house is placed for sale. Friend I thought I could stay with withdrew offer and chewed me out for not staying with my parents and general life decisions.

I've been having bi-polar symtoms and have appointment in a couple of weeks. I'm not suicidal or danger to others but my mood swings (triggered by conversations like that with friend or worry about future or stress of relationship) are violent and I have trouble calming myself down. When I do I just feel empty (like now).

I just feel like I'm losing friends for being "whiny or self pitying". I scared of being homeless and being stuck of dead in job. I'm scared of how bad it hurts when I go off. I feel guilty for financial drain I am on parents/mooching off friend. Don't know what to do. 

 tl;dr- violent uncontrollable mood swings triggered by stress. Get help? 

Edit- It is 5AM and I am going to bed. Thank you to those who offered advice and took the time to listen. I am in the "flat emotion" period after a panic attack. I'll be OK.

Again, thank you and keep up the awesome work.
