My landlord claims someone smoked pot in my apartment and fined me $500 (again)No one fucking smoked in my apartment. I paid a fine for the same thing back in December and no one smoked then either. I only paid it because the guy banged on my door, yelled in my face, and threatened to kick me out. I was scared and didnâ€™t want an eviction on my record, so I paid. Now I canâ€™t afford it. It didnâ€™t happen. No one smoked in there and I donâ€™t know what the fuck to do
