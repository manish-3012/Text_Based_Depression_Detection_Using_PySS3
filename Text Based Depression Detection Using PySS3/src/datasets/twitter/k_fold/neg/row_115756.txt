My three year old hates me and Iâ€™m losing my mindMy daughter is only three. I made the mistake of having her with a man I barely knew in a country very far away from my own. Sheâ€™s started to do 50/50 care with me and her father. Today she returned to me to tell me she didnâ€™t love me anymore. She screamed to be with her dad. I do not want to live this shitty fucking life. I have sacrificed everything for her.
