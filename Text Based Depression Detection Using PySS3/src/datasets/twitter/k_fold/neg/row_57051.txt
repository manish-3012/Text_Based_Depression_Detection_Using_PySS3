Anyone with any history of drug abuse/SO with drug abuse? Things just got worse and idk what to do.She showed up. She told me she was sorry for the abuse. She was sorry for ruining my life. I thought I was getting closure. I thought she was asking for help. I thought she was gonna try and get better. She handed me me 100$z She told me she was gonna go smoke crack and shack up with a dude. I feel like I'm watching someone kill themselves and there's nothing I can do about it.
