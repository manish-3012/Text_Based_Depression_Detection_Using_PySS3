It wouldn't matter if I was here anywayFriends don't wanna hang out with me. People at work only talk to me when they need something from me. My friends don't really care about what I have to say unless its of importance of them or if they need something from me. 

My parents have my brother, friends of mine all have other better friends. My colleagues don't care for me anyway so that really doesn't matter. 

I know I'm nothing more than a burden to those around me yet no one dares to say it. I know the only reason I still have people to talk to is because they're either too worried I'll hurt myself when they leave or have had enough of me but haven't realised it yet.

Fuck this. Fuck this life. Fuck my parents for bringing me into this. I'm sorry that I had to be the fuck up. I'm sorry for being that annoying when I feel sad. I really wish I was different but I had to be like this. I'm sorry.
