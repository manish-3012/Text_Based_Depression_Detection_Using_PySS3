Why is it like this?Iâ€™m sitting here in my room writing this. As a kid I didnâ€™t understand suicide. Why would someone do such a thing to a problem that is only temporary? Well now I understand. Honestly I still canâ€™t tell you why I want to. It is just how my brain is wired. I exist but I am not living. I was dealt a bad hand, so am I here just to suffer?
