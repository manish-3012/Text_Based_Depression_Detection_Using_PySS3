Tired Eyes and a tired mind...Long story short, I've been unemployed since graduation in 2011. I got a 2:1 in Business. I'm nearly 27, will be in May. I've taken care of family for over a year, near two before I signed on late 2013, I now volunteer have done for over a year with two charities for references. 
I sincerely am trying. 
I've got in contact with the Samaritan, and CALM to speak up and it's helped to an extent.

I just recently...

I hate waking up after eight hours sleep and still feeling tired.  I hate having a broken sleep, where I wake up repeatedly after five hours. I hate thinking the futures hopeless. I hate thinking about funeral costs. I've even had suicidal thoughts once again. And reading up on it is something that I just can't help. 
I've had to make a conscious effort to not be alone. I make sure my bedroom door is open. 

My concentration is shot  and it's just frustrating.
 
I honestly am at a loss how to handle this. I don't even know what I'm asking for. This depression and cycle of I'm a fuck up and the there's no hope thoughts is wearing us down. 

I know I'm not the only one in my situation it's just hard to see past my own failings. I already feel I've let my family down. I just don't know where to go from here.
