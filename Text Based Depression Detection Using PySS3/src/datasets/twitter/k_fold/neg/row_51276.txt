I didn't know where else to turn.Yesterday the person who i talked to about my problems told me to geniuely hang myself already, he was basically my only friend I had other than a few and we've been friends for years. I cried for almost three hours, and ivr been in bad mood swings of either nothingness, anger or deep sadness. I don't want to bother any one else because i know they'll probably do the same thing. As another person already lied about caring about me as a friend and just me

I'm too scared to message or call suicide Hotline as I just feel so much anxiety with it and im too scared to go anywhere else. I'm even scared to say on this reddit that I actually want to die. I only feel safe reaching out for help because I just dont know where else to turn for help right now and I'm really hoping i made this post right. 
I just am losing it right now as all i can think of is killing myself...
