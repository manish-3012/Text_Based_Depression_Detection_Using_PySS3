Im a mistakeIm so scared to write this but i need someone to know 


im a gay kid in Saudi Arabia a place where lgbtq+ ppl aren't accepted and punished(by death) , im scared of my family and I've isolated myself from everyone cause im terrified that they'll know.
 
I spent most of my life being bullied (cause ppl can kinda tell) which made me develop social anxiety and depression .

 it feels like im carrying this heavy weight and I can't do it anymore i just wanna let go, These two years have been the hardest so far, my depression is so bad to the point where im not going to school , my general health is shit ,i have no one and im so alone and scared . 

everyone around my is happy and having fun except for me, I don't get to have that because of something i had no choice over ,this isn't a way to live and im so fucking tired. 
 
I  just wanna love and feel loved is that too much to ask for!!????????

 I find myself thinking about letting go and im searching for reasons to not do it . 

Maybe this is my cry for help
