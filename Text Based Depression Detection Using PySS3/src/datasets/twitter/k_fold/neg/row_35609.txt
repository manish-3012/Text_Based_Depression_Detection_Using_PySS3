Don't know wat to sayNot sure what yo say. There are lots of inspirational stories on here which are amazing. But none of these stories seem to ever ring true for me. I hope some, if not almost all people get inspiration from these stories. I guess I'm one of the few it doesn't quite touch. It's hard picturing people missing you when you don't know anyone who acts like they care at all.  I don't know what the reasons for living really are, but I know I'm running out of them.
