First time I've thought about it in awhileIt's been a few years since the desire crossed my mind.

But I sit here now, having failed an exam I spent a year studying for, reminded that I have no one to comfort me. And I won't. Because no one wants to be with me.

I'm drowning in debt. I have no real friends. Family ignores me because I don't have kids for them to care about. 

I hate my job and have tried more than 10x to get a promotion in the past 12 months and I can't get anywhere. 

Maybe I'm not meant to be here anymore. I've reached the end of this miserable existence.
