I'm sick of having nothing. Figuratively and literally. All I have been doing for the last 4 years is hanging on for dear life.I have mental issues. I have no family and no friends. My net worth is about -20,000, I'm about to lose my job, and my girlfriend and I are about to split. She's the last person I know or have contact with. Fuck I'm only 22 and don't even have my physical health.

My mental issues have gotten much worse recently and have prevented me from getting or keeping friends and are probably going to keep me from getting another job after this one is gone.

It's not even something usually considered serious. It's just really severe anxiety and depression. It's so severe that I've created and live in my own little world. Sometimes I feel like I completely lose touch with the reality of things around me. Seriously, you should try to see me interact with another human being. It's weird, awkward, alien, and pointless. I don't feel like I'm even human anymore. I feel like I'm some sort of foreign or alien entity in a human body stuck in a completely existentially nonsense world. My internal sense of identity is all fucked up. The word "I" doesn't feel right. There isn't a proper pronoun to describe me/I/it... if that make sense.

I've been down the therapist and medication route. That was what I did for two of the last four years with virtually zero impact. 

Since all of this started I feel like I have been mentally holding onto a rope with all of my strength while suspended over a pit of spikes or magma. It was easy at first but I've been gradually been worn down and there is no escape. I'm really ready and really just want to finally be able to let go of the rope. 

Oh yeah throw in some substance abuse, self medication, and extreme paranoia too. I really do believe this situation is hopeless and that things are going to be like this forever. I really just want to let go.
