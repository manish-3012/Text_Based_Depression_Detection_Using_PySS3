I don't know how but I know that one day I'm going to kill myself.I don't see it ending any other way. All I want to do is cry when I wake up. There's nothing I want to do. I don't see the point in living. I can't get a boyfriend, I can't make friends. Everyone eventually leaves me. My own family isn't interested in talking to me. My parents don't know how to deal with me. I just eat as less as I can so meals aren't expensive because I'm not working right now and there's nothing I want to do. Everything just feels like a nightmare. I just want to sleep and never wake up. 

I can't find a decent therapist, everyone is either on a waitlist or they don't take my insurance and I don't want to pay $120 for someone that I'm just going to talk to for an hour about why I think life sucks and listen to them tell me that I should think more positively. I don't know what else anyone can tell me at this point that will make things better. I don't know who I can meet that will change my life forever. I just don't want anything.
