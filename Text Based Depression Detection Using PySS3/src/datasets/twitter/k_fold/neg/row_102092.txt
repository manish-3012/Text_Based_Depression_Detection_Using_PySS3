What's the point in existing anywayAll we are is parasites. We exist to reproduce and multiply. That's it. That's the point of life, existence and everything. Why do we even care. Nothing we do will have meaning in the future anyway.

We seek meaning in bullshit religions and groups. Fuck God, fuck love, fuck existence. It's just an endless pain.
