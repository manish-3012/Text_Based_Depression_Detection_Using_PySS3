Want to DieI feel like I have no purpose in life. I'm thinking of attempting to commit suicide tomorrow by crushing Vicodin and taking it with alcohol. I may break up with my boyfriend first because he hid something that devasted me. My best friend left me and one of my good friends is moving. I feel like I have only one other friend to talk to. I don't want to talk to my parents so I just stay in my room and sleep and cry.
