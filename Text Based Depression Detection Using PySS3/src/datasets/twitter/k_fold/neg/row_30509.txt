I want it to endI have no drive, no motivation, no willpower left in me. I got pushed into medicine by my parents and I never wanted to do it. I try bringing this up and we just fight where they point out how other jobs do not make money or how I would be unable to provide a good life for kids or my wife or anyone else. All we do is argue over that and I just end up frustrated. 

I went to high school and it was special in that I went everyday from 8 to 5 from 8th grade to 12th. University isn't much different since I was raised with the mindset to succeed and push myself so I've gone too far. I'm too afraid to fail, but I feel like a failure. I feel as if nothing matters anymore. I'm not going to make it anyways so why should I try? Why should I even make an effort to move forward? Why can I not simply kill myself? I'm too scared to do it, but I fall asleep every night hoping I dont wake up.

I drive to my research lab hoping a truck hits me, I walk to class hoping a texting driver decides to run me over ending me. I cant find it in myself anymore to even study for my classes. I've given up on doing things I liked to do...I am just so done with everything, I want it all to end. I want to write a suicide note and disappear and let survival of the fittest deal with me. My father always told me dreaming was for fools so I never chased any dream I had. I did what I was told no matter how it affected my mental state. I am burned out, but in my position I cannot take a break. I dont stand a chance. I know the end is near for me, I just hope it will be painless.
