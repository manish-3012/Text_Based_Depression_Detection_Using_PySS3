I feel trapped.Iâ€™ve been serving in the military for about a year and half now and Iâ€™m legitimately on the verge of going to a Walgreens, buying a bottle of Tylenol and ending my life within the next 48 hours. I get very little sleep, get overworked with grueling weekly hours, eat and feel like absolute garbage everyday, stopped hanging out and talking to most of my friends and deal with an unfair and completely dysfunctional chain of command. I canâ€™t bear to image dealing with this for another 3 years.

I just want it this nightmare to end.
