Not feeling well.It's not that i want to die, but i've been thinking about it a lot, since i dont really have any reason to live. My love life is failure on failure, i meet a nice girl, who gets to know me and then dumps me from one day to another. It kills me, along with this i live in a SMALL town where everyone i knew has moved out due to multiple reasons. So im all alone here..
