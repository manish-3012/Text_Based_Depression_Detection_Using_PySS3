Not TodayI had everything perfectly planned. I would fall to my death from a condominium under construction near my work. I would sneak in at night and jump from the top of its 26 floors. Today would have been the day I finally achieved the peace I long sought.

My eight year old step-sister reminded me that it's my birthday next month. She said she was making me a card. 

Killing myself would hurt her, and I don't want to do that.

One day I will end the suffering. Not today.
