Just leaving this hereI have already written a note. Although thinking through this logically I don't really want to leave a sidenote to why. Or even give a justification. I don't feel people around me deserve that. And i want to believe being silent is beter than being a sidenote

Its not their fault. Its mine really. I was born. I made myself occur in the universe at the wrong time, produced in the wrong place. So i was it all fits in.

Im quite tired of being bullied. At home and at once school. I used to be fairly muted and i was made a bitch at school. And I used to get angry. Naturally like a child - of which I was at the time I would push back. I was slightly taller than the others and wasent stupid at all. So when i was needing to 'push back' it worked satisfyingly well. Although I was made a villan by my teachers, again I did not stand up for myself the whole way.

At home my brother bullies me all day. Any second he can. He is 5 years older than me 23 and going collage. He does football, and beats me up a lot. I became very ill after i was hurt bad at 13 and he still beated me. More in fact. So I kept being ill to myself of which my parents hated me for. He still beats me. Im 18 now and recovering, trying to get healthy.

My parents also hate me. Its funny in fact, in a weird way it is. My dad enjoys making me a 2nd best, calling me names, like faggot, pushing me both runk and sober. My mum is stupid. 

I said I was trying to get healthy, I am really hard. And yet they deny my at any request to join sports. They will laugh at me and never sign parental agreement forms. Even if the only way is through paying and walking. My dad whispers about how hes going to make me crack up: "only when he asks nicely". I reckon its so I grow up with no self respect, I assume anyway.

Going to school is okay. I have a personality, but it breaks down at home. Im a mute at home. Ive moved away from my old school. The kids are my height if not taller. But I dont feel comfortable around people. And i think they think the same of me. I have a strong group of friends. Who never need me outside class.

Im basically there to make laughs for them with a witty joke or two. Understand a subject so they can be taught at break or lunch. Im needed for advice. And thats it, im not needed for friendship outside. I can admit this all now, ill be called out to a party like on reserve. If they want to impress some new kids socially. After I go out and glue them together im blanked. I feel like a bitch and im mature enough to realise what they want me for now. Im a cheap laugh or fix.

Im very tired now. Im always unhappy, and i cannot access sports.  Im bored of education, its either to easy or im forced to fuck up by my family who will tear up papers or break my pens. I cant do work outs at home as my brother will kick me down. Seriously whats the point?

What would you do. What the fuck do I do. I havent cried since I was 8 and I really am now. 10 years on and im still someones bitch. I swear I could have been great. I did swimming once. Only once. I learnt to swim in one day. I was given 8 months to swim by my aunt. I competed county. Regional. I was on track for higher, so much higher and my dad stopped it becuase I wanted to go national.

Thats my story in a nut shell. Potential never gained. I dont want to have a partner in life. Or grow and up live a beter life. I want to die. I dont even want to be happy. Or wait for it. How screwed up is that. 

Any parents who pass by this please go love your kids. Hug them, care for them and thats it. 

I dont know when im going or how. I have to think about what im doing next but its here open now. I always play my hand, I will wait for a miracle in this month. But i dont really want to start another school year.
