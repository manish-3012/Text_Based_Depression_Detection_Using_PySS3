Trapped and I know it..How did I get this bad? Just 2 years ago I was playing the wii with a friend. I don't know where to even start.first off, I was going to die and I would be dead if I hadn't seen this video: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6GggY4TEYbk . I sat there and watched it and dammit I cryed for hours. Then I realized that I can't kill myself. There is no way. I don't have a gun, I don't live on a tall building, etc. I want to die so much but I know that I am not going to. What do I do? Im not interested in anything, I have no hobbies, I don't feel like doing schoolwork. I am doing online studies because I'm bad at socializing and I get scared around other ppl. I haven't done much on it and I'm screwed. I can't do this anymore. I can't even sleep at night I just sit and cry and cry, and I'm a male. I need someone to kill me, or something to get out of this ASAP, what should I do? I don't have any friends. And when I say that I don't mean I only have a couple of friends, I mean I literally have no friends. I need to kill myself but I can't. I'm trapped and.... Danget I have nothing else to say
