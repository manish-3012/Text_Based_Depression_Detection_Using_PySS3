I feel stupid for failing to commit suicideI have a bunch of mental illnesses and have spent time in and out of inpatient over the last few years. My illnesses come with a lot of suicidal thoughts. I have attempted suicide 6 times, well, 6 resulting in hospitalisations but Iâ€™ve odâ€™d god knows how many times. 

An ex-friend once said â€œif you wanted to kill yourself it wouldâ€™ve worked, youâ€™re just abusing the health care system and wasting their resourcesâ€.  To some extent I agree, a few attempts have been more leaning towards a cry for help than anything else but the others have all been methodically planned and I just ended up being saved by doctors and friends. She said this to me about a month ago and itâ€™s all I can think about. I feel like Iâ€™ve failed myself for not committing suicide. I canâ€™t even kill myself properly. I feel useless and incredibly guilty for surviving when Iâ€™ve continued to waste resources by attempting since.
