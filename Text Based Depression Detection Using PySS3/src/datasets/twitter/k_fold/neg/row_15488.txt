I can't do this anymoreI'm a disappointment. A liar. A criminal in the eyes of the law. Just turned 19 and my 19th gift was a new court date while still waiting two more dates. Maybe it's just the cocaine wearing off, or the fact that I've blown every dollar gambling, or maybe it's the fact that there is only so much one can take.

Used to believe that the suicidal thoughts I got were funny &amp; that I would never resort to it but lately they have been creeping up very deeply, and it seems to me like those thoughts are smarter to commit to.

Not sure why I am posting - I just need to... get it out? I can't tell anyone about anything because no one knows about my gambling addiction, my drug addiction, my criminal acts, I am already a disappointment to my family, I'm not sure what to do anymore. Guess I'm just looking for a helping hand in a world where finding a therapist is near impossible for someone in my position :(
