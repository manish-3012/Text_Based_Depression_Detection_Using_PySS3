last night ive dreamt about dying and i feel joy nowi already posted in r/depression but i feel like this is the right place to seek for some sort of advice  


i feel relaxed, calm, and sort of hope that when i die i will feel like this and i fear that this evolves into some type of motivation to try something to kill myself.
