Iâ€™m scaredIâ€™m
Scared of getting help for being bipolar. I have been posting on here and I am just so fearful of getting help because I wonâ€™t feel like the sad depressed fuck Iâ€™ve always been. I feel worthless and like none of my effort will ever matter. I want help so I can show everyone and myself that i can be better but Iâ€™m scared of feeling different.
