Last night was pretty roughI was seriously considering admitting myself into the hospital yesterday but decided against it as the last thing I wanted was to miss out on college classes for the next little while.

It was the first time in a while that I have broken down and just cried for hours and truly contemplated ending my life. The reason for breaking down wasn't even that serious. I had a little argument with my father about some things, and I tried to apologize as I was in the wrong, but no matter what I said, he was still upset with me. It affected my mother as well. 

I guess I just felt like I honestly shouldn't be around. I know people care for me, but in those moments I can't help but think things like "they really would be happier if I was gone". 

I'm 22 and still live with my parents. I'm not financially stable enough to move out, especially with the amount I'm paying to go to college. I've thought about taking out a loan so I could move out and just sort of distance myself from my family a bit, but I'm worried about the financial burden that will put on me. 

My life is a mess and my surroundings and habits reflect that. My room is a mess, clutter and clothes everywhere. I hate it just as much as my family does. I feel guilty because it saddens my mother, but I can't break the habit. I used to care about how I looked to other people. I liked to pride myself in dressing well but lately I just slap on whatever is convenient. I stopped caring about my personal health a long time ago. I recently started to try eating healthier, so I like to think that I am trying to improve things little by little. 

I feel like I'm stuck. I don't really see a way out. I'm just disappointing my family. I'm disappointing myself.
