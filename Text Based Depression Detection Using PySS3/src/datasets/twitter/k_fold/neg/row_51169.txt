I feel it creeping up on me again.21 year old female here. I thought I was finally okay, but I guess depression never truly goes away. So here I am seeking an internet friend to talk to since I sadly don't have many friends in the outside world, and the friends that I do have don't know about my..history. Four suicide attempts, a couple of ER visits, and four inpatient hospital stays in the looney bin. Self harm and suicide have been on my mind constantly. I just want someone to talk to that understands. I really just need a friend.
