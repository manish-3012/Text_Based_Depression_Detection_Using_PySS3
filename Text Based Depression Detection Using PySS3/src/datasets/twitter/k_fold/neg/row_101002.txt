Anyone else get so depressed they're empty?I'm not even sad anymore. I don't cry or have a tendency to self harm. I don't even feel that much anger inside me anymore. I just feel numb, empty. Like the whole world flashes between my eyes but nothing matters anymore. All the ambitions I had last year of getting clean off self harming and getting into university don't seem to matter anymore. But it's not like I'm sad, it's like I've gone beyond emotions and I'm just empty now. It's somehow even more painful to me than sadness, it's feels much more permanent. Before there was a chance I'd get better and be fine after all, but now it feels like it's finally hit home. This is now it.
