I feel trapped.I want to die. But I don't want to leave family with expensive death arrangements. Or have some poor soul find my body.
I'm utter trash. I don't have friends anymore. I messed them all up. I've been replaced. The love of my life doesn't want me anymore.
I'm 25. No skills, no smarts, no looks, no talents. Not even a redeeming personality. I feel like the best thing I can do for anymore is to die
