The time I'am never going to get back...I know this is a generic problem among people, but my teenage life is almost over, and I never had a single girl in my life. Even though I tried my best, and went on a few meetings with some girls, I think that I am uninteresting and unlovable for who I am. This isn't how I imagined my teens, and it's no help that my father is always asking me about girls and why I don't have one already, and of course I have been more and more frustrated about it, especially in the last few weeks.And all of my friends had girls and sex already. I feel like I've wasted the best part of life, and I just don't want to get older and bitter...and start my twentysomething years alone. What people are telling me is to not worry about it, but I must. It's like a 0-24 thing in my brain. Soon I'll be twenty and I think that I just won't make it if I stay like that. Wish I'd be gone.
