Help meI wish I could be somewhere where I can feel safe. I canâ€™t handle going to work anymore because Iâ€™m too mentally ill. I feel like I might hurt myself. Iâ€™ve been in a mental hospital before but it was nothing like what I thought it would be. It was horrible. I was just crying wanting to get out of there. I wish I could be kept somewhere where I could feel safe and be able to heal. In the state Iâ€™m in Iâ€™m gonna end up harming myself. Iâ€™m lonely.
