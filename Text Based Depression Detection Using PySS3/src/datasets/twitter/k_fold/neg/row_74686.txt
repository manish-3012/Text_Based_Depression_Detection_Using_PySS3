I'm not sure what's even wrong. But... I can't take it.I feel like I stopped existing, I just stopped caring about everything. I don't even know where my head sits right now. things have been so confusing... i want to go on a ride, find out my bikes max speed and see what a wrong turn does... but I have a reason for not wanting to.. I'm afraid that in my head that final thread will snap.
