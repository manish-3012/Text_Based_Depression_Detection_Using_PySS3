I ruined my life while I was suicidal because I thought that I had no future. Now...I want to live but I have permanent damage.

I was suicidal so I spent all my money on heroin. I IV'd heroin in hopes that eventually I would OD. I was convinced that I had no future. 

Now I'm 2 years clean, but still have scars all over my body, a face rash that won't go away, lost tens of thousands of dollars, and I have no idea if I did any permanent damage to myself.
