I Can't Stand My Life AnymoreI'm 21 years old and I absolutely hate everything about my life. I'm fat, $5000 in debt, I have no skills, my closest friend got with some chick and I rarely got to hang out with him, now he got her pregnant so I'm literally never going to see him. I don't like my family. They say they love me and I say it back, but deep down I know I don't mean it. I don't hate them, I just wish they weren't a part of my life. I don't get why I'm supposed to love people who have treated me so poorly before. I'm a virgin, haven't even been in a relationship. I know my standards are probably too high, I'm not stupid, but I'm also not going to date someone I'm not attracted to. I'm the most uninteresting person I know. The only thing I like is music. I have no motivation to keep going anymore. At this point, I just want to die. I'm so tired of living. I don't care if things got better. I don't get why I had to be born. I feel like the only way I could work towards being happy is if I cut off all contact with everyone in my life, moved across the country, and reinvented myself. Even if that were possible, which it isn't, I'd probably feel too guilty to actually do it. I'm terrified of death but I've spent the past 3 years it seems trying to build the courage to actually kill myself. I really just want it to end.
