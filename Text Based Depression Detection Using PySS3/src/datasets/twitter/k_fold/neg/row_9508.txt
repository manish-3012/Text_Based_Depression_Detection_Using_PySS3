I've finally given upI'm done. I'm finally going to kill myself tonight. It would be best for everyone around me and no one would really care anyways. Those of you who even bother to read, don't. Just stop now. There's morphine in my house. I know where my parents keep it. If not, they have a gun that I can use, and if that doesn't work,  there's always the alternative of jumping off a bridge or some shit. This is it, no one will miss me that much anyways
