Feel so lost, wanna end it.Boyfriend and I split after 3 years, living on my own for the first time ever, unbearable displacement and started a manic cycle causing me the inability to think and act straight, was talking to a guy I met through a coworker, went out came back to mine and forcefully had sex, stayed the whole next day, been two days heard nothing from him, haven't contacted him myself feel like an ashtray, boss screaming at me called me fucking stupid, threatening my job because I can't keep a normal disposition. Please tell me things aren't that bad and I'm overreacting.
