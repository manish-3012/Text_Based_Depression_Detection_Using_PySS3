Please help, what's wrong with me?  For the past 9 months, I've gone in and out of depression. Some days go by where killing myself is the only thing on my mind, but I don't know why. So many people have it worse than I do. I have a handful of very close friends that really make me happy, though I don't see them very much. I'm not broke or homeless, and I have an okay family (though terribly dysfunctional and often distant). Yet I still lay in bed at night and wish that I could give up and cease to live. The only thing I can see being the cause of my depression is the fact that I rarely have someone to talk to and the people I really care about are the ones that end up hurting me. I'm coming here for help, I don't know why I'm feeling so suicidal. Is there anyone that can provide a reason for why I lack the will to live anymore?
