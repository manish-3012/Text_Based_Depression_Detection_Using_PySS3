I just bought pills and alcohol so I can kill myself tonightFinally, I will stop feeling the pain that I'm feeling, this is going to be easy. I got xanax, and alcohol and I'm going to overdose, and I pray to whatever there is, that I die tonight. I wonder what my mom will say on my funeral, you can read my old posts and you'll understand why. My suicide note is now below my pillow and my wrists are full with scars, I'm listening to music as I feel the closure of death near me. Thank you everyone for the help, but I have to move on.
