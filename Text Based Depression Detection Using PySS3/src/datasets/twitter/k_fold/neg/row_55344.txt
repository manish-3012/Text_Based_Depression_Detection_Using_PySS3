My girlfriend is suicidal and I don't know what to do.She has tried to kill herself several times and was almost successful a few times. I don't know what to do. She has tried taking pills, slitting her wrists, and hanging herself. She has been abused in the past which I am guessing is the root of her pain and why she wants to kill herself. She used to go to therapy and stopped going for a few months while money was tight and she got very upset that the therapist didn't try contacting her or anything and refuses to try going again. Searching on the internet just says to try and convince her to go to counseling or something. Can I force her to go some how? Maybe get her put in the psych ward again? She really hated being there but I love her so much and just want to help her. Any advice at all would mean the world to me.
