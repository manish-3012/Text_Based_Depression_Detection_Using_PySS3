How do you find a reason to want to live?I have no friends, a family that has so many problems I tried to avoid them, a relationship that I just stay in so I dont have to be alone, and I am going to graduate college soon but I feel I havent learned anything and will be buried in massive debt. Why should I live? What else is out there?Only more disappointment, sadness, and loneliness..
