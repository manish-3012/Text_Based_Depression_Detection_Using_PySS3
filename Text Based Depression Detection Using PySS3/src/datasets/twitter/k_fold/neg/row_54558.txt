I don't know how I can keep doing thisI am struggling so hard to hold it together. I lost my mom to a very short fight with cancer. It seemed like it swept in like a plague and took her before we even knew what to do. It took three months for it to completely destroy her. My mom had such a beautiful mind and loved in a way thay I cannot even begin to describe. She gave everything to her kids and now she's gone. I can't stop thinking about it and I can't stop wanting her back. It hurts so deeply and I just want it to stop so bad. Food just hurts my stomache, I have lost my desire to engage any of my hobbies, I am a shell around my wife and kids. I am so broken that I just no longer want to be here anymore. How do I live past thus? How do I go on when my will to live is so vacant? Someone please help me.
