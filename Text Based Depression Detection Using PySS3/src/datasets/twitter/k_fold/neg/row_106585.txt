planning to die in my early twentiesI'm a teenager. I'm not even in high school yet. 

I know it's bad, but I really just don't see a point in living anymore. A little while back, I told my mom about how I'm almost positive that I'm depressed (saying almost bc I haven't been diagnosed yet), that I self harm and that I'm suicidal.

She says it's only temporary, that it won't last long. Then she asked me if I was on my period or if I was going to be soon. I was like "umm no??" She told me it was just my hormones. I'd shown her my arms and everything. I told my sister before my mom. She was more comforting, but also said it was prob just hormones. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Everything is stressing me out. I know that I won't go anywhere in life, so what's even the point of being in it? I've already begun writing a note for when I die. If life becomes way too much for me to handle, I'll probably cut my life short before I'm planning to. 

I recently lost my razor, so I've grown out my nails and begun to dig them into my skin. This little rant/vent has gotten kind of long, so I'm just gonna cut it short. I just felt the need to tell someone.
