Can't stop thinking about killing myself.It is starting to turn into something I think about all the time.  I always think about killing myself and suicide.  My life right now is horrible and has been for a very long time.  I am only 19 but I honestly don't have anything to live for.  I have no friends despite trying my best to make friends this year.  I also have no job and never had a job in my life.  I also think I might be seriously mentally ill plus I have depression.  I am seeing a therapist who isn't that helpful.  I really think I will kill myself within a few years.  If things don't get better I can't see myself living any more.
