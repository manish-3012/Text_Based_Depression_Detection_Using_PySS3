Just tried to kill myselfHome alone, got a call from someone I been trying to be friends with, trying to take care of her because she is depressed, took her for lunch, talked with her, lend her money when she needed it, included her in projects so she wouldn't fail classes, I was worried about her, wanted to see her happy, I mean I've there before so why not lend a hand?. She told me she is not my friend and does not trust me.

For a long time I've been feeling like every time I start caring about someone, it always end up in me being hurt because they don't care the same way, they never do, why would they anyways? If there's nothing to care for in me, if there's nothing to love, the world is better off with a mouth less to feed, other people will fill the gap I left eventualy.

It was impressive how I started crying, but my body kept going as if I was no longer controling it, I took out a belt, wraped it around my neck and went to look for a place to finish the deed. It was like watching it from a screen in a first person view, I didn't feel anything, I didn't had anything on my mind but what I wanted to do, I didn't worry about who would find me, what would happen with my body, it was peaceful, knowing I would soon stop suffering, that is until I realized there was nothing in my house that could support my weight without breaking.

I started crying, tried to pull the belt as hard as I could until I got dizzy, fell on my knees and cried for a good while, the world doesnt stop for you, life keeps going around you, if only I had found something that supported my weight, I would be gone, I felt so much peace..back to drinking I guess, I'll come up with something, i dont understand why it is so hard for someone to listen to you, to understand you, to love you
