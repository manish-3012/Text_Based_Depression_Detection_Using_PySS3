I'm 22 years old and for some reason, I feel like I've missed out on so many things!I'm a 22 year old man from the UK and I'm currently at university, studying film-making. Lately, I've been in a terrible place and it's been having for six years now, I feel like I've missed out on so many things in life. I've never been in a relationship, I've missed out on those moments you share with someone you love. I've only got my family with me and it hurts knowing that no one else outside of my family cares about me. 

I've missed out on so many moments that you experience when you are young. I hate my life and I wish I could reboot it and start again! 

I want to hang myself so fucking bad and be in peace! I hate this life!
