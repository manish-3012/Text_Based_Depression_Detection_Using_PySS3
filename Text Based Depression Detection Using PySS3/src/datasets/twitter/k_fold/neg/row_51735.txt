If the early life is this hard, I don't want to know how bad it getsSome of you may remember I posted here a while back

Due to me neglecting my schoolwork from depression, I'm swamped with crap to do (Grade 8). I also want to add that this is on top of all the teasing I deal with on a daily basis (I'm a high-functioning autist), not to mention that I frequently hear stories of PC-infested colleges (something I'll have to deal with later on) If my life is this hard so early on, I don't want to know how hard adult life is. My parents are the only people keeping me from hanging myself with a belt or jumping off the roof. Antidepressants used to help, but not anymore. I'm a christian, so I've been pondering this question: if the second life (i.e. heaven) is so much better, why bother with the first? My father hosts a bible study meeting every wednesday, so I asked the pastor that always attends. He said it's a sort of "decision time." a time to decide if you're with God or Satan. For such an easy decision, I'm being given WAY too much time. Just get me off this floating pile of dirt already!

Thanks for reading my ramblings. Any and all advice is appreciated.
