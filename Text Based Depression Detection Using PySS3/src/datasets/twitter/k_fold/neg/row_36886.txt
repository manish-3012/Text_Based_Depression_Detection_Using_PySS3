If literally anyone on earth knew this about me, they'd want me to kill myself. I can't take it anymore.When I was in highschool I masturbated to pictures of naked children.

Not porn there was no sex or abuse, it was nudism pictures, but that's no better.

The guilt caught up with me and I stopped senior year and haven't since except for one relapse.

The guilt makes me want to kill myself, and there's not a single person I can talk to about this.

I've told two people in real life, both of whom were bound by doctor patient privilege. They were sympathetic because they had to be and knew I was suicidal but I could tell from their eyes they wanted me to die.

And why not? I want to die too. No one would love me after making such a monstrous mistake and action.

I can't even fathom why I did it anymore. It didn't feel like a big deal then. I knew it was wrong but rationalized that it was ok because everyone was smiling and I was "young" (pre-17) too. None of that matters of course.

One day it just hit me. The full gravity of the moral depravity of what I did. Ever since I've been consumed with guilt and fighting off the suicidak urges with distractions.

But what's the point if everyone wants me dead
