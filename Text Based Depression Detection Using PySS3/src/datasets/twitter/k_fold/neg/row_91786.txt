I think I'm done...I found out last month that my boyfriend was cheating on me... he broke up with me when I confronted him... ever since I have been reeling and feeling lost.... I moved out back to my parents.  I went on a month long trip abroad to find myself and now I'm back... I've had a week back at work and everything just feels useless... I loved him with every fiber of my being.  I've lost a dramatic amount of weight and people are questioning me.  All of my dreams have lost their luster.  I came very close to tossing myself off a cliff in the Alps but was stopped by another man hiking... I kind of wish he wasn't there.  It would have at least looked like an accident.  Drunk american girl tumbles to her death off the alps.  

I'm thinking of purchasing a gun with my next check and ending myself discreetly far out in the woods.  It would be painless and my family wouldn't have to walk into it. 

this isn't to get back at him or anyone else... I'm just done.  I'm done with the pain.  He isn't the first one to hurt me like this and I doubt he would have been the last.  I want it to stop.  I just want it all to end.
