Three strikes and you're outTried to kill myself 6 years ago twice but ended up in a very bad state in A&amp;E. I gave life another go but felt suicidal most of the time.

My girlfriend left me, I live in a place where there are no people I can meet or talk to. I don't have any friends close by. I got my degree but I can't find a job.

I feel really empty. I just thiught I'd vent how I feel here before I make anymore poor decisions. This time I'm hoping I'm gone for good so I can have peace of mind and not have to deal with this feeling of not being able to do anything life, not having love and not having anyone to talk to. I'm already fucked up and everyone keeps reminding me of it without trying to see the better side of me.

I hope everyone else is able to overcome there battles but this is something that I can't win
