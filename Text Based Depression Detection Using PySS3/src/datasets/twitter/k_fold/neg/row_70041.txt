AloneCan't believe that I'm going to be 30 soon and everything is still so crappy. I started thinking about suicide when I was 13 years old. I think the only thing that stopped me was the thought that everything could change for me and become better. I wish that I could say that it has. I wish I could say that thing have became easier. I've completely loss hope around 25. I have no kids, no career, nothing that I thought that would bring meaning to my life. I tried so hard too. I've always worked hard hoping that things will pay off. It hasn't and everyone is so much more ahead than me. I should do it I have nothing to lose. I'm alone. I sit at home alone on a friday night  drinking and writing this. The only thing that I had was a cat and he died a few weeks ago. Everyone at work loves to talk about all the things that they do over the weekend but my answer is always nothing. I did nothing I have no one to do anything with and no money to do anything. I keep telling myself that this should be my last weekend. Enjoy the few days and end it before work on Monday morning. I just don't know how. I want it to be quick and painless. Maybe I'll never turn 30.
