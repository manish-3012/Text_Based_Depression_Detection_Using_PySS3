It occurred to me today that pretty much the only thing holding me back right now is that I'm worried my mom will blame herself.I wish i could make her understand it was nothing she did, and there was nothing she could have done, but I don't know how.             
 
I don't know what to do. I need to end this, but I don't want to destroy her life.
