I keep having these feelingsOne day I am ok, then another day I want to die...

I have no control over these dramatic mood swings and the other day my bf threatened to walk out on me because we had a fight...

I told him if he was going to walk out on me, then take me to the hospital because I was going to kill myself. The scary part was that I was dead serious about it and even in my own mind it was a scary realization... he ended up staying and he held me as I cried

The past few days have been constant thoughts about killing myself and I'm scared...I need help
