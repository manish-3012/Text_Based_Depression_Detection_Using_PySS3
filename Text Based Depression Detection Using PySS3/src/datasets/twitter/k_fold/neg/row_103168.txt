Tired of disappointment. It's too much.What's the point of me living if nothing but disappointment and pain is what Im forced to go through everyday? Ever since I was a kid I've been living a shit life. Everytime I think something good is about to happen...it gets ripped from me. And I've always kept faith, telling myself it will get better. Now its 19years later and I'm typing this out with tears in my eyes cause the pain is getting too much.

I try so hard to be nice, polite, and look out for others. I'm always a volunteer if someone needs a shoulder to cry on...never had a shoulder for me to cry on. It's like I can feel peoples pain, I really really can, and it hurts. But I've always kept my head up, looking forward for a "good future". Not just for me, but for people who I try to help as well. My brother needs a kidney, he's on dialysis and I promised my mother I would find him one. It's been two years.

I can feel my mothers pain and it hurts the most. I try so hard to help not just her but others and I make no progress, just disappointment.

What makes it worse is I want to end it all so badly, but  I know that would absolutely destroy my mother. If it wasn't for that, I would have killed myself a long time ago...

I cant even keep my head up anymore...im in the army and a soldier is supposed to keep his head up. How am I supposed to walk with confidence and my head held high if I have no confidence?

Everytime I think something good is about to happen....disappointment follows suit. It's not like I'm not grateful for what I already have either...but what I have to be grateful for is my health and my mother...thats it.
