It would be so easy to just do it.Took my cat to the crematorium today. Said my goodbyes. Everyone's offered their condolences but I don't think they really get how important he was to me. He was the only ~~cat~~living thing I've known who really understood me. We were on the same wavelength. Now I'm surrounded by people but it feels like I might as well be on a deserted island for how connected I feel to them.

Everyone else in the house is going to be out tonight. There's a shotgun in the garage. It would be so easy to just end it. Everyone today talked about the rainbow bridge and while I think it's bullshit I can't help but hope that maybe Wheatley's there waiting for me.
