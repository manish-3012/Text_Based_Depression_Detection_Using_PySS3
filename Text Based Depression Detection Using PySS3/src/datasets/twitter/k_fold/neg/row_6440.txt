who cares anymoreI don't care about anything anymore. I don't have anything to care about and nothing to do. everyday is the same. We'll all gonna die one day. tomorrow or in 50 years. we'll die no matter what. this planet is gonna die. so who cares. I just wish  that it all ended now.
I'm so fucking tired. all I want is to disappear but why  
is it so hard. why is it so hard end it now. its all useless in the end so why do we care
