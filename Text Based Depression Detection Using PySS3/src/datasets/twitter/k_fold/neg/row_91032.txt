Thinking about just leavingGetting a few things and heading off alone as far as I can walk until the elements inevitably kill me, it's always been a thought but now I'm seriously contemplating it

Have spent the majority of my money this month gambling, suffer from a porn addiction and gambling addiction, I'm in debt, haven't paid certain debts in months, have bad arthritis everywhere in my body (got treatment so it doesn't really hurt but itll come back some day), rapid mood changes, dark thoughts , sudden urges to harm myself or harm other people, hate my body, hate my personality, hate everything really

Maybe I'll head into the woods and just hang for a few days until the cold kills me
