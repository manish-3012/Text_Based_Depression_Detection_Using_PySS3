I want to volunteer my services for freeI'm suicidal but want to distract myself with busiwork, just literally give me anything to help you with. I'm college graduated twice with a degree in criminal Justice which I hate with a passion and music business which I also hate, and have a disability in my back, cyatica so I can't stand or sit longer than a half hour at a time each. I'm getting disability benefit money soon but until then I want to volunteer for people so I feel like I'm a worthwhile and useful human being on this Earth. Please give me something to do that would benefit your life. Thank you
