A planI will probably be given a highly toxic surf next most. I am basing this on my previous symptoms with the same doctor who gave me the same med before. My therapist agrees that I shouldn't have it but neither of us get a chose. 

If he gives it to me I am going to od. 

It will kill me if he gives me that drug. I will take extras to make it easy for me. 

I told my doc about my mental health and situation. If it happens I may post. But they would kill me and that is ok.
