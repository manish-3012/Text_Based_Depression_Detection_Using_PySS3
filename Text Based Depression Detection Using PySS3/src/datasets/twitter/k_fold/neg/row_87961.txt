I wanna die without hurting people around meI'm in love with a person who doesn't feel the same for me and it's just painful, I can't help but cry alone in my room everytime. I've had never experienced something like this, it's not like I didn't try moving on but I'm stuck in a cycle now. I give up on everything and start again but then everything collapses one day. It's happening quite a lot these days it had been the worse experience today I was crying throughout the day. I can't force them loving me but I can't even stop myself from loving them. I just don't see any point in living now if I'm gonna be like this my whole life it would be waste of food and space. And I will just be this depressed person and effect on others lives. I don't think I wanna live anymore.
