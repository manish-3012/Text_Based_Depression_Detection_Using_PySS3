Girlfriend 2nd Suicide NoteHey  Reddit People, 

 My girlfriend and I (of 10 months) have been . She has a history of anxiety and recently her Great grandmother passed away. I think her anxiety is in high gear and cause her to lash out at me. I did what I usually do, having deep meaningful conversations and express my love for her. I tell her it's gonna be okay. 

 When we first started dating, I found a suicide note and didn't think much about this note.   I found another suicide not this past weekend.  We talked about the note, I found this weekend.  She makes it seem like its no big deal, but its a super issue with me.  

Some personal history,  A family member committed suicide when I was 19. I never fully came to terms and my pasted relationship. My ex-Girlfriend also was suicidal, I walked away from that relationship for personal reasons. 

I feel my relationship with my GF Growing apart. What should  I do?
