if you are feeling particularly bad one night, make a list of your favourite show's top 5 episodes and watch all of them before considering to harm yourself.my holy grail is 'how i met your mother'. the series has been with me for little over a year, but it's grown closer to me than any human being. I watch it all the time. I watch it in school, I watch it when I get home, during the day, and I fall asleep to it. the soundtrack is so utterly comforting and even on my worst nights (today being one of them, hello there!) the show always manages to make me smile and to give me the comfort that nobody else can. I rarely watch anything else. it has become so familiar (and not at all boring) that I can leave it playing in the background while studying and it actually helps me concentrate. in the past, music did this for me, but music rarely made me laugh again.

get something that gets to you and your emotions, but can make you laugh too. just something that disconnects you from the world and makes the imagination of it a better place. dedicate your bad times to this and you might be able deal with them better. 

[himym is an exceptional pick for that, actually, just recommending. I can't safely say that this will work for everyone, but as somebody who has been suicidal ever since the age of 5 and always needed a reliability, this has been the most important and impacting thing for me and I hope it will help just one person out there. it's not worked every time and I've had some attempts still, but, you know, you gotta try.]
