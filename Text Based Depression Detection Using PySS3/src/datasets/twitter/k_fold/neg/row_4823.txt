PlanningSo hereâ€™s my thoughts, if itâ€™s not gonna get any better letâ€™s go back to planning. Iâ€™m here for feedback. I feel it would be best to do it at the medical examiners office that way Iâ€™m saving their time having to come see me and I donâ€™t have to worry about who will find me and have to clean me up. The hard part is going to be keeping sane (lol) until then. Iâ€™m trapped in my head. I canâ€™t talk to anyone because no one can help me. I need to pull further away. The further I pull away the more Iâ€™ll probably post on here. Just because at least I will have an outlet. I feel Iâ€™m too far gone for help. Iâ€™ve tried to get help for 26 years. Iâ€™m still here.
