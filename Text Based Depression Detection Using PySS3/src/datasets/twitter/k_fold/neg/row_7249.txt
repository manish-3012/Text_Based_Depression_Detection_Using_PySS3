I think it's time.I could turn this into 3,000 words but I think I'll put this in basic terms chronologically.

* Mum turns out to have lung cancer from asbestos
* Mum dies 2 months later
* Go into a relationship with friend of 6 years
* Girlfriend breaks up with me "because I'm selfish"
* Ex doesn't want to be friends with me
* I don't have many friends or people I can talk to
* Tried attempting suicide 4 days ago but failed

I miss my ex-girlfriend a lot and she says she misses me too but she can't trust me. I deleted her number and her Facebook. My friend is still friends with her, I told him how I felt and he got into contact with her, explained the situation. My ex-girlfriend says "Just let him get on with it. He's just being selfish and thinking about himself again."

I won't go into explicit methods of attempting but I think it's frustrating that I can't do it. I want to do it, sure but I physically can't. People will be sad about me but I miss my mum and I want somebody to love. Somebody to hold me at night and tell me that everything will be okay.
