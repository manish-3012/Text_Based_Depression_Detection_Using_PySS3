My mom has been gone now for 6 months..she was all I had. I'm 45, female, alone, except for an alcoholic narcissistic man that pretends to be my friend when he has got some time to kill, or needs narcissistic supply, or needs somebody to knock around. I really literally have nothing and no one. I have sisters that I beg to spend time with me, by they won't they're too busy with their lives and always thought less of my anyways because I chose to live with my Mom so she wouldn't be alone. ..and she was my best friend...and she died in her sleep unexpectedly on August 7th. ..and i literally don't think I can go another 6 months of living like this... not just because of the pain, but because I have no job, and no job experience, and rent is due, and I have no where to go. The only comfort I get is thinking about falling into a deep sleep forever.
