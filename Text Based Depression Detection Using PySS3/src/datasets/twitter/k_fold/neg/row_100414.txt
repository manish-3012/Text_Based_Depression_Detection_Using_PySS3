27 years old, after a life-altering injury I find myself craving for suicideUp until 23/24 years old I used to be a strapping 6' 4" 220 pounds very active young man loving life, I changed my sexual partner every two weeks (some of the best girls in campus went through my bed) and I was winning scholarship after scholarship. I was successful and happy.

One night in a sports accident I get tackled from behind illegally by an idiot. During the upside-down fall my spine snaps at the neck level and I get a concussion too. 

Fast forward to me at 27 I have lost most of my formerly great muscle mass, I have excruciating chronic nerve and muscle pain on my whole upper body 24/7, have constant headaches that make stutter and give me bad brain fog, chronic tinnitus in both ears and on top of that also chronic depression, which makes me live barred at home. No sport, no girls and no fun anymore. Can't even work like a human being in these conditions.

I just want to die frankly, I can't do anything anymore, my life is ruined, the injury is permanent, I am a shell of a shell of my former self. I feel dumb and physically inept. Pain and chain smoking have become my only constants. 

I think I'll go for a well-padded rope hanging. The padding should make me lose consciousness faster.
