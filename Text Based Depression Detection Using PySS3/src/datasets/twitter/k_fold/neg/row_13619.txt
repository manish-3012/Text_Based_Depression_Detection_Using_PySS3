I have literally nothing to live for (cliche but true)Who cares about me. The basic bullet points is I'm a female in my late 20's.

\-don't make much money

\-am not healthy at all

\-don't date at all (because I am so not a catch)

\-don't have friends

I am technically alive but all I do is work then home. I have no life. I have no one in my life who cares. I have wasted my entire life up to now. I have lived so carefully that I haven't lived at all. Now I am done, this is not worth it to me.
