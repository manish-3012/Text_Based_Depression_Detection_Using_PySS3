I'm not making any sense. Fuck it.I guess I'm having psychotic symptoms because of my caffeine addiction and depression. I feel fucking delirious, like I'm about to blast off to space. I'm detached from my body and continuously on the verge of having a panic attack. I can't control the paranoia.

Honestly it would be great if I just died. I'm not in control anymore. I'M LOSING MY SHIT.

The world is fucked. Life's a meaningless rat race. We're not in control.
