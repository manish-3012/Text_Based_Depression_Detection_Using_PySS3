Somehow, I'm here again.After a bit of scrounging around Google and having the Suicide Hotline suggested to me multiple times, I came back here and made an account while I'm still alone in the living room. 

I'm a college kid. In the middle of one of my recent midterms last week, I thought about how it'd be like to die. Not really the *how* of it but more if I'd have to experience all of this all over again. In the following days I mapped out a plan while walking between classes, ignored calls from my parents, started blowing my money on coffee and games when I wasn't thinking about anything else. At one point, it struck me that I'd have to account for my little sister, too, and I figured that she'd be who I wrote to; I laid down a bit, cried, because she doesn't deserve having an older sibling commit suicide, but I don't think I'm strong enough to live on that thought alone. If I wrote anything to her, I don't think I could get past 'I'm sorry'. 

The rest is a bad compilation of depression, the effects of shitty parenting, and the fact that I'm a waste of my family's funds with every second that goes by. I wish I was better than this, or that it was easy to die, because the sheer fear of how painful it might be is leaving me in this crippling state of emotion. 

I'll probably go once I'm done with this quarter, and enjoy whatever's between now and then.
