No purpose.I've got my comp. science degree just as my parents have wanted. I speak english fluently even though I live in a third world country... yet, nobody likes, or need me... I feel useless. I've tried making friends and I'm a good person, I can talk about many subjects... I've worked so hard to get up here(while cutting myself to surpress the pain, since I was 11)... alone. I'm a man and I cry, I like drawing, this and that but... I was doing this the whole time in order to the world accept me, but nobody really likes me and I've run out of gas... I don't have enough energy to keep going, cutting myself isn't helping anymore and I don't want to start taking pills or anything else. I like to see the reality how it is and this is my life and things are sad and bad. I cry daily, I don't remember what were the last time I've slept well. I'm always in a state of fear(that's what used to move me) but that fear is starting to bore me. Today I've cried almost the whole day, I don't want to do anything. I keep creating imaginary friends which talk with me like a kid... why nobody will ever love me? :(
