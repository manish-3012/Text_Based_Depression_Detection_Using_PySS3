M28, I ruined my life beyond repairWhere do I start

I was born a loser, I spent 25 year of my life being fat (about 150lbs when I was 8 years old, about 300lbs when I was 18 and I peaked at maybe 350 but not entirely sure, maybe I was even more since i'm 6'2" and I currently look like a trashbag filled with shit)

So i'm 28 now, 182lbs and by now you could've guessed that i'm covered in excess skin literally EVERYWHERE (stomach, thighs, chest, ass, arms)

I really don't have the power to lift for 5 years to make my body looks slightly better, also I don't have the money and the effort to undergo a full body lift

I have also many minor cosmetic flaws, I started balding recently, I have a missing teeth from an accident, I can't grow normal facial hair

I have stable income, but it's not too much because I'm a failure, I don't have any qualifications, I'm doing physical job the money is fine but I can't really save up money

Also i'm insanely lonely, I lost most of my friend (not too much to begin with) since they have families now
I was never on a date, I never tried and i'm still a virgin

My mother constantly tells me to start dating but that's not going to happen cause of my terrible body

This is the end of my post, I really don't know why did I type all of this since I genuinely believe that my situation is hopeless, in the past 5 months I think about dying every hour but I don't have any plan yet

Well, i'm probably just seeking for attention I don't know...
Sorry for wasting your time, probably there are people who deserve help more than I do
