This is finally itI can't do it anymore, I've felt this way for going on 10 years. Everyone thinks they can save me, everyone tells me "things will get better". When? When will anything ever get better? Now I'm the most stuck I've ever been in my life, I'm stuck with a man who doesn't understand, who thinks I should just snap out of it. Does he honestly think I want to feel this way, like I've wanted to spend the last ten years in constant sorrow. If it wasn't for my beautiful baby boy I would have done this some much sooner. He'll never understand how much harder he's made this for me. This needs to happen he needs a life with out a mom who will bring him down. I just can't wait to not feel this anymore, I'm not even scared now.
