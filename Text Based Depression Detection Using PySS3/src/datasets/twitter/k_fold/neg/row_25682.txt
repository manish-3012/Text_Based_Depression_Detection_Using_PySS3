Not suicidal yet but could use a shoulder to cry on...I have had a secret for a long time which I wanted to get off my chest. Anyway I tried doing that today anonymously and realized just how alone I am and how there is no other human being on earth I can be honest with.

I just want someone to talk to and not be judged. I thought i could handle things one step at a time, but trying even the least in telling people about myself anonymously has hurt me.

I'm just really afraid and alone right now :(
