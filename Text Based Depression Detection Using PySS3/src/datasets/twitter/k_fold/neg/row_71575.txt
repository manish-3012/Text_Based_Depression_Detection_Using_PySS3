True story
I'm smart.  U can't convince me that life makes more sense than death. 

I wanted to end it.  Because I know for a fact it's all down hill from here for me And my family and the peace and harmony in my house. 


Details :

 jumped off an 18 story building and lived.

Note: I jumped off the 18th story , I did not fall the 18 stories. 

My left hand grabbed a rail just as I had jumped off.

  Like what...~~~ ?!



I'm all suicided out . I mean if jumping off the 18th floor doesn't kill me.  
Then I'm like one of those characters who can't be killed. 




Now,  my life is either going to be in prison or an asylum.. . Just wanted to share my story, before they take me away.  I'll have to live out the rest of my life,  like the rest of you unlucky bunch. 


I'm typing this because of the high of still being alive.. , when reality hits  . I'm ducked. (Lolz)
Like ducked ducked.  

Like ducked up my spinal canal ducked. (I thought saying being ducked up my ass hole does the gravity if the ducks I'm in. )



I guess the gourd my mom prays us more powerful then the gourd I pray. 


I ducking prayed to successfully jump off an 18th story building.  And it came true. !


Like fuck! 

I mean literally fuck fuck fuck fuck.. ( not freaking it)
But contemplating what the fuck Hurst happened to me.




Fuck not wanting to live or making flawless plans of execution.



But, why did my hand hold me back. 

Probably so I can type this story to you guys and then let the fucking up of my life begin.


Hope you enjoyed my true story .
