Iâ€™ve been thinking about ending everything for awhile now . Today was the day that finally made me say why not .I used to be happy 5 years ago. A perfect life . Good friends a great relationship a 6 figure job I had it all. All my friends are gone they just faded away for the most part I havenâ€™t talked to any of them in over a year. Today my significant other said sheâ€™s no longer in love with me . Iâ€™ve known this for a long time. Iâ€™m not blaming this on here at all and if she is going to be happier without me then I wish her the best. I just canâ€™t re start life anymore Iâ€™ve peaked and itâ€™s all gone down hill . If everything is going down hill then why would I want to stay just for the bad times .
