What's the point in living?Hello. 

My name is Nick, 19 years old, living in the beautiful land. The Netherlands

First off all, i cant kill myself. Tried cutting myself with a knife, but couldn't do it. 

But whats the point off living? My life atm sucks..

I dont know what i wanna become later on, thats why i did quit with school 3 months ago. To figure out what i wanna do etc, the only thing i love to do is Streaming my gameplay on Mixer. But my parents hate it when i'm on my pc because i dont think about anything. 

So they toke my pc back again, for the second time in these 3 months. 

Normally i also had a job, but i just got fired. Atm searching for a job, and Thursday i have a job interview. 

I just dont understand life.. how am i supposed to know what i wanna do for the rest of my life? Why are my parents taking my pc ( i bought it with my own money ) from me? 

Stopping with school was the biggest mistake ever, mainly bcs i have 3 friends in total.. 2 off them where on the school i did quit. And the other one lives near me, but he has exams etc. And i'm afraid to share my struggles with him... 
So atm i'm pretty lonely, execpt when i'm live streaming and 10+ people are watching me
