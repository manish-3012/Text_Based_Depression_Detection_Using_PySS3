A poem I wroteI won't blame Monika for how I feel.

Truly I don't know what's my deal.

My life has felt empty

My hope has felt shallow.

I pretend to be happy but I've been hurting for a while though


Life is meaningless.

I'm meaningless.

Im no longer saying get out of my head..

At least I'll have some company until I'm gone and dead.
