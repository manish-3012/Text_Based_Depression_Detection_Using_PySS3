Hearing people talk about plans years in the future is something I can't relate to because I don't plan on living that long.I'll hear people talk about how things will be 5-10 years in the future and I don't even think I'll make it half a month more. The thought of existing on this shithole for 10 more years sounds like something I can't bear. I regret not killing myself 5 years ago and I am tired of being alive. Nothing is getting better. Everything is falling apart and I can feel my grip on reality fading. All I want now is a peaceful death.
