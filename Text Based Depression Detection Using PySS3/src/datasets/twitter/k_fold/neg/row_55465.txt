I think Iâ€™m ready to goI just hate myself so completely, every time I think Iâ€™ve recovered some from my issues, become a better person, worked harder, learned more about myself and other people, gotten over something from my past... it turns out Iâ€™m still a complete fuck up and everyone around me would be better off without me. Is better off without me. Iâ€™m a mistake, I literally should not have been born, I think my happiness actually causes bad things to happen in the world and if I died, it would fix something or undo some kind of curse on the world. Itâ€™s been too long, 30 years Iâ€™ve been a blight on the earth. Iâ€™ll fix it
