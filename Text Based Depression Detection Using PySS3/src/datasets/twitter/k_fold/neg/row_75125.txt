Not in any danger just ranting..Right now my depression is getting to me.. I'm so tired of getting tests done and not finding out what's wrong with me I'm just over getting tested or sometimes not tested at all and just thrown pills at me and hoping it works .. I'm just so over it.. Sorry for complaining I just want to curl up in bed and never leave it.. Most resent visit to a doctor in a different town who didn't even really test me tells me it's my thyroid making me allergic to myself pretty much so this constant itching feeling will not go away ever what I was told.. The visit was suppose to take 30 mins getting poked and tested it was only 10 mins not even all he did was drag a thing across my arm and that was it. Sorry for wasting time on here .. But I'm just very upset and don't want to deal with this for the rest of my life.. I don't think I could.
