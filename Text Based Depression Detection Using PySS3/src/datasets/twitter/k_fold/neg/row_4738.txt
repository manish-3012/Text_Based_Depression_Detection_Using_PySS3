The last strawMy ex giving me the cold shoulder was the last straw, especially after all of the trauma and hurt I have been thru in this past year. I am tired of being â€œstrongâ€ or resilient or whatever and trying to make things better. Tired of trying to improve things. Therapy does not help. Medicine does not help. I donâ€™t have friends. I donâ€™t have family. I have been trying so hard to just make it thru life and itâ€™s become too much. Iâ€™m done. 

Iâ€™m turning 26 on Saturday and Iâ€™m not happy or excited. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been more suicidal than I am right now and I just want to not feel anymore. Iâ€™m done.
