Just getting worseLife keeps going downhill I hide her drinks, get yelled at, ask her not to drink, get yelled at, just don't talk to her, get yelled at. Nothing is going my way at all it's all in her favor and it's getting old fast I just want things to change I have people that i could go live with but she'd never say yes to it and if they just took me shed press charges, so that off the list. Again I could just pack my bags and leave. I'm adopted and wonder a lot if things would be better if she never chose me, would I be happier would I not have to worry so much, would I have parents who are actually responsible people, probably...
