fuck, i'm either horribly addicted to weed or super fucking depressed.I'm addicted to weed. I feel like shit and I hate being alive all day until night when I smoke and listen to music. I don't ever go more than a few days without it. I'm either a hopelessly lazy and addicted zombie stoner, or life really really fucking sucks and I would be dead right now without my vice.
