35 year old virgin, never had a girlfriend.Can't take much more of being ugly and alone. Everyday the weight  gets heavier and heavier but I don't want to kill myself (yet), What can I do to help my time here less painful. I work fulltime and have no friends/social life. Everytime I leave the house and see happy couples together it hits me like a punch in the stomach and makes me feel so pathetic and useless. I don't have the looks or personality for a girlfirend so I don't need any advice in that department, I just need a reason or a will to keep going. I fear that I'm gonna do something spontaneous like jump in front of a train or something but I would hate to put my parents through the misery. Need advice on how to distract myself for the time being.
