I Am A MistakeI'll never have friends. I'll never have a gf. I'll never be employed by anyone. I'll never make anyone proud. I'll never succeed at anything. I'll never be anything other then a fat grotesque slob nobody wants to be seen dead with. I'll never have amazing experiences. I'll never travel to amazing places. 
I'm sure, for most people, it gets better. They find people in their lives who show them they don't have to continue being hopelessly alone, they find a purpose, something to get out of bed for. I am not most people. My entire life has been a huge mistake, and I don't know if I can carry on living with this overwhelming sense of shame much longer. I keep fantasising about suicide but I'm so scared of the pain... of something going wrong and having to face people who I would have hurt irrevocably... of eternal nothingness... I wish something would just take me, a sudden illness, a knife-wielding maniac... something that takes my fate out of my hands...
