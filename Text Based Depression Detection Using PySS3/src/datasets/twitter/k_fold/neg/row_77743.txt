emptiness hurtsI've wanted to die since I was ten, I turned seventeen a couple weeks ago. Everything just seems pointless -- I have severe migraines all the time, my back issues are flaring up again, I've probably destroyed my liver from overdosing on painkillers, and my school will likely expel me at some point before I graduate. Nothing makes me happy anymore, there's just this feeling like there's a huge hole in my chest. I can't go to counselors, as they report to the school deans, and I don't trust anyone else enough to talk to them.

tonight really seems like the night.
