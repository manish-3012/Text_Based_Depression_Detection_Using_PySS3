I feel dead inside and completely lostI really don't know what to do anymore. I've felt dead inside for months now and suicide has been a constant thought at the front of my mind. I have the means to end my life tonight, a backup in case I were to wake up, and I know it would be 100% effective. I can't think of a reason to continue trying to live..
