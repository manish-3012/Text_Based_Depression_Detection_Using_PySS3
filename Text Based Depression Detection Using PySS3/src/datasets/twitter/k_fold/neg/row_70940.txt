I think I'm getting closer to the breaking point every day.I've been cheated, manipulated, abused thoroughly for the last three years of my relationship. I'm tired of being treated like this. I never even confront people who wrong me. I just shut the fuck up and mind my own business. But this has got into my head so much, I don't think anything other than death will fix it. I've spoken to people, they don't get how this has affected me. They aren't obliged to fix me also. I am. And I will.

Everyday I go to sleep with a blade next to me. One day I will snap and do it. It doesn't matter what happens right? I'm tired of being guilt tripped to stay alive. I've provided all that I can for my family. Settled most of the debts like a good son. I'm done. Actually my life is in the best shape. This is what I've worked for. 

But you know that feeling of edging closer everyday? I can now imagine how it is going to go down. I can feel the blade already on my skin. It's only a matter of time.

There is no ray of hope to guide to the path of joy. It's all an illusion. Life is entirely an illusion.
