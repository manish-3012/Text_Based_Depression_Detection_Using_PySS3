I don't understand.So been feeling very bad but Don understand why I searched for help and i got help but even with the support of those people and all the help they've given me I still want to die but im also trying to hold on but im not sure if I'll last more than October I'm in so much damn pain and it's not because something tragic happened to me If you who is reading this knew why I feel this way you'd probably laugh so I'm just weak really god damn weak and I just want it to end 5 years of suffering wich is about to turn into 6 this October.
