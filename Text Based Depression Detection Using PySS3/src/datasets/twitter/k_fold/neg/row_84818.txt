I feel like an unworthy trash can.I have NOTHING to complain about.
(For context, Iâ€™m 17, very nearly 18)

My family is very well off, I have a (really emotionally taxing) job that pays amazingly well, Iâ€™ve just graduated high school, I think I finally know what I want to do in college, and (as stupid and humble-brag-ish as it sounds) I was voted prom king at my schoolâ€™s prom dance!

Despite all this, every day I want to kill myself.

I believe I feel this way because of my obsession with failure. I lock myself in my room and think about my dreams being too big and how itâ€™ll never happen. Academically, socially, and physically, Iâ€™m the best in my family. Iâ€™m the smartest, the most social, and the most fit. I have no expectations to reach because Iâ€™ve already surpassed them. There is no pressure to be better, but I have an expectation on myself to constantly be better... Hereâ€™s something fun: Iâ€™m gay, whoop-de-do, but I fucking hate it. Iâ€™ve told so few people. My family hated it too when they forced it out of me to tell them. Now, itâ€™s not so much of an issue, and this isnâ€™t what is causing these feelings, I donâ€™t think. Itâ€™s more so that I AM gay is what the problem is. I donâ€™t care what my family thinks about it, I just hate the fact that Iâ€™m gay. I feel like I was set to fail from birth because of it.

Ok Iâ€™m rambling.

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m expecting anyone to say. I donâ€™t know what I want to hear because Iâ€™ve heard it all before. Iâ€™ve posted on here before, Iâ€™ve talked to a whole slew of strangers all over the internet.

I guess... what Iâ€™m asking for is... give me your best, but simultaneously most obscure advice. Something Iâ€™ve never heard before. Something thatâ€™s true to you, no matter how specific or strange.

I just want to know that to continue living would be worth it compared to what seems like a dark and cloudy future of sadness and loneliness.
