This can't go on foreverI can't see myself growing old at all, there's just no way. I can't hold out much longer and all I can think about is killing myself. It's not just a thought anymore, it's an obsession. I hate the college I'm at, I hate letting down my parents, I hate not having any ambition or motivation in life, I hate myself for all of this. I don't enjoy anything, my life is completely directionless and meaningless. I just want it to stop...why me? Why the fuck me?

I've been with a therapist and psychiatrist for a few months and discussed several problems including anxiety, bipolar, and ADHD-PI for which I've tried 3 different SSRIs, seroquel, and adderall. The side affects of all these drugs are terrible and I never last too long on them. The therapist doesn't help too much, after all how much can an hour visit every month do? I just don't know where to turn anymore. I feel I'm being pushed to the edge and won't be long before I go over. I don't see any improvement, I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. All I see is utter misery for the rest of my days, and I wanted out. I want out of this cycle and I'm completely lost.
