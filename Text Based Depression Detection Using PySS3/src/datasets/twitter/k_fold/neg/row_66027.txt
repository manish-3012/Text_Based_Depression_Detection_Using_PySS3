16 year old guy here. Having so many thoughts of suicideMy life feels like hell. I have been trying to be normal and fit in, but it's so difficult with my parents intervening at any possible point they can. I don't think i even deserve to be normal. I feel like i'm not wanted wherever i go. I can't even get a girlfriend. I don't know what to do. I feel so trapped.
