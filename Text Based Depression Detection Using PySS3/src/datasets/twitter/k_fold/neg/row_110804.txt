an old friend killed himself on mondayI heard yesterday afternoon. I've been just kind of stumbling through a range of emotions since I heard.

I'm obviously broken. When I heard the news, my first reaction wasn't of loss. Wasn't of pain. Wasn't of guilt.

My first reaction was "Good for you, bud, you got out."

I'm crushed. I don't know what to do now. I can't imagine what life will be like without him. But I'm also weirdly happy for him, *he got out.*
