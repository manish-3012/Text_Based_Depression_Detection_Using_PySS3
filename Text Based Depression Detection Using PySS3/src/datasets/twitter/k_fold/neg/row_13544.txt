I feel like I don't matter and never will.I'm so fucking depressed and feel so worthless. My boyfriend is great but puts me down every day in some way. He always seems to zero in on random shit I do and blow it out of proportion. I love my daughter but she's always clinging to me and sometimes I just can't stand being touched. I need care that I just can't get. I've tried so hard to get therapy but society doesn't give a shit about people like me. It was so fucking impossible to get therapy everywhere I went. The clinics don't care. I have no family support; my mom was abusive, my sister is a drug addict who I can't find 75 % of the time, and my dad just doesn't understand me. I feel like even if someone loves me, they will inevitably get sick of me and leave me. I feel completely worthless and like I will never matter. Nothing I do will matter. The only way I can matter is if I die. That's the only way people will care the way I wanted them to. I don't know how to get through the day. I take care of my daughter by myself almost every day because her dad works three jobs. And when he is there he is obnoxious and callous. He shows me no affection. I know one day I will kill myself, it's just a matter of postponing it as long as I can until my daughter is old enough to not need me. I'm trying so hard not to cut myself anymore but I know that if I could just do it everything would feel better. I just want to stop being "crazy." I want to have control over my feelings and my mind. But I have no idea how. I've tried everything and every day I just become more and more withdrawn, less and less able to look for help. I'm losing hope that I will every get help.
