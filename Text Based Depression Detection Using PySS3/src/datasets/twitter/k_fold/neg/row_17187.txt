I'm putting my foot down and ending my life today. I'm tired of looking for a job. I'm sick of being told no to this and no to that. I'm tired of schools explaining to me how I need more money to go to their school, money I can't get. I'm tired of anytime I do something to enjoy myself I have a feeling that I'm wasting my time and should be doing something else to better my life. I'm done with life. 

I can't afford anything and have no family left alive. I've been homeless now for 8 years. I bounce around from libraries and homeless shelters in different towns hoping someone will give me the chance to prove myself. Nothing ever seems to workout. There's ALWAYS a reason why I can't work for someone or go to school or join the military or even sit next to someone in a library. Right now this woman is complaining about me because "I look homeless". Don't worry lady I'll be dead soon enough. I'll be out of society's way as soon as I can. 

It doesn't matter if things did eventually get better. The only thing worse than 8 years of this is 8 years and 1 day. 

I just want to leave this up on the screen so this fat woman in the stupid looking flower shirt will know what happened to me. Maybe it will cheer her up to know that I took my life to get out of the way of people like her. She can have fun getting fatter and collecting small yappy dogs until her husband dies and leaves her with a ton of debt she has to deal with. 

Fuck this world and fuck the people in it.
