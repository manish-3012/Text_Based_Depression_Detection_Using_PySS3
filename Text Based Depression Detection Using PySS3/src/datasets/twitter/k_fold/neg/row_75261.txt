My head burns every time I think about suicide.I feel like there is a vibrator stuck under my skin on every surface of my body and its especially weird that i feel it in my head physically too, my brain hurts and my whole body starts to shiver out of nowhere and then the shivering stops but i feel very warm and my fingers shake my head starts to heat up(atleast thats what i think it is) i start to breath in heavily, but its cause isnt fear. I'm not scared of death enough to start shaking. Im a freak, I should really give it all up.
