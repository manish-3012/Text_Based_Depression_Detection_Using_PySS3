Gonna do it tonightWhy should I live? There I no point to anything. I donâ€™t get replies from anyone I text. I donâ€™t even deserve to live. There would be nothing much different after I die. Why should I continue to live. I donâ€™t have anything in my name.  I canâ€™t move out. Iâ€™m 23 and still live with my parents and I will have no accomplishments under my belt. Why should I keep going. I have a poor health just like my mom. I have no hope to ever get a job because of my stupid attitudes. I have no hope to ever finish anything. Iâ€™m just going to go out with a bang and hope that the things I have studied and wrote will be beneficial in a future. Goodbye. Thank you for the memories.
