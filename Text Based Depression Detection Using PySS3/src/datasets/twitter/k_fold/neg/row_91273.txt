Just got done writing a note. Maybe Iâ€™ll use it soon idk. Need someone to pour my life story out to. 16 is too young for this shit, donâ€™t you think?So many small things things just adding up and at the risk of sounding x-tra edgy I legitimately can feel nothing or everything at once with no in-between. Iâ€™m dissociating harder than ever and itâ€™s hard to think about anything that isnâ€™t suicide if Iâ€™m by myself not doing anything. Iâ€™m just so ready for it to be over. Waiting for an album from a rap group I listen to to drop this Friday before I even consider it. Iâ€™ve been waiting for that for a long time. Cleaning my room and nuking all my identifiable social media this week in preparation if I decide to do it I wonâ€™t pussy out before I can finish doing all of that. It was going so well, too.
