It's possible2015 was the hardest year of my life, so many suicide attempts, I posted here multiple times, I never thought I would be able to look around my room and see nothing but self loathing. And I am aware people aren't in the same situation I was but and I doubted it myself, it's so possible to feel happiness, one you never thought you would feel to just look up at the sky and smile. Your feelings are yours and are real, you feel shit and that is the truth but and it has been proven to me, you CAN feel what has been kept from you for so long. Happines.
