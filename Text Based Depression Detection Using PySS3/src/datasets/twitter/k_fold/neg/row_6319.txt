I'm afraid everything's gonna get worseThings are sort of looking like they'll get better but I'm afraid everything's gonna get worse. If things do get worse for me somehow I won't know what to do. I don't know if I'll be able to go on living. I'm dealing with a lot of different kinds of feelings right now. It's complicated.
