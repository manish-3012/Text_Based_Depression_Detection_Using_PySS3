I haven't eaten near anything today and I'm so proudI'm so proud In a fucked up way. I want to feel lighter and I want to feel my head hurt. I've had such a bad time recently and such a bad time in living.

Today was another bad day. But a plain shitty day.  I don't know what I can do. I don't really want to do anything. I just want to put something in writing and have someone see this who won't be able to send me to a hospital or a psychologist. I don't want help for the moment. I just want to survive till I'm eighteen and cam leave this shitty life behind
