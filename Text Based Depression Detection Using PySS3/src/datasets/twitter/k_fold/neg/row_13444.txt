Feel like my life's over before it even startedI'll start off by explaining the title: I'm pretty young (under 18; I don't feel comfortable with giving out my real age in case somebody recognizes this) and I feel like my life is completely fucked before I've even had the chance to really experience it.

I'm homeschooled and I really hate it. I'm not smart like a lot of you guys and I have difficulty understanding the material, not to mention the fact that I can't concentrate for shit. I've got exams soon and I'm almost positive that I'm going to fail most of them.

I've tried speaking to my mom (dad ran off somewhere, haha) about it but whenever somebody tries to have a serious discussion with her, she tries to make it a game, or just simply puts it off. She's a really wonderful person but her attitude towards anything remotely negative that needs to be sorted out is infuriating. I love her but I'm finding it difficult not to resent her at the moment.

I don't really have any friends either. I've got a few people I know online and they're really nice, but online friendships aren't the same. I have a real life friend but his dad's job requires him to move a lot, so I only see him once or twice a year.

I'm sorry if this sounds stupid. Maybe I'm just a whiny bitch, which would be fucking typical of me. I know there're people much worse off but I just feel like such absolute crap at the moment.
