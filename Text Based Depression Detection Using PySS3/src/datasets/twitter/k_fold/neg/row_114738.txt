Sometimes the only thing that stops me is the fear that I wonâ€™t see him ever again if I kill myselfMy husband died in 2016 from leukemia. 28 mother fucking days after we got married. We were already engaged before he was diagnosed with cancer and kept our wedding date the same despite the situation. He was in remission and actually doing fairly well, but then suddenly one day he goes from feeling fine to his whole body hurts and canâ€™t breathe well. The last day I talked to him was on my birthday (October 19th) and they put him in an induced coma and on life support. October 28th, heâ€™s dead at 12:45am after a massive stroke while he was in the coma. 

Iâ€™m constantly jumping around the stages of grief. Right now Iâ€™m mad. Iâ€™m so fucking angry that this has happened. Not only mad that my person died, but that Iâ€™m the one left on this hellish planet. Iâ€™m all fucked up and Iâ€™ll never be the person I was before Kyle died. I will always be the girl would husband died when she was 28 years old. Look at how sad her life is.

October was my FAVORITE month. Now it just reminds me of the 10 worst days of my life.

I told Kyle that I better die first (assuming at an old age) because I wonâ€™t be able to live without him. This was long before he got cancer. And now instead of maybe living 5-10 years as an old lady without him, I gotta go FUCKING DECADES? Hell no.

I have a boyfriend now and heâ€™s absolutely wonderful, but I still want to die. I donâ€™t want to be in this mental pain anymore. I want to die because living hurts a lot. 

I sat in bed all morning thinking of how I would do it. I wonâ€™t though. Itâ€™s too much work. I dream about a nuclear bomb going off or maybe Iâ€™ll get cancer and will chose to not get treated and Iâ€™ll die that way.

Another thing. I hate it when people tell me that Iâ€™m â€œso strongâ€ and I want to reply with 10 reasons why I am actually not. I mean, Iâ€™m here telling a bunch of strangers my sob story because I just want to talk to others who feel as hopeless as I do. I feel so hopeless and worthless and fucked up.
