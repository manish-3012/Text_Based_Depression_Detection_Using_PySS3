I'm diseased and in pain I've been wanting to kill myself. I'm 21, alone, diseased, and in constant pain. I injured my teeth so I have constant tooth pain. I recently had disturbing HPV symptoms and now I'm taking medicine that burns my skin for 16 weeks. I'm paranoid I have oral cancer and that partly explains my tooth pain. I've had panic attacks and wish all my pain and health problems could be resolved. sometimes my teeth hurt so much I fantisize about having them all pulled (but I've never had a cavity and they are beautiful teeth) I can't get out of bed. Help
