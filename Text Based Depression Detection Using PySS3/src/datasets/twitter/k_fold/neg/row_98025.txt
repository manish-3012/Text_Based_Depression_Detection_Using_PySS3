Just learned a good friend tried to commit suicide, need advice.Hey all! First off, thank you for all of you wonderful people that take time out of your busy lives to help people struggling, or people who have friends who struggle. Highly appreciated!

Nevertheless: A few days ago I learned that a good friend of mine tried to commit suicide, but he called an ambulance himself and didn't pass away. This came as a shock to me as he's a really great, happy, and funny guy. I guess that the statement "you never know what's hiding behind someone's smile" is greatly accurate. After he told me, I had a good discussion with him where I ensured him that he could always talk to me, and I listened to him describe the situation. Essentially letting him get things off his shoulder.

Even though he is alive and well, there is something that causes me great concern. He seems so fine with it. He's very open and tells people that he wouldn't consider great friends. If someone asks, he tells them. He doesn't hold back. Also, he is eerily comedic about it. He cracks jokes about it. a lot. However, he doesn't use humor to cover it up. Because if you sit down and have a serious conversation him, he opens up.

Does anyone have any opinions on what this means?

EDIT: Forgot to mention that he has accepted seeing a mental health professional.
