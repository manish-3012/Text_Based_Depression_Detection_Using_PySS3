For years i have been in the same placeI don't see it changing, I am in too deep. Just no point now.. 4 years doing noting, now I'm so used to it i cant go out and be normal... i dont see any reason to not end it. Only reason i haven't is because im a pussy, i know your just gonna say some shit top make yourself feel like you did some good. But saying the same shit that everyone else has said a million times means nothing, there is a 1% chance you say something useful for me, im worthless. 

I just wanna be high forever, or die. I wish i could go into a mental hospital but there is no info on the one i would go into and i dont know anyone from Ireland that has been to a mental hospital. fml
