I don't deserve anythingI'm supposed to provide for my family but I'm a fuck up and can't get a job.my younger sis got a job now.

I'm just being a burden on my family, asking for rent and food

I'm not even a good relative, cousins sent me money for a console to play with them like the good old days, but I rarely go online

I failed my uncle who took a chance that I can make it in Canada when no one else would and spent money, time and reputation to train me on basic jobs. 

My mom spent everything we had left except for our house just to send me here. We sold 2 plots of land for my tuition. 

 Having a hard time on school to boot. 

I don't have any relationships.

Is there any point in going on in this world?
