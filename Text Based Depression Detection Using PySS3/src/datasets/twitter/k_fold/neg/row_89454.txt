Update: There is no point.[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/67akll/whats_the_point/)

I'm still coughing up blood. Still in medical debt. Family still hates me. There's no point. Thank you Catholic upbringing for making me a coward and not ending it all right now. 

The fear of Hell is keeping me alive, despite Hell being another call center.
