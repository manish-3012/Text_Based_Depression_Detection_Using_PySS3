I've said this before, but i want to kill myself 

I've never been able to admit it until now. I always used to say I want to disappear or turn invisible, but I've come to terms with my suicidal thoughts. I don't want to go into detail about my situation, but I hate my life. I love my friends and family, but besides that, I hate everything about it. Ever since I was diagnosed with high functioning autism when I was fourteen, I felt like I didn't deserve to live, since I'm worthless, unintelligent, retarded and much more. Additionally, I've heard people say that autistic people don't deserve to live, their lives were over before it started, they can't do anything and etc.

Even before I was diagnosed with autism I dealt with isolation at my middle/high school. I was isolated for so long that I began feeling as if I was crazy, and I did the most strangest things like playing with insects, even though I was 13. I used to always sit in a small corner during lunch and recess, sometimes I used to cry and people never cared. Since a teacher told me I can't make friends by doing anything, I tried joining three groups at school, but all of them ghosted me after the 3rd day of hanging with them. I felt boring and uninteresting like it was my fault no one wants to be my friend.

I used to have three friends at my current school but unfortunately they both left, one went to another school and the other went to tafe. I still have a friend at my school and she's really great but she doesn't come to school often, and sadly I don't think that's enough reason to live.

I don't really know what else to say but if you want to ask me something, go ahead i guess
