This life could of been beautifulThere was once a time I enjoyed that the fact the the skies were blue, and that I had the ability to take a deep breath in and smell the fresh air, the feeling of butterflies filled my stomach.

It's all over, the old me is dead, laid to rest will all the memories of everything I used to enjoy, suicide is not necessary because I'm already dead. The old me is gone, this monster is who I am now. I have no control over nothing, it is fate, I must live this life of torture, it's over. I've realized that. Imagine losing everything, even who you are. Pain is the only emotion that accompanies you, that old but familiar sting.

What I would give to just remember what it was like to sit there and close my eyes and just think about how amazing life is, and the fact that I was apart of it. Bliss it was, sometimes I look back and smile, if only things could be like that again.

If only.
