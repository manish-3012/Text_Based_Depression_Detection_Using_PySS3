The therapist didn't want to listen to me talking about my suicide attemptIt only further strengthens my need to commit succesfully in order to make anyone care about me. I'm so incredibly done with people. I'm so sick of people telling me to "get help" when there is no help. This is what happens when i "get help". Some therapist who just wants to move on to the next client sort of half-listens, but then quickly shuts you up and sends you out as soon as more serious things come up. I've been feeling really tired lately.
