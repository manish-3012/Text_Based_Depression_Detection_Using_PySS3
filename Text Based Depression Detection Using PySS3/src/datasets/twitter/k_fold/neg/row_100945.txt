VentIâ€™ve lost hope for things to get better. Everything is ruined in my life.  I screwed up too many things including my marriage and work. Now I donâ€™t believe in anything. I pray to God but he never answers. I have family and friends who love me but I disconnect all the time. Move away when things got tough. Afraid of death but now trying to seek it out.  I donâ€™t wanna leave my kids behind. But the pain of not seeing them, the loneliness, the lack of people to eat with and be with on a daily basis, having no work and unable to type more than three words, all of this and more has pushed me to the edge. Every day I wake up and think about suicide and I read about it and watch videos. I just donâ€™t want to be here but Iâ€™m afraid to do it the wrong way and fail. I pray for a miracle today, something when I know God loves me and that things change in a positive way. Even if it is just my brain and attitude. I donâ€™t wanna be here and I donâ€™t want to move forward the way things are.
