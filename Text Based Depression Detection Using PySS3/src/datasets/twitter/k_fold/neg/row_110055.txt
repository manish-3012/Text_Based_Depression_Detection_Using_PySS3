Giving upI'm tired of all of this. I don't care for the kids at my school. I am mildly envious of everybody in my friend group having caring, cohesive families. Whenever something can go wrong, it always turns out to be the worst possible scenario for me. I have no control. I am bad at handling emotions. I try to never show sadness or anger but in reality, I'm frustrated and tormented. My parent doesn't believe/want to believe that my anxiety has gotten really bad and that I probably really need medicine or counseling. Not that it matters, but if you take anything from this, don't order your kids to "be a man" when they have serious mental health problems. That's probably fucked me up the most.

 I've considered/wanted this since such an early age--this decision feels about right. In all the pretend games I used to play, I was obsessed with the idea of martyrdom and self sacrifice. That's probably where I would have gone if I had a real cause. In fact, I wanted to be a Navy SEAL at one point, later learning that my uncorrected vision was way too poor and they don't let you wear contacts. Fuck that. I'm tired of trying to appease everybody around me. I've seen/experienced things that no 15 year old should. I don't want people to remember me. I am not that naive. I have had friends that killed themselves. A week after their memorial service, nobody really cares. People wake up and move on with their lives. I wish I could believe that there's something to look forward to in life. 

Bad things happen to good people.
There's no solace to be found.
