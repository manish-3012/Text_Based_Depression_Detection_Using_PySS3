She Keeps Asking the Impossible of Me"Smile" she says. I wish that I could lie to her so easily, but smiling would be a false reassurance, smiling means I am okay. Right now, not smiling seems to be the only cry for help I can muster. I hope she notices. Even then, how does that conversation go? 

All these little notes I'm leaving everywhere, posting to /r/SuicideWatch while I'm at work, not smiling, it's like I want so badly to tell someone, but only if they can figure it out for themselves. I am half as rational today as I was yesterday, when I felt half as rational as the day before. I feel like I'm slipping.

I have looked up a list of good places to go missing. I am lucky, so many places near me where people have been disappearing for decades. I could go there, I could make myself disappear just by walking too far into the forest. I am great at getting in over my head, anyways.

Maybe I should wait until I am ready to starve to death in the woods.

Whatever. I don't feel like smiling.
