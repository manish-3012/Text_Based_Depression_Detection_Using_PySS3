I'm not going to make it past 20.I sincerely believe that. I'm 17 now. I haven't applied for any colleges because I have no fucking clue what I want to do in life. I love music and video games but I'm terrible at both. I'll never be good at anything. 
I feel like a sack of shit for feeling the way I do, seeing what others go through. I'm so fucking weak. But I can't do this much longer. I feel so alone. I'm too anxious to talk to girls. Not like they'd like me anyway. I had my chance, and now she's gone. 
My family and pets are becoming less of a reason to refrain from killing myself, with how painful this is getting. It'll only get worse. 
I don't want to do it. Not at all. But I feel like I need to. I just can't do life anymore. Fuck.
