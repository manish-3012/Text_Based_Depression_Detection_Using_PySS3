Passively Suicidal - TRIGGER WarningThe usual. 

I stopped taking care of my body a while ago.

I stopped caring whether I wake up each morning.

Iâ€™m not really living. I donâ€™t fear dying. 
I donâ€™t care if I die.

I take potentially dangerous concoctions and live life on the very edge.

If I accidentally die, so be it.

Iâ€™m not going to actively commit suicide. But if the universe decides Iâ€™ve gone too far and itâ€™s time for the lights to go out, Iâ€™m at peace with that.

I donâ€™t care if I stop existing. I donâ€™t care if thereâ€™s an afterlife. Iâ€™m not afraid of non existence. 

I donâ€™t want those who love me to be hurting if I do die. Thatâ€™s the one downside. 
But at least I wonâ€™t have chosen to leave them. If it is a choice, itâ€™s a very passive one.

Iâ€™m over it. Iâ€™m drowning. Iâ€™m numb. Iâ€™m devoid of pleasure. Iâ€™m depressed. 

Each day I go through the motions of self destruction and each night I whisper my (potentially) very last goodnight. 

This is my passive suicide.
