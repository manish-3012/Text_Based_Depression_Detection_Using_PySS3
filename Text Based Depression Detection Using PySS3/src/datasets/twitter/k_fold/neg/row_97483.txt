I'm not gone yet. But I'm slowly giving up.Again. My fiance left me on Monday.  It hasn't even been a week.  I'm confused. I'm not even sure if we're taking a break or totally broken up.  She hasn't deleted me off facebook (not like that means anything). Not just delete but I'm still listed as her SO.   I've never loved anyone even close to like this.   I ditched fb. (what an evil platform).  We're not talking and my fb is deactivated, but I can't help checking ever so often to make sure she's not still there.   It's valentines day soon.  I know I seem like a moron but I know she has no one else.  I'm thinking of sending her flowers.  I don't have anyone else to send flowers too.  I guess I'm probably a moron.  I'm SUPER depressed.  It's just not good. I thought it might make me feel special to send someone flowers.  :/
