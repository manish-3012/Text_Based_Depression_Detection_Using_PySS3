i'm such a fucking cowardi have trouble looking people in the eyes, especially when they're angry. i just don't want to deal with anything anymore. people expect me to focus on school but i just can't because i'm so damn tired and lazy. i can't see any redeeming qualities within myself anymore i just cry and sleep and play video games. i love art so much but i can\\t bring myself up to do it anymore. i know my parents don't support it. i'm just such a fucking coward and  don't tell anyone

i have so many questions about my sexuality and the way i feel but i'm just too much of a fucking coward to tell anyone. i know that as a 15 yo boy in  high school none of the friends are ggoing to accept or listen to me if i come out. i feel more alone than ever.

i just want to do art and be happy but that isn't how the world works. i look at my future  and i just don't want to struggle to get there.

i want to die but i'm just such a fucking  coward.

i dont get it
