I don't know if i'm in a dreamI keep getting illusions that I'm not in the real world, time seems to be going too quick and people around me seem fake, how am I meant to feel reality? I've lost one of my good friends in suicide and feel a huge amount of guilt whenever I think about it. I feel like people never really like me and always hate me. This huge paranoia always takes me over. I always feel stupid and unwanted. it's been days now since I've been fantasising about suicide, looking up quick and easy ways, anyone help? tell me im not alone
