I really have no reason to kill myself other than the fact that I want to.Like the title says, I have no reason to kill myself. I come from a middle-class family that loves me, I have a masters degree, I have had girlfriends, I have great friends that love me, yet every single day I wake up and my first thought is that I should kill myself. I think about it all day everyday. I get stuck in the same mental loop all the time about how I should just do it and then I decide not to because of how much it would inconvenience everyone. I am 24 years old now and I have wanted to kill myself since I was about 12. I have gone to counseling and I have been on medication for depression for about a year now but I can feel myself finally giving in to these urges. I just don't know what else to do.
