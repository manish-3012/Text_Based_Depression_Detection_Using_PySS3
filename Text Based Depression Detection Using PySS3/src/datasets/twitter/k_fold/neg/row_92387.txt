About to suicide in the next few days... (hopefully)15.5 years old,

The cliche I had low self esteem and self hate since I was a little boy.

The little boy became big boy, really fat over the years.

In middle school the boy was bullied by the 1 strong guy who was liked by the class.

Little boy was bad at school, but over time he somehow got to a Computer Science class.

The boy realized after 2 months that he lost all of his motivation, didn't do anything, no one bothered really.

the boy failed and failed and failed and failed and failed.

The boy realized that he is about to fall out of the honor class to the lowest level class.

The boy was also interested in economics (the only thing kept him alive), and he did 1+1 and he knew that if he wasn't going to be a software engineer he is doomed to join the majority of the population which has the SAME real wage since 1998.

&amp;#x200B;

He had many medical problems which made him practically, unemployable at low skill employment.

&amp;#x200B;

The boy has decided a few months back to cease relationships with all of his friends because he didn't want to be a bad influence on them.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a relatively tall mall/commercial building in a 5 minutes walk from his home.

Tomorrow, on the 26/2/2019, he is going to head to the top floor of the building, and he is going to jump.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, the boy might have the guts to do it.

To be continued, or not........
