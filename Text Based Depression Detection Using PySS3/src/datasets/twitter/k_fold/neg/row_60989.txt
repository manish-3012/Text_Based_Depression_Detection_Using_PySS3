No job, no career, no moneyI'm turning 33 in 10 days and the only thing I can think is: I have:

1. No job
2. No career
3. No money
4. No "true" independence.
5. No purpose
6. No future

The only reason I'm still here breathing air is because my parents are still around, they are the only thing keeping me afloat. If they were suddenly gone I'd be suddenly "done". I have a college degree in Law Enforcement, but that was no help. A lot of times I regret going to college and wasting money on a degree that got me nothing more than a framed piece of paper on the wall.

Getting my aspirations and dreams crushed is a repeating theme with me.

I thought I had finally found the answer to this conundrum recently. I thought about going into Real Estate. Then, my friend who is actually in RE told me that it costs over $2,000 just to get into the job, and 6 months expenses because you won't start selling immediately.

Been at this bullshit for too many years already. If things don't change SOON I don't know what I'm going to do.
