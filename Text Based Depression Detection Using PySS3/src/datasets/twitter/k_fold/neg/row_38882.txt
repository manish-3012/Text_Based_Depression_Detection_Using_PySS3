I am feeling completely overwhelmed. I'm starting to get another panic attack. This is the third time this month I've though about suicide. I just feel completely unappreciated and...I don't even have the will to cry anymore. I volunteered to plan a nice party for my mother and one for my sister and I haven't gotten a thank you from either of them. I feel like there's no freaking point in anything to do anymore. On top of that I have 48 dollars in my bank account. I feel more and more like my life is a complete mess. I haven't thought about suicide in years and I thought I was getting better but I'm not. I just need someone to talk to. I know I'm far from the worst off here and I'm sorry for that.
