I am tired !I think I have had enough. I have been in a relationship for 7 years, with the only person I ever knew since I was 18. I am now 26 and I have asked for a divorce just recently. We lived abroad for 3 years, the least I could say is that the experience changed me to the core. 

My ex-wife and I had different immigration status, I was on a student visa and she is a legal permanent resident over there, I knew I couldn't stay indefinitely, there was no way, but I loved her. My visa did not allow me to get a job, but only internships, way too underpaid, and I had to rely on my parents and small jobs to make ends meet, I have broke my parents' finances. 
 My partner did not have that issue. I always had the feeling of dragging everything down, everything would have been easier if I hadn't been there. Every friend, every family member, hers or mine, have been telling to do my best in order to stay with her, and do my best so that she doesn't  leave her new country of residence. Life is just better there. But nobody knew how I felt, because I was raised in a way that a man is never to show pain, weakness or failure to others no matter what. I had to do my best to keep my head high almost all the time.
Everytime, I was told to hold on whatever I can until I figure out new goals in my life. 

I decided to leave, for many reasons, the first one is that our couple was just so disfuncional and we had a very toxic relationship, however, people say that mariage is sacred, in my culture and everyone just believes that I have to be there for her no matter what happens. I wasn't happy, I cannot describe how much I respect that person and how much I still care for her. However I cannot say that it is love anymore, that sparkling feeling just went off a while ago. 

She is very sad over this as well, and I realize it, for me, honesty is what matters, I was so scared to tell her this that I was thinking of killing myself instead. But I did eventually. And unsurprisingly, nobody could even process this. Everyone just calls me to ask questions about what I had just done, everyone reminds me how she feels and what she is going through. And the more it goes, the more I find myself choking because of guilt. 

Never in my life I had cheated on her, never in my life I had ever disrespected her, I wanted out because I could no longer see future with her. I feel like a cheat and I feel like shit. I don't open up about my feelings, or usually talk about how I actually feel or felt during those times. Nobody even cares, my own family do not support my decision, and I literally have found nobody to talk to even in my darkest of days. 
My ex partner was a very indifferent person to many things I had to say or share, or how I felt. She used to get mad when I tell her I was feeling depressed, and would say things like "You should be thankful for what you have, and you are with me". So I just stopped sharing, because it wasn't worth it, and I had to act right in front of her, just so that I don't ruine her day. Putting an everyday act is tiring. I was constantly bored at home, and for a year I was scared to go out because my papers had run out.

I saw some friends after the event, and at some point in the night, they went on telling me that what I did was cold and horrible, it was a horrible horrible guilt trip. On the way back home the next early morning, I wanted to drive into the trees and be done. But I am weak, and I get scared when I am in the heat of the moment, it wasn't the first time that I get scared at the last step. I was never able to do anything yet, but I wake up everyday now wishing that this day would be my last.

I no longer see ahead, I have been following with a psychiatrist, and I have been under Prazepam treatment since I had two anxiety attacks that landed me in the ER a month ago. But it doesn't help me, everyday I feel lonelier than before and worse, my anger just gets more and more intense and I can feel it, I am not a violent person, I don't and won't ever hurt anyone, but I have been in a suicidal ideation phase for such a while. I am completely on my own and I can't imagine myself telling this to anyone, even the psychiatrist. 

I am doing my best to stay busy and keep my head clear, especially with work, I work to up to 15 hours a day in a medical assistance company, I love the job, I love helping others when they need it, I feel great doing it. Especially with the ongoing pandemic crisis. But as I soon as I am done with it, my thoughts come back again. 
I never meant to hurt anyone, I never meant to cause so much trouble and I never meant any of this. Anything I touch seems to get f*cked the next day and I am just tired of this. I am tired of being me and feeling like this. I am tired of it all.
