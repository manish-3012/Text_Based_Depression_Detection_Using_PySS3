The Only Thing Stopping Me Is That Iâ€™m A CowardI would be dead by the end of this morning if I wasnâ€™t. I already would be, even.

I have a well laid out plan, that I can, and might, go through with. It would be so easy. I hate life, and yet something in me forces me to keep going, and I hate it. I would be happier if I could just die, but I canâ€™t. 

This entire night has been Hell. A rollercoaster of tunnels and sunlight while I contemplate whether I should end it all.

I am, after all, worthless. Human life has no intrinsic value. I canâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™m forgetful, everyone hates me. I said, recently, that I changed my mind about doing it. I wonâ€™t, I said. I learned something though. 

If you feel better, youâ€™ll probably feel worse in just a couple days. 

Iâ€™m ready to die, I have it all planned out. It could happen. 6:20 this morning. I just want to be dead, but thereâ€™s no easy way to have that aside from aging.
