Too much of a fuckupI am a useless, cowardly fuckup. If there was a way for me to just disappear, for every trace of me to be erased from the memories of my loved ones and friends, I would hit that switch in a heartbeat. I am a waste of resources and oxygen. I am bound to keep causing those around me worry and pain, and being alive is unbearably painful for me. It's been 31 years and it's been downhill for so much of my adult life. I wish to fucking hell my death wouldn't cause yet more pain. There's no way out of this fucking trap of an existence.
