I am nothing.Iâ€™ve tried therapy and medications. Theyâ€™ve done nothing. Iâ€™ve tried socializing. Iâ€™ve tried not socializing and just letting things come. I am alone.

I have no friends, family, acquaintances, no exâ€™s, no dating history. Iâ€™ve never been liked by anyone. From childhood to high school I was bullied severely. I am too damaged. My social skills are gone and Iâ€™m an outcast.

It doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™m a tranny freak. I have no connection to anyone or any group. I failed at connecting with a lgbt group. Iâ€™ve failed at work and college.

Iâ€™m not respected and the authentic me is ignored. I have loved others but no one is capable of loving me and I understand why. Iâ€™m ugly, anxious, weird and canâ€™t communicate well.

Iâ€™m trash and a failure of a human being. I will never be loved or wanted. I just get sympathy messages online. People lie and say they care about me, send me a message and then stop responding.

I was a waste of a human being and itâ€™s time to go. I have been rejected by society and can no longer be so isolated. If this were 2000 years ago Iâ€™d be dead. Humans didnâ€™t survive for long being alone and rejected by their tribe. Now that bear that used to kill us is a gun or a bridge.
