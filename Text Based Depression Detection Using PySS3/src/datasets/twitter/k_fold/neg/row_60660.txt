should i finally do it?it all seems so inescapable. depressed, anxious, suicidal, im in college but in the process of medically withdrawing because i just cant keep up with the work. i want to drop out but i dont know where i would go and what i would do. again, inescapable. i want to do it but im scared to do it and im scared for how people would react, but i already think everyone hates me so im not sure if i should care. i dont really care about anything. i feel like a coward. im really embarrassed at how my life is going it just seems like it would be easier to end it.
