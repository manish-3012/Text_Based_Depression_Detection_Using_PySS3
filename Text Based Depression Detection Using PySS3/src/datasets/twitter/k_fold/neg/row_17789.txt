I'm useless and it's better if she never knowsThrowaway because my wife knows my account. 

I'm useless, I'll never be able to get out of my head enough to make a decent life for my daughter. We'll struggle like we are now, likely forever. 

Fiance ignores my problems, family is too closed minded, thinks the depression cure is smiling. 

At the end of the day all my woes are financial. Lost my job (snowed in sli they fired me...) was relying on a tax return to get a vehicle (had been riding with someone before) so I could look for work, tax return came back less than 1k when it was supposed to be 7k. No job, no income, running out of savings (5$ in the account, could just say we're out). Live so far out in a rural area (staying with family because we have nothing) that without a vehicle there is no option for work. 

All I ever want is the best for her, my baby girl, the only reason I try to push forward. But honestly, she might be better off thinking me a victim of depression than a failure who could never hold down a job, couldn't provide for her, etc. Maybe I should just sign custody to my parents and disappear.

I struggle every day to keep myself alive for her, but in the end, I'm no good for her. I don't know what else to say. 

I want so badly to kill myself and make this pain stop, all my financial and relationship woes (the latter is another story entirely), but she loves her dadada so much and I can't hurt her like that. She's not even two yet, so I keep thinking if I do it soon, she won't really remember. I'll just be the dad that offed himself when she was little. She'll recover, she's got good people in her life. 

I try so hard to be one of them, but at the end of the day, I'm a failure. I'm useless. She's better off without me. She has to be because I provide nothing in terms of her sustainability.
