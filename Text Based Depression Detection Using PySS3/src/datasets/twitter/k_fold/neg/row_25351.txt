I thought a vacation would clear my head but Iâ€™m still feeling like crapI went on a vacation with my family to a whole different country and it was great but it wasnâ€™t enough to make me happy Iâ€™m still a piece of trash and I still deserve to die. Iâ€™m stuck in love with a girl who hates me and the sooner I die the easier it is for everyone else
