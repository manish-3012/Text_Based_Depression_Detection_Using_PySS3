Suicidal friend and how to deal with them?My name is Andy, I have a suicidal friend named Eric, we have been friends for a while now, almost going on 8 years. He's a great guy, just has terrible luck in life. I met him through a friend of mine when they were dating. Well turns out a few months ago, almost a year, they broke up. He attempted suicide and was taken to a hospital, from there his dad brought him back to Mi. When he got out it seemed his life got better, he found a stable job and was working great, enough to support himself. Well he offered me a chance to move from Kentucky to Mi. and I jumped on it. Everything was fine and I noticed that he still wasn't over his ex. More time passed and he lost his manager job for his anger issues. Didn't notice he had an anger issue and then everything started to make sense, I believe he is bipolar. Anyways, after he got fired, he wouldn't stop messaging his bosses about how his life was a wreck from getting fired, eventually he made a remark about his boss and how he wanted to kill him, he also went on about killing himself and how when they institutionalized him put him in debt. A few days after getting fired, he wrecked his car completely and still hasn't finished the payments on it. He recently told me he is hearing voices and that he doesn't feel comfortable hearing them. I'm afraid. Afraid for myself and my friend. I want him to get better I want him to succeed in life. I feel with each day that goes by he loses hope in life and is close to suicide. I want to give him help, like tell someone so they can institutionalized him and get him help! Thing is I know he will hate me most likely never speak to me again. I don't want to lose my best friend but I don't want to come home one day with the best dank in the world and find my  best friend dead. What should I do?
