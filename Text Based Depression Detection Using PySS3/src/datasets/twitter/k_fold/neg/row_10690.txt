Why not?Idk what I really want from this post, I guess I just want advice or something idk.
Im 16 and Iâ€™m the classic problem child. Mediocre-bad grades, caught with drugs multiple times, disrespect my parents cause Iâ€™m a depressed asshole, etc.
On top of that, my brother, while I love him a lot, is everything Iâ€™m not. Straight Aâ€™s, got a full scholarship to an honors program at a college in la, nice, great relationship to my parents, bright future.
Also I donâ€™t have any motivation for literally anything including the things that used to bring me joy, like writing and whatnot. Even school, I literally donâ€™t care anymore.
And I think my friends donâ€™t like me very much cause Iâ€™m annoying. I donâ€™t even know what I want to do, and I just really donâ€™t wanna see what the future has in store, cause I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll be good.
I havenâ€™t told anyone how I feel except my therapist, who I didnâ€™t even tell him everything because Iâ€™m really afraid heâ€™ll tell my parents or put me on meds or put my in a ward or whatever, but heâ€™s gonna see me once a week to work with me but idk if I can do that tbh. And I donâ€™t really want to tell my parents or my friends cause Iâ€™ll feel like Iâ€™ll be doing it for attention and our relationship will change and not necessarily for the better.
Want to somehow get a gun and end it just to grant myself bliss, but Iâ€™m really scared to and Regardless of how much I want to idk if I can go through with it.
Sorry for the long ass post but I just need to get my feelings out somewhere and I couldnâ€™t really think of another place.
