Never thought Iâ€™d be posting hereLet me start by saying I feel really pathetic doing this. Always knew Iâ€™d probably end up dying at my own hand, whether suicide or much more predictably a drug overdose after many years of heroin abuse. I donâ€™t entirely know why Iâ€™m writing this yet. Maybe help? Encouragement? I donâ€™t know. I think itâ€™s just to get this all of my chest because I canâ€™t talk to anyone else. Iâ€™m scared but Iâ€™m not sure of what. I donâ€™t want to die exactly, but even more so I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore. 

A little about me. I am male, 24, Canadian. Grew up with loving parents but thereâ€™s always been something a little off with me. Since I was young I struggled with anxiety and later depression, as well as misophonia, which without going into too much detail is a hatred of sound. Certain sounds. Chewing, breathing, sandals, dishes, you name it, if itâ€™s repetitive it probably bothers me. I havenâ€™t had dinner with my family since I was 7 without it being a struggle to cope, and even then only on very special occasions where I had no choice lest to let guests discover my condition. I hate to list of all my disorders like some angsty teen; I am diagnosed with PTSD, as I was sexually abused over a period of two years by a friends step father when I was 7-8ish. This led to me being very withdrawn and while Iâ€™ve never really admitted it, I got bullied pretty bad in school. It sorta stopped after I stabbed a kid with a pen but then I became the bad kid and nobody wanted me around anyways. Thatâ€™s when I really got into drugs. Ever since I was 10 I had been huffing solvents and drinking mouthwash to get a buzz, then by 12 I was stealing weed from my grandpa and booze and pills from my grandma. By 14 I developed a liking, and then 12 year addiction to opioids, specifically heroin. Which brings me to where we are now. 

For years I struggled with my heroin addiction, mental health and overall loneliness. About 2 years and 3 months ago I got stable and on methadone. It was the best Iâ€™ve ever done. Over the next year and a half I got my licence, went back to school, started collecting and breeding reptiles again, and most importantly met the girl of my dreams. Nothing has ever made me as happy as she did. All I ever wanted was to be loved, and this was it. Everything I ever wanted. She is to this day, absolutely perfect. But Iâ€™m not. I fucked it up. I took her for granted. I relapsed. I used around her. I scared her off. The best thing that ever happened to me, and I fucked it up for good. Because of drugs and mental illness. 

I know Iâ€™ll never be normal or have the life my mom wanted for me. I know Iâ€™ll never have the life I wanted. Iâ€™m a coward and a selfish asshole. Iâ€™m glad she got away from me, because I would have just dragged her down with me. I love her so much and itâ€™s taken me so long to let go. I donâ€™t want to keep hurting her, which I know will happen again no matter how much I love her. I donâ€™t want to keep hurting my family either. She told me today that she still loves me. I know it will never work again between us. But her telling me she still loved me, well it gave me the courage to do what I need to do. I can go in peace now. I donâ€™t have to worry about my pride or thinking Iâ€™d die having her hate me. I donâ€™t want to leave like that. She hadnâ€™t talked to me in two months and finally she did, and while it was never going to play out how I hoped, this gives me peace. I thought we would get married and have kids. Maybe 19 months isnâ€™t long to some people but to me, it was a lifetime. Time I shouldnâ€™t have had anyways. It was a second chance. I want to leave this earth while thatâ€™s still fresh in my mind. I want to leave while she still loves me. I want this to be the last pain I cause anyone. 

Thereâ€™s so much more I wanted to say but I canâ€™t think of it all now. I have a lot of letters to work on. My mom and dad, my papa, my best friend Curtis and my friends that have supported me through all the drugs and bullshit and nonsense Iâ€™ve put them through. I feel so guilty because Iâ€™m leaving behind a sizeable collection of snakes, geckos, frogs etc but I canâ€™t physically care for them to the best of my ability now anyways because I am crippled by depression and hopelessness. I donâ€™t want to hope. Iâ€™m loyal, and I love with all my heart. I refuse to move on from this. I refuse to keep causing my loved ones more pain though. Iâ€™m not pulling my end. I am leaving behind several thousand dollars, my car, a detailed care guide for my animals and I guide to rehome most of them as quickly as possible. Thatâ€™s the best I can do. I plan on leaving my letters to everyone but my love in a notebook on my bed, with my cell phone. Iâ€™m going to leave my suicide letter to the girl I love more than anything at the front door to her work. I know exactly when Iâ€™m going to do this. Then Iâ€™m going to drive out to a place that is special to me since I was little, and also meaningful to my relationship with her. Thatâ€™s where I am choosing to die. I will hang myself from a beautiful tree there. I had originally wanted to go out with a massive shot of heroin. But it doesnâ€™t feel right. Iâ€™ve never done anything sober, but this feels like the one thing that has to be done sober. I want it to be clear I made this choice out of love for my family and friends and for her. She is the love of my life. I canâ€™t hurt her anymore. I donâ€™t want to keep doing this. Iâ€™m tired of letting down the ones I love. 

I guess I want this to be a testament to how I feel so atleast somebody in this world will understand and get why I did what I did. I know itâ€™s a little selfish. But itâ€™s the best I can do. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to get caught before I can do this. With my misophonia Iâ€™m so scared Iâ€™ll get locked up involuntarily in a psych ward and be unable to cope or to leave when the noises start eating away at my sanity. Iâ€™m terrified Iâ€™ll be too scared. I need to do this now instead of thinking about it. I need to go before she forgets about me. I need the words â€˜I love you tooâ€™ to be fresh in my head to go through with this. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Even if it gets better, I donâ€™t want it to without her. I donâ€™t expect anyone to understand. I know how special what we had was. I know it was a once in a lifetime thing for me. But I need to go. This is the end of my story. Please bear witness. Please donâ€™t be sad. Please donâ€™t ask me to rethink. I wonâ€™t see any of your replies. 

Thanks for listening. I donâ€™t have anyone else. I feel so broken thinking that the only thing I have to look forward to is my death. I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore.
