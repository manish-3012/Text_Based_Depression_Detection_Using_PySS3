ThingsEndFinancial issues, emotional issues, about to be homeless. My family is always screwing me at every turn and the only thing I have to get up for right now is my grandmother whom I help out on a daily basis. Nobody wants to hire me despite me applying for jobs daily and spending large amounts of time trying to follow through. I feel like I'm too far gone to go back to school. Friends are avoiding me and I don't even feel a part of the group anymore. All everything does is makes me realize how futile life is. There's no point. Everything ends, but until then, the world is progressively becoming a shittier place. I've noticed a trend where every year I am less happy then the last. I have the occasional small bump where my mood feels better, and then month-long divots that always leave me slightly worse off. I haven't been sleeping well and I'm getting less healthy every year. If I'm going to inevitably die, why suffer along the way?
