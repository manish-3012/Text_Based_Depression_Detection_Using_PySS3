Hey, I need to vent. Or something.I have no life. I feel like I never started. I eat; I throw up. I sit around and pick my skin. I have no self-worth, no sense of self outside of being "crazy." Others try to connect with me, and they're true gifts in every sense, but I stick to my guns and insist on my worthlessness, stuck in my one room pity party. I cannot love them as they love me. I haven't tried to work in years. I dropped out of school. I pretend to have a place in the world, and apparently come across as smart and competent, but I contribute nothing, and have no desire to. I forget that wonderful people and things exist, and I withdraw. I make the token effort, but don't stick it through. My family isn't alright. Nothing's going to be okay. I try to get back to the basics, to nurture myself, but nothing works, and I'm left with my eating disorder. I don't turn to other substances because I know in my heart it's all the same, and I won't feel any different no matter what I do.

My ideations are getting more vivid and specific and my boundaries seem weaker than they used to. I'm scared I'm going to kill myself when I'm at my weakest.
