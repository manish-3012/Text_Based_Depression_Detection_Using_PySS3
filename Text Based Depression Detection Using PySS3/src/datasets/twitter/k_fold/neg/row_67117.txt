I just don't see the point in life, it's made out to be the wonderous thing, but it just isn't and some people can't seem to see that.I'll start by asking a question, what is the point of life to you reading this? Everyone seems to have different answers to this question, but none seem right too me. 

I'm 18 years old and have had depression for the past two years or so. I am overweight and originally believed that to be the reason for my depression. I started going to the gym and eating more healthier as a way to combat this, and have actually made amazing progress so far. I'm still unhappy though, so that clearly wasn't my issue. I can't believe I'm so naive that I thought that was the only thing wrong. 

I am currently in my second year of college in the UK (pretty much dropped out at this point, haven't attended for a while now) and as the days go on, I'm discovering how useless the thing we call life is. I've failed my education, I'm struggling to find a job, and I have no money to my name whatsoever. All around me I see successful people, and I fucking hate it so much. I have so much envy for others. I wish I could be those people but it's just not a possible thing for me anymore, I tried. 

I've given up caring these days and nobody I speak to seems to understand that. I wouldn't mind dropping off the planet right now and being at peace finally, but I still feel as though there is hope for me, I just need to find out what life means to me. That's the issue at hand. 

Maybe my time may come soon. Maybe later on in life. I just wish something would take me away now, so I don't have to deal with my thoughts and feelings...
