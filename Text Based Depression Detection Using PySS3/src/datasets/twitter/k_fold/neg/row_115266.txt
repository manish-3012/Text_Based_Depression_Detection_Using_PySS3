The only thing stopping me is the pain that it would cause my family.I've been thinking about it for a long time now. It got worse two weeks ago, when I got drunk and sent some awful messages to a person that I've been literally obsessed with for four years. I've never been more ashamed of anything in my life. I just want to end it all, but I can't, because of the pain it would bring to my family. I know I need help, but I can't ask for it, because I'm just so ashamed of myself.
