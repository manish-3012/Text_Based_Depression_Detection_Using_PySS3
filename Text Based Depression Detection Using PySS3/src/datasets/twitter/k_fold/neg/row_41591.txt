Really bad shapeI'm very much down on my luck with all going with covid and family situation. I hate asking this and if wrong sub please point me to those that are allowed. My cash app is $abstractv3 I hate asking for help in person or online but I'm at the end of my road with the load on me that don't think I can stretch it. I only need a few empathically inclined people to make huge effect on my life right now. I just can't take a week off eating so my mom come. And I'm disabled alone with being diabetic. I plead anyone who can help a kid/young adult who's never asked for anyone to help but I truly need it. Over the last few months suicide has seemed to inch its way close to to be done with this misery. I truly appreciate if anyone could donate. Please have empathy for someone who always it on. Once again it's cash app and my name $abstractv3, sincerely hope karma comes around for you in need
