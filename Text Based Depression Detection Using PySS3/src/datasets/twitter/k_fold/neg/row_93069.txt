Dear youI know it's a cliche, but I am so tired. Tired of being scared. Tired of being sad. Feels like I'm only half alive. Other half's gone somewhere. I wish I could go, too. 

The fact of the matter is I am deeply in love, and I wish I wasn't. I wish I never met him, because I am going to lose him. And I sleep with that knowledge everyday. I feel his hands wrap around mine and I feel scared. I look over at him watching TV and a deep sadness wells up inside me. I'm so scared. He doesn't know what it's like to live in fear, to live like this. I'm always afraid that I will lose his love. Always been. They say that it's unhealthy, but it's the only feeling I know. 

We met shortly after I got discharged from the hospital. He gave me a reason to live. I love seeing his face everyday, sleeping next to him, waking up next to him, watching him play with the cat. Sometimes I don't even think about how much it hurts, because it makes me so happy. 

Yesterday the cat delivered some nasty scratches to my arm, and he washed them carefully with his handkerchief. I don't think I have ever experienced a love like this. But I'm so scared of losing it. It's been going well lately. We stayed home and watched Netflix all day last night. He made us dinner. I thanked him and kissed him on the lips. 

I think I have told him before that I would be dead young. It's not something I am consciously planning, but I won't say no if Death offered me a ticket. 

I love him too much, and I never want to lose him. That's why I must go before it happens. I want to go knowing that I am loved, before I lose everything. I love him too much, that's why I need to go. 

My last memories will be good. 

Thank you.
