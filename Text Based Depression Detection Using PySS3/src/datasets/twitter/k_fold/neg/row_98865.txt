I think it would be better if I died than if I stay aliveLike the title says, I really think it would be best if I die than if I stay alive. I'm a 16 year old girl and I'm the worst person I know. Pretty much all I do is hurt people. I'm nice to some people, but when I really get to know someone and I've known them for a while I end up eventually hurting them too.

I wasn't planning on going into more detail when I started typing this post, but I will. I'm 16 and I've been violent and abusive for half my life. My parents are perfect to me and they love me but I just keep hurting them anyway. I'm physically violent (and I have been since I was seven) and there's no reason for it and I can't do anything about it. I'm going to end up killing one of them, I'm sure, and I won't mean to but it will be accidental. Just because I'm a girl doesn't mean I don't hurt them. I do. They're older parents and not much bigger than I am, so it's easier than it should be to hurt them. 

I hate myself because I beat them up (give them bruises, I've broken their bones, punched them as hard as I can in the face, and I'm very verbally abusive too) and I can't stop beating them up. It just happens and sometimes I try not to but it's too late anyway. I was so happy these last two, almost three, months because I got along with my family for once. That's a new record for me--two months without being such an abusive bitch. But then today happened. I can't give too much detail just in case anyone I know sees this (though it doesn't really matter, everyone I know knows how I am anyway) but I got slightly violent today, as I have been for the last two or three days. I didn't exactly beat anyone up, but I was violent.

As you can tell from reading this, I really have some problems and I think it's best if I'm not around anymore. I've tried to control myself for eight years now and nothing's working. I've been to counselors and psychologists and psychiatrists but nothing's helping. I hate myself and I'm disgusted with the way I am and I don't know what to do about it other than just ending it. At least my family wouldn't be hurt by me anymore, nor would anyone else in the future. I don't have any immediate suicidal plans, but I am considering it. I just hate myself so much and I think I take it out on other people.
