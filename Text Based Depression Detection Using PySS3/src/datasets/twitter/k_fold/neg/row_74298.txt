Iâ€™m doneA lot of peopleâ€™s last memory of me will be a fight, or me having a bad day, or them cancelling plans on me. A lot of people will feel bad. But they also wonâ€™t miss me. They wonâ€™t really care about me being gone, because they donâ€™t really about me now. Theyâ€™ll be upset about how it reflects on them.

More proof that I should be gone.
