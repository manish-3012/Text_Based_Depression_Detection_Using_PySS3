I'm useless.I tried. If only I wasn't such a fuck up. I can't go outside, I can't get a job, I keep hurting friends/family etc. I break everything and all that because of my trauma, social anxiety and depression. The more people try to help me the more I realise I'll never accomplish anything. It just makes me feel worse when they tell me to believe in me. Thinking about killing myself all the time. I'll do it sometime this year for sure. I'm done with everything.
