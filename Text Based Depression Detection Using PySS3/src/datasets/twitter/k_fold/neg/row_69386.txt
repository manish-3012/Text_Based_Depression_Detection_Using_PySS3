I wish I was born somewhere else.U might think this guy is so stupid, but listen. I was born in India, literally the shittiest country(no offence to any Indian).The people are soo bad, there is absolutely no cleanliness, and worst over population.
My father was very abusive with my mother. Always used to beat her, and me and my elder sister were always scared of him. My mother committed suicide when I was 15 (year 2015). Since then l am always sad. My father remarried to my stepmom. And she just treats me like shit. Never have I ever felt a part of this family. She always cussed and me and my sis. Because of all this, my sister got a degree and left.
Now since 2 years I am alone without any friends, no one. I m almost at the end of 12 grade. And let me tell you something In India everytime a child is born, the middle class parents thinks either he will be a doctor or engineer. After 12 there are exams Jee( Joint entrance exam) for engineering and NEET for doctors. 1200000 students sit and only 10000 qualify. The pressure is to much, because of the population we have to compete and every parent thinks that it is easy. I think about suicide almost everyday, but I won't do it. I don't have any friends, none of my parents think about me. I just feel trash. I wish I was born In Us. I hope someday I get out of this country and never come back.
