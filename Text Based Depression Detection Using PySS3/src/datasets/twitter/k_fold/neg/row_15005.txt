Violent dry heaving. anxiety and chronic depression.I don't want to be here anymore, I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm alone and no one understands me. I'm constantly misunderstood and I don't know who I am. I'm constantly dry heaving and I held in vomit last light as I sat on the toilet crying. When do I get to be happy? When do I get to be the one that has a smile on her face? People constantly tell me I look angry, it's because I am. Im angry at the life I was given and I want it gone, banished. I have no one. Constant dry heaving is making me insane, relationship problems, me being constantly misunderstood, me constantly being told I'm doing something wrong wrong wrong by EVERYONE. I never mean any harm but I somehow always cause it. I don't want to be here anymore. No one can help me it's too late. It helps to write out my thoughts for people to read, makes me feel a little less alone when I know I will always continue to be alone. People like me don't need to be on Earth, people like me should have never been born. I'll be leaving soon.
