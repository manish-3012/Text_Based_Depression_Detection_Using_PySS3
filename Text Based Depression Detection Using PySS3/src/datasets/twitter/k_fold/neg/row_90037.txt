Struggling with this new-ish development.I've had intense anxiety and depression my whole life. My mind runs a mile a minute and I can't keep up. I have tons of negative core beliefs and have been going to therapy for years, trying all kinds of meds as well as cognitive methods to help. I've recently become somewhat of a stoner because weed seems to be one of the only things that snaps me back into a (more) healthy perspective, but I can't function well stoned and I don't want to have to depend on cannabis. I start TMS next week, at my therapist's suggestion and after years of medication that always seems to work at first, but then stops being effective. 

And I've had thoughts in the past of "Oh well I wish I could just sleep forever," or "Life hurts so bad right now I don't see a future." I've had thoughts of "I'd rather be a ghost - watching the world but not participating." The pressure of life, the pressure to succeed, to make something of myself, to move forward, to achieve, to not worry people, has always felt so damn intense and crushing. But I've never felt so hopeless I considered suicide, or had suicidal thoughts outside of a few seldom intrusive thoughts.

Until about a month ago.

The suicidal thoughts and feelings I'm having right now are really scaring me. My partner is scared for me, my mom is scared for me, I'm scared for me. 

I'm not in crisis in the sense that I don't have a plan, I've not written any note, I'm trying to fight the part of me that wants to daydream about it and consider how I'd do it. I'm trying to ignore the part of me that is telling me it's hopeless, that my whole life is going to be like this.

I'm trying so hard not to indulge the negative intrusive thoughts. I've had intrusive thoughts of self-harm, of impulsive suicide. Mostly, these thoughts are painful - how could I think that? I have family, friends who love me, etc. etc. 

So the shitty thoughts cause shame and guilt, as well as being distressing emotionally. 

I can slowly feel my thoughts going from a knee-jerk negative reaction to thoughts of suicide, to being more... open to the idea? More hopeless, more in pain, more desperate for relief. 

The negative part of my brain imagines my future being a series of feeling better, committing to jobs and projects, and then crashing and letting people down over and over again because my anxiety and depression make me feel useless and too scared to do anything. A future of being unable to be independent, of failing to live up to my potential. It makes me feel so ashamed and guilty, and I end up feeling like I'd rather just die. 

I've had to call out twice in three weeks of work at my new job thanks to depression and anxiety. Anxiety so bad it made me throw up twice at work. Anxiety so bad that getting up in the morning is excruciating, because I feel so much pressure to get out of my depression and feel good so I can do good work. 

I just feel like I'll never be stable enough to keep a job, that I'll never be able to achieve what I want. I feel like I can't even figure out what I want. I feel numb and in excruciating pain at the same time. Physical pain as well as mental - fatigue, aches, headaches. 

I'm used to depression, but my whole life it's been more of a symptom of my anxiety. Now it feels like it has come back on steroids. 

I know my negative/suicidal thoughts are not rational, and that I shouldn't feed them. But even when I try not to exacerbate them cognitively, they keep coming. I finally understand first hand what people mean when they refer to suicidality as "my brain trying to kill me." 

It sucks and I just needed to vent/rant about it. I've talked to my loved ones and my therapist, I've got a plan to help myself and in case I get much worse. It's just scary. 

TL;DR 
For the first time, I'm seriously feeling suicidal, and it sucks balls, and I'm not sure how i'm going to go to work tomorrow and act like my brain isn't constantly screaming. 

Thanks for reading.
