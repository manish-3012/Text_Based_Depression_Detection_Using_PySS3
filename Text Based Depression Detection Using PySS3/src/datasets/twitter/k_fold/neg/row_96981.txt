I understand that I should tell someone how I feelI'm having a really hard time right now and I feel like I have no where to turn. I think about committing suicide all the time and my job only makes me feel worse. I work at a drug and alcohol rehab center specifically with people that have mental health disorders. Their problems are so much worse than mine and it makes me feel like I shouldn't complain but that thought only makes me feel worse. I don't have any friends and my girl friend and I broke up. She was my connection to the outside world. Im 22 work full time and go to school full time. I live at home with my parents but I don't feel comfortable talking to them. Reddit is the closest thing I have to a friend. I don't want to kill myself but I can't help shake the feeling that it's becoming a more viable option every minute.
