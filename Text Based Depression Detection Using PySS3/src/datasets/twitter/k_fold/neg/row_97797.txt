Some good news but i still feel trappedI need help I don't know how long I can take until a meltdown or worse...

 Haven't had any good job luck for a good 9 months and finally got an interview for semi decent job that I've been kidding myself is something I want.... I don't but its better then what I'm doing now...

I don't like the location, not completely into the job but with my limited opinions and experience it's the best I'm going to get but everything I think about it I feel hot flushes, dread, depression and heavy anxiety that I'm forced to take this as my only option when my mental state is already at its worst in scared a bad work environment will push me over the edge I know I should be happy but my mom makes everything worse if I don't take this or get it ill be mentally abused for being useful, a quitter, a failure, like my father I can't take it anymore
