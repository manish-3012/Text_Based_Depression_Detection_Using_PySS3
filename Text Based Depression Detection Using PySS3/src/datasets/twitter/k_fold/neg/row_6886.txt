6 more hours till my birthday.Only two more hours of work. i just want to go home swallow all of my antidepressants and sleep. Hopefully to never wake up again. I'm stupid piece of shit and I don't want to live any longer. I'm so tired of being sick all the time, both mentally and physically. So tired of not being able to express myself because of a cultish religion that is islam. So very tired.

Edit: Someone reached out to me, and on top of that, you all are so nice. Thank you. I'll stick around a bit longer.
