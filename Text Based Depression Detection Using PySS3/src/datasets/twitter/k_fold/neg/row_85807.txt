Am I worthless? I wish I had someone who cared.I tried to kill myself last month. It didn't work. My life has been very unfair and terrible so far. Sometimes I'm more suicidal than other times but I feel hopeless. My family has given me reasons to hate myself. My dad used to abuse me when I was little and then when I was slightly older he left my life. I thought I could talk to my grandmother because I was close with her (my moms mom) but she passed away a few years ago. Last few years have been tough and my mom seems to not understand me anymore. I feel like nobody cares about me that much. I feel like the world would be 1000x better without me in it. I try to explain my feelings a lot but who cares? My mom's told me I'm a waste of time and that I stress her out and she denies it. I feel like I waste everyone's time by being here.
