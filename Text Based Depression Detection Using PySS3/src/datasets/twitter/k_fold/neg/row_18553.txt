My country destroyed my lifeI had a tumour, not a serious one, but serious enough to cause my appendicitis like pain.

They didn't do any tests and when I became desperate they suffed me of psychiatric meds.

I had to go to a private hospital to take it out,  which even damaged me more.

I haven't been able to heal from psychological damage.

I push away every person I cherish 

Life isn't worth living like this.
