I am going to inject 1 gram of heroin and overdose in 2 days and I havent had anyone to talk to about itIm a 25 yo male, I live with my girlfriend who I love so much, but I live with depression and I can tell I'm killing her spirit. I've self medicated over the years with drugs and I never went to a doctor an I ended up getting really bad off and as time went by I went from one drug to a worse drug and so on the the point I was shooting heroin.

 I know that I will always be an addict and that I will never change. I will always have this looming sadness and dissatisfaction with life and it's even worse to be so in love with someone and know that I am the worst thing to ever happen in their life and only drain them of all happiness and potential they have. She deserves the world, not a depressed drug addict. She'll hurt at first but she will move on and make a great life for herself.

I'm going to buy a gram of heroin in a couple of days when I get my check and the days couldn't be any slower. I don't have the money to buy it all right now and that's the only reason I haven't done it yet. But once I do I'm going to drive to the beach right by my house and inject it all and lay back and inevitably pass out and stop breathing.

 I haven't talked about it to anyone for obvious reasons and I just wanted to get it off my chest.
