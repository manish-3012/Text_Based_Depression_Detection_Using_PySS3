I am seriously at my breaking pointFuck 2020, seriously this whole year can get fucked. I just lost my nan a few days ago due to COPD and now it has been reported that COVID cases are increasing again in my home country (I'm in the UK). It just seems at the moment everything is getting worse and worse and there is no end in sight. I'm honestly truly past fed up of it and I seriously can't take any more. I honestly want to escape from this world now.
