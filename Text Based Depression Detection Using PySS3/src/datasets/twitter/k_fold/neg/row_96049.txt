i wish i could take my mom's pain awayshe's done so much for me and my sisters. she's worked so damn hard being the only one raising us. over the years, i feel like my mom's gotten less and less happy. we fight pretty frequently and i can't help it, it just happens. i feel like i just screw everything up for my loved ones. i'm so tired of being empty space and when i am acknowledged, it's because i screwed up in some way. it's often said that suicide will only cause more pain for your loved ones and while that may be true, i feel like - for me - it would ultimately make things a lot easier and happier for my family because i won't be there to cause them pain anymore. i'm a horrible older sister, daughter, person. i just cause everyone pain. literally no purpose. i'm just empty space.
