Welp.Ahhh....what a miserable life. Having been depressed since highschool (or possibly earlier, but there's no way to tell other than remembering how hard I took things happening) with me being traumatized by dumb crap (the first girl I ever asked out saying yes, then 2 weeks later after coming back from camp, telling me she had a boyfriend, then proceeding to tell everyone that I was stalking her) and simply being too big of a loser to make anything of myself (still have done nothing more intimate besides give someone a hug or get a girlfriend, also just wasting my life away playing videogames and nothing else constructive).

I'm 25 and feel a strong dislike (or quite possibly hatred) towards most other people (mostly caused from working a retail job and seeing how people truly are), overweight and just in general have very low self-esteem.

I can't stand the fact that I'm depressed over random stupid crap either, with how weak I really am that I can't surmount this. Until tonight I couldn't bring myself to slash my wrists and even then, the razor I was using was too dull or I just couldn't apply enough force despite wanting to die so badly.

Anyways, I'm going to go to my fallback and wait for a train to come by, then I don't even have to wait for myself to bleed out, I can just feel instant silence and not have to deal with all my doubts, depression, regrets and so on anymore.

Also sorry for the shaky nature of my message, I'm not composed anymore, every day is just pain. I want to end it and my weakness.
