Weird wish i had for us allIm so sick of wanting something and having thst voice laugh. Trying for something to have the voice prove how it wont happen. Even imagining singing the song im listening to made me think "why even pretend its so sad and far from something that could possibly happen that its not even fun to imagine"

Just wish we could all get togther. Id bring drugs Wed get hookers the whole shabang. I imagine some of you are really smart and a bunch of you funny as hell. Some of you are popular boys or just really sweet pretty girls. We wouldnt be depressed misfits just a big party getting high and shitfaced. Wed all talk and hangout as normal. People. Next day if we felt that was it wed do it and not be alone. If not wed have each other and that night. Stupid dorky and embarassing to write but it was just comforting. Idk y ive got good friends partner irl but they dont get it like you do
