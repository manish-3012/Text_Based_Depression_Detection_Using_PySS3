I don't want to die but I can live with my emotions.I don't have friends, never did. So many years spent alone, I no longer feel human. I'm constantly depressed and I see everything in a negative light, I wish I was strong-willed and tough enough to suck it up and keep on living on a lone wolf but I'm too emotional.

I don't want to die, I just wish I could rid myself of my feelings. On a surface level I've already suceeded at that thanks to my endless solitude because I look like a wandering corpse without any care in the world, safe to say no one likes to approach me. 

I'm already dead inside, to others, all that remain is emotional turmoil. Might aswell make it official.
