I wrote my final note.Iâ€™d like my midterms to pass and I donâ€™t want it to intervene with any birthdays or major events because that would be upsetting for my friends and family. 

I donâ€™t really need to talk about anything. Just finishing up the last touches and playing the waiting game. Throwing out things I know no one wants to see from a dead person. Trying to make sure my friends remember the best version of me. But apart from that, kinda just done. For some people Iâ€™m ending connections in ugly ways so that they donâ€™t feel hurt when Iâ€™m gone, because I donâ€™t want them to. I would rather they felt relief or just nothing.
