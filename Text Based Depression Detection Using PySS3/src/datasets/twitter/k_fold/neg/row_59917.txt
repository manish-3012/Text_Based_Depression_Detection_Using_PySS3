I'm sitting at home attempting to cut my wrists openI have come to the realization that my acquaintance friends are sick of me and don't have time for me, that I'm a burden on my family, a failure in my religion, and I think it's best that I just disappear quietly. I can no longer afford to seek psychological help for my issues, the psych ward just dopes me up with drugs and is attempting to keep me as a permanent resident due to my mental illness. It's just better that I go.
