I don't have any friends. I am mentally worn out and just tired of how things seem to be going in my life. Help?I just want my life to be somewhat normal.  I don't have the ability to talk to a therapist right now, due to insurance problems, so I am pretty isolated.  My "friends" (who I was never really close to in the first place, although I'm only just realizing how thin our connections were) have moved on with their lives and I'm just here alone.  I don't even bother to go on Facebook anymore because I don't care to see their new lives; it no longer matters to me.

Suicidal thoughts still go through my head on a near-daily basis.  Never a plan, just the thought of holding a gun to my head and pulling the trigger or something else like hanging.  Just fantasies, I guess.

I keep coming here since I joined the community of Reddit; it's like a drug, it keeps me grounded enough to be marginally okay.  Being me is no picnic, that's for sure.
