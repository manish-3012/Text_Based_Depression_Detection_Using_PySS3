I had a moment last nightHi all, 

I'm writing on here because I had a horrible moment last night.  I've been feeling down for quite some time and I don't really know why.  I honestly believe it all boils down to being unhappy with my career.  It's not going the way I want it to and I feel like I'm caught in a rut.  Last night, I had quite a few drinks and all hell broke loose.  My husband was asleep and I really felt like I wanted to end everything.  I decided that I wanted to sit in my car in the garage and let the engine run, but instead I did the right thing and contacted a text message suicide hotline.  I told the operator what was going on and eventually passed out drunk.  The next thing I know, my husband and multiple EMT workers were in my bedroom checking my vitals.  I told them I was fine and that I just had too much to drink.  They eventually left and all was fine.  

It's now the next morning and I feel even worse than I did last night.  I feel awful that I scared my husband as much as I did, and I feel horribly embarrassed because I'm sure my neighbors saw what was going on.  I'm just so damn frustrated with everything and I'm not really sure what my next move should be in terms of recovery from this.  Does anyone have any insight?
