Nothing is going right, just wishing it could all end.I really donâ€™t know what the point of my life is anymore. About a month ago I became quite ill, physically, and since then my mental health has been suffering. With being ill, Iâ€™ve become feeling extremely embarrassed, annoying, and ashamed and not wanting others to help me because I feel like a burden. Now, Iâ€™m failing all my classes and missed so much work that I cannot afford anything. Then, today my car took a shit and I have no mode of transportation and no money to get it fixed. Iâ€™m extremely stressed out about my life and Iâ€™m still feeling very ill. Why does every little thing make my mental health crumble? Like once I start feeling a little better, something happens and puts me back into this place. This morning I had therapy and was feeling good. Then my car died when I got home. Honestly just have the worst luck of anyone. I want my life to be over, but I just canâ€™t get myself to do anything.
