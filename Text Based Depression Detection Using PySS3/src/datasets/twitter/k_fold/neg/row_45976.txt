Hiding emotions until i think of suicideI started to hide my emotions because I don't get better and I didn't want to hurt other people anymore...

Then I felt how it grew in me and became a lot to cope with/impossible to cope with...

Now I don't have any interest in any emotions. It's not like I have none, but I'm hiding and surpressing about 90% of the emotions I feel. But that doesn't make anything better...

A while ago I was there and wanted to talk to everybody and let it all out. Now I don't have any reason to tell anyone anything. I am just feeling numb or terrible every second in my life and it's stupid...

The only reason why I'm posting anything is because some music braught some of the lovesickness back and I feel so useless sad and lonely again.

I don't see any sense in doing anything at all so why should I stay alive? Don't come with "it gets better" because I know it will. But that doesn't matter if the time until then hurts me so deep that I am hurt for life with wounds I don't want to life with if that makes any sense...
