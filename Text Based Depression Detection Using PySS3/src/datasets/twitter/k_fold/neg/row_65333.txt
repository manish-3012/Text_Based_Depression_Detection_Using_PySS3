A piece of my personality and my soul dies a little everydayI was on venlafaxine and was fine on it for years doing great had a fantastic life and then I came off it very slowly from jan to june this year and then from sept onwards my anxiety has only worsened every day is a battle to stay alive to fight dark horrible Intrusive thoughts and urges to not harm myself to remember who I am even.
I was taking sertraline to begin with and I didnâ€™t give it enough time to work. Thought ok Iâ€™ll go back on venlafaxine cause it worked before but it really isnâ€™t working to me. The only thing that has slightly returned is my appetite and thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™m just as anxious as before and now Iâ€™m on even ore medication. Valium Seroquel zimovane propranolol and I barely make it through a day without trying to harm or kill myself. I have no quality of life I go nowhere I mostly just hide under my duvet from everyone cause Iâ€™m scared I will hurt them. I am get  agitated through most of the day v forgetful and get quite confused. I donâ€™t even say the same things I used to anymore I donâ€™t speak with any confidence or clearly. I canâ€™t even bare to look in the mirror and I have a wall of mirrors on wardrobe doors so I have to open one and so I donâ€™t see myself. I am triggered by almost everything I get Scared by words in conversations words, on paper, I feel terrified even standing outside sometimes I donâ€™t even go downstairs Iâ€™m terrified of who I am and who Iâ€™m becoming Iâ€™m literally so scared of even leaving my room or hearing people in the house my anxiety and depression is literally ruling my whole life I donâ€™t know how to cope any more I donâ€™t feel like used to and everyone keeps telling me it will get better but it hasnâ€™t it only feels worse. The Seroquel is horrible the feeling is too intense and I donâ€™t like it at all but I donâ€™t know what else to do aside from the obvious. Iâ€™m trapped in this house so I canâ€™t run and kill myself if I jump out the window I likely wonâ€™t die and Iâ€™ve tried hanging numerous times but the sensation and the pain in my neck and throat is too much for me to bare. Iâ€™m literally trapped in my mind my home and in this life I have a family a daughter that I barely go near cause Iâ€™m scared to be around her my partner irritates me as soon as he opens his mouth. Thatâ€™s not me none of this is me I die a little bit every single day
