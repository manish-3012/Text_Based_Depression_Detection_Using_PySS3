killing myself tonightI am fed up. I hate my family although they are loving, and forgiving of my mistakes. I put so much pressure on myself. I faked happiness, sobriety, good school grades (when i dropped out of college), not to worry/upset my parents, brother and friends. I don't have friends that i can rely on now, i've been negging them for the past two years. I feel really lonely and sad all the time. I don't think there is a reason worth living. Now that my parents found out about the addiction and money stealing they don't trust me enough to let me leave the house on my own. I feel like a child. I don't want to be dependant on my parents or any substance yet i always fail to do things on my own. Maybe suicide is the only thing i will ever succeed at. 

I've thought about the suicide method a lot: i don't have access to a gun or prescription drugs. I climbed a crane a few weeks ago but got scared of the height and didn't jump. I'm tempted by the idea of going into the ocean, swimming away from the coast to exhaustion, and drowning in agony. My parents don't hate me, they genuenly want to help but i just want to die. There is no way they can help me. Tonight is the night, the suffering will finally end tonight. 

Don't even bother to reply to this post, im looking for catharsis, rather than karma or support comments. 

Life has been bad to me, so i'm ending it. In my 20 years of life i have only suffered. I was molested by a complete stranger when i was  very young. I never told anyone. I only bear secrets and suffering. Not for any longer, i will die tonight.
