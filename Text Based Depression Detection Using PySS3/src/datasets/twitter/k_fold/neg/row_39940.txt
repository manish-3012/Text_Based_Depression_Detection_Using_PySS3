06/03/96 - 05/08/2020Now is the timee finally, i'm alone, the knot is ready, I feel at peace. These are my last words and for anyone thinking about commiting suicide i say this: you fucking have the right to do it, no one should be forced to have a horrible existence. At least now, in my lastest moments, I feel at peace and maybe even happy. Goodbye.
