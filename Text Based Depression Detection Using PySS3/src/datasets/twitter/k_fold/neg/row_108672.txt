It's getting to be too muchIt feels like my life is crumbling all around me. It feels like no matter what I try to do nothing seems to be right. I have tried to make my own path for myself to be happy but it just can't come together. I have always lived my life to please other people and not myself. Since I was 13 I have never been truly happy. It's awful, it's unbearable. Every night I lay in my bed and cry myself to sleep thinking about how I must be a failure because no one else around me understand the way I feel. I mask my emotions everyday as best I can. I try to push others away so that if the time does come they do not care. 9 years of this has taken its toll and I no longer know what to do. My parents think tell me I'm a failure. I feel like such a waste of space in this world. I pray every night that one day this feeling is gone but it never is. I drink with my friends but they don't know I drink to try and forget how I feel. They commend me on being able to drink so much but I know it's because I have to. It hurts so much.
