EnoughAt what point do you feel like you just want to give up? Iâ€™ve done a lot of reading and looking around about suicide. Iâ€™m basically just sick of thinking about it every day. There is this site called exitinternational and I really like the points the doctor makes there. He has a book on how to help do everything. It actually makes it seem more okay, or if itâ€™s actually more excepted and itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ll be just disappointing all over again. I donâ€™t really know, it just seems so mixed but Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for far too long. When is enough, enough?
