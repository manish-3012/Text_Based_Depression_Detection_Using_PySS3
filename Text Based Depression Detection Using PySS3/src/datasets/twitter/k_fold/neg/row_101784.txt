Tired of life and bored ... is staying depressed the only way to cope?Iâ€™ve been depressed my entire adult life ... so, almost 20 years ... perhaps longer. At the age of 21, I met the man to whom Iâ€™m married. We married when I was 24. We have two children, ages 8 and 6. I stay home with the kids, although if this year were normal, Iâ€™d be here alone. My issue is, I am bored and tired of life. I hate being married, I hate being part of a family, I hate that Iâ€™ve done nothing with my life. I feel as though if I hadnâ€™t been depressed, none of these are decisions I would have made for myself. And itâ€™s the kind of stuff you canâ€™t undo, ya know? So I feel as though the only way to deal with this life is to remain depressed. If I was not depressed, I feel as though I would abandon my family in search of something more satisfying, more interesting? I donâ€™t know ... But when I think of spending at least the next 12 years with someone whose person and company I donâ€™t enjoy, who probably and justifiably feels the same way about me ... I want to abandon my life altogether. If Iâ€™m just going to be depressed anyway, what is the point? Wow sorry, that was a lot.
