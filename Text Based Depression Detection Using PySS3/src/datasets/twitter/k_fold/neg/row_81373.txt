I think this is itI am 18 and I am the loneliest person on Earth.

I've never had any type of relationship with anyone because I am so shy of everyone. Every time someone tries to make a conversation with me I feel lost and I feel anxious and draw up into myself.

I have been on two dates my entire life
and each date ended horribly with me coming to the realization that I am meant to be alone.

I've tried to make friends before but no one is interested in talking to someone with severe social anxiety. 

I own a gun from my grandfather and I all I can think of is using it on myself. 

I want a friend. I need a friend. 

I don't want to die alone but I feel like that is going to happen maybe tonight.
