Everything hurtsI think I need to end my life. I feel sick and alone. Being alive is painful. I feel pain all over in my body and in my mind. Everything hurts. Why am I here? Iâ€™m in so much pain tonight. Iâ€™ve never cried like this in my whole life. I think if I were to do something, I would just leave so much more of a mess for my loved ones to clean up.
Everyone at school thinks Iâ€™m the â€˜weird fat kid.â€™ Words hurt like those mouths wouldnâ€™t believe. 
Everyone hates me. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I donâ€™t want to cry anymore. Iâ€™m just a kid. 
I reach out to friends, but the only response I get is â€œLMAO SAME.â€ I just need someone to care...
