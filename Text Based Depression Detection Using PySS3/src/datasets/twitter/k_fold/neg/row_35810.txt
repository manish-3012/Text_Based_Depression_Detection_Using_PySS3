im fucking tired of being transi cant even feel sad due to gender dysphoria without being ridiculed for it or people using it against me. its fucking annoying, let me be suicidal without it being a political debate, shit makes it worse. my whole existence is just based around a fucking political debate, its so fucking tiring and makes me feel useless.

''haha 40%'', ''lmao trans people killing themselves, 40% haha''

please, shut the fuck up. my entire existence isnt based around my gender or what i identify as. leave me alone, im not bothering you, why should you bother me.

pls dont let there be a fucking political debate in the comments, i am honestly tired of it. just let me die without it being a fucking percentage.
