Does anyone else make bucket lists?Whenever I'm feeling like there's nothing worth living for, I make a list of things that I have to do before I can kill myself. Instead of something like climb Everest, or see the pyramids, or any of the amazing things you want to do when you want to make the most of your time left, I put little stupid things on my list.

2 years ago I decided that I couldn't kill myself until after I saw "The Avengers." No matter how bad life felt, I told myself, I've invested time and fandom in all the movies leading up to this, I gotta see it thru to the end, at least. The way I see it, "experts" always tell you to set a series of attainable, short term goals instead of one unlikely long term goal, whether it's how much to read while studying for finals, or a losing 2 lbs in a month rather than 20 lbs in a year. It just so happens that in my case these little goals are things like "I need to see The Dark Knight Rises" or "I've got a friend's wedding to go to in a few months" and my unlikely long term one is something more existential like "Be happy" or "mean something."

When I check one off it's kinda mixed feelings. On the one hand, it feels nice to check something off the list, on the other it's like that line in *The Princess Bride*, (Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.")

Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone else did stuff like that. "I *would* kill myself but I need to know how (fill in the blank) show/movie/video game/book ends," or "I need to lose 15 lbs, so I can die young and leave a good looking corpse," etc.

Or is this just another example of how crazy I've become?
