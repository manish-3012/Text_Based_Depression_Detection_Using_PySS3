I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself before I turn 27Iâ€™ll be 26 this year and I see no hope for myself. I suffer from mental illness specifically schizoaffective disorder and anhedonia so I donâ€™t feel any joy in my life at all. It has been hell living through this. I told my mom I wanted to kill myself and she cried saying she would do the same thing if I leave this world. Thatâ€™s the only thing stopping me from suicide is my mom. I canâ€™t handle life anymore I just want to die.
