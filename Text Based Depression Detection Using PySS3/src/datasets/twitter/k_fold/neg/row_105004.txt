Please tell me how you recovered from being suicidalI really thought I was going to do it today. I kept putting it off, and now it looks like I'll make it to tomorrow. But I obviously can't keep going like this.

I feel like I hardly exist already. I work, I spend time with friends, but I feel untethered from the world, or separated from it as by a soundproof glass wall. I feel alone all the time, even with the people who know me best. I feel broken and unloveable and deficient in every way. 

I've known this would be my final stop for years, but I'm still a little surprised to find myself here already; I thought that fear of hurting my family and the mere habit of being alive would be enough to keep me from killing myself. Now, though, freedom seems *so close*, that last step so easy to take, that I'm willing to just hope they can forgive me.

It doesn't seem worth trying to get through this; if I live, I have to keep being me. But clearly some small part of me feels obligated to try to be a person and not to hurt the people who love me. What I want to know is, how do I stop wanting to die? How do I find an intrinsic desire to live? I would love to hear from people who've been where I am and then didn't kill themselves. Thanks for reading.
