Living on edge, every small thing gets to me and hurts me and pushes me more and more. Might be closer to suicide than ever.Suicidal thoughts used to bring me relief in pain. But now, I just feel like I am on edge all the time. That sometimes I might just kill myself out of spite for this world and everything. I used to care and love my family so much. But these days, i feel pent up disgust towards everything. And I feel like I will just not think anymore of the effect I might have on them and just kill myself. Life is just shit anyway and it just hurts people every time.
