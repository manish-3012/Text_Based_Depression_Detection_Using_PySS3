depressedi just got out of the mental hospital for trying to end my life &amp; ive got lots if meetings n stuff with new therapists n whatever. my mom, for some reason, expected me to come out of the hospital, not depression free, but able to manage &amp; deal with it with no problems. that's not how it works.

i miss the hospital, actually. it was like a little safe island for me. everything was good, i felt good, them i came back to reality. it fucking sucks. i wanna go back :(

anyways i just asked my mom "am i not allowed to have depression??" because that's what it feels like. she said "you just talked about that today, you know what you have to do &gt;:( you can but you need to overcome! don't let it win!" ??? alright let me just do that real fast bc that's so easy.

i wanna fucking be gone, i don't CARE anymore. i get that that's not the right attitude but i literally hate myself so much that i tried to fucking kill myself. im not just gonna snap back n be normal. that's all easier said than done.

this was really depressing n i probably sound like a dumb annoying teenager. oh well.
