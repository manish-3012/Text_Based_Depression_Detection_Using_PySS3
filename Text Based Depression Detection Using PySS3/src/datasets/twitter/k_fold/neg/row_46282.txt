Everything is boringEverything is trash, my best friend is the only thing that can make me feel a little happy
The things I used to like now are boring
My mom deserves a better daughter than me and at the same time she's not the best mom. 
My mom gets angry at me when I have panic attacks or anxiety attacks, I have sleep paralysis I sleep 2 hours or less, I hate myself and everything I say or I have done. 
I don't know what's the point on life anymore. 
I'm just waiting for when I turn 21 and see if my life is a little bit better or maybe just kill myself.
