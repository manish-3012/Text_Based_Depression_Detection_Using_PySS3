i dunnoI used to fear death so much. Like the thought of not existing just terrified me. But nowadays when I think that if I  were to die today would I care? I feel so numb that everything feels irrelevant. I want to find meaning in my life. I cant live with myself unless im drunk. Every weekend I come home from the army and I just drink. I cant stand my life and I dont care enough to do anything about my situation. I  just dont fu\*\*ing care anymore about anything. Here I am sitting home alone drinking on the computer. I know my situation is my fault but I just dont care anymore. I dont know what to do anymore..
