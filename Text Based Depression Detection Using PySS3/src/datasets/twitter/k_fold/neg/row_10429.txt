Suicidal idiot here to rantThis is a new throwaway. My other was too identifiable. Been on meds and in therapy for 2 yrs. Multiple attempts covered up by my family so that I wouldn't go to a psyche ward. Things got better for a long time.

Lemme cut to the chase. I want to quit my job and go to college. I am 20 yrs old and live at home still. I jumped into a high stress job thinking it'd be good for me and I was wrong. I want to fix my mistake and pursue a better life. 

My family has been screaming with me about my decision and is trying to force me to stay. I work from home for a trucking company and need to keep my typing speed fast enough to stay home. I get panic attacks when I'm cooped up in my house (was homeschooled for 10 yrs with no friends, still no friends). Going to work is a 2 hr total commute and I cannot drive (my family never helped me to get my license). I do not want to pay for Uber and I do not and will not trust buses. My family doesn't want to drive me in so home has been convenient but the stress to keep up speed and my anxiety mean I want out of this situation and into another one.

My mother keeps track of my meds so I don't attempt with them. She stormed out after the fight and idk where she keeps them. I'm having fantasies of suicide and wrote a suicide note, but I know I'm not in my right mind because I'm off meds (The college decision was while on meds plz don't question my drugged up sanity on that one lmao).

I kind of just want some reassurance that I'm not crazy. And someone to talk this stuff through with. So yea, howdy
