Hey SW! Need a couple of volunteers.Bi-polar here, starting to sink into another fit of depression. This one's going to be particularly nasty because of some recent events and I really don't trust myself when I'm in that state. If I could get some positive reinforcement sent through PM every half hour or so, it'd be a great help; I'll repay you in some way or another.

Cheers all, remember to keep looking forward.

Update - Wow, I've learnt a lesson on the kindness of strangers. A looooooooot of messages. I genuinely appreciate it, you're all great people.

I'm heading off to work so don't worry if there's no response in the next 10 hours or so. Again, thank you so much.
