What happens when your husband doesnâ€™t trust you?Iâ€™m a stay at home mom of two boys. My husband thinks that my male friend I met during an involuntary psychiatric hold during a â€œsuicide attemptâ€ is someone I cheat on him with. I was just on the phone with a different friend while he was at work. He doesnâ€™t believe me. What do I even do? I have found hope in this male friend. I wish it didnâ€™t affect one of my most important relationships.
