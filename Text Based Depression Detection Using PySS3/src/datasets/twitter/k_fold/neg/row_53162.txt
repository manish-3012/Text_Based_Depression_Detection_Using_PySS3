Thoughts on lifeWe go through life with barriers and safety nets, with support and backing, someone or something to always catch you when you fall, but is that really beneficial for you? some would say yes and others no.

Iâ€™m here to ask the question, can you really grow as a person and truly as yourself while unintentionally holding yourself back, you never get enough courage to go fly to somewhere, or to go do something like a party or see someone, or maybe you bottle it and just donâ€™t think you have what it takes to get that job you always wanted.

If you look at life as a whole, there are more significant things for you to be concerned and bothered about, then just what ifâ€™s and buts, about being embarrassed because you said something or did something wrong.

Iâ€™m suggesting an idea, A principle, think of your world as a ocean, if you are on a boat comfy and everything you need, whats the point of going anywhere, what is the point of moving, But if you drop yourself within that ocean, forced to sink or swim, you need to keep moving forward, to find that boat of comfort, and when you find that boat, you will sit there, in that safety zone once again, looking back at that swim you just made, and on the experiences you faced, and then after doing those swims, you truly grow and find out who you are as a person, and how to really tackle those situations that once before made you freeze and doubt, but now you realise, whats the worst that can happen, they reject you and oh look you still go on living and 99% of your life has not changed, embrace the new and unknown, grow from life, donâ€™t stagnate and just be a watcher of life but a player and user of it, to find what you truly wanted.
