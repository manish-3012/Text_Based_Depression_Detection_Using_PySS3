I won't give up.I have a very common story. No close friends, no passion, no one to talk to, just emptiness. 

The void, nothing.

My grades are average, nothing to worry about. Yet I used to think my future was dark, because I just don't know what to do. I keep playing video games to fill the void, but every single day I get hungrier. And sometimes, when I look for a solution I just think :

What's the point of living if I'll just die ? Accomplishing things ? Why ? It's not like I can change this world.

And then I realized ; It's not that I won't do anything because it's useless : it's because I can't do anything right. And because I can't do anything right, I get depressed !

You have probably already watched those motivational videos, telling you to keep going, to struggle if you want to succeed. But how do you achieve that ? How do I learn how to learn ? My whole life I've been trying to climb to the top while the talented people were watching me from the top and others were trying to push me , yet I couldn't go further, I was stuck, alone.

Depression ? Medication ? Xanax ? I don't need that crap. 

Fuck that.

Sure, some people are talented from birth, there are 10 year old geniuses smarter than anyone else. There's rich people in Lambos who never worked a single day in their life. 

That doesn't mean you have to stay at the bottom. 

That doesn't mean you can't do anything. 

You just have to work: it's unfair, so what ? Fuck all of them, work but work smart. Keep doing this and eventually... you'll be fine. Right now I'm fully dedicated to web development with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and not even death could stop me.
