I don't even know anymoreI have been depressed for well over a year now, I have tried to kill myself 3 times till now but always got scared towards the end and stopped because I was too scared of the pain. I have told one of my friends about this but lately, even she started ignoring me without reason. I don't have anyone else to talk to anymore and all I ever feel like doing is crying but every time I try to cry to let it out, for some reason, I am never able to.

I can promise you that if guns were easily available where I live I would've killed myself by now as a shot to the head would be a quick death. 

If anyone knows of any easy, painless and quick ways to kill myself please tell me.
