Should I clean out my room before killing myself?I've heard that it's heavy for bereaved parents to see their deceased childs possessions, because it reminds them the parents about them. But I've also read that some parents prefer to keep their childs room the way it is. I'm torn between throwing away all my clothes and stuff or letting them stay the way the do. What do you think?
