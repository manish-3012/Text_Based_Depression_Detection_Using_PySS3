Counting down daysI plan to kill myself on my birthday in a few months, but I don't know if I can hold out for much longer. I'd prefer if I hadn't been born at all so it wouldn't have to come to this. I don't want to leave behind a grieving family, because I know from dealing with grief myself that it never stop hurting.

I'm afraid if I wait until my birthday to kill myself I might hesitate or find a reason to live for a little while longer and then it would all fall apart. I'd have missed the window and have to wait another year.

I really have nothing left to live for, and I don't particularly care to find a reason to live either. I just wish I could disappear without a trace. I don't want anybody to miss me, remember me, or mourn my passing.

I came close to killing myself last year. I think the change in my mood had been obvious enough for my then girlfriend to beg me not to do it. She cried and begged me to grow old with her. At the time I didn't think it would be so bad to live like that. I think it might have been nice... but she left me for somebody else.

I miss her and mourn for what we could have had together. However, I understand why she left. I'm not even half the man I was when we met -- I'm an absolute wreck.

Funerals and remembrances are more for the living than the dead. If I kill myself on my birthday then at the very least there would only be a single day of remembrance, if any at all.

I don't know why I'm making a post, or what to expect, but I can't talk to anybody about it in case somebody calls the authorities and places me under a real suicide watch.
