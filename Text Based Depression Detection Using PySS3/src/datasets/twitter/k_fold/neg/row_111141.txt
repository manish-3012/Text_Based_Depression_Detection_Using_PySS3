I have the two best partners in the world and I can't tell them.I really need to tell someone I'm feeling suicidal. I can't tell them. I can tell how sick of dealing with me they are. They have their own problems and I can't be there for them because I fall apart when things go wrong, because I make everything harder for them than it needs to be. They think I make things all about me. They don't really know what it feels like to hate yourself this much, to immediately go there at any provocation. 
I'm so scared. My boyfriend has a loaded gun in the nightstand and I want to ask him to move it, or at least unload it, but I can't tell him I'm feeling this way. I don't want to manipulate them, make them responsible for keeping me safe. They just think I'm feeling sorry for myself. Maybe I am. I don't know. I don't know what I want out of this. I don't know what to do. I made yet another appointment with yet another new counselor, but it's not for another couple of weeks and I've seen 4 already and none of them felt right. I didn't feel like I could trust them. It didn't seem like it would work.
Now my girlfriend's job is ending and so will my insurance benefits through her--I'm underemployed, of course. I'm trying, it's just, nothing's ever worked before. I find myself wishing there was a way to end it without causing any more trouble for anyone.
It was just my birthday this weekend and we went on a trip with a bunch of friends. The whole time I was just trying to hold it together. They don't know I just wanted to die.
edit: It's never been this bad before. I've had really scary nights that I got over the next day or so. But all last week, I've been suicidal. And when I'm kind of okay, between the crying, I'm just shellshocked at how I was just thinking.
