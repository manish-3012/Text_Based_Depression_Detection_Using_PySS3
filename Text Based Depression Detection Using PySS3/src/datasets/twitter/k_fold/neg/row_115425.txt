I need to tell someone.I hope you guys have the time to read this. I'm 15, and I think I'm bored at life. Bored and scared. I don't want to work everyday, I don't want any of the hassle most people put up with. I'm not going to live like that. I'm not some crazy suicidal person. I've thought about it for years. The only thing stopping me is my father. I can't bare the thought of him crying at my funeral, with his heart absolutely shattered. A few weeks after he dies (I know i'm a true monster for writing this, but i would rather him die from natural causes then from the heart attack of hearing about his son jumping from a fucking bridge), I'm going to let go of this life. I don't want my death to be in vain. I think i'm going to write in my suicide letter that i'm gay, so people will take this gay acceptance thing more seriously. Apart from all this, I think I've gotten an alright life. I love my best friend, but she'll never know. All my other friends would gladly leave me so they can go with their girlfriends. I'm nobody's first choice, and I can't fucking stand it. I'm not scared to die. I just want to let someone know. Thank you guys for taking the time. It would mean the world to me if even one person reads this.
