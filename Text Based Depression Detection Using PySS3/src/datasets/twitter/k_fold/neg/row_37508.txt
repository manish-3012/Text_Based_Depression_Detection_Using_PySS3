How much consideration is abnormal?I am fairly certain I am not remotely a real risk.  But I'm concerned, because I do find myself contemplating suicide about 1 to 3 times a week.  On each contemplation, I'm not remotely tempted to act, but I do consider what the logistics would be and how people would react.  

I feel like these are fairly common thoughts for people to have.  So, my question is if my frequency of them is unusual, and if it is unusual to the point that I need to be concerned.

thanks
