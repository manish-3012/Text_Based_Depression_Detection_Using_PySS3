Am I selfish?I want attention, I want friends, I want someone to care for me. I have none of that, am I selfish for wanting people to set their own life aside in order to devote time for me? I've been at the end of my rope for a long time and I've never had any emotional support, as result my life is pretty much in shambles. I've no education, no job, no one to talk to. My life pretty much ended back when I was 17, that's when I dropped out. Back then I was set on killing myself so I didn't bother with anything. Now 3 years have passed and I've not progressed in the slightest. I'm still in the same mindset, I've done nothing productive since.

I attempted suicide last year through various drugs, and ended up getting my stomach pumped. I know what loneliness feels like, and it's just not sustainable. If you're truly lonely, you've no place in this world, there certainly is no point to being alive. Not only are you going against the very nature of humans by not being able to reproduce and staying socially healthy but you also have no purpose to life since you'll never achieve happiness. I don't believe for a second that anyone can be happy living alone without any contact with anyone, at least not for me. I'm an extremely empathetic person, I require love and frienship in order to feel good. 

I'm 10 units in and I'm still drinking, it's a routine at this point, every 3 days I get drunk enough to feel suicidal so that I hopefully end myself impulsively.
