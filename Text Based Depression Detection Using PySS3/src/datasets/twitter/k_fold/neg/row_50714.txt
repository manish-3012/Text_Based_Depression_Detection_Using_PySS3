Like many others I'm lost againIm at a loss, ive spiralled back to my previous state of despair,i have no one to confess my problems to.
I wanna cry and let it out but I cant. Im not living for myself. Im living and doing what is logical but i am not pleased.

Im thinking of disappearing. A part of me wants to just disappear from this realm. These past few days have been unbearable. I lost many friends to a breakup and I have 1 real friend and my younger brother theyre the only ppl that mean the most to me so i dont want to burden them with my shit. They have a lot going on and i dont want them to look at me differently.

I just want to cry I hate existing and waking up to nothing and no one. It hurts to fake it when ppl ask if im okay i just wanna break down but i cant. I just want to be freed from this. 

I dont want to try and make something of myseld but i dont want to be nothing but my life has killed my drive.

Im angry and sad. I want to scream. I want to cut myself. Im startin to understand people who say they do it to feel something because i feel nothing.
