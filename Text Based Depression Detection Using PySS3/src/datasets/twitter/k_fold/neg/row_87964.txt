Question.How do I make sure I sever the jugular?
Do I need to stab and tear?
I want to try and make as little noise as possible, but I have a feeling I will need to go into a state of beserk and yell really loud before making the strike.

I'd prefer a poison, but I'm starting to lose patience.

Should I just make a deep strike to my wrist instead?
