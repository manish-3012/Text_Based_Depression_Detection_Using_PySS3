What is the likelihood of me recovering from depression (or other mental illnesses) if I seek medical care?I'm consistently struggling with suicidal impulses, but am slightly afraid to speak up. 

If I seek medical care, what exactly is the likelihood I will successfully recover from depression? I've suffered in the past (but I didn't seek treatment). Are most cases of depression and other mental illnesses treatable? I've heard some say a small minority get successfully treated, while others say almost everyone who seeks medical care improves.

Please help, and thanks.
