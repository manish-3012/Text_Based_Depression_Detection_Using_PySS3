I don't know why I am posting here. I am just lost.Truthfully I don't know why I am posting here, I doubt people read these anyway.

My medication has fucked me over. I forgot to take it yesterday and when I went to bed and when I woke up I felt like I had the worst hangover on the planet. Until I took this mornings dose I felt like shit. But I can't come off it because then I will feel even worse. It's also making me Schizophrenic. I just.... fuck.

My 'friends' just backstab me and make me realize that they don't really care about me. Once we take away them because they obviously don't care I am left with one person, Mom. She's handled the death of a child before so she can deal with it a second time.

There's no way I have a future in anything I want to do if I can't even be happy. My High Functioning Depression is taking over and I really don't know how long I have left. I bet if I was to take my own life no one would even realize the battle I had going on in my head.

I wish I didn't have to feel.

I wish I could just leave and start again somewhere else.

I wish I could just get lost and never be found.
