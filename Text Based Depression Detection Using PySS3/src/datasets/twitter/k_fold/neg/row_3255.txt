Do you guys ever think about how weird it is to want to end your own life?Iâ€™ll just be sitting, casually thinking about how I donâ€™t want to live anymore.  Imagining whatever may or may not lie beyond this life. Then I get this thought/feeling like â€œwow Iâ€™m actually fantasizing about KILLING myself?â€ that shits weird man. Wanting to die is weird.
