I just got fired for comments I didnâ€™t mean to say and ended up upsetting co-workers. It was my first termination in life for that reason. As long as I have that on my conscience, then I think death is better than trying again.I was called and told over the phone by my employer that â€œwe have to to cut tiesâ€ because of some comments, assuming bad jokes out of recall, I wasnâ€™t aware they upset my co-workers. My first reaction led me to punch my fist into a wall in a public area and now my mind is swirling with thoughts of candid anger. This was my first firing and Iâ€™m not processing it well. My first thought is why bother apply for other jobs when I have the reason on my conscience? Second, if I do try again, then I better embrace the bias hateful questioning about my termination. Third if I tell anyone, then I will lose everyone close to me. Fourth, if I tell my parents, I will be a shame and burden to have committed such an act. Finally, looking back, Iâ€™m tempted to end my life rather than deal with future repercussions about my termination. If youâ€™ve been fired for first time, how did you process it?
