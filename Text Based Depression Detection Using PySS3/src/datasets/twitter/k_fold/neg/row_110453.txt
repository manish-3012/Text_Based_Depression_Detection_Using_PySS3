Unusual, scary condition. May kill myself if it keeps up.
I'm an avid reader.  Long time ago, I came to a realization that there was a love for books and stories imprinted as early as in my childhood days but was too unaware to tap into.  Helped develop my talent of writing as well.  
Now I'm in danger of losing that passion completely.  Lately, I've experienced a weird, unsettling problem.  Certain books are now giving my hands stinging sensations, the feel of burning charcoal.  Something that's never happened before until about a year ago.  But it was relatively mild compared to now.  Even the books I have that are, say, only a month old, they're uncomfortable to hold for extensive periods.
This new development has stressed me so to the point of depression and suicidal thoughts.  How could I have developed such a crippling condition?  Reading and getting inspiration from it is the only hobby left that gives me purpose.  How can I enjoy it with this sudden malignity in my hands when I hold a book?
I'm so scared.  If this keeps up, or gets worse, then I'm going to end it all.  Unless there's a cure out there.  Doubtful because I can't even find basic information or support on this condition.  So far, it's looking hopeless.  Not much faith left.
