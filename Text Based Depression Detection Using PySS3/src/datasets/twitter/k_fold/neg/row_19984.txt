How long is too long for it to just be a "temporary problem"?I've been depressed, so long...8 years now, and struggled with suicidal thoughts throughout a good deal of it. My entire adolescence and adulthood (I'm 21). I can't even do anything to fix it anymore. I don't understand what happiness is, or why I'm at all deserving of it. Its been too long. I either hurt, or am just numb. The only thing that's changed is that the occasional panic attack has decided to grace me with its presence, as of late...

I seem to only be getting gradually worse, and any illusion of progress is usually shattered within a few hours. I really just don't see any hope in any of this. I have zero aspirations anymore, no redeeming qualities, and I can't even imagine a future for myself.

I don't know if I'm just...I don't even know...All I do know is that there's just about nothing keeping me here, and no reason for me to stick around and be a burden on everyone.
