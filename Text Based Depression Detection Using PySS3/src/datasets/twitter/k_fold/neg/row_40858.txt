She wants to be friends but...I don't have any friends anymore, at the age of 25. I have my bf and that's it. My mother tries to get close and is confused why we aren't closer and why I won't open up.

I tried calling her today after a fight with my bf and she just laughs...I seriously just wish I were gone...I so badly want someone close I can talk to but idk how to anymore. I can't function as a normal adult and I can never tell if I'm overreacting or if my feelings of neglect are true. 

I just want it all to end.
