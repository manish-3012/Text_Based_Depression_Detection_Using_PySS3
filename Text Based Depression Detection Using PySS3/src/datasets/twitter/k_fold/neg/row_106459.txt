I'm just tired of livingI'm living just to help others and I'm sick of it. I haven't been happy in years. I've gotten good at faking it but sometimes I'm overwhelmed with sadness and hatred for myself. I take care of my mother-in-law, and tend to the house for my husband. I work as well. I was disowned by my blood relatives for moving away. I have been emotionally, physically and verbally abused by my blood relatives. I was sexually assaulted by a religious leader in my teens. I never told my husband or his mother but they know I've been disowned. I can't even have a moment of showing my true emotion. If my face isn't sickingly happy looking I get these types of comments: "Why do you look so serious?" "Where's that smile?" 

Every smile, smirk or laugh is fake. Every conversation I have with them is shallow. Telling them about my past wouldn't achieve anything so I don't bother. I don't think they care about how I feel or how I'm doing. As long as I get the chores done and dinner ready when I get home they are content. I'm the one that's always confided in and used as a emotional pillow. My husband knows I have depression, and knows when I'm upset. Rather than trying to comfort me he actively avoids me. Then he pretends that everything is okay once I calm down from crying. 

I've just checked out. I'm dead to my family, and my new family doesn't give a damn about me. I've been teetering for 2 years now on whether I should just end it, and the desire to do so increases daily. The one thing that kept me going was hurting my husband, but I can't empathize with him any longer. I don't care if my death hurts him. My demons haunting me everyday hurts too.

Why do I have to live to make other people happy? Why are my wishes put on the back burner for their happiness? I don't get how taking my life is selfish. It's my life to take, I think it's selfish for them to want me to live just to serve their needs and wants.

I'm looking into seeing if I can get N or something that can give me a peaceful end.
