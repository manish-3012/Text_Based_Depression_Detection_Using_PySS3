Wednesday September 9Currently in the process of writing goodbye letters for all my loved ones. I have access to a way out. I canâ€™t live on with the pain and heartache. I canâ€™t live on feeling like Iâ€™ve messed everything up in my life and Iâ€™ve lost everything that truly matter to me... my grandma passed away this year and itâ€™s still hurting me that I didnâ€™t say goodbye... my girlfriend and the little family we had made together they are now gone too... the only place I every felt alive was in that little family coming home to them and loving them... now thereâ€™s just emptiness. I hope that I donâ€™t cause more hurt than I already have. September 9... 9 has always been a number with meaning to me... this will be my new start... or the end of something tragic... I love you all.
