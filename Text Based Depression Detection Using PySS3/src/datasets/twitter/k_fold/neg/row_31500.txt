I think the whole world is full of shit, including me.I'm starting to look at death like its favorable. It'll be just like before I was born not a care in the world.

I hate this piece of shit world. I hate humans, because they're prententious and deluded about what they actually are. A bunch of dumb animals who think they're smart and better than everything but they're driven by the same monkey greed and ignorance. I hate myself.

I hate the process of aging, where you become old frail and ugly. And undesirable.

I hate that nothing is completely good. Everything has a downside.

I hate how ridiculous existence truly is. Deep down everyone is alone. No one truly gives a fuck about us or about each other 

I wish I was neverborn
