School's getting to meI've been depressed for years now, and have had suicidal thoughts multiple times. Lately, though, school has been pushing me pretty far, and I feel closer to actually commiting suicide then ever before. Although my grades are fine and I rank high, I feel like I don't meet expectations and am disappointing everyone around me.
