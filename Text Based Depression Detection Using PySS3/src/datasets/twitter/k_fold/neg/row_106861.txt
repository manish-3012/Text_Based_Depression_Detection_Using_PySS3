My parents wonâ€™t listen to meI donâ€™t get it I literally have said to my parents that I donâ€™t want to be in this earth anymore and have explained how I donâ€™t care about anything anymore  and would rather not be alive but all they say isâ€ how do I think they feel when I say that. â€œ and Iâ€™m just scared Iâ€™m going to end up doing something bad if I donâ€™t get help soon and Iâ€™m not sure what to do .
