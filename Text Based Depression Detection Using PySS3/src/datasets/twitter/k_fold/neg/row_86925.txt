I'm thinking of killing myself next year.At a time when everyone is possibly too busy to realize that I'm here. At a time when high school graduation is over and everyone is busy with college. I'll give myself one more year. One more. Iv been trying to kill myself for some time now. 

Some years are better then others, but for the most part there's nothing fulfilling enough to live through life entirely. 

Looking at the state of the earth, does it even matter if I was gone anyway? This world is probably going to be unlivable sooner than expected. 

I'll try to find a solid reason to live, just so I dont end up disappointing anyone that I got therapy but I'm not better.

But until then, I've been a lot more careless about school and my grades again. I fall asleep in classes often, and its starting to get harder to vent about it to friends in fear of losing them.

I don't know. I thought things were getting better. But now I feel better off dead.
