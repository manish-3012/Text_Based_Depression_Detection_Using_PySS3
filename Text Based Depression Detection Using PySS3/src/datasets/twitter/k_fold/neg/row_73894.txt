Help. Please.I've wanted to kill myself since the second grade when my parents starting fighting even though they had been separated for quite a while. Then my sister started her rebellious age (9 years difference.) She brought strange people into the house wild parties it was scary. She drove us into the ground and we were almost homeless. All this other badd stuff happened like moving 3 more times and my sister and my mom fighting for a while, also my self esteem was demolished.Then in 6th grade my dad killed himself a few weeks after my birthday. I felt like it was my fault for the longest time until I recently realized his birthday card to me was his goodbye and I love you. I was the **ONLY** one who got a goodbye. He didn't leave a note, a recording, anything. Except to me. Now, I just feel hideous and worthless for no reason except for what other people have stop me. I don't remember or know if they're kidding but every little word has stuck with me. I don't know if I still feel like this because it's normal and it's the emotion I go to when I'm alone since I blamed myself for the longest time. But I look at a rope, or knife, or an empty bottle of pills and think I could do it. Please do it. PLEASE. I don't know what to do. I don't know what I feel like this anymore. Am I right to feel worthless? I have a therapist but she can tell my mom if I tell her I want to harm myself. I don't want to tell my mom. I just don't. Recently I've been eating less on purpose. It's hard to do because my mom notices easily, but I feel like it's right for me. The pain feels good in a sick way. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
