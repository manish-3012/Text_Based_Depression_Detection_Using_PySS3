What if this is as good as it gets?I donâ€™t know why I am here. No matter what I do I canâ€™t escape the feeling that I will never amount to anything. Nothing I used to love interests me anymore. I depend on other people and activities for my happiness. I donâ€™t think I can be truly at peace with myself. I want to get better and I keep on trying but something always drags me back down. I desperately want to escape this rut and enjoy my last year of high school. But something inside of me keeps on saying that Iâ€™m destined to die young.
