Well, I know how to kill myself now if I need too. Right now I don't feel sucidal, I feel nothing.I found a store that sells fresh nutmeg, 100 grams (with shell) for 1.7 dollars. What a steal.

I got my dad to buy me 4. I'm gonna get high tomorrow off them. I've never been high and maybe getting high helps with loneliness.

I usally get 1-3 suicidal waves per day. A wave is a series of moderate to intense suicide thoughts on my definition.

Right now Im not sad but not happy. Not excited but not scared. Just kinda not anything. 

Lately I've been coping with loneliness and suicidal thoughts by making food but this is just the school break. When school starts again I'm gonna be feeling shit all the time. 

I don't know how to describe it. I can feel my muscles shrinking. Every workout I did is useless . I haven't exercised in few weeks because I'm so lazy. I hate this . 2 months for nothing. The muscle will turn into fat. I'm gonna get fat again and then eat nothing and become a skeleton more than i already am.

I'm getting bloated all the time because im a lazy piece of shit. I look fat but I have no muscles.i hate my body. I can't be confident when literally every guy in my class is more muscular than me by miles (and Even some girls).

I tried to bulk  . I defently got stronger and maybe a little bit more muscles and went to 10 pounds. 

But mostly fat... My cheekbones are invisible. But I'm still skinny but I'm fat.

No point in trying to gain weight anymore since I lost all the muscles because I am a lazy piece of shit who sat in bed all day instead of doing anything.

Its becoming more frequent that somedays I don't eat that much. I kinda lose appetite. I just don't feel like eating on some days.

I really don't know why I am alive. I have really nothing to live for. I'm probably just scared of death. 

Only thing I do is make food (my coocking skills aren't even that good) and play videogames. Nothing productive.

My grades are going down in most things. Hearing and reading english tests went very bad. I only got around C (I am expected and usally get B/A). And I got F in all spanish tests..... And I'm doing worse in everything.

I did get A in english writing and Math. But I kinda feel nothing. am supposed to be happy or what ? It's just a score...

I feel like it's all pointless.... Like this grades are just that .. grades. I don't even have any A's, I have few B's but still no A. 

I suck at literally every subject exept maybe math. But math is just one. 

My ego is getting bigger because I got A in math... I'm a selfish piece of shit who deserves to keep being isolated.

We have so many tests coming up... Physics , maths, biology (lol I don't even know what's coming up, we had substitute teacher all the time and he explained so poorly because all the students kept talking).

I wish I could study but I just kinds see no point.whats even the point of this post.

I just feel nothing. I don't know why. Why am I even alive? I don't really know... probably because I'm too afraid of death...
