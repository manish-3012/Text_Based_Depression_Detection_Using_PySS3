I Wish I Could Just Tell Everyone To Fucking Stop...So... First time talking about this to someone--- Or multiple people, depending on how many people click this. Now, before I even get into the reason I have quite literally attempted suicide I just want to say that when I'm depressed, talking to someone about this shit is the last thing I want to do, but I did gather the will to contact the Suicide Hotline and they did almost nothing. I told them my reasoning for wanting to die and it's almost as if they did not give a single care in the world, changing the topics constantly and misinterpreting everything that I tried to explain. So, I came out to my mom as transgender about a year ago, I told her I want to be a guy and that I simply hate looking at my body in the mirror. Her initial response wasn't the best but it was rather supportive! I was genuinely happy that she was taking this well because she was known to be homophobic at times. N o w, that alone should have been a red flag to keep it to myself. BUT OH NO, I had to open my big fucking mouth and ruin everything that was good in this deranged family. A few days later, she didn't bring it up again so I just shrugged it off as something that she needed to get used to, I mean-- I sure as hell wasn't going to assume that she'd be totally okay with it, I knew it was going to be a hard thing to get used to and I was making sure that she knew that I was there for her if she needed any support with this. Anyway, Few days later, I check her phone (( _Because back when she first got an Iphone I constantly checked her phone to make sure she didn't break it or something, she doesn't know how to use Iphones to this day..._ )) I see  notifications for  a rather 50-50 split of hate comments and comments that agree with a comment that she posted on Facebook. Out of curiosity, I check what it says, It says-- Don't quote me on this but I think it said something like, "Daughter just came out as a tranny or should I say, SON. disgusting" and then the comment went on explaining how fucked up society is. Now, I was heartbroken at this comment and got extremely pissed at my mother for posting this,  I didn't say anything to her but I have a feeling she knew that I saw it. 




Skip about a week and my mother and father were verbally fighting over me being me, I could  h e a r everything that my mother thought of me. How fucking disgusting I was. How she genuinely thought that I should be thrown into a pit of fire. I am not joking what-so-ever about the last bit, I broke into a full on mental-break-down when hearing this. For the sake of this post not being twenty pages long, skip a month or two, mom starts taking these pills. Dunno what pills, KepraRage likely, they were prescribed pills anyhow, but it made her aggressive. Very aggressive. Especially since she would drink a bottle of alcohol a day with the pills. KepraRage and Alchohol is a _big_ mistake.She would take her anger out on dad by yelling with all the windows open about me or money or some shit. When dad wasn't home she would nit-pick at anything she could to absolutely destroy my self-worth. It worked. Oh it fucking worked. "What are you going to do?! Huh?! Sew a dick on?!" I FUCKING WISH  _M O T H E R_ . BUT SADLY, SHIT DOESNT WORK LIKE THAT. Just... I... Dad had given up on trying to help her for a while so every time that father would head to work, I was stuck, alone, with her until he got home. I couldn't leave the house either, she wouldn't let me. No, She _P h y s i c a l l y_ would not let me. I tried to leave but she made a barrier with her body, I tried to push her out of the way but she pushed back. Hard. I went through this form of verbal abuse for months at a time, until one day she just.... Snapped? Dad got into a Serious verbal fight with her until it escalated to the point where she grabbed a fucking knife. I shit you not. So, me-- Being the dumb-ass that I am, got in-between the two to try to calm shit down. See, you don't believe that this happens until it happens in front of you. I never believed the stories when I was little that 'Person stabbed twenty times over an argument about Pokemon ((Or some shit)) ' Or something like that, but when you see it in front of you... Happening. *F u c k*. Luckily, nobody got stabbed and everyone survived. The police did absolutely nothing when they were called, simply had a talk with her but didn't arrest her or anything. The second time she pulled that, however, she did get arrested. Or... She w i l l. I'm still living with her until she does get jailed. Now, I'm not saying I'm happy that she's getting put in prison for what she pulled. But... That's exactly what I'm saying. I just... I feel like every time I say "I love you" to my family it's just empty words. Doesn't mean anything at all. If I could just not say it without it seeming rude, I wouldn't. She stopped drinking and taking those pills and she's calmed down now. But... I haven't. Doing what she did and saying what she said created an irreversible hatred towards her. Of course, I say I love her all the time but... I don't mean anything by it. I just.... Shit... Seeing that fucked me over... Big time.




 Skip a month and I was already feeling suicidal, I kept it in for the longest times until I just... Couldn't. One night I had an overwhelming feeling of my thoughts all jumbled and racing and usually, I could just watch a Youtube video to cheer me up... But, that night wasn't like that. I wasn't interested in what was on the screen, I couldn't focus on it. I knew that I needed help so I talked to my mother about it (( She's calmed down by now )) and she got me a therapist. But, it's like the therapist doesn't do anything. She sits there, just taking in everything I have to say but saying nothing in return. It's like talking to a brick wall. I need a response so I can actually progress with my thoughts, not just be talking to someone I don't know just to have a judgemental stare looking back at me.
  Oh, and another thing, mother is using everything I told her against me. I told her I hate my weight! Every s i n g l e time she observes me with a junk-food-like snack in my hand she goes out of her way to say something about it, sometimes she'll even list everything that I ate that day. Yup, she goes _t h a t_ out of her way to mess up my self-esteem. 
   I told her that I want to die! I want to hang myself with a cord! Her response, "Well, If you do it, you can't come back!" Then she walked away. She walked away saying nothing else but that. I am grasping at loose ends here trying to save myself and she isn't putting any effort in. Yeah, no shit I can't come back, that's kinda the point. Thanks for the encouragement.
Since I have only one friend (Yes, Only one) that will talk to me I don't really have anyone to go to, my friend has even brushed it my chronic depression and anxiety as a 'phase'. I'm surrounded by negative energy and I don't know what to do.




  I tried so hard to talk to mom again about how I felt and she didn't understand at all, saying, "Well, _Y o u_ made your life this way!"
 I was done.
Fucking done.
 I walked back into my room and started sobbing, covering my head with my blanket until my light suddenly turned on,
"No, you're not going to play this game with me, damn it! You can't just come _w h i n e_ to me and say it's all _m y_ fault! So, are you going to disobey me and lay there or are you going to come speak to me"
Now, I would have gotten up and spoke to her if she wouldn't have used the tone that she used. It was nine at night and she was yelling quite loudly at me that I was _w h i n i n g_  to her.
 So, opening up to her is considered whining?
 Thanks, mom.
Love you too.
I just... I can't go two nights anymore without wanting to suicide. Each time gets worse. It's gotten to the point where I write a suicide note and I just always back out of doing it in the end.



 I want to.
 I really want do.
 I just... Cant.
 One of these days though, I'm going to, and I'll only have myself to blame. I started this. Mom is one-hundred percent correct, I told her I wanted to be a guy, I started this. If I had just kept my mouth shut everyone would be happy. Fucks sake. I don't... I just... I don't want to anymore.
With life. With people. With my own fucking family.
She still posts things to this day to publicly humiliate me.
My dad does nothing.
My therapist does nothing.
 I can't talk to my friend about this because they think depression is just a phase and so is anxiety.
It's funny, mom had previously told me that she only married dad to get away from _her Mom_ . When I was younger she told me how horrid it was and how absolutely strict her mother was and how she promised me she could never treat me like that.
 Hows that promise goin' for you, mother?

I feel like I've lost everything, I hardly speak to my dad, my mother always is trying to mold me into the perfect little child that she wants and every time I objectify to her manipulation, she yells. It's like the only thing she knows how to do and knows she'll win. Dad always sides with her in the end, _always_ . I guess he feels the need to for some odd reason and leaves me singled out. I don't really have many friends so that's always a bummer. I've tried to treat my family as my friends (Even after everything) but they yell at me saying "We're not your friends, we are your parents!" Which, I understand. 




I mean, I have the everything I need to just... Off myself. Nobody pays attention to me that much, so I could definitely get away with it. Sorry if this was a mess, sorry if this was too long and sorry if you read through this. It's just... You never believe people like her exist until you see them in person.
