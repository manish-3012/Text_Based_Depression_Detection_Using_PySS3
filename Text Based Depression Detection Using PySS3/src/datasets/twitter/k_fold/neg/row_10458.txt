Been trying26/f. Iâ€™ve been trying for so long to get my shit together. My mental illness prevents it and I just canâ€™t take it anymore. Every guy Iâ€™ve loved left me the last guy knew me for 6 years we met up after A long time apart and he was so in love with me still.. after we hung out for a few weeks he left me with no explanation. We broke up originally in 2014 but he was a huge part of my life and meant so much to me as a friend losing him as both just killed me. I donâ€™t think I can do this anymore... Iâ€™m sitting in a hotel and all I wanna do is end it. I feel bad for complaining.
