i feel so drainedusing my other account that i use for nsfw purposes because i am scared that people will harass me and call me a, â€œkarma whore.â€
and serious apologies for the formatting i am on mobile.

i have had therapy for around 3-4 months by now and i have been making progress if i do say so myself, but recently i lost all that progress. 

i am suddenly back to being a perfectionist, back to missing my ex who cheated on me, back to being the most unmotivated fuck in the existence of humanity. 

i am an online student who is transferring to a new school soon and the principal told me to finish all my work by May 30. as important as this task is, i canâ€™t get myself to do it. the fact that i am back to thinking about a girl who harmed me and me losing all my progress from therapy feels like utter hell. i feel so unmotivated to do anything. my antidepressants are slowly turning into nothing but a waste. the thoughts of self harm and suicide are slipping back in and i am so scared. 

i am back to square one and i feel worthless. i am not loved and i donâ€™t deserved to be loved. i am just a speck in a huge sea of intelligent people and i am not one of them.

i am so worthless and scared.
