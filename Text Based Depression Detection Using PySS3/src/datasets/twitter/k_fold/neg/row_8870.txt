I'm broken and lonelyI don't like people, but i need them to hold off loneliness, i hate humanity as a whole, but i need to live around them. I'm so tired and defeated when it comes to looking for people to talk to nobody understands, hardly any relate to me as a person, i want to die, yet i can't do it. I found that out when i held a firearm to my head, loaded and safety off, i needed to see what i would do, i wrote a note just in case, i could barely hold it to my head for kust over a second, and i had to force myself to do that. I have no outlets, just loneliness and self hatred. I don't expect anything to come of this post, i'm just hoping writing it out helps for this particular moment
