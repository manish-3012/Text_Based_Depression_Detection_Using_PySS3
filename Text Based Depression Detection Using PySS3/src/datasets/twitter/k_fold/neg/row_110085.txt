I Give up......I'm 17 years old (male) and nothing seems right I don't know what to do anymore. I have herpes and i'm a virgin I never had sex before or a girlfriend. I'm not that bad looking but im to scared to talk to them because of the std I have. Idk how i got the std I think someone gave it to me when I was a little kid..... I also have very few friends and don't go out much :( . I feel like i don't belong here all my cousins don't want to hang out with me my sister hates me my parents don't care I just feel alone. I Didn't had a chance to ruin my life because it was already ruined with this std and an outbreak happens every month. 
I just feel lost. FUCK THIS!
