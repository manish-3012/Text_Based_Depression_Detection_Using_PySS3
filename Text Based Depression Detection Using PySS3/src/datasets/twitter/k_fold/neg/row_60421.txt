I'm Starting to Lose Interest in the Things I Normally Enjoy.Everything I typically like doing seems boring and pointless. I don't have motivation to try new things. I feel like I'm on autopilot most of the time. I think about killing myself just so I'm not so bored... sometimes I feel like I'm losing everything around me that I care about.. I think that has a lot to do with losing interest in things I love.  I'm not sure. I need to know that I'm not alone and that this is just a phase or something.
