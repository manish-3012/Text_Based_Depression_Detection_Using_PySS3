Considering driving to beachy headI don't want this to be some long angsty piece of shit, so I'll keep it short. I don't have anyone I can talk to so I'm just getting this off my chest.

I'm 30 in six months. Male, if it matters. In the last two years I've lost my SO (that's what people say nowadays, isn't it?), my dog, three jobs, had a car crash, my grandparents died unexpectedly within days of each other. I've moved home four fucking times. I'm in financial ruin.

The bank is demanding money I simply do not have. I cannot pay my rent or my bills. I have tried desperately to find work. I was offered a really good position managing a warehouse, but then I had the car crash and now my knee doesn't work properly, so I couldn't take the job. My savings have run out. My credit is gone. My knee fucking hurts. Sometimes I can barely drive to the shops. Just because some prick things checking his phone is that fucking important (I apologise for the language. I type how I think, what can I say, anger consumes me).

I'm considering going to beachy head today. It's a 600ft cliff. I know that it will not hurt. You don't even perceive the last six seconds because you are falling so fast your brain cannot process the visual information at that point. 

I'm not scared. I know what physical pain is. And I know what psychological pain is. Death must be better than this.

I'm not sure there is any reason for this particular journey to continue. I don't see a way out of this. I can only see myself becoming homeless in the very near future.

I'm not sure I did anything to deserve this. I'm not the best person. But I did what was asked of me. Attended a fine university, did the whole 'look at me in my suit ma' thing. Had relationships, contributed, paid my fucking taxes.

And here I am. Alone, desperate, destitute. What the fuck happened.
