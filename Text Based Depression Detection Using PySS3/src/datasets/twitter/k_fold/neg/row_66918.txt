I donâ€™t know what to doSomething happened on my brotherâ€™s birthday last year. I was lied to by someone I trusted more than life itself and a item of mine was stolen by the same person. I feel guilty because sometimes I feel like I deserve this pain. Like sometimes itâ€™s pathetic to feel this way over something so dumb. People are suicidal because theyâ€™ve gone through actual trauma or things that can scar someone and Iâ€™m sitting depressed and suicidal because someone steals from me and everyone leaves me behind. Iâ€™m a stepping stool in all of my friends and familyâ€™s lives. I was trying to sleep and it hits me. Every wrong thing that person did to me. Whenever I think of them I think of one of my old friends. She was sweet, pretty, lovable, and kind. She runs away from me now. Canâ€™t stand to be near me. She moved on and Iâ€™m still crying about it. But I remember her saying, â€œIâ€™ll always be better than you.â€
I used to scratch myself every time someone told me a lie. Itâ€™s so pathetic, the person I trusted apologized to me only once, and didnâ€™t even tell his parents. After everything my family has done for him? He once pushed me down into a metal pipe because he didnâ€™t want to return something he found that was not his. He disgusts me in every way possible. I can write a book about everyone whoâ€™s wronged me in some way. One of my friends told me I should kill myself. They said that I ruin everything and I was better off in a six foot grave. She didnâ€™t even have the guts to tell me to my face.
