idkNever had any friends, never had any ambitions, years of solitude led to my personality dying out due to the lack of social encounters. I don't know who I am anymore nor why I am alive. At this point my mindset differ so much from the norm that people would find it hard to wrap their head around my perspective on the world. I can no longer function as a part of my society thus I see no point in being alive.
