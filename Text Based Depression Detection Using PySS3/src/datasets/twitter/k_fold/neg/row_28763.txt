How do you handle the nagging belief that death would be preferable.I graduated college last spring and still havenâ€™t been able to launch a career. Just going from freelance gig to gig, feeling degraded and useless about the work I find myself doing. Purposes menial work. On top of that Iâ€™m engaged. Sheâ€™s the sweetest thing Iâ€™ve ever met, but sometimes I canâ€™t share my struggles or hurts with her because she feels guilty or hurt when I try. I slowly feel my circle of friends shrinking, loneliness creeps in, and I just wonder why put myself through a relentless assault of worry and anxiety every damn day. Me and my fiancÃ© are currently separated geographically for work related reasons, and not seeing her face really makes it easy to consider a jump off a bridge or into traffic. I scare myself how much I consider killing myself. How do I push through?
