Looking for information related to survivors of SuicideThis page has been a great help to me in the past when I was in a very dark place and I am glad for it. I am in the process of trying to write about how my suicide would have effected my family and friends and was looking for any suggestions of books, anthologies or sites that will help me understand it better. I have talked a lot with my wife but want to see how others dealt with the aftereffects of suicide. Thanks in advance.
