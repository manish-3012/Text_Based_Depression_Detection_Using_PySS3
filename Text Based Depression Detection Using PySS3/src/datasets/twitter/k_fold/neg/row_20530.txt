A vent.Hello. First off, I don't think I've ever seriously considered suicide, but I feel like I'm heading towards it. I'm 24, male. Ive quit highschool, had only 2 jobs (currently unemployed). I don't have a sad story. I have an amazing loving family, without exception, which care for me not only financially but also emotionally. My mom is one of the most amazing loving persons you'd be lucky to meet. The fact that my life is so great makes me hate myself even more. I feel like a piece of shit, worthless. I'd hate to cause more pain to my family, but Ive been "living" this life for the past 9 years. Since I quit highschool I isolated myself. Don't know why I quit, or why i isolated myself. I'm tired of just watching time pass by for these 9 years, but I can't have a stable job, or commit to anything, really. Like I said, I don't think I'd kill myself, but more and more I'm getting fed up. I sometimes honestly hope that I'd have the courage to kill myself. Cause momentary pain to my family, but freeing them from the burden of me.
