Help, i am so lonely.. (adhd, autism)i no doubt have ADHD and autism, get called drunk or daydreaming even when i am trying hard to look like i am focused, i cant read body language, i am awkward asf, i am failing school, i cant focus around people at class or focus at all. I never have anyone to talk to in rl about my feelings and opinions because i am unexpressive in rl. My life was hell until i was 10, when i found a virtual world game online, where i felt comfortable at, i made alot of friends there, the game where i could express myself. the game where i could be someone i couldn't be in real life. and 99% of my best memories are there, for 7 years. but i knew i cant rely on this game forever to make friends or interact with people through text forever and live on the textures of the game.. and then now i got banned from the game, all my efforts gone, all the people, everything.. just vanished. now i am stuck back in reality, nowhere to hide or run away to. i know this is good, its going to shut down one day anyways. Now, i realized i have no One in life. i am just different, a square born in a world of circles. I dont know whats there to live anymore. in my mind right now, death can set me free from this illusion called life
