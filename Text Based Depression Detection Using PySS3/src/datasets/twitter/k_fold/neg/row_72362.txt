Feel like I've done so much damage to this world and peopleI really actively do try to be a good person and do what I can to amend my ways and help people out and make things right all the time but I think I'm past the point of any type of redemption.

Reflecting on my past I realize there are multiple instances of being in someway abusive. Being a drunk creep, not going about consent in the best way, allowing my emotions to cloud my judgement in relationships and end up being an asshole. Every person I've felt like I've wronged I've reached out to them if I can and they've seemed forgiving (or didn't know what I was talking about) but I can't shake it that I don't deserve to be here and I am lying to everyone and everyone I love and everyone that loves me.

I've been trying to get a therapist/help but my town is so hard to get one in and I just feel like I'm at the end of my rope for myself and the world would be better without me
