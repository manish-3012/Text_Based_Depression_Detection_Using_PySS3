HelloIâ€™m scared because today is the first time Iâ€™ve felt like suicide is really the only option. Until now, I think it was just ideation. Iâ€™m getting closer to it everyday and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be able to hold on very long. 

Itâ€™s something deep within me thatâ€™s just wrong, and not normal. I just wanted someone to care and protect me but I donâ€™t think normal people have time for people like us. When I try to reassure myself, I just feel so disgusted with myself.

I hope youâ€™ll find a way out. Lots of love to everyone.
