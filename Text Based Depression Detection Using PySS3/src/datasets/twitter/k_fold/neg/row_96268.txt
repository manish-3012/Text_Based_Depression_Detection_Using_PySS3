Iâ€™m thinking of doing it in the next few daysI tried to reach out for help and everyone I came to closed the door in my face. I think this might be my last cry for help.
No one likes me or will even talk to me. I have always tried to be kind to everyone and I donâ€™t understand why they feel this way about me. The people I thought were my friends donâ€™t even like me.
My life is in shambles and I donâ€™t have the strength to go on anymore. 
I kept going for my family but that will is running out.
