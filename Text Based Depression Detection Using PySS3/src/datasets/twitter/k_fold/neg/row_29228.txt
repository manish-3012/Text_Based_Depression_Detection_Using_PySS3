I'm a loser Lost everything I have nobody.  The people that I thought loved me were just using me  Everyone just uses me.  I'm angry at God every morning waking up because he woke me up   I'm addicted to opiates I use speed  The addiction is turned me into a fucking liar and a thief I'm just an all-around fucking loser waste of oxygen just so fucking stupid    I just want to end it
