I wish I was normal and happy like everyone elseI dont feel like a homo sapiens anymore. It's like I'm a different species. I don't have any friends. I don't have any friends because I have avoidant personality disorder/ extreme anxiety, and my mind is mostly completely blank when someone tries to talk or interact with me. Like, I just can't find anything to say. Noises bother me and usually I can't hear properly. My voice is very low when talking to someone. I don't even really talk to my family. They just annoy me, especially my dad. I don't think they even cared about me at all. They raised me like shit. For example when I was like 6, my dad got very angry with me for some reason, went to my room and distributed my room and made thngs messy. Also when he shouted and threatened me, I would cry and he would say "Please cry more, I can't hear you" in a mocking voice over and over. These are just some examples from shitty, miserable life. There's so much more why I'm depressed but that would make it an even longer post.
