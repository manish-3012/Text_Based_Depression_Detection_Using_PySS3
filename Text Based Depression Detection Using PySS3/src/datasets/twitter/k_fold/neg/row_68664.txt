I donâ€™t know what to do anymore...Right now Iâ€™m a little under 18 and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I have very severe depression, anxiety, adhd, most likely ptsd, and possibly bipolar although doctor never confirmed but said it was definitely a possibility. Right now my life is unbearably bad. Every day is so grueling and bad Iâ€™m having a hard time not committing suicide. I actually have a small possibility to have a good life when I get a lot older but even then with how bad my mental condition is I donâ€™t know if i could even enjoy it. After trying so many medications and going to so many doctors nothing works and the doctors canâ€™t help and in a lot of cases donâ€™t even care believe it or not. Iâ€™ve resulted in taking many drugs to try to cope and even psychedelic medicines which didnâ€™t really work for my condition. Iâ€™ve thought of just committing suicide but I know my parents just could never cope and would hurt them to much. Every direction I look Iâ€™m totally f****d and see nothing but a living hell. The only thing that helps me handle my condition is canabis. For a while I would smoke a little through out the day and I would be able to think clearly and I wouldnâ€™t go off the rails and my depression wouldnâ€™t be bad but my parents busted me and are completely against it. ever since my life went back to being a constant living hell. I donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™m going to be able to stay alive. If anyone has a idea on what I can do please tell me. These episodes are getting to unbearable to live through.
