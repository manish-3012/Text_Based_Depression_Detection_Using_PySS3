Not sure what I want to doI've battled depression as long as I can remember, I've had my ups and downs and tried every medicine known to man with little actual results. Most days I manage ok. I had one suicide attempt as a teenager, I took a bunch of Tylenol pm and other pills and still have no idea how I survived that with no ill effects. Lately I've been struggling more, but something happened that has kind of pushed me to the edge. 

I was in a difficult relationship, recently I ended it and my ex flipped out. He sent me pictures of him loading his gun, blaming me and telling me I was making it easy for him to make the decision to use it on himself. He did not kill himself, part of me knows that he was manipulating me and trying to make me feel bad for him.

The whole incident has left me feeling so bad. I found myself going through my medicines last night and counting how many I had. It would be super easy for me to get in the car and drive to a place I know, take them all and let the water wash me away. I don't think I can go through with it but the thoughts are constantly there. 

I'm not even sure why I'm posting this, I can't tell anyone in my life how I feel. I think they would flip out. I will not put my ex in the position he put me in, that's just wrong. He wants to talk it out and I just don't think I can. There are lines you just don't cross, and to me what he did was beyond rhe limits of what I can get past. 

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.
