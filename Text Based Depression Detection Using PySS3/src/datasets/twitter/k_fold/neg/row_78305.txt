Iâ€™m just so sadI feel sad every day. I feel like Iâ€™m losing my memory and my mind. Iâ€™ve struggled with depression and severe anxiety for my entire life but itâ€™s never been so bad. I have a good life, good friends, a successful career, but deep down I feel only misery. I just donâ€™t like anything.  I decided a long time ago, while I was experiencing a true moment of happiness and peace, that I would never kill myself and the strength of that conviction has gotten me through a lot of hard times and many years. But lately I feel like Iâ€™m surrounded by shadow. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to die but Iâ€™m sick of enduring the pain, sadness, and constant worrying. I know Iâ€™m self-sabotaging but I canâ€™t stop it. It feels like Iâ€™m on a runaway train. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this or what Iâ€™m looking for. But I guess writing these thoughts out is cathartic in its own way. Does anyone else feel like I feel? Did any of you feel like this in the past? How did you get through it?
