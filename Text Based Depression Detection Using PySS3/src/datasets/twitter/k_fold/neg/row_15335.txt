No one believes youâ€™re suicidal until after youâ€™re gone- so whatâ€™s the point in asking for help?Especially as a girl. First you hint at it, in the way we hint at everything. Okay, next step. We explicitly say weâ€™re suicidal. Silence, oh I made you uncomfortable? Iâ€™m sorry. Boyfriend literally stops talking for the rest of the call, we fall asleep. Next we say â€œI donâ€™t want to be hereâ€, because weâ€™re feeling suicidal this very moment and we need help. â€œNothing bad is happening, though.â€ Next, an attempt. Because it was just an attempt, it was just for attention. I didnâ€™t REALLY mean to do that, of course. Well whatâ€™s next? Where do we go from here? Recovery, since everything was for attention? You tell me
