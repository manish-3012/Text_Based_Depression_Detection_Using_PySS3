Realized I'm mentally retarded,can't handle this.I knew I had aspergers and was different my whole life but never really accepted it by looking at how other people act.

Just recently I started to try to learn math to go to college and its what triggered my awareness when I struggled to do 6th grade math , shit a 10 year old can do .


Now I know I'll always be poor because I'm not capable of learning and I'm to clumsy for manual labor


I'm researching jumping as my method and try to find local buildings which are 10 story's plus.

I hate how normal people waste their lives away when I don't even have a life to waste . they can go to college and be whatever they want to be but I can't.


I hate this.  Its so unfair and I wish I was never aware .

I want to go back to being unaware. I hate this so much..


Fucking normal people I hate them so much.  And then they judge me on how I spend my autism bucks , fick them . I want to work and make my own money but I can't . I hate being retarded so much
