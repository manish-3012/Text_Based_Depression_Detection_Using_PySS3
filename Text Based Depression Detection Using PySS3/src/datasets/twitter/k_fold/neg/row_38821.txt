So I'm going to kill myself.I have fucked everything. I have fucked my final year at university academically and socially. I got rid of a wonderful man on a whim and have ruined everything. I have lost the good relationship I have with my family and with my mum dead I feel it's only going to get worse and we'll drift further and further apart. I am going to die. I can hear friends laughing down the corridor. They have no idea what's about to happen. I thought someone should know.
