Tired of being a victimI can't keep pretending I'm okay. After I was sexually assaulted I told myself that things would get better over time. Nothing has, though. Nothing's going to be the same anymore, I've come to realize. I'm never going to be ok again. I can either keep pretending otherwise, or I can accept that and take action. And the only action I think will really solve this is my death. No more pain or fear or shame or any of the bullshit that's consumed me since this happened. I'm tired of being a victim, and I want out.
