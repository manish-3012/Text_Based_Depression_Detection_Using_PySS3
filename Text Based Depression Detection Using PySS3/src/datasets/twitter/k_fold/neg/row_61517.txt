I can't get out of my headI'm always scared that people are talking about me and that no one actually wants me around. It's gotten to the point where I dont trust anyone and when I'm rejected, even if it's just they have other plans, I spiral and end up wanting to die. I don't know how to get out of my head and not take everything as the world is against me...
