The grass is always greener...I thought I'd be happier when I got my license.  Not really.  I thought I'd be happier when I turned 18.  Nope.  I thought even being at community college would make me happier than I was in high school.  Nope.  And now, I'm finally realizing that the same is going to happen at normal college too. I'm going to get there, and my life will be just as shitty.  Every day will be spent inside with little to no human contact outside of the Internet, I won't make friends, I won't find a girlfriend (who'd stay with a loser anyway?), and I'm never gonna bring myself to die.  I'll never be able to get myself to do anything about my problems.  I'm stuck in this rut, hating life and myself, waiting for nothing as my mind slowly tears itself apart, and whenever any changes come along, it will never be enough.
All I can do is wait until I get a lucky break or until I snap and kill myself, and this waiting is just worse than the depression itself.  I'm so lost...
