Question about a methodIâ€™m wondering if anyone would know if I took a 3 inch nail and a Ramset powder actuated nail gun (it uses .22 blanks to drive nails through concrete) and drove said nail into my temple or forehead would it actually kill me? Itâ€™s either that or â€œborrowâ€ a nitrogen canister from work and make an exit bag. However I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s pure nitrogen or not as itâ€™s for HVAC work and may be a mix that would ruin my attempt by only making me lightheaded. I also could just take a big ass helium tank from the same job and use that since I know thatâ€™s pure helium and itâ€™s an inert gas as well so itâ€™d work equally well. Itâ€™s just harder to drag a huge fucking tank of helium out of the office during work hours and up a flight of stairs into my apartment. The nitrogen is at least compact so if itâ€™s pure thatâ€™s my preferred option, Iâ€™d just have to wait till after work next Monday for that option.
