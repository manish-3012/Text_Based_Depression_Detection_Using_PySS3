My psychosis is literally killing me.To be honest, i don't really know why i'm posting here, i just want to talk a bit i guess ? I'm sorry... I just feel so lonely and i got nobody to talk to.

Just for some context, i'm 17 years old. And i already did 4 suicide attempt in the past few months


Like i said in the title, my psychosis is killing me, i've also been diagnosed with MDD and severe anxiety disorder, so yeah. At this point i have a date and everything is ready so i can properly kill myself. And i honestly don't have a single clue of what i can do, i'm clueless. I also struggle with self harm.


I just can't live like this anymore, i can't live while i'm hearing voices over and over, it's unbearable. I'm too weak for that. So i tried to reach professional help, and you know what ? They didn't took my psychosis and intense suicidal thoughts seriously, so i got absolutely nothing, zero help. Am i hated by life or what ? I guess 4 suicide attempt in a short amount of time isn't enough. At this point it's getting ridiculous. And i know that if one person will comment on this post will say that i should seek help again, but for some reasons i can't seek help until the 22 October. And the date i've setup is before that. And i can't really postpone it. And i can't rush to the ER either. So i don't have many options but to kill myself.


Am i just destined to kill myself ? I probably should stop running away from my fate, i can't really escape it.
