I'm slowly fucking my life upI'm gonna be quick about this, I think I'm losing my will to live. (Tl;Dr down)
Some years back, I got a crush on a girl for long 2 years, and even got rejected once, but still loved her (Let's call her Laura) for some reason in the last school day (to be more specific 12/06/2017,I just can't forget it) she confessed to me, and it was the happiest day of my existence, we dated for about 1 and a half year, I told her every single secret I had and I was really in deep love i would write love poems for her and all that shit, but everything that goes up goes down. I grew up in a tough family, since I was like 5 my parents would fight, like, really fight, and it would happen multiple times a week, and this is really a trauma to me, because I heard so many horrible things as a kid, and kept hearing them until I was like 11-12 when they divorced.When I got older my brother told me one of them had cheated on each other and that's why all the fighting happened.
Since I got to know that, cheating has really got into my mind, I can say that it's my biggest fear, I'm horrified just by the thought of being cheated on, and Laura knew that, I'm sure of it. I think you know where we are going, right ?
Well, one day I skipped class cause I was sick, and a friend sent me a video after class, of her with a guy and by the way it was happening for some time...
It destroyed me, completely, the person I loved more than myself, did exactly what I told her not to, then I called her, and told her I knew what she was doing and that I wanted to break up, (this was in 12/01/2018) then I instantly hang up and turned off my phone.
The next day at school, she was crying her eyes out telling me she was sorry, but i had taken a lot more prozac than I should, so I just told her "Yeah,right" and left, didn't even looked at her
That mouth I did things like trying to overdose, cut, punch the wall and all kinda shit like that, and I avoided dates and girls in general for a long time, to be honest, I haven't kissed anyone since then.
After some time I got trough it, but with a cost, i became numb, I didn't fell pleasure in doing things that used to be fun, I had found difficult to get out of bed in the morning (still do), I don't trust anyone anymore so I didn't have friends/girlfriends and and honestly I didn't wanted to find any, but I lost so many incredible people just for this, and I find it incredibly hard to generally do things, I used this "emotion" to study, telling myself that if I got to my dream collage this felling would stop, but I ignored it for so much time it became worse, I got into my dream collage and I was between the Top 10 in my state, but I find it so hard to get up and go to the collage, I don't fell any pleasure in going there, I like the classes, teachers and I'm kinda ok with the no friends thing, but my grades have been dropping and i have been missing so many classes and I have been through so many depressive crisis and I have tried suicide twice in 3 months, and I'm losing my will to do anything at all, j just wanna be in bed and forget everything
What do ?




Tl;Dr:The girl I loved for years cheated on me even after me saying it was my biggest fear, now I'm into my dream collage but I cant find joy in living
