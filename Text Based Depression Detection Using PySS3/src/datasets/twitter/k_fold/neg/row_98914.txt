sick of iti am sick of chronic pain 
i am sick of the soul crushing loneliness that has been with me since my childhood
i am sick of being used as a punching bag by others and being told im unloved
i am sick of lying to make someone else smile
i am sick of crying myself to sleep and enjoying it
i am sick of pretending im someone else and then waking up
i am sick of imagining a future that i will never ever get
i dont want this
im scared and want to run away and get stabbed i dont fucking know
ive come to realise that ill only be loved in my death
i killed my own personality and mutilated the corpse
and the pain makes me want to rip out my heart 
i may as well say to the one person who said they loved me; you wont be forgiving me for this and im the most selfish and vile bitch for doing this to you
i love you even if you wont love me afterwards
