Not sure why to keep going onI've never really had goals, realistic or otherwise. For my whole life I've been told to do what is expected of me, school, college, job, marriage, kids, then die at some point, I'm not really sure why I'd do any of that as I have no genuine interest in it, the only reason I do these things is some kind of deep emotional push to not let them down because they are my parents which fades the more I am away from them. I never really do anything other than sleep and go to school, the last time i was with "friends" outside of school is around ten years ago now, and I haven't the slightest clue how to start doing that again as all this time on the internet has molded this extremist purist type of view of other people that is incredibly hard to break, somehow at one point various girls have taken a liking to me over the past few years and were very consistent about making physical contact with me on many occasions, I never really had long conversations with these girls and the second I might get around to speaking with them I just tense up and do nothing, overall this is just some rant for nobody, I can't find the courage in me to commit suicide as that strange emotional need to not let down my parents is still lingering, for the past few years I was talking about moving to russia permanently with them, and maybe I could do it there, as far as they would know I moved to some remote area of russia and i would make sure they have no way to contact me.
