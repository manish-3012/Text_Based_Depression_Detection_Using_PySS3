Don't even recognize myself in the mirror anymore.I realize it's my body, but my perception of myself is my conscience now. I don't think of myself as a person anymore, because I think suicidally way too much. I'll just look in the mirror and all I can see are my eyes. They look fucking tortured. My face is irrelevant. It's just an empty husk. I want to end it, but I can't. I want to end it so desperately. But too many people love me, or at least I think they do. It's probably pretty entitled for me to think that way. I don't want to put more people in the place that I'm in.
