I just want to dieGeneric ass title.

I'm stuck. Same toxic friends. Same toxic parent's house. Same soul sucking job.

.. There's no time to pursue my dreams. I had such a simple dream, but life just hands me suffering all the time. I'm done man. I'm sick of hearing how it might change someday, cuz I don't really believe in waiting. I know I should kill myself cuz really I'm not good enough. And that's the truth, I'm not trying to be dramatic.

I look at all the people that inspire me, and there's NO hope of ever being that great. Living in India is like a curse. You get toxic parents who tell you who to be. You get toxic friends who treat you like you're Satan if you even suggest you don't like tradition or the shit you're expected to do. And you don't have space to do what you want. It's time to kill myself. I'm not sure if I should cut my wrist or try carbon monoxide poisoning. What's a surer way to go?
