Suicide is a very viable and logical option for me to take.I am not sure if this is the right sub to post because I don't think I'm suicidal as I post this... But the last few months I've been thinking more and more about committing suicide. 

I don't think I feel sad and I don't really have any major issues in my life. I have food, shelter, I'm studying at college. All I know is that living and life itself isn't really something that I like taking part in. I don't like the obligations I have in life such as relationships, jobs, money etc. The construct of our society is built upon survival and money and things that will always lead to stress. There is always pressure. As long as a human has obligation and needs, there is always a longing and stress to fulfill those needs. I honestly can't be fucked with that stress and pressure. 

If I had it my way I'd just chemically induce contentment via drugs and substances for as much time as I could because I truly believe that is the only way to be alive and not have
a worry in the world at the same time. However, that needs money, so it isn't really viable since it would be contradictory. Sleeping is the only time I get to catch a break from life. So the more I think about it, the closest thing to a permanent sleep is suicide. It honestly seems like the most logical and fitting solution for me and I really am considering it.

Anyway, just posting in here for people's thoughts on the matter because it is obviously a massive decision and I need to consider the pros AND cons. I can't seem to find many cons and this sub is practically designed for that purpose so yeah.
