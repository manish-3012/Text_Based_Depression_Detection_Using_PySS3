I want to die and I don't have any one to talk to.I am Bipolar.  Recently, I have had to spend a lot of time alone.  My husband has started a new job and I never really get to see him any more because we are on opposite work schedules.  My family does not live close to me.  I am not close enough to them either to call and talk about how terrible I feel. I have friends but none of them that I feel I can tell about this.  I feel like I have no one at all. 

I was thinking about calling the suicide hotline however, in the past they sent the cops to my room to check on me and it only made me feel worse. It was scary. I lived in college dorms at the time and people saw them coming to my room to check on my.  It was traumatizing. I never want to call them again. 

I just do not want to feel so alone in the world anymore. No one understands me. No one is ever going to understand me. I haven't stopped crying all day.  Most of the websites that I have looked at say that people who want to commit suicide do not really want to die.  They just want pain relief.  I do not fit into this category.  I truely want to die.  There is nothing in this world for me.  I work all the time.  I have no close friends. This is not what I thought life would be like.
