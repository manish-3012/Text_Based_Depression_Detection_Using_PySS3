ADHD spiralling out of control, failing at everything, just let me die and leave a pretty corpseI wrote a long post but that would probably doxx myself so I'll just say I'm having a bad day.

My sister lost her hearing aid and I can't afford to replace it. Her first day of school is in January and she can't communicate properly. She isn't great at signing or lip reading yet, she's only 5. It's not the biggest most catastrophic thing in the world, but watching her struggle without it is really breaking my heart. She was so looking forward to being a big kid and going to school, and now her first months will be an incomprehensible nightmare.

I have bills to pay that I can't pay because the rent was put up. My ADHD and anxiety's through the roof and I can't talk to anyone. Not that I have anyone.

My brother's possibly depressed and has been avoiding me. I think something happened with his girlfriend, she might've wrecked his pride and joy gaming laptop, but he won't say anything.

There's a leak in the bathroom wall. Don't know how to begin to fix it.

I left the rubbish bin open, my dog went in and swallowed a tampon, so he might die.

I might be depressed, or just mired in the reality that everything sucks. Today my sister got so frustrated that she smashed a glass and hit me. My brother didn't even look up or help me clean up, which hurts too.

I wish I had a capable parent, an SO, a friend, anyone who would swoop in and save me, and I hate myself for wishing that.
