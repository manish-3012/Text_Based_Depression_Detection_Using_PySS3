One of my friends online is considering suicideOne of my online friends is considering suicide. He has been telling me that he has been depressed recently and that he is losing his will to live. He just sent me this message through discord

"Im tired of  faking myself, I act a certain because they like it, no one likes me for me, they like me for my desperation and need to feel like I belong somewhere, the reason I keep leaving at random is because I don't want to say goodbye, so instead I just leave and pretend it's an internet problem. I don't expect you to forgive me, I just want you to know I'm sorry
the feeling of my life being nothing but a routine, I do nothing, I sit at home playing video games, and when school starts, I'll slave away doing things I don't care about.
I've lost my passion, my will to live"

This is the first time anything like this has happened to anyone I know. I am too young to do anything about this, and I don't have any real life contacts with him. If there's anything I can do to help him, please tell me.
