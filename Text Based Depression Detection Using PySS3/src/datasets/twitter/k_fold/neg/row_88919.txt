Needing adviceHey guys how are you, so basically my situation is I'm 12 and I moved away from my hometown for about a year during then i started fighting with my mom and her asshole boyfriend so I moved in with my dad and i feel the same really minus the fighting I was confused because I was deppressed because I moved but i came back still deppressed and i would consider myself popular at school but I do have people who wont leave me alone because who i used to be and I would fight them because if I do I'll go back to juvi and I don't want to and like i said they won't leave me alone calling me a pussy and shit and i told them i hope they feel good there the reason i cut myself and tried to kill myself a few times and they say i dont care i just got put on antidepressants but i feel like it's all bullshit or I'm just soft what do you guys say?
