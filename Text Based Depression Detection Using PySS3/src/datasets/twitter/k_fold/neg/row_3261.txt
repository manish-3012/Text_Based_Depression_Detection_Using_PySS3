What am i supposed to do?Looking for ways to help me sleep at night as my depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts make it nearly impossible for me. This has been an extremely rough year for me, and althought ive been depressed and suicidal in the past it has never been as it has the last 5 months. I absolutely can not get away from the thought of suicide - i literally think about it multiple times a day everyday.. I wake up everyday barely able to peel myself from my bed to take care of my 2 kids, my boyfriend and father of one of my children essentially hates me and could really care less if i live or die. Ive lost my therapist due to covid, and i just dont even know what to do anymore to make it bareable to keep existing in this world. I just want die but stay i here for my kids. BUT, its just a horrible cycle of guilt that eats me up knowing that im such a worthless piece of shit to ever consider leaving them to begin with, (especially as one of my childrens father is already dead himself) which in turn just makes me want to die even more. I feel so alone and like i have just absolutely no one who isnt willing to toss me aside when its convenient for them. I always come second to someone/something, I have basically no family or anyone that really cares about me, and a shitload of childhood trauma caused by the family i do have. I wish i could just shut my eyes and never wake up but i know this life is my reality and i will get 2 hours of sleep tonight so i can wake up and do it all over again tomorrow. Any tips and suggestions of help for sleep or coping with these thoughts will be greatly appreciated.
