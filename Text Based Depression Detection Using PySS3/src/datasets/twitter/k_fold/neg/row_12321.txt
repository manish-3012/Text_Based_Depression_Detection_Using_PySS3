Iâ€™m 28 and I donâ€™t have any more reasons to live for. 

For the last several years, I was smoking weed, and somehow coping with all the shit that is in my head. After the 1,5 month quarantine and taking Xanax to cope with the chaos inside my head, weed stopped working on me, it just doesnâ€™t take the edge off like it used to do.

I guess this was the moment when everything started falling and the reality started to settle in.

Iâ€™m sitting now alone and empty in my condo, and I canâ€™t take anymore all the overthinking, maniacal episodes, and depression after. Iâ€™m just so dead inside that I canâ€™t change anything about it.

Whole my life I was an outsider, even when I was living in a small village, all the kids at school treated me like I was an alien, they even told me once to my face that I must be from another planet. I just wanted to belong and be like other people. To live normally without drastic overthinking and overwhelming ambitions that are destroying me every day of my life.

I was trying to fill the hole that I have inside with buying all kinds of shit throughout my young adult years, it was working for some time I can't lie, but at some point, it stopped making happy.

I just wanna love, and have someone that will be there for me no matter what, but it seems impossible at this point.

I just wanna die, hell I would be dead already, but I don't want to hurt my mother.
