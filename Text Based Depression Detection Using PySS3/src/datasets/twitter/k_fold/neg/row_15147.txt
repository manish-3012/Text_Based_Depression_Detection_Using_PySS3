I (23F) can't stop doing crazy bullshit and it's ruining my life.I'm sitting here spun as fuck feeling very lost and fragile after yet another manic episode in which I have done everything in my power to ruin my life.

I'm a 23F and was diagnosed at 14 with Bipolar Type 1. It has ruled my life ever since and even though I have an exceptionally fulfilling, successful career and love what I do my personal life seems to often fall to pieces because of my drastic mood swings.

I've been hospitalised, tried every antipsychotic, antidepressant and mood stabiliser known to man and can go months with it under control. Also susceptible to substance/alcohol abuse which inflates the issues.

Last night I took a bunch of MDMA and lost my shit, rang my emotionally abusive ex of 3 years, let him fuck me and treat me like shit and also just caused unnecessary drama because I can and could and when I'm in that manic mindset I just do whatever I want/whatever I can and am totally out of control and very, very self destructive. Then I have to deal with the consequences when I finally level out and come to my senses and it's horrible because I know logically the things I do are totally fucking retarded and so detrimental to my emotional state and self.

I am a good friend and a good person, or I try to be, I love my family and friends but I am going to lose everyone and eventually suicide (I've had 3 very close attempts that resulted in hospitalisations in ICU) if I don't stop. I don't know where to start. When I'm most likely to fuck everything up is when I feel most in control, buzzing and brilliant.

Can anyone offer any suggestions? I'm at my wits ends. It feels like I've been fighting myself for 9 years and I'm losing the battle and this disease is going to take everything good away from me.

TLDR; 23F severe bipolar and impulsive/reckless behaviour, worsened by substance abuse issues, is ruining my life. Don't know how to stop being self destructive.
