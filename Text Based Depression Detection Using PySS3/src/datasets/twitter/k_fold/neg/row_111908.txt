Safety offI'm about to go into work acting like I didn't have a gun in my mouth earlier this morning. The moment I put the barrel on my tongue, chills went down my spine but after a moment it was the most comfortable I've felt in weeks. I want to die, but... idk,  something keeps stopping me. I wish I knew what.
