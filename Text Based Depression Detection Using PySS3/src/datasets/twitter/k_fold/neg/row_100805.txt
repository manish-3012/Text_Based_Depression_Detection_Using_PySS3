Not afraid to dieIve been depressed for years. Tried killing myself a couple times and cutting, all that.. I OD'd on cough medicine once, but it had something in it other than just DXM and it made you tired. I went to the bathroom high as balls and then.. I woke up with a headache and feeling like I just died. I saw a face, maybe a skull, but it was like a symbol for death and it was laughing at me.. I never have been that scared before.
I went to my mom and asked her to take me to the hospital. Within 5 minutes in the car I felt, fine almost, like nothing happened. From that point on for the most part I stopped caring, about damn near everything. I'm not afraid to die anymore. I want to die with a purpose like saving someone's life and losing my own. I cant cry or laugh for real anymore. I feel empty, unsatisfied, and unhappy after even a great workout or fun day at Disneyworld. I'm stuck in the grey area, of just "eh" and I won't ever get out. My brain won't let me, not yet. I dont know what to do and I dont want to do much of anything anymore.. I'm almost too far gone, and I'm sober now because of probation, and still... empty
