Thinking every day about buying a gunI really cant take this anymore
Only thing keeping me is my family, but nothing can ease this suffering. Even when I start feeling a little better it's just this disease lying to me. Eventually bipolar will come back and destroy me.

So its selfish. So what. At least I can do one thing selfish for once. Although honestly  those who can't understand the suffering that lead to the event are even more selfish.

I cant shake this, nearly 30 years on this earth and 90% of it past 12 has been depression. The other 10% has been lying mania or hypomania, which honestly shows how much the other 90% is missing. It's honestly worse to know that there's a better life out there, but due to your brain you can't get out.

I cant take the mixed episodes, the deep depressions, ridiculous manic episodes. The loneliness. The evil I cause. The rotten insides i have. Nothing. Ever. Helps.

So I'm going to buy a gun in a weeks time. I'll keep you all updated. I think it's time for this sad pathetic life to end though. It kinda feels good to have a plan.

Hope is a lie.
