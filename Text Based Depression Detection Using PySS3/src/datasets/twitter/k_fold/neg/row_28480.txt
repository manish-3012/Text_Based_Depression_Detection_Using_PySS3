Should have killed myself when she was just a baby.I knew it back then. If I just had the courage, I could have done it. She'd still be the same happy kid, just without the memories of me. She wouldn't even know the difference - just that her older brother killed himself when she was too young to remember him. Hell, she'd probably have gotten more presents at Christmas.

But now she's too old, and it would fuck her up if I died. That avenue of escape is closed to me, and I despise myself for it. I feel all the more miserable. I was selfish and chose to keep living, and now she might suffer as a result.

That's what you get for holding on to hope, I guess.
