Why am I like this?I have read a lot of these posts and a some/most people definitely have something that I do not. I grew up in foster care so by the time my â€œmomâ€ got her kids back from the system not only did we have no type of relationship but letâ€™s just say... I was better off in the system. And the things I saw and was put through was things no child should even know about as a kid. My life has been of so much loneliness and sadness that my chest literally randomly hurts cus of how bad I need a good cry. Iâ€™m tired of crying and tired of being there for people That wonâ€™t do the same for me. When I think about how one shot can end all this misery it makes me feel so calm to the point it almost scares me. Like everyone else I have goals/dreams but this society is so sick and weird and itâ€™s in their hands if you make it or not. Iâ€™m tired of struggling financially and mentally. Life is hard and itâ€™s sad that suicide is easy. I am thinking hard about it to the point I can smile when the thoughts go through my mind. I just wonder if there is a â€œGODâ€ why did I get put on this earth for this. Itâ€™s just not fair.
