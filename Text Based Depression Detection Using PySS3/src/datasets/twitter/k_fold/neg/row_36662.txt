I posted this in legaladvice and it was taken down and referred here. I donâ€™t know if this is the place but if anyone could give me advice I would really appreciate it, but I am looking for steps to get a will in case the worse happensI do not have lots of money obviously, or anything of great value, but rather personal items and I plan on writing letters addressed to certain individuals (my parents, siblings, close friends) so in the event of my death, they can get some sort of closure. 

I would really like not to get into details, but rather just the steps of obtaining a will so that in the event of my death, these people will get these letters and items. Any help is appreciated 

I live in Michigan, if that helps 

If any of you have suffered from the loss of someone that killed themselves, you know that the lack of closure if very hard. I am trying to avoid that as much as I can in case the worse happens and any attempt to improve my life does not work out. 

Call me an attention seeker or whatever, Iâ€™ve heard it all and I donâ€™t care anymore. I would just like to know how to get this done
