Ready to dieI regret figuring out that i was trans. I hate myself because i still feel like a cheap imitation of the real thing. Like I'm less than. It's what everyone already thinks of me and they're right. What the hell do i know about being a woman. I'm just a freak. A failure. A pathetic disgusting loser. Seeing other trans people being successful in their transition and in their lives used to make me so happy. It gave me so much hope. Now it's just torture. I see myself in the mirror and i want to cry. Hormones were supposed to change everything. Now i know how FUCKING STUPID i was to think that there was any hope for me. I'm going to lose everyone in my family and for what? So i can live a subhuman existence where no one respects me? I won't even kid myself about finding love. I am going to die alone and nobody will care. no one will notice until my decomposing body starts to stink and my landlord comes by looking for rent money. I cry myself to sleep every single fucking night and my heart hurts so much that I want to tear it out of my chest. And I'm too much of a coward to successfully kill myself.  I'm beyond saving, but good fucking riddance right? Cis people hate me for being trans, trans people hate me for my internal transphobia. I'm sorry for existing. I'm ready to die, but I'll probably fail at that too like everything else i do.
