Life is meaningless, to me.I'm 15, and I come from South America, so... Yeah. 

Why strive for a few mere moments of happiness amongst a swamp of sadness? An intoxicating miasma of numbness that gets heavier and heavier as you go along with it?

These days I just don't... Feel the flame of life. The only thing driving me forward is time itself, and even so, I feel like I'm hanging onto every second I could have, and just... Trying to stay in there forever. 

Maybe I'm scared of going forward. Scared of rejection, scared of change... Who knows? Cuz I sure as hell don't.

I might be forced to live in a tight kitchenette with my mother and my sister, because my narcissist of a mother had a fight with her narcissist (?) Of a mother, AKA my grandmother.

I should like my mother. I... I should. But I can't. No matter what she does or how much it costs, I just can't forgive her. When people mock you for suicide, walk into your room as you're crying, your face buried in your knees, your cheeks stained by salty teardrops, just to tell you she would not help you, and that you should just man up, it's... You lose all love for that person. When that person constantly tries to... Ground you and stuff, take away your things, your trust withers away.

My sister will be returning from her father in a few more days, and honestly, as minor as this is, it's just something else to add to a huge pile. It's a banana peel in the dumpster, but it still is there.
I don't wanna put up with her shenanigans anymore. The worst thing, my mother forced her to start sleeping in my bedroom, so all delusions of privacy I ever had are now gone. Besides, even thoughâ€‹ she is a bit younger than me, she fucking snores like a pig. I... I don't know how I haven't flown of the handle yet. When she slept here, I couldn't sleep. I started going crazy, seeing things and stuff. Because the only rest I ever got was in my dreams.

I've recently realized with some diligence, maybe, just maybe I could become a writer. But when you're this insecure, it's hard not to just... Dismiss yourself for even trying.

I'm sorry for that rant. I... Maybe I just want some empathy, I don't even know anymore... I'm just feeling so lonely lately, I wonder if I would even be missed at all. I wonder how long it'd take till they found my body. Maybe a few hours, maybe a few days. Maybe never, if I was smart about it...
