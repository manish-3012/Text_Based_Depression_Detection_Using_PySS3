I broke up with my boyfriend and now I hate myself for it.I broke up with my boyfriend a couple of days ago.  I suffer from anxiety and depression, and he stuck through it with me.  I recently realized that I didn't want to be in a relationship with him anymore, so I decided the best thing to do was break it off now.

He was upset, and didn't understand why I didn't love him anymore.  Now I feel terrible that I've caused someone else pain.  I hate myself for breaking his heart, and I keep thinking about self harm because I feel like I deserve to feel bad since I've hurt someone badly.

How do I make these feelings go away? Thank you
