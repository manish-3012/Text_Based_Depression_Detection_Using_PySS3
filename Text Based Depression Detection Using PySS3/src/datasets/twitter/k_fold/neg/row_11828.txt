New Day Same PositionWaking up today I'm annoyed by the fact my eyes opened in the first place. If I could choose a way to go, I'd rather die in my sleep. My soul hurts constantly from heartbreak after heartbreak, not just from my first love or my second, but from those who I believed to be my friend. Or from my own mother and other family member. I sometimes feel isolated and alone even when I find others like me, we don't have the same story how could we feel alone together in the same space. Feeling as if her or his pain is stronger then mine. That could never work. 

You would think with the thousand of people ive met that I would find my soulmate or someone to help heal me in some way but I hasnt happened..... and I still wake up every morning.  For those who are religious I'm sorry but why would God allow someone to feel so much pain a misery days and days on end without a small break? If it isn't this, it's that, if it isn't that, it's something else. 

Why must I suffer everyday knowing I still exsist to feel pain.... I remember reading someone post that said 'If I were to die and satan said "welcome to the after life", I'm going to beat his ass.'

I would honestly help them.
