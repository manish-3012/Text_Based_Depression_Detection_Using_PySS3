I don't fit.I have tried so hard, but I can't seem to fit in. 
I have average social skills but no one wants to talk with me out of school, I have a girl sitting behind me who's so like me, selfish but caring for the ones she loves, kind of a jerk sometimes but I like the way she is, you probably don't know how it feels to want so hard to know her better ,talk to her for hours but... there's always a fucking but,she kinda has a boyfriend I'm cool with him but I thin I should stay away.Back to the main point, we have this week off so I thought someone would invite me somewhere but since no one remembers me I haven't been invited anywhere as usual.when I see other peoples lives I think for myself, why can't I be happy like that or why can't I have a relationship like that and this keeps me thinking from 6 pm to 4 am awake,  I no longer find my hobbies enjoyable nor have a normal diet I usually eat a lot or not eat at all.
all my "friends" get together to do stuff and I get to stay at home playing videogames and thinking why I wasn't invited to thr\e movies or the mall.I don't feel accepted even though this in my second year at this school. 
no one wants to talk to me.i want people to notice my pain but I don't want to go around telling everyone my life story. 
I just want to give up.
I am tired.
I want to die.
