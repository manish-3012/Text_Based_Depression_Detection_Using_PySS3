Why?Why think that depression is just a part of life, and they have to get over it?

Why say that suicide is selfish?

Why leave us when we have depression or mental disorders?

Why do you think we deserve it because we are a bad child in their eyes?

Why dismiss me?

Why joke about my suffering?

Why say itâ€™s not a real issue when we clearly need help?

Why say weâ€™re attention seekers even though you donâ€™t know if we are?

Why making us handle it ourselves?

Why donâ€™t you see the pain I see or what we received from you?

Why, after we kill ourselves that you care now?

Why blame us for killing ourselves, when you are part of the problem, too?

Why do judgements about our mental illness?

Why do people relate when our sadness is more extreme than theirs?

And most importantly: Why has no one even talked about our suffering?

Itâ€™s because most people donâ€™t really care. By the time they realized how much damage they caused, itâ€™s too late.
