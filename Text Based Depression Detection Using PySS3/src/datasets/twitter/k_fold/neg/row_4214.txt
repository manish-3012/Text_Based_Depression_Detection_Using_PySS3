I feel my time has come(M15)I made this account for one reason and one reason only. To post here. As you see I have been on this account for almost a year. I have been in and out of suicidal thoughts and in November almost attempted it with a near miss with local police. Iâ€™m suprised I survived to see 2019 but Iâ€™m still not happy. In September I made a deal with myself. If things donâ€™t get better in one year Iâ€™m killing myself no questions asked. Im suicidal because I just hate myself. I hate mirrors because I look at my ugly face. I hate everything about myself and even others see it. People in my school think Iâ€™m gonna be a shooter because of how depressed and suicidal I am. Iâ€™m also very lonely and have no friends or a girlfriend. I feel I have had enough and am close to the end. The stress, the depression. It does not go away and I can live with it. Iâ€™m not in immediate danger but at anytime I could just switch and instantly find a way to die. At only 15 I have had one suicide attempt which was when I was 12. Ever since I have had suicidal thoughts and depression. Remember, September is instant death if things donâ€™t get better for me.
