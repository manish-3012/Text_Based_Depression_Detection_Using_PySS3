I don't want to hurt myself but I can't stop myself eitherI go to the kitchen completely emotionless (well I don't feel anything but I must be having emotions or else I wouldn't want to hurt myself right?) and I had a perfectly nice time, meeting friends and actually having a conversation here and there (I'm autistic and usually just don't know what to talk about so I don't talk at all) and for some stupid weird reason I'm sad. Why?
