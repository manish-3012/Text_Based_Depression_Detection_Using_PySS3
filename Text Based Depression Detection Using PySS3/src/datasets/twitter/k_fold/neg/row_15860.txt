Thank you for being here // á€™á€•á€»á€±á€¬á€ºThank you for still being here. It isnâ€™t easy; in this horribly beautiful world. Itâ€™s easy to feel alone. Itâ€™s easy to feel hopeless. Maybe this community gives you even the smallest semblance of togetherness, the  most minuscule amount of hope. But still those dark clouds donâ€™t seem to be going anywhere.

Thank you for sitting here in this darkness.

It feels weird to write this - Iâ€™ve browsed here for awhile, reached out a few times ( this is a new accnt though ). All of the pain on here is overwhelming sometimes. I donâ€™t know your pain, the hurt in your heart - &amp; when people fail to empathize with someone truly suffering - barely hanging on - it can make it that much worse despite it not being their intention. 

Thank you for being here in this deep ocean of pain. 

Where am I going with this ? I dunno - this is darkness I donâ€™t have any flashlight - do any of us ? I can share my experience - my pain - &amp; maybe that will do something, can I even know my own intention for wanting to share ? Iâ€™d like to hope itâ€™s wholesome but maybe my ego is having a say too because it can never shut up either. 

Thank you for being here in this dark cloud of suffering. 

Itâ€™s easy for our mind to want to compare but I try to not &amp; just see what is for itself. I am not in the darkness right now - but I used to be - I just left a 3 day silent vipassana meditation retreat, it was agonizing, but my heart feels stronger now. 

Thank you for being here in this agonizing human existence. 

I was depressed &amp; suicidal for about 20 years. I still am sometimes, but itâ€™s not deep darkness like before. When I was 6 I held a knife to my chest - I didnâ€™t push in I just held it there &amp; I kept saying I want to die, I want to die. My mom witnessed. Fast forward blah blah more pain more darkness more depression. Youâ€™ve heard far worse &amp; maybe worse yourself but does comparing help us? 

Thank you for being here in this confusing unmerciful house.



I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™d be alive if someone didnâ€™t pull me out when I was most lost. That someone had just started to really leave their darkness, a darkness from their baby 5 year old sister dying in their arms in a car accident &amp; themselves almost dying too. It gave me a little strength to swim up. I was introduced to meditation - now meditation - I donâ€™t like that word it has a lot of connotations attached to it. I havenâ€™t thought of a good replacement word but really what sitting is , along with movement which is important too like yoga &amp; qi gong, is its training. Training our bodies, minds &amp; hearts, which are all muscles that can grow. &amp; psychedelics are amazing too but they have their own pitfalls as does all of this 

Thank you for being here in this river of sorrow. 

But anyway blah blah whatâ€™s the use of anything. Fast forward 4.5 years of this path &amp; here I am. Iâ€™d probably be dead without this stuff. &amp; I wanna invite you to try the smallest of things - imagine yourself sitting in front of you, feeling terrible right now, sitting there hunched over in pain, &amp; take one giant deep breath in inhaling the pain &amp; darkness from yourself sitting in front of you, &amp; imagine it filling up your body all of it - and hold it in - &amp; then breathe out a cooling soothing relief to yourself. Thank you if you tried &amp; thank you if you didnâ€™t. Maybe it does something or maybe itâ€™s bullshit like everything else. 

But I just wanna tell you one more time thank you for being here. 

&amp; if this all sucked Iâ€™m sorry I tried like the rest of the assholes who try and just make it worse - á€™á€•á€»á€±á€¬á€º
