I have nobody left.My girlfriend and I just broke up last night. I had a falling out with my friends several weeks ago, and my relationship with my family hasn't been great either. I've completely ruined every kind of relationship I might have had.

I feel like the only person I might have been able to live for is gone. I wanted to marry her.

I don't care about anything anymore. No one would notice if I died, and no one would care.
