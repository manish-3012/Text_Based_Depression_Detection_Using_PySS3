Exhales*do you ever read a really shitty book, like the kind where it starts REALLY slow, you know the ones that have an inch of paper before the anything remotely happens, the type of book that you dont care how good the ending is, the beginning is just too shit to finish it.the type of book you would rather throw into a wood chipper than return it to the library. thats how i feel about life rite now. people keep saying you can get through it but i honestly would rather just not be there. "Well i gets better" i hear you say with your shiny new iphone 69420 se xl and your job and your parents that respect you. well guess what im done wading through the literal shit that is my life.
