Is life worth itIâ€™ve been struggling a lot. Been using drugs, relationship is failing, and Iâ€™m at the end of my rope. I really want to give up, and I was hoping someone could please talk to me. I need strangers to talk to, cause if I reach out to what little friends I have, theyâ€™ll call the cops, and if the cops show up, Iâ€™d end up in a suicide by cop situation.
