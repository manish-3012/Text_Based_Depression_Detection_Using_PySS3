Give Me A ReasonThis is my last resort. I'm currently tasting the barrel of my 20 gauge. I'm a fucking loser, i dropped out of high school, i'm working a dead end job, and i still live at home. My dad is a meth head who abandoned me at 16 and my mom is a drunk who is basically telling me im worthless. Yeah I could move out and make it on my own, but whats the point? im going nowhere, Im a nobody, and nothing will ever be good in my life.  i cant even come home from work without feeling worthless. I just want to end it all. Everything has been handed to me all my life, and now that im an adult im being blamed for it. I will always take responsibility for my mistakes, yet it always turns into me being the biggest piece of shit on the planet. My friends don't give a shit, my family doesn't give a shit, and i'm just lost in my own head. Please help me
