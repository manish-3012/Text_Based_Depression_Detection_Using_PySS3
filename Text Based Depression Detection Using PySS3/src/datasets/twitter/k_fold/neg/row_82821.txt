why canâ€™t I just leave?I feel so horrible. canâ€™t someone just tell me that itâ€™ll be okay? that itâ€™s okay if I want to go. I want reassurance that theyâ€™ll be okay without me? why do others get to choose death but I canâ€™t? It hurts so much, please someone just let me leave. I feel like Iâ€™m mourning myself. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m even alive anymore, Iâ€™m already gone
