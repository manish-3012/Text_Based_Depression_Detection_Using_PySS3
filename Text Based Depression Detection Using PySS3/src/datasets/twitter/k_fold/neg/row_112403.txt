Please can we see a few more upvotes on helpful comments so people know they're actually being helpful?I know it shouldn't be necessary, and it's not. People want to help others who are suffering. But let's not forget that people who can help the most, are also possibly some the people who want to help the most, because they have been there themselves and have self esteem issues and/or other things, so up votes do actually matter. In the same way that posts are up voted! Everyone needs validation here! Out of my last 15 attempts to help, I've had more comments with down votes than up votes. Now I might not be perfect but this is not the way to encourage people who want to help when on a daily basis there are oodles of requests for help going completely unanswered. It's depressing. Thank you =D please take care of yourselves and each other and don't let Reddit's slightly tightfisted voting tendancies get anyone down or stopping posts being replied to
