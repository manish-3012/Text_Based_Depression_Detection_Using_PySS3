I don't know..I'm thinking about how pitiful I am.. 
How my friends don't even care to talk to me..
How my boyfriend can't bother to message me..
How exhausted I am.. I'm tired of waking up everyday. It's so painful, why can't I be normal like everybody else?
I would like to fall asleep and stay asleep
Right now.. I could do it. But I won't because I'm too much of a chicken.
I suppose this is a rant. I'm not sure. I'm just so pissed at myself for everything I can't do. I'm pretty damn Terrible at doing just about everything. I can't talk to anybody without doing something stupid, I can't do shit. I wish I could just leave and be gone. Hah. I could walk out the front door and just keep walking. Nobody would notice for a long while. I'd get far enough way, but I don't have my glasses. Then again I'm talking about ending my life.. Should I really be that scared..?
