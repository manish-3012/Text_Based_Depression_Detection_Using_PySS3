I wonder if anyone can actually say anything useful and helpful, not just utter shit.Advice, ideas, etc. None of that generic response shit. Things that actually work. I refuse to deal with stupid answers.

If anything seems decent, then I will gladly discuss it and dwell into the shit that is my life.
