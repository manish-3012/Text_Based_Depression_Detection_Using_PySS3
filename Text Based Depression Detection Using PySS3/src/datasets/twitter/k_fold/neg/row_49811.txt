My[M14] girlfriend[F14] is suicidalI found a book with suicidal writings and thoughts written by my girlfriend of 3 months. Knew she was depressed but not to what extent. Her bestfriend told me that GF thinks shes fat ugly and everyone hates her(Not true). GF's parents also fight non-stop.
She also told me that after we got into a fight gf locked herself in a room and cut for the first time in a while. GF was on antidepressants because the doctor knew what was up, but doc and gf told GF's Mom they were sleeping pills. GF's mom took away the pills because she is an idiot. GF does not know I know about the cutting or the book.
GF's Bestfriend knows that my gf is having suicidal thoughts but refuses to talk about them with her because she is afraid GF will hate her for trying to help.
I have noticed that my girlfriend always has been coming to school tired and sad looking, but I just assumed that was from sleeping issues (She had mentioned she had insomnia).
I am away this week and so is GF, who is on vacation with her Bestfriend from earlier. I am going to talk to the school counsellor when I get back. I don't know how to handle this, please help.
TL;DR: Found GF's book of suicidal writings. Her bestfriend was somewhat helpful. Don't know what to do.
EDIT: E-mailed counsellor.
