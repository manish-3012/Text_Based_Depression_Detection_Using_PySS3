Idc anymoreI jus don't wanna live anymore. I lost the love of my life while my life was already at the worst it's ever been. I cannot stop thinking about her, the good times we had. I have no drive left or ambition to continue. My life has always been bad. I never really felt loved besides by my wife and my children. I have family but they never showed me love, always looked at me as an outcast. I try to occupy my time with things to take my mind off of thinking about suicide but nothing's working. I contracted two STDs during my time being married that I'm very self conscious about. I only made it to ninth grade because I was a troublemaker in my youth. I feel like a burden when I go around friends because I'm always in this bad mood. I just don't wanna feel the pain anymore. I'm only in my late 20s and I've been thru so much. I haven't made an attempt on my life yet but everyday I inch closer and closer to actually doing it. I plan on leaving a note for my children to let them know how I feel inside.
