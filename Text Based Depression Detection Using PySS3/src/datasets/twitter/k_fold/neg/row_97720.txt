closer than I've ever been to giving upi need to stop stringing myself along, expecting things to get better. they won't. I need to stop being fucking delusional.

I'm in my second year of college, struggling massively because my depression has sapped all of my motivation. I'm broke because I can't keep a job, and it's now gotten to the point where I'm struggling to afford lunch every day. all I want to do is lie in bed and play video games. or kill myself. that too. 

I just feel so fucking alone. I like to think people would care if I *did* die, but I know that's too much to ask. life would go on, and I'd be forgotten about. and that's incredibly tempting.
