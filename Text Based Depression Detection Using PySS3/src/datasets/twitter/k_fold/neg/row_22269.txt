envy envy envy ( I know I'm shit )I am filled with envy. I don't know what I feel for my bestfriend anymore, I don't know if I still love her, because all I feel is envy. I could burst in tears at the most insignificant thing she possess/she gets and whatever. I hate her. 
She was depressed and she's getting better and she's getting the help she deserves.
But I constantly put her down. I do my best to insult her. 
Why ? Deep inside I don't wanna do this. I don't want her to be depressed, I don't want to be me the one who kills her. 
I have problems myself..like anxiety and I couldn't get professional help and I have just suffered a lot. So now I'm envious.
I could be happy because she doesn't have to get through what I did..but I'm not.
I don't care if I'm a bad person..I guess. These are my feelings and I can't control them. Of course I can pretend I'm happy for her and I've done this countless times. 

What should I do to stop hurting her ? I'm this..bitter 
and it hurts me too so much. I want to stop but my feelings are overwhelming 
I'm desperate -
