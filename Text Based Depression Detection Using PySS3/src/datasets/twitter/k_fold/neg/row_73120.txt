Having a Hard Time Finding PurposeIâ€™ve been doing pretty well up until lately. I took some time to think of only myself and take better care of myself but lately, Iâ€™ve been feeling like things are going backwards. I find it increasingly difficult to be a part of peopleâ€™s lives. I find it even harder to understand what about my life is even worth anything. Iâ€™m not sure if I want to kill myself. Part of me wants to but part of me doesnâ€™t want to.
