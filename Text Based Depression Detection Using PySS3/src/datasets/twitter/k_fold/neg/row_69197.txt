Just want to say thank youI just want to say thank you to all of you who have talked to me and helped me through what I have been dealing with recently. I have posted here a lot trying to get my thoughts out of my head and while things are still tough I am healing and I am getting better. It will take a long time before the pain and heartache I deal with ever really eases, and the memories will never ever go away. But there is hope on the horizon. I am doing my best each day not to let the memory of her hold me down and put me in a bad place. I want her to be happy in the long run but I fear her tests are still to come for the things she has done. Just as much as this is my test, a test of character and strength and perseverance. There is hope for all of us and we can pull through! I may still post here from time to time to get my thoughts out so they don't fester but I just wanted to say thank you to this sub reddit and to the people who patted me on the back and gave me a shoulder to cry on. Again Thank you, you all saved my life :)
