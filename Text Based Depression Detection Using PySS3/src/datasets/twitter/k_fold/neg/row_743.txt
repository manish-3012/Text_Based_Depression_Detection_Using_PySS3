27I'm so tired of trying. I run in circles, every day is nothing new, I go from hope to excitement to disillusion. I know this whole cycle so thoroughly, my life is like a laughably bad book or a parody of some kind. And beneath this there is so much suffering and loneliness.

I don't want to work just so I can survive to work yet another month. I will never sell my mind to someone or something I don't believe in. And this alone is enough to be an outcast, both socially and professionally. I find it weird how we prevent people from killing themselves yet all follow and support structures that beat them to it without even realising it. Not like I have an answer, the past, present and future key to our survival is a well functioning and productive society, not the well being of free radicals. But I have to add that depression isn't an illness, the norm is. Depressed people are more likely to realistically judge a situation.

I'll try once again, and maybe a few times after that. But after a fixed age, and without any solid improvement, I'm just going to call it quits. I'll have years upon years of proof that life isn't worth it. I won't be repeating the same experiment and expecting different results.
