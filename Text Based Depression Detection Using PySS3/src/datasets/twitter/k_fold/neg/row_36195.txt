Not brave enoughI would like to stop hurting people who loves me, I feel like I'm cursed... I can't be just happy and enjoy and they need me to do it and I CAN'T be a fucking normal person. But I'm not brave enough to just pick up a knife and do it... But the feeling becomes stronger every time I hurt someone
