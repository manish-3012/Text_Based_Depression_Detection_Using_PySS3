I Think My Days Are NumberedIâ€™ve been dealing with whatever is wrong with me for a while. The reason why I donâ€™t have a name for it is because I never told anyone about it so I could see a professional to see whatâ€™s wrong with me. But I probably have some form of mental illness so whatâ€™s the point for some doctor to put a label on me and call me crazy.

Iâ€™m not gonna kill myself because I want to die. Iâ€™m gonna do it because I donâ€™t want to exist anymore. Like little school kids who wait with impatience for the end of the school day on a Friday, thatâ€™s how I feel about sleeping. And Iâ€™m am severely disappointed when I wake up. 

Every year that has went by the hope that one day Iâ€™ll be happy and these thoughts will be behind has faltered. To the point that Iâ€™m looking a 400mg of painkillers. 100 mg less than what I need to finish the job and finally get what I want. Sleep. 

I am truly miserable. Waking up everyday feels like a chore and life moves on without me anyway so why do I have to stay and watch it leave? 

The only thing stopping me for doing is that I want to try out everything before I do this. This is my last resort. If nothing else works I know this will. There only so many more things I can do. 

1) Call/Chat with Suicide Hotline (Iâ€™ve did it before and it didnâ€™t work, I got frustrated and stop replying.) 
2) Tell My Mom/ Get some professional help
3) Try the Medication. 

And if all else fails then Iâ€™ll be back. Announcing my goodbyes to the world that has continuously thrown punches while I was down. By then Iâ€™ll would have written my letter and would probably leave it on my phone or a notebook for them to find. 

Because the one thing that has kept me alive for this long (my baby sisters) no longer gives me the same hope but leaving them behind would be my only regret. So i want to try something so people can never said I didnâ€™t put up a fight.
