I need advice or help or anything. Please.I have been thinking about killing myself for a while now and not because of recent events. My mental health is taking a turn for the worse and my therapist wonâ€™t listen to me. I know Iâ€™m not okay, she just keeps telling me that Iâ€™m not feeling that and that I should stop lying. I really donâ€™t see any other option anymore. My parents have tried to pump me full of antipsychotics and antidepressants and anything else but they donâ€™t listen to me about what I need. I really donâ€™t know what to do anymore and Iâ€™ve started cutting myself and I have been doing it where no one can see. None of my friends really care anymore and I am thinking about killing myself soon. Please I need help or advice or someone to care and understand that Iâ€™m not okay and to really hear me.
