All my problems are invalidI just came to this realization on reddit. I realized that not only am I not actually as smart as I have been told I was all my life, but all those years spent suffering and being a general wreck were all just invalid. The stalking issues? Typical for an average male. The depression? I might as well be faking it. Social anxiety? Just mild autism. The only valid problems I have are OCD and Autism. I donâ€™t have PTSD or ADHD, just a social death sentence. All my problems that are a little valid were self-inflicted. I love being broken and damaged. My parents have wasted probably millions of dollars to find out what was wrong with me and to treat me. Iâ€™m so paranoid and my victim complex is so big, that I think iâ€™m oppressed or going to be oppressed as a white male. My life has been turned upside down, and iâ€™m not exactly sure how I can go on. The guilt and shame I feel after doxxing, stalking, wasting millions, and generally being an asshole are so immense. I feel like I might kill myself tonight. 

So long.
