I'm considering doing it today.I'm worthless. Everything I have ever believed has been for nothing. 
Aesthetics is the basis of human life, from your tastes to the way you die. Everything is looking at a mirror and seeing Narcissus looking back at you. You can't escape it. I tried. I really tried to escape the aesthetic existence. From Thoreau to Hitler, from Mishima to Wilde and Pessoa. Everything revolves around it. And I can't escape my heavy aesthetic of life. My old ways in this new world. I feel ages old. I feel I'll never be understood. Somebody I care for said yesterday that she lived for me. That a world without me was worthless. Today, she says the contrary. That she does not depend on me. It's been seven years of caring, of loving. Of dedicating myself. I don't want to live in a world where I have no more meaning for her, as this is my chosen burden. My chosen aesthetic. My true Beauty. I have loved and love and will always love, and will keep loving if there's something after death. Hamlet's undiscovered country. My life has been this. I endured humiliation, rape, depression, failure, because she needed me. Now that she doesn't, there's no more reason. I'm thinking of drinking poison, or hanging myself. It's a pity that it's not night-blooming jasmine's season. I would have wanted to smell it one last time, if I've had the opportunity. So, I think this is goodbye, perhaps. I hope that somebody who feels lonely in this world and reads this discover that there are still people who care and love and give. I wish you all the best. I wish you will be loved forever.
