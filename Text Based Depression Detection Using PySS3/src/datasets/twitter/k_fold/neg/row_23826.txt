Im sick of the racismMy name is Ousama. For my whole life people have called my bin laden and called my a terroist so much its pretty much common. Honestly, im just fucking done with it. No matter where I go I never get a fair shot because of my name. Its not my fault some guy sharing my name did terrible shit aftet I was born. Im afraid to tell people my name. No teacher will ever help me and I when I fight people I get excluded like I am some delinquent. Theres no winning. My confidence is pretty much shattered. My life at home is shit too. I want to end it but its against my religion and I am really fucking struggling.
