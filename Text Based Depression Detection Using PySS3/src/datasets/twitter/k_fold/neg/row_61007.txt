What is so wrong with me?Everyone leaves me. Yesterday my boyfriend of two years left me. My friends left me this summer. My stepdad took his life a few years ago and left me. My real dad left me for a new family. I have no one. Iâ€™m lonely and scared and I just donâ€™t want to live anymore. I just want to get in my car and drive really fast into a tree or something. Iâ€™m so hurt. I canâ€™t take care of myself anymore. I havenâ€™t showered in several days, havenâ€™t eaten or slept. Iâ€™m falling apart and the only easy way to fix this seems like ending it all.
