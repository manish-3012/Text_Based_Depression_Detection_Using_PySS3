I'm so tired...I've just gotta vent

I'm sick of the pain. I'm sick of never feeling good enough. I'm sick of feeling worthless, sick of feeling like I don't deserve anything good. I'm sick of being afraid of everything.

This has gotten so out of hand and I'm really worried about where it's going to take me. I never used to struggle with suicidal thoughts but now they're practically the only ones I have. 

I want to get help but I'm so afraid to reach out. My therapist already knows but she doesn't know the extent to which I have these thoughts. I don't know what to do.

I'm so tired of feeling like this, I just want this to be over, I want to be happy again...
