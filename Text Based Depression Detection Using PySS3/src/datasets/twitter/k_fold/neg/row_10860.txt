I can't anymoreI need a hug. Someone who listens. In real life. Now. Just wishful thinking but I am at my limit right now. I don't know how to endure this feeling anymore. I am bursting. It feels like my insides are trying to get out through my chest with all they got. It literally hurts so much. Help me. Please. I know you can't.
