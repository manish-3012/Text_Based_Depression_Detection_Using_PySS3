I'm not showing up to workThis is the third job I have flaked out on after a week.  I am absolutely destitute and I only have gotten called back for an interview twice this entire year.  
I can't handle going in tonight. I can't handle talking to my coworkers and hearing the same dumbass jokes about me being shy or nervous or quiet.  I can't handle talking to customers and I really cannot handle criticism or authority.  
After tonight, I really have no more hope by any means. I can't even afford to be buried which is my only wish after death.
