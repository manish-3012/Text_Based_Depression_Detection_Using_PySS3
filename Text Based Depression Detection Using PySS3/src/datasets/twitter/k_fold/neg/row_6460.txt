(UPDATE 1) 26 years old male, My life is crumbling before my eyes. - Total reverse.http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tyiy8/26_years_old_male_my_life_is_crumbling_before_my/

Holy fuck my online suisidewatchers.

You know, I really thought it was my issues, MY ISSUES that were causing her to leave me.

I am thankful for the knowledge of being a black hat.
I am so thankful to my friend for hacking me one day in 8th grade and for letting me get so angry in revenge that I learned how to become a black hat my self.

SHE CHEATED ON ME,  And played me for a fucking fool!  And here I was crying endlessly, in agony and in pain because I thought it was my fault! Suffering and having suicidal thoughts because it was my fault I would not get a second chance.

Holy fuck, I would have killed myself because of Her.
What a sucker I am for thinking Even though  I am making great strides and she sees it that she would still want to break up with me even though promises after promises she told me.

Fuck me.....   Fuck me....     I am boiling angry and sad that she would do that to someone like me.


I asked her how many times!   she said just once while I was gone,  I asked her to tell me the truth,  She said once but fucking a.....


I don't even know how to put my anger into words,  My skin feels super tight and full of rage.


 My birthday is on the 28th, (not cake day) i'll be 27   what a way to turn 27 don't you guys think?  wow.  I'm just full of thoughts tonight.

I don't know what to think right now,  But sure as hell ain't suicide.


I know some of you might go  wtf...  why would you want her after that.       I love her and even if it will bring me more pain, my thought process is I want her.

But I want to kick some ass so bad right now.


**p.s. I want to thank this group for trying to keep me strong when I was feeling that way.**
