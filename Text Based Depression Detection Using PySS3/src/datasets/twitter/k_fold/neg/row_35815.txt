I couldnt care if anything bad happened to meI couldn't care anymore if I were to get hit by a car, lose my job, kicked out of school or anything. I just want a reason to kill myself already but I don't have the balls to do it. No point in hanging around in the world when I purposely and actively hurt myself mentally and physically so I can be miserable.
