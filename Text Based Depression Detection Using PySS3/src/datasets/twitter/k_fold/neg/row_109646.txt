layed on a roadand got put in a mental ward in hospital. It was ok at first but they really dont pay attention to you, you have to scream 500 hours just so they listen to you. and they don't let you outside or anything so on a 20 minute leave I ran off and i'm probably going to have to sleep on the street now and will probably jump off a building.
