There is nothing hereThere are no connections to be had. There is nothing here, simply bodies moving around, purposely ignoring those they choose. I am one of those, alone, I am always alone. I am a loser. There is nothing here, just weeks of endless suffering. I write notes like this so often, there is no respite, there is no release, no one cares. My family even stopped caring, they know this has been going on too long. No one ever gave me a chance. No one ever met me halfway. People are exclusionary beastful bullies at best. Some of us live in a hell obscured through modern "civility." Make no mistake, we still dwell there, it still exists. I want out, this is the point of suicide. If no one will connect with you, life gets old. If no one wants to go deeper with you, you only scratch the surface. I hate humanity so much, why was I never good enough for any of you. You're not that special, you know.
