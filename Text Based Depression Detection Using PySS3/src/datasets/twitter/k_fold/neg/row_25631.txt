Just found out the mother of my two kids cheated on meSo, lately I've been in a place in my life where i thought things were improving. My S.O. had ended up in a place where she most likely will get hired. I've been completing my studie and have had a goal to look forward to and that i seem to be reaching.

Our relationship felt stable, it felt like our future was really damn good. But, yesterday she acted very strange when i went into the bathroom where she was, i knew that look in her eyes of surprise and hiding something. I didn't do anythign about it at that point because i thought that maybe i was imagining things.

Today i decided to just have a quick look in her mail because of that funny feeling i had. And there it was, a mail that she most likely had forgotten to delete. It was blank but contained a video clip, a clip where she was masturbating sent to some mail. I looked who she had sent it to, it was a guy that i knew about, whom she has talked to before, someone that she claim she was only friend with.

I have been in a relatively stable position in my life, having suffered from depresseion since 12 years back. And this hit me like a massive boulder. My kids are 1 and 2 and they're the highlight of my life but i have no idea if i am able to stay strong through this and be who i want to be to them.

I have no idea how to proceed from this, I have attempted suicide in the past but i know that suicide most likely would be devestating to my kids and extremely unfair.

How the hell does one proceed from this?
