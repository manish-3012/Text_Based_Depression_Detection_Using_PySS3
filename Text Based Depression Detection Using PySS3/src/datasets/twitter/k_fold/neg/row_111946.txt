I just want to feel like someone cares the way I doIt's been years since I felt like I was someone's top priority. I'm 21 years old, in college, should be having the time of my life but it just seems like I don't matter to anyone. Everyone I try to get close to just doesn't show the same concern, the same care back. People I consider my closest friends know I'm in a rut, and yet nobody calls to check on my like I do, nobody seems to wonder if I'm ok or if I need help.


My past few girlfriends have legitimately left me for other guys. One texting me as we speak telling me about how she left me because she likes his voice better. Like am I actually that bad of a person that I can be replaced by someone with a better voice? My own family doesn't seem the slightest concerned with me being the way I am. I've tried to talk to them about what I'm struggling with and I get responses like "You just got to get it together" and "It's not that hard to get up and get moving". 


I just don't know what's wrong with me that I'm not a priority to anyone. I know that people say there's always someone that cares, and I know that. I just want back what I put out. I want someone to talk to me first, someone to ask me to go somewhere, someone that just wants to be around me because they like to. But I'm not good enough, and I don't know what to change to be that for someone. 


Anyways today was my breaking point. I don't know how much longer I can do it. I go to work and class with a mask on because everyone wants to be entertained, not stressed by some depressed loner. I'm tired of acting happy. It doesn't matter anyways because nobody would change a thing if they saw I wasn't happy.
