On the turning of the year.I've always hated new years, it's always seemed the most difficult time to keep away from the worst of the self-destructive thoughts. As though I need to make a more conscious decision than usual to stay alive. 

In the past, I've had people in my life who have helped me this time of the year... at least in part of my life, the online part, not the real world where I'm distant from everyone. People lose touch and disconnect, it happens, but this year is the first time when I've had to deal with it absolutely alone since I was 15 and attempted unsuccessfully to end it. The worst is that I thought there were at least a couple of people who would give a damn enough to talk to me on this day, but in the end... I'm alone. It's got worse each year, and at this point the only reason it can't get any worse is that I've lost everyone from my life now. 

I didn't quite think of it in those terms till the second I wrote it... I was struggling to find reasons to live, but now... I guess there is no struggle, because there is no hope, no mental force, or force within my life to counteract the inevitability of death. We all know it's a matter of when, not if, but right now there's no reason that the when isn't today.
