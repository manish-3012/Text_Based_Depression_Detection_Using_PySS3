I woke up in a sweat remembering the rapeI havenâ€™t been sleeping well lately. Lately for almost 11 years. Itâ€™s been 5 days since Iâ€™ve self harmed. Iâ€™m tired. I tried reaching out to all the people in my life who â€˜love and support meâ€™ after a while it feels like Iâ€™m bugging them. Like they have other things. Which they do. Everyone had their life. I just donâ€™t want mine.
