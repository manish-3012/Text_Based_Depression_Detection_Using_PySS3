Does it really matter if I stay alive, the world will go on with out me.I mean c'mon. All I do is wake up and wish I didn't. I have to hide this pain in me everyday and drown it with wine so nobody worries or gets depressed with me. Plus, even when you tell others about your pain just the slightest bit, they laugh or totally disregard and fuck you up more. Nobody fucking cares about you. You will mean shit to them unless you feed them parts of your own flesh. I'm tired of giving flesh for nothing. I'm tired of having my heart destroyed yet again. I'm tired waiting and looking for "Love".
Love. What the fuck does that even mean anymore? Nobody loves and love doesn't exist. We are animals. We crave, kill, eat and fuck. That's it and fucking disgusting. I'm ending it cuz I'm tired of the hurt that others inconsiderately throw on you and expect you to continue living with a smile on your face. Fuck this. See you all in hell.
