I donâ€™t drink, I donâ€™t smoke weed, I donâ€™t do drugs, and Iâ€™ve tried to stay healthy. Not a single one of those things have curbed my depression or stopped suicidal thoughts.What HAS contributed to me wanting to kill myself on basically a daily basis?

Bad luck, constant rejection, feelings of uselessness, a family that basically hates me and wouldnâ€™t care if I was dead or not, shit luck finding a job, and loss of faith in humanity.

Feeling unloved, unwanted and unneeded will destroy your soul and will to live far faster than substance abuse or a shitty diet. Iâ€™m living proof, if you want to call what Iâ€™m doing living.
