The notion of life beyond death.Part of the reason I want to end my life is because is because I understand and accept what it would mean for me in my afterlife experience. I'm NOT religious at all but very spiritual instead. 

I realize that my experience may be unpleasant, but in my opinion, nothing worse than current circumstances. I look forward to the solitude of what likely awaits me.
