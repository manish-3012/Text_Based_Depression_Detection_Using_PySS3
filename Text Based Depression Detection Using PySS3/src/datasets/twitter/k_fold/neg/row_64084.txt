There is hope for you.Hello, to whoever is reading this. 

If you feel suicidal and think you have nothing else in this life other than killing yourself or cutting to fill the void, I am here to tell you that there is hope for you. Even if everything is going down hill and people don't love you or you barely have any friends or family by your side, I am here to tell you that this is only a small part in your life story. There is hope for you in this world you just have to wait for it or go looking for it. You are important and are here for a reason, without you there may be someone in the future who has no one to hold on to, maybe there is someone who already cares for you with all their heart but you just don't know it yet. There is hope for everyone is this world even if you think there isn't any for you. Just remember that no matter what there are people you can talk to or call about your problems and the way you are feeling. In this world you are never alone. There will always be someone who will comfort you in your time in need. Please know that someone is always there for you even if you are alone at the moment. You still have a bright future ahead of you, things to explore and many opportunity for you to do. Please remember that there are people who love you. 

Thank you for reading and I hope this has made your day. Even if I don't know you personally, I still want you to live your best life without fear or sadness.
