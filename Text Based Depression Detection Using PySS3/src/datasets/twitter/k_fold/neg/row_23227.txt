ExplainSome might take this the wrong way but I've notice when people post on here they have a planned date for ending their lives. Like they're holding out because they either are hoping something good will happen in between the time of posting and their planned date. Or they actually have things in their life that actually make them happy. So they're hesitant on doing the deed because of this.
Also majority of the users who post seem to be in their late teens or early twenties and their stories just come off as extreme. Like they're in a movie or something. I don't mean to come off as rude or anything. I have my fair share of dark moments myself. But I hope that who ever reads this that the next time they go to make a post about ending it they actually think about what they're posting.
I guess I am just curious to why people actually do this.
