I just feel bad, it's been going on for two whole yearsI don't plan on ending my life, but I wish I knew how to end the suffering. Since my girlfriend left me 2 years ago I've done a lot but my mental health just got worse and worse. I joined the army 2 and a half years ago, I was 16, didn't really help getting the issue solved. Got it worse. I tired of being alone, there's people around me yet nobody sees me. I just want a little bit of love, not even love just a hug or maybe a smile, just that. My loneliness hurts to the point where I can actually feel pain down in my chest. It just doesn't wanna end
