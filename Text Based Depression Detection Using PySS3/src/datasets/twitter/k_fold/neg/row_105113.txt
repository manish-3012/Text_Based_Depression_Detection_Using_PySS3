Not suicidal but i don't really care if I died.I never really have any thoughts of suicide but I do have those thoughts of if something were to happen I would be fine with it.

I'm 20 years young currently fighting addiction, court cases, and on top of that i'm in the closet. 

Sometimes the easiest way to do deal with all of it is to just not give a shit and get my self killed.
