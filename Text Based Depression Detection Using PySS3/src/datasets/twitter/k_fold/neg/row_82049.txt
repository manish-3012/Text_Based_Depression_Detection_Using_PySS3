I mean nothing to nobody.I'm not important. What I wish is to be someone's #1, for someone to chase me out the door when I'm mad and leave, to be cared about. But nobody does. Nobody ever will.

So tonight might be the night. If not tonight, then definitely tomorrow. I need to do it. Nobody fucking cares. Everybody has someone, except for me.
