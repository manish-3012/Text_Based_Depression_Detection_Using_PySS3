Done with Life. I don't like doing anything. No goals, no interests, no hobbies. No noticeable cause for this, and its been ongoing for over 5 years. Therapy didn't help. Tried everything I could think of to fix those, and asked advice from at least 200 people. No one else to help me. I go to a job I don't like and I can't think of a single thing I'd actually want to do. No friends. No girlfriend. Emotionally quite sensitive, coupled with most people treating me like I don't exist, or using me, or losing interest after a short while. Great potential; I'm fairly intelligent, and anything mind/thinking based, I can easily pick up if I want to. I think it's worse that way, because I'm wasting it as there's nothing I want to do. I'd much rather be stupid and useless than potentially greatly useful. In all honesty, I don't think there's a single upside to my life. I'm considering not living it. All you need is a rope and something that can sustain your weight. Very easy, if selfish, solution. Then again, if anyone reads this, they'll probably think I'm emo or something. It doesn't really matter, it's difficult to understand unless you've spent 5 straight years caring for people that you come across, hoping that one will return the favour and be the person who wants to know you, who wants to make sure you feel happy. Mind you, I eventually gave up on caring for people. I just couldn't do it, knowing how people are. Seeing all those cold eyes. You probably have the same eyes...
