Life wants me dead.People abuse me, my Dad abuses me, Discord has abused me for 2 years...

I have had severe depression for almost 2 years and antidepressants and therapy are useless.

Nothing makes me happy anymore, not even games which frustrate me and I don't enjoy anymore.

I have no future really. College was pointless. Every single job requires a lifetime of experience.

I'm only 19. I have no hope.
