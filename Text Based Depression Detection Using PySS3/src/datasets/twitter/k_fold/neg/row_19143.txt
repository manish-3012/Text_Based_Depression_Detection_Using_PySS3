Feel like depression is killing my mind.Canâ€™t be bothered with making an alt.


I feel drained. I donâ€™t have the energy to leave my bed. I finally told my girlfriend about what I was struggling with and she called me telling me that she would always be there for me and that I could tell her anything. It didnâ€™t help.







I donâ€™t have any feelings for anyone anymore. I donâ€™t want attention, I donâ€™t want help. I just want to isolate myself somewhere and let depression kill my mind. I canâ€™t do anything, even read or listen to music, because I just donâ€™t want to be conscious anymore.







Iâ€™ve never visited a therapist, never been diagnosed, so I could be making this shit up like the little bitch that I am. Whatever.
