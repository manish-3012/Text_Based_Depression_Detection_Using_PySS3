All aloneI've never had a single best friend in my entire life. Nobody cared me enough to be one. I feel out of place and irrelevant. I've tried to join groups, clubs, chatrooms but I've never found a place that I would fit in. I'll probably always be out of place in life and I'm sick and tired of it. I just wanna rest forever... 

Thanks for just reading. Even that helps a little
