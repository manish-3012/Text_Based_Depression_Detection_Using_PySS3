WhyMy life changed when I hurt my back about year half ago I had a decent job was a service tech for large company out of ny it was a busy 24/7 heating and cooling company I worked there for many years and literally worked all day every day I hurt my back in 6/19 thought I would just be out few weeks but they turned into months etc well in 10/19 insurance company stopped paying cuz of dr clerical mistake I was not aware of procedures I eventually got a attorney and got a hearing in April ! So no money from 10/19-4/20 lost my condo my girlfriend who was living with me and I have a daughter with left me ( we were already on shaky ground our break up doesnâ€™t bother me not being around my daughter all the time does though ) defaulted on all my bills at the time I was paying state and irs back taxes I was on payment plan well I now have lien irs has paused collections not the state tho was living in my vacant condo until it Was unlawful so I lived in my car for about two weeks and had hearing I got awarded payments eventually got a apartment paid up my bills everything was getting back in order I was eventually put on light duty work restrictions and my old employer offered me a part time office job being that my old duties I was not able to perform the was happy to be back see everybody I was 27 when I started working there Iâ€™m 41 now so about 2 months later I tweaked my back doing a gas inspection ( wich I shouldnâ€™t of been doing ) and well I was laid off so when I started back at work the insurance company stopped my indemnity payments for reduced earnings since Iâ€™m back at work (at the time ) judge reduced my weekly idemnity wich I expected and was depending on cuz they would start sending me checks again they stopped paying me on 9/20 had hearing on 10/20 well itâ€™s now the middle of November no check I called attorney they said they called insurance and are waiting for reply well I checked mail and I have a appeal notice so I now will have to wait for another hearing probably some time after holidays
