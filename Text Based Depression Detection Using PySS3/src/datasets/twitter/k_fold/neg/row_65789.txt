At what point am I considered suicidal?Just a quick question...

So Iâ€™ve decided to hang myself at the next available opportunity â€“ which will be when my parents leave me with the house to myself for at least 18 hours.

Iâ€™ve decided not to leave a note or an explanation â€“ itâ€™s obvious - and Iâ€™ve even become an organ donor because, why not?

I know where Iâ€™m going to do it and what to do to make sure that someone finds me before my parents.
