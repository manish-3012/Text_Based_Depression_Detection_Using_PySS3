Such hard daysThis is a new account I made for this post.

Basically my situation is 2 nights ago was my girlfriend and i anniversary. But at 2am she was raped by a coworker.

and while trying to cope with that i find out that (i still live with my parents) they owe 14k in taxes and are going to have to sell the house.

i've struggled with suicidal depression for a while and this isn't helping. i don't know what to do. i want to goto sleep so i don't have to be awake to feel or think. i want to kill myself but funerals are expensive and it would only burden my parents even more. can some one please wake me up out of this nightmare

edit: i've also started to struggle with eating. i want to eat but my stomach feels ill and i just want to cry.
