Do not know what to think anymoreFirst of all sorry for my english is not my first language... I am a 34 male with 7 year relationship ended 4 years ago, a total of 3 girls and countless of refused love interests. I have a high education and a more than adequate iq with a good humanistic education and I can easily create connections with people but when I like a girl is always the same story, she end seeing me as a friend, so i remain alone and i cannot ever cherish my past 3 stories because even then they choose me and I just accepted because i knew i would have been alone... I had this frustration all my life, but in these years is becoming umbearable, i cannot  cope it in any manner and i became more angry by the day... i pass the nights crying at being alone and searching the answer to my problem but i cannot figure it out, i end thinking up i am not bf material and just masturbate 2 or 3 times a night. of course that is not working anymore and i am now constantly frustrated because i have begun to tell lie to my friends about my sex life just to be on their pass, many of them are girls so is hard to tell that i don not have sex in year when they have a new guy every 10 days. i feel inferior and useless, and i feel all my past choices were wrong, i am thinking to kill myself in the more painless way possible but i do not want to give this pain to my family, this is the firzt time i say these things, please help me.
