Looking for adviceI am really sorry you are reading this, I really didn't mean to waste your time with this meaningless rant. The English I am using is far from perfect, so going on would cause you also unnecessary suffering.   

I am better off than most , I was blessed with many talents and whatever I am doing would come easier to me than most. I haven't gone hungry due to the lack of money for a long time now. I am charismatic and well liked in the community, I can be funny and social when I want.  

With all of that I have been flirting with the idea of ending it all recently. The thought has always been there , but recently it has been gaining momentum, I have decided on the way to go. I will tell my brother that I am just going for skinny dipping in the cold water, I know no one will be there, it isnt a popular thing to do. the sun will be on its way to shine its last rays of light, I would go to one deserted beach, I would take few strong pain killers bills , I would smoke a joint in my car and take few sips of my whisky then take off my clothes and jump in the water and swim till I cant swim anymore, I will then rest on my back waiting for the bills to kickoff and dive slowly when it gets dark till I cant get to the surface and let go.  

I know I most probably will not dare do such a thing , I am a coward. I have told a close friend of my thoughts and he dismissed them stating that it is just a phase due to recent disappointments. I used to think it is so, but this time the urge is stronger than ever, and nothing brings me joy other than thinking about it. The guilt I feel of having such thoughts is only making it worse.

I guess I am looking for an advice , I have no access to psychological help and admitting to having such thoughts will bring me and those close to me a lot of misery. I am not sure where the thoughts are originating from.
