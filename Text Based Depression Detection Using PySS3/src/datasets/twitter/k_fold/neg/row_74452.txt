I can't do this anymore.I annoy my girlfriend with my depression and suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. I tell my mother I'm sorry she had me. My job has me working nights and therefore I have a lot of quiet alone time to think about things. I'm afraid of doing anything anymore. Going to the grocery store is the highlight of my life. I'm a borderline compulsive saver. My friends hate me. My father hates me. I'm a fucking tranny. I don't have any hobbies anymore. I don't have enjoyment out of life anymore. I'm not going anywhere or doing anywhere with my life.

I've always thought some people just weren't meant to be happy. I see now I'm one of those people. The only thing which makes me not want to destroy myself is marijuana, and that's destroying me in another way. I have no reason to keep going. I have nothing to live for. I am nothing.
