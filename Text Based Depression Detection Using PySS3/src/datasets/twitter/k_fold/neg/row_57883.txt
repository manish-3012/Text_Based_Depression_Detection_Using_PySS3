I can't keep goingI'm trans. I'm in the middle of transitioning at the point where I look so androgynous that going out as a guy consistently earns me whispers stares and looks.


I also attend a relatively small college such that enough people recognize me as the "disgusting" person.


At the beginning of the year when I started transitioning but it wasn't that apparent I was much happier. I made friends in my program for the first time and felt like people liked me.


But as I've started to look different people I thought were my friends have drifted away from me. I'm "othered" and ignored. Today I was obviously on the verge of tears in class and some girls fucking laughed at me.

I don't know what I did to deserve this. I've tried really hard to be friendly. I've tried really hard to accept people regardless of their flaws. But it's not enough. These people literally want me to die just for existing 

I Don't even feel human anymore. I'm so angry. I'm so anxious. I'm so paranoid and fearful.

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't handle another year of harassment and I can't drop out of school now.


I want to die. I've written a suicide note. I have a method planned.
