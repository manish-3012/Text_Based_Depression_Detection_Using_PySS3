They tell you to call for "help" if you are feeling bad but what can anyone else do to help?Today is shit.  If there weren't a couple big birthdays in my family in the next 2 weeks I'd be dead by the end of the day. Having done the whole therapy thing in the past I know that these are times when they'd tell a person to contact a professional for help but even if I did, what can anyone do to help?  It sucks.  I feel like shit.  I want to end my life.  But I don't need/want/can't afford to be hospitalized.  I don't have anything to say to anyone except it really fucking sucks.  And what can anyone else do to fix it anyway?  Even talking to someone for a bit.  I still feel like shit. I've wasted their time.  And nothing has changed.  

I don't know what to do right now.  Do I call the doctor?  If so, what can be done anyway?  Do I just shut up and suffer in silence?  That option sucks too.
