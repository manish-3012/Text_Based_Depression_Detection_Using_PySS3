idk I'm at the end of my tether, my girlfriend has left me and I have no one left to talk to about my problems, at school I always pretend I'm fine and so but when I get home I just think just about killing myself, I just don't see any more value for myself in this world, my "friends" joke if I don't manage to be happy what kind of emo I am, I just can't do this shit anymore
