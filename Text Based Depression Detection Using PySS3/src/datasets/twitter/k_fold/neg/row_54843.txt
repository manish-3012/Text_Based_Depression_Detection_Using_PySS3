I have been feeling worthlessAnd it's consuming me. It's like I cant even go 30 minutes without dwelling on everything wrong with me.
I try to distract my mind and focus on other things but then I spiral back into thinking about how I just want to not exist anymore. I wanna evaporate, disappear.

Even fun things feel like a chore and it's hard to be motivated to do anything. I dread having to go to work, to do school work, to do anything. On my days off I should feel relaxed but I can't because I'm still worrying about all the things that need to be done.

I'm constantly counting the time, whether it's how much time I have left in work, how much time is left in the day before I need to sleep, how much time I have before an assignment is due. I feel anxious all the time.

I feel unlovable, stupid, ugly, and honestly I don't think that feelings will go away even if someone tries to tell me it's not true. Even if they don't think so, I still think I am and they just haven't noticed yet.

I'm never going to be good enough for anyone. Even if I was, I would still feel this way, it could just at best distract me for a bit. But what's the point? And that's not really fair to anyone to have them be my only source of happiness, and I don't know if I could handle it again, to get my Hope's up thinking someone loves me only to have them eventually leave.

I don't know what I do, but I always mess things up. I wish I could fix it and just stop whatever I do that is so bad. I wish I wasn't so dumb. I wish I was better looking. I wish people could just care about me unconditionally but I know I don't deserve any of that.
