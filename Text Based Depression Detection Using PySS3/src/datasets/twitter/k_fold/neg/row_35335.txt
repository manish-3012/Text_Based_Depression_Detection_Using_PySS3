i dont know how to live anymoreevery time i (f 20) get a little bit of happiness it ends up going down the drain a few days later. my lows last for months to years sometimes and my highs only last a week tops. because i live in america and donâ€™t have health insurance, i canâ€™t get medicated properly or go to therapy and i donâ€™t know how long itâ€™ll be until i can. i just donâ€™t know how to keep doing this every day. i donâ€™t want to kill myself but i just donâ€™t know how to be alive anymore. not sure what iâ€™m hoping to get from this post, i just needed to put it out there somewhere.
