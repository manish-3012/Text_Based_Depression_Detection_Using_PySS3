I don't understand why I should live.Why shouldn't I kill myself when I'm going to die without achieving anything anyway? All I do when I'm alive is stay in my room and cry so what would be so different about if if I'm dead? Why do people expect me to try in life just so I can die and be forgotten about? I have absolutely no redeeming qualities. I'm definitely too dumb to be an astrophysicist, or any career that I'd want honestly, I'm so fucking ugly that I want to cry whenever I look in the mirror, I'm so annoying to be around because I always "ruin the mood", so I have no friends, and no matter how much I try at anything, I have no talents. No one will ever love me because who would love an ugly, talentless, unintelligent, annoying, depressed whore? There is no reason for me to live. I'm SO FUCKING entitled too, I won't eat more than 500 calories when there's an entire country dying of famine, and I KNOW that. They're literally eating LEAVES and I won't eat a slice of pizza. I'm a selfish, worthless, stupid whore and I deserve to get raped and die. I fucking hate myself and I know I'm a disappointment.
