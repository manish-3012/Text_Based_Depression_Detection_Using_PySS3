My brain is not wired to want me to die and itâ€™s fucking horribleMy life is worse than any of yours trust me. Iâ€™m the worst 18 year old in the world. Anyone else wouldâ€™ve died or self harmed by now but here I am, being a stubborn nutcase, too scared of not being in control of life anymore. Killing myself would fix everything and no one else would care, so I donâ€™t have to worry about that. If I had anyone elseâ€™s brain, Iâ€™d have died ages ago but Iâ€™m inherently scared of death. Itâ€™s the absolute worst combo; being in the worst situation and having the worst life, but also scared of death. Iâ€™ve been like this for so long Iâ€™ve gotten used to it, so Iâ€™ve been conditioned to be alright with being eternally unhappy and isolated. I want suicidal thoughts. I just fucking want to do it. I dream about it. I hate being alive and everyone else is surprised Iâ€™m still here. I just want to wake up with a rewired brain so I can end it.
