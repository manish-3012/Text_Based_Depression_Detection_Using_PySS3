Iâ€™ve never been so consistently lowThrowaway account. Iâ€™ve posted on here with my regular account before. But this is different, because Iâ€™m ashamed. 

Iâ€™m 16. Ik this makes some people immediately not want to listen, which is fair. I know that teens arenâ€™t super reliable. And we donâ€™t know much. That doesnâ€™t change the fact that itâ€™s a struggle for me to get up most days and I want to kill myself. So please reserve your judgement until you hear what Iâ€™m here to talk about. 

I live with my mom and her boyfriend. We moved in soon after they met. We didnâ€™t really have anywhere else to stay. Before that, we lived in a friends in law suite because we were running from my moms abusive ex. So yeah. 

My room is a mess. Like really really bad. I just canâ€™t do anything. And Iâ€™m clearly aware that itâ€™s bad. And I know I should do better. My mom scheduled a therapy appointment, after I all but forced her to, but the appointment is in October. When I heard this, I almost cried. 

Iâ€™ve been really down lately. Iâ€™ve had worst lows, but I usually bounce back within 1-3 days. Iâ€™ve been at a low for about a month now. I am considering suicide far more seriously, and it scares me. 

My mom and her bf have been wanting to paint my room and put in new furniture. I used to have a cat in my room but she had to be moved back outside while we redecorate. So my room has been a mess, with loose cat litter all over the floor. I know itâ€™s disgusting but I only ever sleep in here. The rest of my time is spent in the living room. 

So my moms bf went into my room without permission. He was really mad. I wasnâ€™t home, I was in the car with my mom to visit my friend. He sent her pictures as I was in the car. 

My mom was mad at me. Her bf is mad at me. Iâ€™m mad that he canâ€™t respect my privacy; I close the door so that they donâ€™t have to see my mess. I know I should do better, but what am I supposed to do when I just canâ€™t?

I donâ€™t want to live with my moms bf. I donâ€™t want to live with my dad. I want to live with my mom and just my mom. Iâ€™m sick of all these strangers that Iâ€™m constantly forced to share space with. They always bring pain, and I guess Iâ€™m just never supposed to have a say in it. I originally planned on leaving this time next year, and dropping out and living in my car. Being homeless would be better than this. But I love my mom. Sheâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m alive. 

I want to die. Iâ€™ve thought about it and thought about it. The only thing that scares me is the idea that I may never see my mom again. Thatâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m not dead. If thereâ€™s a god, I know Iâ€™ll get whatever punishment I deserve and itâ€™ll all be okay. If there isnâ€™t,, then I wonâ€™t even exist to know that Iâ€™ll never see her again. Itâ€™ll be okay. But I do exist right now. So itâ€™s painful 

I wouldnâ€™t hang myself because I know how gruesome it looks. I have no gun. I could get ahold of pills. I have razors. But I think pills are the best bet. My mom wouldnâ€™t even find me until I was long gone. 

It does sadden me that Iâ€™ll never be successful. I wonâ€™t get to help people. I wonâ€™t get a chance at independence. My friends will miss me. My dogs wonâ€™t know what happened. My cat will stay outside. But I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Itâ€™s all so worthless and meaningless.
