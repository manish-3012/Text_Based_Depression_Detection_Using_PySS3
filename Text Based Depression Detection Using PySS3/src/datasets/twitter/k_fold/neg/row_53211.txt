I suppose this is not normal.My best friend and I occasionally take turns asking each other personal questions to get to know each other better (call it the question game, if you will) and a couple weeks ago I asked him if he ever thought about killing himself and he bluntly answered yes, but it was never anything serious. Since then, it has opened up the discussion of suicide. I told him yesterday something that I never have told anyone. I never really thought of it as a big deal. I told him I think about killing myself nearly everyday, at least twice a week. Every time I make myself out to be an idiot, make a mistake, screw something up, think about how much I hate myself, etc. I feel like it's adding to my "Kill Yourself" list and I feel a strong urge too shoot myself in the head or wrap a rope around my neck. I know a lot of people have thought about suicide before but for the thoughts to be this often... I guess it's not normal. My friend seemed kind of shocked and asked if I ever told my therapist that and I said no. He told me I should but I don't want to bring it up. I don't want to sound like a melodramatic little pussy.
