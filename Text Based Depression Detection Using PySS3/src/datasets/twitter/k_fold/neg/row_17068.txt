The urge to kill myself gets worse everydayI truly cannot express enough how much I hate myself. I wouldnâ€™t tell this to my family, but the only reason I havenâ€™t committed suicide is because of them. Weâ€™re a very small family and I know if I leave this young (24) it will break them. But everyday I get worse. Itâ€™s a death waiting to happen.
