I don't know what to doI tried posting this in /r/depression but I couldn't get a response and I need help or advice or anything really.

My best friend is an asshole, and one that will sadly be with me for a long time. Not only did he help bully me into depression, low self esteem, and a lack of confidence in myself, he also helped put me into the therapy I attend every Monday. He has recently moved into my home unannounced to me. It is literally hell. My parents don't know what he's done over the years and everyday that goes by I hope he just drives off a bridge. Every time I have feelings for someone guess who shows up? Asshole. He has ruined every attempt of finding someone that I've ever made and I don't understand why everyone enjoy's him so much more than myself. We're are the same height, I'm more intelligent and talented, I weigh less, I'm more attractive, I don't smoke or drink unlike asshole, I don't wear beanies 24 fucking 7, I don't treat people like shit, I don't belittle others, and I don't treat my friends like garbage. I just can't wrap my mind around why I can't have a chance at being something more than myself. This asshole has helped put me on my death bed twice. 

I don't understand why I always come second for everyone.
