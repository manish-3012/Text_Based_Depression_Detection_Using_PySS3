I gave it so much time and...It just gets worse. And worse. And worse. 

The fact that I have to live a life where I simply cannot and will not ever be loved. It's load only gets heavier with every single passing second, minute, day, month, year.

I went through so fucking much. I tried as much bullshit as I could to help myself. Nothing ever worked. I know that the only reason that I couldn't ever be helped was because I deserve all this pain and trauma, and I'm most probably just being overdramatic but... couldn't I at least have been loved a little through it?

No I couldn't. Why the fuck am I asking that?

I've had this pistol for so long. I know I need to. Why can't I? Maybe I just try with the other methods because of some horseshit subconscious survival instinct. Or maybe I really do think hanging, ODing, slitting my wrist will end with a sleepy, peaceful death. I've tried too many times to still believe that. And I've had too much useless professional help fail me. I need to make sure this is it.

But whag the fuck. I just wanted to be fucking loved. I'd take another beating from my parents, another day of seeing dad rape her, another 50 anxiety attacks in front of teachers who couldn't care less, i wkuld go through just a little more pain added on top if it meant I could be loved through it all. That's not how it works though is it?

I want to go in peace. I don't wanna go in the condition Ive been in my whole life; scared shitless. But I have no choice. I dreamt for so long that I'd die in peace, knowing that a girl will love me even with the pain enough to just let me spend my final moments in her undisturbed company. Fuck. I fucking hate this. Why the fuck am I such a fucking pussy. I just want to go in peace. Please. I just want someone who can love me enough to wave goodbye at me from the proverbial train station. I have to accept it's not going to happen. I have to die like this.
