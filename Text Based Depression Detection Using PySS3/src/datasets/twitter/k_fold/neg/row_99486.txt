Girl showed me cuts on her arms and said she wasn't gonna do it, should I trust her?So, there's this girl at my school who's often lonely, maybe has two friends, she's almost always alone at lunch and stuff. I have tried being friends with her once I realized she was lonely, but we never really hit it off. Today, she asked if she could ask a quick question, which I replied "Sure!". She said "Be honest, what do these look like?" as she showed me faded cuts on her arm. I said "suicidal cuts" because this is a serious matter and I didn't want to lay her off with an "I don't know" or "cat scratches". She said I was right, but she wasn't going to kill herself. "I kept asking "Are you sure?" repetitively, but she kept respond with "I'm sure." Deep down inside, I don't think she'll do it and I hope she won't, but I'm not sure. Should I trust her?
