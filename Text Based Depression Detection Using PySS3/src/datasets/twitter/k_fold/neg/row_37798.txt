When is suicide an optoinI was married and i loved her, but she was being raped by her stepfather and needed anyone to escape an abusive home. 8 years and two kids later, after abusing me physically, she finally told me why we are together, how sexually frustrated she is and that she is going to find a well endowed man to be with. Now i look after my 2 kids 50 percent of the time and deal with panic disorder and research how to grow my penis the other 50 percent of the time. In this catch 22 situation women openly tell me that they will not date a man with children and they will not date a man who had abandoned his kids to start a new life. I've tried being ok and accepting the loneliness but i am unable to be ok with what my life had become. I've lost my sense of identity and purpose. I have no where to run away from myself and i need to find a way to end my suffering. I don't want to kill myself and so when i tried hanging myself because i saw no other option or action to take in life, i've started having these attacks. The suffering will end once i a dead right? It is so easy yet it is so hard - i am so afraid of a violent death. I can't cut deep enough, i swerve out of traffic at the last moment on my mountain bike, i haven't even tried looking down from an edge of a building. I'm afraid of death bc i know it will not be instant. It is only instant in movies. Falling asleep with a noose in a sitting position .... i think i feel sorry for myself too much, I need to man up and take concrete steps in my life. Life in complete loneliness and isolation does not make sense.
