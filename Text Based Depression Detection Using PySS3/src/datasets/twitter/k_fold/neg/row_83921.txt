I want it all to end.I do not know how much more of this pain/sickness I can take. I am currently sitting in my room with intense stomach and back pain. I can't stop crying. I have been suffering for almost six months. I have multiple UTIs, multiple sinus infections, multiple headaches, leg pain, arm pain, back pain, and so much more. Nothing ever ends. I have had something wrong every day for almost six months. I can't take it for much longer. I wish someone would just shoot me in the head.
