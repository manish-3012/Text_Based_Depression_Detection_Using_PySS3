Enough is enough!I canâ€™t take anymore!

Life has always thrown shit my way but now itâ€™s so unbearable and out of control I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. This has by far been the worst year of my life and Iâ€™ve been through so much in the last 5 months. More than one person would go through in a lifetime! Thatâ€™s never mind the years previously full of abuse and suffering! 

Iâ€™m so comfortable with death now, I long for it to happen to take me away from the pain and grief and suffering I have every single day! 

I just need a hug, someone to take me in their arms and say it will be ok but I have no one to even do that! 

Iâ€™m tired of wondering where the next meal is coming from and when my house will be taken from me, and watching people fall apart around me whilst Iâ€™m expected to be strong and sort everything out constantly!!! 

I canâ€™t do it anymore... I donâ€™t want to do it anymore... I need someone to be strong for me, do things for me! But I have no one to do that because my life is fucked with no family apart from my kids and no friends! 

I doubt I will take my life, Iâ€™ve tried and failed so many times. And anyway I usually stop half way through with the guilt of hurting other people. As usual I never think of myself, ALWAYS everyone else before me and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m in this mess right now. 

Iâ€™m sorry to ramble, Iâ€™m just tired and lonely and Iâ€™m in crisis but thereâ€™s no one to help me :(
