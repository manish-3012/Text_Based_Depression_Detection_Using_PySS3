What to do..So just like almost everyone else. I dont want to live anymore. Like I dont have family or "friends" work is dull. I use to game all thw time but most of the people I gamed with over the years just.. well left. I have a dog and thats about the only things keeping me here. I think I'm going to drop him off at a person I know who takes in rescue pets. And just walk into thw ocean by my house and move on with what ever this is .  Idk. Im just sick of doing this alone. I just want peaceful sleep.
