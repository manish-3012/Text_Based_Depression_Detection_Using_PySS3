Everyday is a battle. But I feel like I am losing (giving-up)I have been struggling with anxiety almost my entire life. 3rd grade is the first time I remember having a nervous breakdown. When I was in middle school I started having suicidal thoughts. These have only gotten worse. It is to the point now at age 22 that suicide is the first thing on my mind every morning when I wake up. 

When you meet someone you discover their good qualities first. I'm funny, generous, good looking. But behind all that. I hate myself. At my core. I fucking hate myself for being this way and I'm never going to get better and I can't expect anyone to help me through life. I can't bring myself to make new friends or start anymore new relationships because they are only going to end with me being alienated because of how I am. Everything is just going to keep falling apart. 

I'm done fighting. 

I lash out at my friends family and everyone I love. I can't control my emotions and I hurt everyone around me. 

I turn 23 in 6 days. 

I'm going to kill myself. Go to Wal-mart buy a bunch of everything, spend the rest of my money on gas, drive as far as I can, drink it all down, tie a plastic bag to my head and suffocate in my car. 

I don't want this anymore. I can't stand living like this and seeing everything I try to accomplish get fucked up by me.
