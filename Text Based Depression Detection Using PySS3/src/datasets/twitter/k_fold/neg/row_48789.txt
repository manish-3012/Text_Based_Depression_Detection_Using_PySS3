Exhausted and tired of dealing with myself. (Vent)Posted here yesterday, I think, but I still feel like shit. So I'm posting again. I hate myself. I've been binging for 4 or 5 fucking days. I've put on so much weight. I want to die. I hate having to deal with myself. I'm just a disgusting pig who eats their emotions. My teeth are shit from stomach acid. I'm just fat and disgusting and I hate it. I want to go back to starving myself, and I'm so afraid I won't be able to. I hate me. I don't want to die, but I just don't see any other way out. Except trying to run away from all this bullshit. Just packing up and leaving. I mean, it can't be worse than just staying here sad, right? Fuck, I don't know what I'm saying. I just need to get away from food and my past. I hate myself so much.
