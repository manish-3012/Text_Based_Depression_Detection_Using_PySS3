no reason.im sad. i have no idea why. im sad for absolutely no reason, im suicidal for absolutely no reason, and im alive for absolutely no reason. i dont have any friends in real life. god, i hate summer break. it makes it so i dont even have a chance to meet friends. all i do is sit in my bedroom and think. i overthink and overthink and overthinking kills me and i dont even know why im still here because i dont want to be alive at all. 
i took seventy two pills three nights ago and my family doesnt even know. they wouldnt have cared if i told them. i went to a mental hospital in february and they said that i was just going because i wanted attention. what they dont know is that i went because one of my close friends found me in my room with a rope hanging from the ceiling and all of my stepdad's prescription pills, ready to end it all. i dont know how they never found that out but they didnt. that or they just think i was doing that for attention too, who knows. i just have one question for whatever higher authority there is; why wont you let me leave this fucking place? why wont you let me die so that i can finally be happy? ive never been happy. i just want to be happy...
