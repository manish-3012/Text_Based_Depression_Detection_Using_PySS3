I just want it to endIâ€™m so tired of everything. This is my 3rd or 4th post here, Iâ€™m so tired of always being on the brink but never actually doing anything. I almost got hospitalized in December, I told myself I wouldnâ€™t kill myself if things get better this year. Itâ€™s May and nothingâ€™s changed. I still canâ€™t transition yet (Iâ€™m trans), Iâ€™m still being forced through boy scouts, Iâ€™m still being crushed by school (not even hard classes), finals are about to hit me like a train, all I do is sit around and do kinky shit online and watch YouTube cuz I canâ€™t muster the motivation to do anything else, I constantly humiliate myself socially, I canâ€™t finish anything, I miss my meds daily, etc, etc. I would kill myself if I could, my parents are still keeping the knives from me and throwing myself into traffic sounds impractical. I just want to so badly. Iâ€™m so tired of everything, Iâ€™m so exhausted, nothing gets better. Just let me die. I know for a fact that if anyone I know irl sees this Iâ€™m gonna get my ass hospitalized again, and that thought absolutely terrifies me. Yay. Stress.
