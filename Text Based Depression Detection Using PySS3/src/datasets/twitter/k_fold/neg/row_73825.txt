I don't understand it.It's so fucking confusing. I am here, I don't want to die. So why does that thought keeps appearing in my head?! I live on 6th floor. Death is like 8 steps away... It feels so surreal. why is there a part of me that wants me dead? is it part of me? I understand the reasons why "I" want to kill myself, but the logic and more sensible me understands why I shouldn't. It's like "it would be so easy, all problems gone, everybody would be happier." and than I am like "don't even think about it, life is fragile and only valuable thing you have. Thing about others, and possibilities you would miss"
What if I will forget that second part... I am scared.
