Another rant about how pathetic I amHellloooooooooo people!! Nothing new, nothing new at all, just the good olâ€™ Rob, the one and only Canucks lovinâ€™, Yankee lovinâ€™, Semi Nerf Warrior, Video Gamer, Chess Player popping in for another rant on here about how I want to kill myself because I have noooooobooooody to talk to. I kind of wanted to do that as an entertainment type thing because honestly at this point itâ€™s a game, I wake up every day, I go to school where Iâ€™m miserable, I go home and do my thing, I cry myself to sleep, and repeat because Iâ€™m pretty much a loser at the age of fourteen, almost fifteen. Iâ€™ll admit, Iâ€™m young, but life fucking sucks man. It fucking sucks, especially if youâ€™re a loser like me who has nothing to offer because not only am I socially awkward AND barely have anyone to talk to (PSA: itâ€™s very lonely and crippling, especially feeing like youâ€™re on the outside looking in), Iâ€™m fucking ugly so no girl wants me, now I get the whole â€œoh rob!!! Donâ€™t rely on girls or people for happinessâ€ or the â€œaw rob!!!! Donâ€™t sweat it buddy!! Youâ€™re not ugly!!!! Youâ€™re beautiful!!!â€ but it gets tiring because EVERYONE says it and at this point I know itâ€™s bullshit. Like honestly itâ€™s not fair and I know lifeâ€™s not fair and that I should man up but I just wish I could have more people to talk to because I only really have three people outside of my family that I talk to on a regular basis and two of those people online and one of them is in real life and honestly Iâ€™ll say I keep my family contact to a minimum I donâ€™t really talk to family often, for the other two people daily, for my real friend every few days sometimes for a few minutes I guess about video games or whateva and it fucking sucks and gets lonely and Iâ€™m gonna admit right now, I believe in God and I love God, but honestly his plan is NOT a good plan for me because who am I? Iâ€™m literally a fucking fourteen year old loser who plays video games and chess and you know the rest I ainâ€™t repeating it out of self pity and honestly Iâ€™d be long gone off this stupid rock shit-hole if my family owned guns because that seems to be the easiest way out. Now, I know, Iâ€™ve got Christmas to look forward to, but itâ€™s still a long ways away and Iâ€™m only gonna be happy for a day, A DAY, I donâ€™t want to be happy and at peace with a break for a day, I want it to be that way every day. Not only that, the world is getting shittier and shittier every moment and people are becoming suckier and suckier and everyone will leave you anyways so thereâ€™s no point. At the end of the day, Iâ€™m just a pathetic guy whoâ€™s always gonna be a sucker anyways so honestly I feel like Iâ€™m doing semi good because I accept that. Iâ€™m gullible, Iâ€™m useless, Iâ€™m pathetic, and Iâ€™m nothing but a bother for people honestly, Iâ€™m just that fly that wonâ€™t leave anyone alone. So yeah, the first step is acceptance really, the second step is living to well live until Iâ€™m 19 at least and can buy a gun or sooner if I know anyone with a gun. Buuuut yeah thanks for tuning in everyone, Iâ€™m gonna hit the sheets early and sleep at 6 PM and thatâ€™s all. What a lonely world am I right? Wont matter at the end of the day anyways.
