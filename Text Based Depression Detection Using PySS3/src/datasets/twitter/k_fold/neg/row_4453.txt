It feels more like a "when" than an "if"Sorry, theres just nobody I can talk to right now. I'm trying. I really am. Ive been seeing psychologists and trying medication and shit for nearly a year. I've met new people, tried new things, sometimes I can even force myself out of bed. But every time it seems like there might be hope I fuck it up like everything else. I'm just so tired of giving me and everyone else false hope, I'm so tired of fucking up. I think I just wasn't meant to be. I'm just not enough. Do you think they'll know I tried?
