i hope someone can talk to me, maybe we can help each other feel better.i feel absolutely dead inside already. my feelings hurts more than i can bear. i've been so totally alone and completely lacking any source of comfort for a while now. and all i can do is try to hurt others now, lashing out like an unloved monster. that's all i have now. i don't feel any love in my heart. as things stand i wish i didn't exist at all right now. i am really suffering very badly and i wish there was some way to stop the pain. but i see no end in sight. i wish i had a shoulder to cry on, or a hand to hold. but i have nothing. i can't love or trust again. i'm all fucked up :( i know i am capable of giving so much love and making people happy, i just can't escape my past and find happiness. and so i'm here, reaching out to anyone who will listen. i'd be happy to talk to anyone, i know there are kind souls out there that are willing to reach out and help those who are at there lowest. i want to be like that, i want to be good. right now all i have is my pain to keep me company.
