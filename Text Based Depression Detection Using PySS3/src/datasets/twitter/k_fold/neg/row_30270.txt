Ever feel like life just doesn't want you to be happy?Tonight the person who I thought will have potential relationship with ended it. This is not the first to happen to me, it's happen to me so many times in the past, (same shit different girl), that I feel life is always baiting me into thinking there is hope for me out there. This also applies to my career life, it doesn't matter where I go or what my job is I seem to screw things up unintentionally. I have tried to constantly improve myself but life doesn't seem to want me to. Whatever I try to do, whether its career or relationship life I don't see myself improving. Even while trying to make new friends, they don't last. I've been depressed about my life for a very long time and haven't really seek help or told anybody because I tried to fix my situation myself. I have thought about suicide in the past but now lately I been looking forward to suicide cause I think I'm done. Been thinking of killing myself with sleeping pills.

I'm 24 and all my life it's been full of bullshit that happens to me with friends, family, work or relationships. I can't be happy even tho it is a choice for me, because life always baits me with hope.
