All exits blocked. Hope is gone. Farewell cruel world :)Well after years of struggling with my problems, losing everything financially, losing all credibility and losing all hope of recovery it's time to die. 

I have 2000 US dollars to my name and I intend to do a few things with it before I go. I honestly don't know why I'm posting this to reddit, but I thought that before I end my existence this could be some kind of last anonymous mark I leave in this world here.

Don't bother trying to ascertain my location, I'm behind several proxies.

So long and thanks for all the fish!
