I'm going to snapI don't know if I'm going to break everything in my house or if I'm going to kill myself. But I can't fucking take this shit anymore. I thought I'd be able to get two appointments with my therapist this week, but of course that couldn't happen. I have no support outside of that. Every minute of every day is nothing but fucking PAIN. JUST MAKE IT STOP
