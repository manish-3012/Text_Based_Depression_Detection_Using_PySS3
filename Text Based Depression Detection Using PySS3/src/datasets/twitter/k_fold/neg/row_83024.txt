itâ€™s gonna happen sooner rather than lateriâ€™ve been depressed/suicidal for as long as i can remember, but this past year has kicked my ass. iâ€™ve been hospitalized 5 times since last october and it never helps. iâ€™ve been on more medications than i can count on one hand and they never help. friends have tried to support and be there for me but it never helps.

i think tonight might be the night. i have enough of my medication saved up, i have enough booze. iâ€™m not telling anyone, though. i donâ€™t want anyone to let my mom/the cops know and try and stop me. i have letters written but theyâ€™re handwritten so people wonâ€™t find them until itâ€™s too late.

fuck it, you know?
