I tried killing myself and my friends are laughing at me saying I really didnâ€™t and it fucking hurtsTitle, I just didnâ€™t want to live and every time I think about it to someone I feel like an attention whore. I even find it hard posting on here because I just seem like Iâ€™m trying to get attention or some shit.

My friends heard about it and thought I was trying to get attention, yet Iâ€™ve never told anyone.

I need new friends.
