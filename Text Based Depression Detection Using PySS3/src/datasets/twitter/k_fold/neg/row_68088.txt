I did not want to use my actual account for this but I am in serious physical pain.I am combat vet formely of the USMC but since I've gotten out I've had a litany of health issues. Currently half my face is the size of a bowling ball and the VA has a rather large waiting list, and since I'm on disabity I have few choices in my hospital choices. All the waiting list are over a month but the actual pain is unbearable. I can't open my right eye and I have a 24/7 chronic throbbing pain in my face. I don't know what to do but this pain has become unbearable. I love living, existing is nice but I literally can't even hear myself think now because of the pain. Again I don't want to die but if this persist I don't see any other options. Please help others before me I can tough this out for a little while longer, I just don't know what to do and I am running out of "be Marine and march forward".
