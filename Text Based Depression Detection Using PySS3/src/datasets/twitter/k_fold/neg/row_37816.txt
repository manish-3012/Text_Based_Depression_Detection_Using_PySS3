Need to knowHow many oxycodon and alcohol does it take to kill your self. I am 5 oxycodon 10mg a bottle of wine at 13.5abv and a couple of beers 5abv down. I want to die but then again I don't want to. I know that there are people with bigger problems then me. I miss having a significant other to have my back. Mine left me after a 4 year relationship because of a spinal cord injury almost all my friends disappeared I still have family but they always want to judge me so I don't talk to them. I just feel so lonely all the time. I can't live my life the way I would like to live it. Went from a 40k a year job to nothing and have been turned down for disability 4 times and the lawyer can't get a cort date for 16 months my credit is fucked I have debtors calling me in drove I don't know what to do. I have been to an insane asylum once before and i will make sure i die before i go back.
