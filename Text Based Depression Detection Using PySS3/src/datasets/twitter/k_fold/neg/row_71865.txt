My last attempt triggered a psychosis. Turns out I have schizophrenia. Now what?After staying in a crappy Ukrainian hospital for a month I'm back home. I sleep for 15 hours a day so I don't have to face reality. Don't tell my psychiatrist, she would be mad if she found out about my sleep schedule. The remaining 9 hours is still too much. I don't have any friends, irl or online. I go for walks with my mom because going outside is supposed to be good for you. I'm trying to find work as a freelance audio engineer, but can't find clients. I've read this book called You Are The Placebo and trying to do the meditation described there because there's nothing else to do.

After writing schizophrenic nonsense to people I'm scared of making new friends online. I'm stuck. Can't even afford another suicide attempt. Trying to stay positive, but it's hard when there's no support other than a silly book.
