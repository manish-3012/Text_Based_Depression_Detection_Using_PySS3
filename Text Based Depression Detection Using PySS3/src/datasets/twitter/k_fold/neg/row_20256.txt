Groomed to want to DieI donâ€™t understand how people do this. 
Iâ€™m 28. Depressed and anxious since I can remember but I canâ€™t remember my child hood or keep new memories as well. 
Iâ€™m bad at school because my memory sucks. Iâ€™m bad at work because Iâ€™m socially awkward, memory, &amp; stress makes me break down. He took my virginity at 17 after making me believe he was real for 3 years...a bf canâ€™t be 6 year older than you when youâ€™re in high school. If anyone listened or paid attention to me - Iâ€™d be safe. I still canâ€™t seem to protect myself. 
I didnâ€™t get to make my own decisions...because he made them. 
Now, Iâ€™m lost. I did meditation half assed I believe, I tried finding God but everyone rejected me or it all closed due to Covid. I had a promotion and a job but that ended with Covid. I finished my A.A and now no one from school can help me figure out how to transfer to university &amp; I feel like itâ€™s easy ! I just probably canâ€™t figure it out....
â€œJust apply.â€ Where? What does that even mean? They said theyâ€™d look at my grades....
Theyâ€™re not the best. I had so much anxiety and depression that I did bad &amp; they told me as I turned in the paper to graduate with my bad grades that they could have helped me with note taking, tutoring, and extra school support if I had told them.....I did. Freshman year. they gave me 4 sessions with the counselor but it didnâ€™t help. No one told me I could get help with college....I canâ€™t figure out anything for myself. Why....am I this stupid? 

I have only figured out how to do one thing...my plan is (hopefully) fool proof. No one will know it wasnâ€™t an accident...
I just want to find the strength to do it.
I pray I do. 
This is hell.
