he shouldve listened.my mom wouldnt let me shave my legs, have lighters, use a boxcutter, or handle knifes for good reason. i found my ways around (mostly via tearing apart soda cans), but here its so much easier. i may not cut as much as i used to but ive found much needed relief in burning myself. i cant tell if this is bliss or sadness.
