What am I supposed to do?Had a job interview yesterday. I was terrible. I realized how nobody will fucking hire me. I wouldn't hire me either. I'm socially weird, but to be honest I really couldn't care about your call center position that pays lower than minimum income even if you're the top company in the country.

So I either have to go back to college to get better qualifications (actually I have to start college, since I dropped out on the first day), and hope that with time, I'll be able to deal with people better, or become self-employed, which is a lot easier said than done. 

Or I could get an apprenticeship but my god, I have no motivation to learn anything, and even jobs that just want you to harvest potatoes require a driver's license which I don't have because I also dropped out of driving school.
My life is a fucking mess, with no friends. I'm fucking envious of people who post here who have close friends who can support them, and care about them. Nobody gives a fuck about me. And still, they think their life is miserable. Wow, unbelievable. 

I never had friends, partly my fault (I pushed some people away which I shouldn't have done), partly because I met a lot of assholes who just made fun of me. Also never had a gf, a job, or any skillset that could help me get one.

Anyone has any advice besides "kill yourself", anything else I could try besides that?

Thanks.
