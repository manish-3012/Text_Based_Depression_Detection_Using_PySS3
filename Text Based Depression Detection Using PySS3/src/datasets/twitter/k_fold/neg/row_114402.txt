Crazy person hereI'm not sure this belongs here, because I think through out the years I've become..."strong" I guess.. enough to not make any more real attempts at taking my life. But the thoughts lately... The thoughts have become so loud again. I just don't know why society has such a stigma on suicide and depression. I get so tired of fighting. I AM so tired of fighting. And all so I don't have to pass this pain down to the ones I love. I know. I know that's all suicide does is pass the pain on to others. But I get so.... Tired. And the thoughts get so loud. Over 24 years ago is when a friend found me getting ready to hang myself. Over 24 years of therapy. Over 24 years of trying this antidepressant and that new antidepressant. But nothing makes the thoughts go away. It just makes me less vocal about them. Makes shy away from more and more people so no one will ever know. I know I will never be normal, but I think it would be nice if, for once in my life, I could talk to someone frankly and honestly without fear of being locked up, medicated, or treated like nut case. I almost wonder if it would even... Help?
