Suicide survivorMy first post, so be gentle redditor. I'm in the worst place in my life now. Diagnosed with clinical depression. Only two people knows this - Elaine and Logey. I am "active" at church, have a regular work. Good at pretending that everything is okay. I laugh out loud, but at the end of the day, I just want to cry for no reason. Yes, I have thoughts of suicide. I know that's selfish. I have a 7 yr old kid, who means the world to me. But sometimes... I just wonder...

Have your parents/love one/ friends committed suicide? Tell me your story?
