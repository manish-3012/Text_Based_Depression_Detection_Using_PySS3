Thank you.My last post here was about a year ago. I was fifteen and in probably the lowest spot I've ever been. As a last-ditch effort, I created a throwaway account and created a post on r/SuicideWatch.

I then failed a suicide attempt. Nobody knows about this but you.

That got me thinking - what would happen if I were to die?

So I read this subreddit. A mountain of one-off posts from throwaway accounts just like this one, all crying out for help. And in a strange way I realized I wasn't alone. I decided to give life a second chance. Maybe it wasn't so bad after all.

And then I watched another man die.

It was pretty quick, really. One moment there, the next gone. Brain aneurysm, I think. It shook me up for a long time. I realized that really, nobody gets off this ride alive. Too many people have their lives cut short against their will. Life really was precious to me, then. Now that I had seen how fleeting it was, I grew to appreciate its value more. I'm happy to say I am no longer suicidal.

And it's all thanks to you, r/SuicideWatch.

Thank you.
