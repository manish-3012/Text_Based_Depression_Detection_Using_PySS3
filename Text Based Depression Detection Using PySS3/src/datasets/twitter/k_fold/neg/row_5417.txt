I just want one of you to lie to me tell me it will get betterI failed at everything u can imagine. My parents hate me cause I'm gay I have 3 friends and very little family left. I have panic attacks almost every day. I cry almost every night. I'm so tired i just cant do this for much longer. I'm scared that i might wake up one day and actually have the courage to kill myself. I already tried twice and nobody knows. I'm so alone...I'm so tired...it hurts so much...I just want it to stop. I would rather bruise on the outside then on the inside. I wish people could see my bruises that would never heal
