I am at ends. I donâ€™t feel goodI have tried before when I was younger after being continuously beaten by my father and also watching him do the same to my mother. The incident failed, and Iâ€™ve moved on to become a grown adult (26m). After years of nothing, failed relationships, I have found the one. This Saturday is our 6 month anniversary. She is everything to me. Tonight, she told me that because of school and her immaculate stress, she thinks she needs to have some time to herself. I am devastated. I have not thought about suicide since I was 14 when my father was around. I just canâ€™t do this. I was finally doing good for myself, becoming a better person and now my whole world is crushing on top of me. She helped me in so many ways. Iâ€™ve already looked at easy ways to get it done, because if she leaves me tomorrow after this 4 hour call of her not actually leaving me because she loves me dearly, idk what Iâ€™ll do man. I just have always had nothing and feel like Iâ€™ve always been a failure. I have a stressful job at timeâ€™s and she was my happiness. I have my own happiness, donâ€™t get it mixed up. But you know what I mean.. I need some kind words man. This is my 3rd relationship and I just see no need or want to continue if tomorrow goes bad with her. Sorry for the short novel. I love you all.
