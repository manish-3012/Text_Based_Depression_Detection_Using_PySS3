Can I be selfish...I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts that I fear I've become more reckless in my behaviors. I lost the satisfaction and joy in helping others and uplifting them. I volunteered for crisis Text Line and I still find myself wondering how pointless for me to help them. I start wondering when am I allowed to be selfish. Why is it that even when I plan my suicide, I would consider ways to make it look like an accident to save others the truth. To die in a way my organs could be salvaged for others to live from. When does it become okay to be selfish and want someone to cherish and love me... To be that kind of selfish where I can be clingy and desperately claw onto someone for their love... To not feel like I'm desperate and that it is ok to have someone I want to selfishly have all to myself... I feel like I'm chained because I'm thinking of others first ... When is it OK to be greedily selfish... I hate how every thought of wanting to reach out feels like an attention grab... That all I do is cry each night missing the people I had in my life... That I only lived this far is because I always did it for others... I feel alone. People say that you aren't, but you are. A touch, a hug, a kiss is only skin deep. What I feel, only I will know alone. They cannot share my feeling because it is mine, not ours. It is the thought that they can only understand to a point because they are not me. I wait to be struck down or taken by death. Each step is a step closer to death accelerated by recklessness. I don't know what I need in life, I know what I want, but I can only get nothing.
