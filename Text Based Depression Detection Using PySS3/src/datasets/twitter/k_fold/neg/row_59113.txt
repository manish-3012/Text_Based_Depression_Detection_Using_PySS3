i feel like this is the year i'm supposed to kill myself2020 somehow seems significant to me. it is an even numbered year, which is good, even though I was sure 2019 could be it because the number 19 is an even more significant number to me. i said it last year a lot, but things are really starting to fall apart, and i have learned more and more awful things about my family, but especially myself. i come out of doctors with more diagnoses than when I enter, and each time it's a reminder that I was created by some sort of evil, cruel   being and was made with only bad intentions. I am sure, once and for all, that I was cursed before birth, even conception maybe, and am destined to die at my own hand.   


I feel like I can see the past and the future and the present all at once, and I know deep down that sounds completely insane, but I feel like every moment in my life is happening at the same time, and I feel like my insides are going to catch fire, I feel like I need to rip my own guts out and eat them and then give what's left of my body back to the planet as a final sacrifice and to say "sorry" for wasting resources trying to foolishly prolong my life.

hopefully I will find a way to do it soon, i think I'm getting much closer than ever before and that brings me a tiny sliver of peace
