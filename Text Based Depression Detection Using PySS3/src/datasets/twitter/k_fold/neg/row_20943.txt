Is it ok to want to end my life due to mental illness?I just want all these stray thoughts to disappear. All of this OCD, Depression, Body Dysphoria and everything else to just stop. I can't relate to my peers, I don't have any friends or a job. I never asked for any of this but I just want all of it to stop. Therapists don't work and I ruined my body due to my life style. I just want an end to this pain. Is it wrong to consider suicide then? Will God forgive me?
