I have been deciding for awhile. Now its that time.I have a deep repulsion towards life and myself. Don't need to really explain my story, or need to be talked out of it. I fucking hate life and nothing will changed that. Committing suicide isn't wrong, its just stupid ass opinions from other people that believe they are doing the right thing. Time to hang myself with my belt tonight. Bravest thing I will have ever done, dislocating myself from this planet permanently.
