Never ending train.Life sometimes feels like youâ€™re on a train without any destination. Youâ€™re trapped inside and you canâ€™t get out. You see so many wonderful things behind that window .. wonderful creations and places .. but I it moves so fast, you canâ€™t focus. The sun shines upon your face, a little light of hope. Then you hear people laughing and see happy faces. New lovers, new parents .. children with a wonderful life ahead .. they all have a destination. But youâ€™re sitting there alone, drowning in your own tears. Everyone is living, but youâ€™re surviving ..

It feels like Iâ€™m experiencing life this way everyday and Iâ€™m not proud of it at all but I canâ€™t change a thing because itâ€™s too late to book a destination I guess.
