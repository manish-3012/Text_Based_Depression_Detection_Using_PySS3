next year, i am going to die.I have felt depression for 5 years ongoing. I am 16 years old today. On my 18th birthday next year, I plan to die. This has been my plan since I was 13 years old. 

Why have I chosen to do this? Because it's a relief. It is the only relief I've ever felt to say that I am going to leave my pain behind and be completely sure of it. My friends and family will be devastated and I don't doubt that they care about me very very much, but they don't understand that living and feeling nothing is worse than being dead and feeling nothing. It feels like I'm living a lie every day that I live.

I fought so hard to be where I am today but it isn't enough for ME. It isn't about anyone else anymore, just ME. If I can't feel like I'm enough for ME, then what's the point? 

I don't plan on telling anyone in my family that I have been contemplating this. I truly feel relieved whenever I think of how close I am to being... free. 

Sorry.
