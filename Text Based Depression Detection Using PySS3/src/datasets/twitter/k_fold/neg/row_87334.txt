Need someone to talk to, or maybe just hang out.Depression as always run in my family, ever since I was a child I remember hearing my mother crying from my room and all i could do is wish for it to stop. She has gotten so much better after years of therapy and medication but im afraid if i kill myself she will go back into how she was before. I have a little sister who i love so much and i wouldnt do anything to hurt her but this depression i have is just so much. All the loneliness, the pain of losing someone I thought i was going to have a future with. I love in arizona, if anyone else is having issues and maybe needs a friend or something maybe we could help each other.
