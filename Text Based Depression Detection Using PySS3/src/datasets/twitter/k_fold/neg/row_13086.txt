I just woke up from a suicide attemptI didnâ€™t know where else to post this. Technically I woke up 7 hours ago but I only just got back the ability to function coherently. Iâ€™m alone. I have been all day/night. I donâ€™t even know what to say. I donâ€™t know how I feel now. I know how I felt before. You know how you feel empty sometimes. Like not sad, but just nothing fills your heart. That was how I felt before. Now I feel something else. Like my mind doesnâ€™t occupy any space at all now. Iâ€™m not empty or sad, I just am. I took a bunch of klonopin with alcohol so thatâ€™s probably why. I still feel nauseous and fatigued. My head hurts. My vision isnâ€™t blurry anymore so thatâ€™s good. My balance is still shot. I really just want someone to chat with. Not about sad stuff or feeling down. Just maybe what you did today or something. I donâ€™t think I want to die anymore. I just want to move forward and for everything to be different. Itâ€™s hard to start making changes at 2am though.
