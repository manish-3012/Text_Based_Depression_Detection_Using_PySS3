I can't see a future for myselfI'm so tired and exhausted of dealing with this i might just end it tonight. Yesterday I went to the store and bought all the resources i need, and i live alone so no one will find me in time anyways. I wish i could express my feelings better, but frankly im certain no one understands. And i think if i died, barely anyone would care. 

Sure, maybe a handful of people will mourn. Maybe a couple will lie about "how close we were", maybe my parents will cover it up with some bullshit lie abt how i died in an accident since they already tried to cover up my previous attempt and took me off my meds and disregarded all my mental health problems. But im honestly past the point i care about any of that anymore 

I wish i hadn't failed my previous suicide attempt. It's just been a constant downhill since. My family just disregards me as 'crazy', my friends dont look at me the same anymore, my mental health, self harm and bpd has just gotten so bad not a day goes by without me thinking of dying. I've been hanging from a thin thread for so long, i think im just gonna do it

I wish i could say some bullshit excuse to myself about how i know im loved or whatever, but i dont. I don't know im loved, i dont feel loved, and im tired of lying to myself and telling myself everything will be okay because it hasn't and it wont. If anything, im almost certain im doomed and it'll just get worse. And i feel like more and more of a nuisance to people everyday whenever i try to ask for support or help. I just want to be okay, i just want to feel like i matter to people, i want a reason to keep living. But i cant find one anymore
