I'm not a "good" person and I don't want to be. Guess that means I don't deserve to live.I'm not pure evil either, I'm just not what society would label as a good or positive person. Like I don't go out of my way to make help anyone or make them feel good, why should I? Nobody has ever done that for me growing up and I don't blame them, I'm an ugly miserable piece of shit. You get what you give in this world and I was given nothing since birth and as a result i'm just a suicidal depressed piece of shit excuse of a human being that's too afraid to kill himself. 

I'm not gonna fake my personality and try to be a good person in societies eyes because first of all I'm a terrible actor and secondly nobody gives 2 shits about my existence anyway, just like I don't give a shit about theirs. I'm just a product of my environment growing up the way I did, nobody ever went out of their way to help me not even my parents. The entire world wrote me off from day 1 and kept giving me signs to kill myself yet im still here suffering because im too pussy to pull the trigger for some reason.The world would be a much better place if I died and that's fact. Global warming would stop, all the wars and poverty would stop and everyone would be happy and content with their lives. Someone kill me please since I don't have the balls to do it myself.
