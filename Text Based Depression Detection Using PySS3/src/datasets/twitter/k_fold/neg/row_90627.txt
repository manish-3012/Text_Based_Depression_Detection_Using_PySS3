I want to, so so badly, but I canâ€™t.Iâ€™m trying to get through this *only* for my husband, *only* for my baby boy, *only* for my father because Iâ€™m his only child.  Iâ€™m not alive for me anymore. Iâ€™m not alive when I play around and have a mask on. I hate my life. I hate this world. Medication helps but it doesnâ€™t make it go away. Iâ€™m failing today. Iâ€™ve locked myself in the bathroom to take a bath and get some composure but I feel like Iâ€™m being suffocated by life. I am doing my best to make it through but at times like this, itâ€™s so hard
