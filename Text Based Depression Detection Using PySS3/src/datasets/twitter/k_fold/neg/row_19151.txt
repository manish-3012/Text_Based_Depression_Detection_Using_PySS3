a suicide note from months ago. i still feel the same, maybe worse.here's a suicide note i wrote a few month ago, one of my best ones. i skipped a bunch of specific to my true name/area/other details about me. this refers to after i'm dead if it was to be found. reading it now, it sounds so basic and as if it's a call for attention because the reasons sound so small and not worth it but it was what i wrote at the time. i don't have the energy to write a whole new one.

"i believe i had depression. i can't be certain because i never got diagnosed, but if you're reading this i assume it's because i'm dead. i've had thoughts about dying / death in general since 3rd or 4th grade, "what would happen if i died right now?" kind of thoughts. then they developed into "what if i killed myself?" a year afterwards. then it just continued with that thought.

&amp;#x200B;

i didn't want people to care about me. i just wanted to get by. i liked being funny and making little teasing remarks at my friends, but i never wanted to be a big part of their life so i could be replacable. i'm not important, really, i wanted to be a psychologist to understand people's minds, to understand why i feel this way, but i felt so alone. incapable. as if nobody could understand because they wouldn't believe me. "it's just a phase, you have no reason to be depressed, you're just a sad teenage girl who wants attention." i don't want anything more than i want death. a painless, peaceful death, and if not, a sudden one where i feel nothing (similarly to my emotions).

i'll discuss my reasoning for why i believe i was depressed / why i died / whatever else i feel fits. i wasn't straight. i felt i liked girls and boys but that's not really important but it may have contributed to my death. i had a crush on a girl in 6th grade that i didn't understand; i was already feeling horrible about myself and i couldn't take it. i wanted to be normal. to feel normal. so i acted normal for many years since 3rd or 4th grade until now. i've felt was too weak for life if i couldn't even make it past my school years. i wasn't as smart as i wanted to be. i wasn't the person i thought i was. i didn't feel like anything but heavy. the clichÃ© explanation of being in water is accurate; it was as if i sank to the bottom of the ocean, feeling the pressure on my lungs while being unable to swim, while others floated on the surface. i've felt so strong some days but this year i stared at the medicine cabinet wondering how many pills i'd have to take for my heart to stop beating. wondering how long i could make it if i ran away so i could jump off a bridge or drown myself. i lived with a religious family, but instead of praying for better days i prayed for God to just kill me off. ever since i could remember, people would lie to me, take advantage of me (or try to), bully me, and other similar actions. one year i had looked to my cousin for help and support because i trusted him and i didn't want to make my friends think all i could be was depressed all of the time. one day he told me, essentially, he "needed help." he asked me if i knew what a boner was. when i said yes, he said he had one and he needed help getting rid of it. feigning ignorance, i acted like i didn't know what he meant, and he asked me for nudes. disgusted, i gave him excuses why i couldn't, but he gave me "solutions." i said "my parents are home," but he replied, "just go in the bathroom," etc.. i stopped talking to him. i get that this instance isn't bad compared to what others have gone through, but the feeling of only being a body to someone is indescribably painful and degrading. i remember it being the summer before 6th grade. i was 11 years old. in pre-k i remember a girl calling me a devil spawn and, despite telling the teachers and my parents, nobody did anything. i felt like i meant nothing and that feeling has kept by my side more than most people i know. even if it didn't seem like a big deal to anyone, it was everything to me. knowing someone hated me that much. wondering why nobody cared. i get it, she could have an opinion, but that far? before i could even develop resilience? in elementary school i remember the kids playing this game one day called "run away from \[my name\]" or something like that because i was the monster. my friends had played that game even though i was upset. none of them asked if i was okay. these reasons sounds so stupid to me now but depression seems to make them feel a momentous amount worse. i've felt that anybody else could've done a better job at life than i could. if i hadn't existed at all, life would've been so much better and it's better than everyone acting like they like me just to be nice. it's better than crying most nights. strangely enough, i never wanted to self harm. only commit suicide immediately. i didn't want to prolong my pain, only end it, i guess.

to my family; mom, dad, and marvin thank you for being there for me, but i have some things to address. why didn't you allow me to feel sadness or anger? a whole disney movie, "inside out," was better than you were at handling people's feelings. why could you get angry but not me? why were you so hypocritical? why wasn't i ever good enough? why couldn't you see why i closed you off, why i acted to differently? these questions will remain unanswered unless you want to answer them now. better now than never, but i'm still dead. i'm sorry for not talking to you, but you didn't make it easy. you made me feel like i took everything for granted and that i didn't try enough. i tried everything for you. i lived this long for you. i didn't want to anymore. either way, you tried your best and i didn't to your standards, so i'm sorry. i loved you all but not enough to stay.

&amp;#x200B;

to my friends, thank you for also being there for me. for trying to understand if i told you. i didn't want you to care about me, but sorry if i hurt you. you made me feel as close to happy as i can describe even if my suicidal, depressing thoughts were at the back of my mind. thank you for listening to me when i felt i had nowhere to go. you did your best.  i'm sorry to leave but it's not hard to replace someone like me. i love all of you dearly, but only a few of you really got through to seeing a different part of me.

d, you were my closest friend in elementary school. you stayed with me and you listed to me, you felt the same way then too. in middleschool i loved seeing you really grow as a person. you were someone i could look up to. i still love you, you're someone i can never forget as my best friend. i still have those little letters we wrote to eachother for a month or something like that. you've changed but you've become so much more beautiful. i don't have words to describe anything else in my mind about you, but thank you for being a part of my life, and don't lose yourself. you deserve happiness.

c, i don't know if you'll see this, so i ask whoever finds this to ensure he gets this message. i've missed you. in middleschool you made me feel like someone important, someone who had a life worth living, and you were just so positive and confident and you, too, were someone i looked up to. i loved you for being there for me when i wasn't feeling alright at all or just to talk with me about pointless things. you were someone i admired for all of their qualities and how they dealt with life. i hope you have a good life, and thank you for being a part of mine.

k, i don't know if you'll see this either, and i continue to ask for someone to make sure she finds these words. you accepted me for everything i came to be. i became a horrible friend and an even worse best friend. i didn't have the motivation to reply to your messages because i didn't want you to care. i'm so sorry. i'm so sorry for my actions, but i love you too and i want you to be happy.

r, sorry things didn't really work out like we both thought they would. i hope you'll be okay after this but, i wish i could just make things right again. sorry for not being enough as i wanted to. you're such a nice person.

in all honesty, i agree with the "nobody really wants to die" statements. i just wanted everything to stop. for me to be taken out of the situations i was in. but maybe that's just me.

thanks for anyone that took time to read my old suicide note. i just don't feel like it anymore. i'm giving it a week to get better, i'll do replies and stuff. also forgive me if i post in this forum or r/depression often.
