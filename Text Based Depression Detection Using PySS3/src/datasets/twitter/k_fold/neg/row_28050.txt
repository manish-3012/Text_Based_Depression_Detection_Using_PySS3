Tattoos, Zoloft, and my breakup. Please please please help meTwo months ago my ex boyfriend broke up with me. He was so out of my league and i fucked up our relationship and I miss him so much and knowing I can never get him back kills me. I'll never be with someone as attractive as him again and I don't know how to move forward, it's been months and yet I still cry about it often and the last few days he has really plagued my thoughts. 

I'm a nerdy girl with tattoos and I don't think I'm that attractive. For some reason after my breakup I've become hyperfixated on the fact I have tattoos, like I'm so petrified and scared that they will impede on me having good future relationships because they might be a turnoff for men. I never really thought like this before but now I just have this regret and even though those close to me tell me they are cool and that a lot of men are attracted to tattoos I still can't stop hyperfixating and obsessing over this regret and self-hatred and fear that now I will never find love like I had again and that might be a catalyst/reason as to why.

I've started kind of seeing this other guy and he is so nice but I dont love him and I'm much less attracted to him than my ex and all I want is my ex back

I also just started Zoloft and honestly I'm three days in and I'm a wreck with symptoms. Working is such a struggle. I really wanna die and I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this isn't coherent but I'm bawling as I type this
