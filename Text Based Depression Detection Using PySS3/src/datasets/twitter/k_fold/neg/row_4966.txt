The only thing that has kept me going is knowing if I die will hurt peopleBut Iâ€™m just so miserable. Soooo Miserable. Why do I have to keep suffering just to save other people some temporary sadness? Iâ€™ve tried everything I can to find happiness &amp; a reason to keep on existing. Itâ€™s just not there. I feel numb. I am so alone. Something in me is awkward an unloveable. 

I wrote a suicide note on Thursday. I havenâ€™t told anybody. The only reason I didnâ€™t do anything is because itâ€™s Christmas Eve &amp; I know that would ruin someoneâ€™s holiday forever. 

Life hasnâ€™t gotten better. I just broke my exercise bike because Iâ€™m too fat &amp; workout equipment was made for fit people. I guess fat people canâ€™t work out to get less fat. Iâ€™ve tried not eating. I throw up so much. This is miserable. I hate my body. I hate the judgement I get. I hate that I canâ€™t escape this fat existence no matter how hard I fucking try. I hate that no one believes me. I hate that youâ€™re reading this right now &amp; thinking yeah she didnâ€™t try that hard. I hate when people start working out and tell me how they lost 3 pounds in a week like the fat girl needs reminders that sheâ€™s lazy and should stop eating. I didnâ€™t ask for this life!

I canâ€™t make art anymore. I thought I could sing but that was wrong. I got nothing. This pandemic is never going to end because people are selfish. Never going to see my family again. So why should I keep trying. 

Thank you for reading this. If anyone is out there. Give me some reason to wake up tomorrow and do this fucking bullshit all over again.
