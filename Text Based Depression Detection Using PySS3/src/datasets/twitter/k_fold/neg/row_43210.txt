Everyone i care about could care less about my feelingsMy rational self is telling me to stop obessing over them and that you will get over them but my emotions tell a different story. I care so much about them and they can't even bother to answer my texts or do me a simple favor. Im done with this shit. My problems arent that bad. I dont have depression. I have nothing to be depressed about. Im just a worthless piece of shit that is impossible to be cared for. I dont want to feel this pain anymore. One simple person. My emotions are not valid. But they exist. And i cant stand the pain and suffering. Going to bed bawling my eyes out waking up and coming to the realization i have to deal with the same pain and suffering all day. I want it to end. I can't take it much longer.
