I'm ready to throw the towel inI think the main reason that I am still here is that I cannot find the words for my note. I have never been with words or poetic and I want my note to say that I'm sorry, that I didn't want to hurt anyone, and that it wasn't anyone else's fault but mine. I just can't do this anymore and I want it to stop. I despise myself and really do think I deserve this. If you've read this, please, don't turn out like I did. Do something before you get to this point.
