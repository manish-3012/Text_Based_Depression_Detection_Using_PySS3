I've been thinking lately...The thought becomes more and more appealing. I wish to die by nitrogen asphyxiation quite soon. I feel like I'm just a terrible friend, daughter, sister, girlfriend and person in general.

I cause more pain to those I love, than any sort of comfort to them.

Would this be a good way to go? I wish to not feel my own death.
