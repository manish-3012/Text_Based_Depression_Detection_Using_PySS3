I don't know what to believe anymoreI don't know what to think of this world anymore.  I've been sitting here for more years than I can count, just thinking about the worth of this candle that is my life.  I just don't know if I can find a valid reason to stick on this ride.  I mean, what's the point? So far I've found that the world I know doesn't seem to accept me.  Is there really a definitive answer for the meaning of life? I don't think there is one, at least not a good one.  I guess I'm done.
