Iâ€™m so tired of feeling this painIâ€™ve been depressed for since I was 11 (now 25) and Iâ€™ve always thought I would kill myself eventually, I never thought I would wanna live past 30. Recently my gf of 3.8 years broke up with me and I donâ€™t think I can deal with this pain any longer. I felt before that I had some reason to smile and to feel good, now I donâ€™t. And I know that there is a future with other people and whatever. But itâ€™s the process of getting there all the pain and discomfort on top of everything else. I donâ€™t wanna have this pain, itâ€™s so unbearable, I canâ€™t sleep, I canâ€™t eat, Iâ€™ve had headaches for the last 4 days. And I just want it to end. The only thing thats stoping me, is my family. I donâ€™t wanna cause then any pain cause I know it would probably destroy my mother, and push her over the edge. But it just feels like Iâ€™m fighting what I wanna do and it makes it feel so much harder to do anything. I just donâ€™t know what I should do.
