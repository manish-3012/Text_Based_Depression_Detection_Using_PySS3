How to cope with being ugly ?Im very insecure about my appearance, therefore I always try to look my best and cherrypicked my pictures. I went camping about a month ago and took some candid pictures. I had loose fitting clothing, hair unkept, and kind of dirty. I took the advice of just looking like your having fun and not take myself to seriously but I feel like it exposed me. I posted some pictures online and got unfriended by two girls. Another girl just acted distant out of nowhere and stop talking to me completely. I canâ€™t help to think because they find me unattractive. I feel like this is last straw and Iâ€™m just tired of being rejected all my life. I havenâ€™t left me house in weeks now I just feel like a freak and bother people with my presence and this world is better off without me.
