Trying not to do something rash on new years eve.2020 was a very bad year for everyone, but i feel like most people at least had one good thing that happened to them. My oldest sibling bought a house with her partner and husband, my other sibling was able to start applying to jobs in their preferred career. i was surrounded by multiple posts and pictures of people being able to make the most out of this year that sucked so so badly. but me? I feel like i was stagnant. stuck. nothing good happened, it was just gut punch after gut punch. i was able to get enrolled in college but im 21 and my parents expected me to do it right after high school so im late on that respect. I dont consider that a victory, plus fafsa has been really frustrating to get through.  I also feel like im being surrounded by happy couples which, i hate being bitter about. my long term relationship ended messily this year and i dont want to turn into that bitter single woman,,,,,

all in all, i don't think anythings really worth it anymore. ive gone stagnant. I can't move forward. i feel like im still stuck in march, even tho the years ending. i....cant kill myself tonight, because we have company over who'll be staying the night and i dont think waking up to a corpse would be nice. but. maybe tomorrow or the next day. sometime soon. Im sorry this is a mess, i'm dissociating heavily. ive written so many suicide notes that i dont think its worth it anymore. so i wont write one. cant wait to finally be free of everything. maybe in my next life ill do better
