Depression is my life...I have had depression for the majority of my teenage to adult life. And I feel like I am at a loss; I have planned and contemplated suicide multiple times but always back out due to fear. I feel the NHS does not do enough until it is too late ( I am English.) I have no idea what to do anymore as I honestly do not know how to cope, I feel like I am at a loss and just existing until I die. I came here to see if anyone else is feeling the same or if anyone who has been through this and came out the other side. All I have that get's me through it is my beautiful girlfriend, family and my music  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IUS9yqVpxk) but I find it always ends up being about my depression, I am just hoping someone who reads this can help as I don't know what to do any more....

thank you for reading.
