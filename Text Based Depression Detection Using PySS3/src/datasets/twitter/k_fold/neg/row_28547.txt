I survived yesterdayHello reddit! I have no one to really talk to so Iâ€™m taking my thoughts here... Yesterday I survived my first and hopefully only suicide attempt. For context, Iâ€™m a 19 year old male college student in the USA. Generally, my life should seem tolerable to people on the outside. I have a super supportive family, I go to a great college, I love writing my own metal and rock music and dogs are my everything. I pretty much have my entire future set. 

On the flip side, I only have one friend, but heâ€™s been my best friend for many years. This never really bothered me because Iâ€™ve always enjoyed being alone and never really felt comfortable in large social groups. As per dating, Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend, which is totally my fault due to lack of confidence. While all this seems great, Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with OCD, Anxiety, and Depression. I of course take medication and try my best to stay proactive. However, itâ€™s extremely hard to get out of your own head. I know I have the opportunity to be happy. I know I can try harder to be sociable. Unfortunately, I decided to take my own life yesterday. I finally had enough. My bottled up emotions got the best of me and I couldnâ€™t take it anymore. It wasnâ€™t about wanting to be dead, as much as me wanting an escape more than anything. 

While I wonâ€™t get into the specifics as to what went down as I donâ€™t want to encourage suicide, my whole perspective on life has changed. I can truly say that my experience scared me. I realized Iâ€™d rather be alive for the sake of living life as compared to dying for the sake of being dead. I know many of the people reading this are sick of hearing that it will get better. While I canâ€™t guarantee you it gets better, I can guarantee that your perspective on life changes over time. Itâ€™s really cool to see your perspective change, and hopefully change for the better. Please stick around to see your story unravel. Maybe it will be a story worth telling one day :)
