Final Suicide noteMost of yâ€™all donâ€™t know me,  but I still feel like I should say goodbye. Iâ€™m going to jump off an 80 ft tall parking garage. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m just in too much pain. I havenâ€™t ate in 2 days or slept in 3 days. I am eating my final meal right now as a type. Then Iâ€™m driving to the city and going through with my plan. Iâ€™m sorry.
