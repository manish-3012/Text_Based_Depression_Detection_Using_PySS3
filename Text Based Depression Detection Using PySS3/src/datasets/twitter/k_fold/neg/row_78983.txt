Suicide pacts. Life seems to be giving up on me... I have a suicide pact and it may be completed soon... Does anyone else here have one? Or what is your opinion on them... I am very badly hurt right now... Things may not go well for me... Just... Confused and depressed.. Not sure what is going to happen.. Not in a good state of mind..
