I keep pushing away help, how do I get better?Ive been going through depression for a couple of years now and for the past year Iâ€™ve been suicidal. Very recently Iâ€™ve considered self harm, but donâ€™t have the guts to do it.

I tend to push away peopleâ€™s support, and even tried to get professional help, but saw it as pointless. What are some of the best ways to get better or at least help myself? I just seem to be running out of reasons to stay alive and as much as I want to end it all, I have not figured out a means of doing so yet.

I would just like some advice so it doesnâ€™t hurt as much.
