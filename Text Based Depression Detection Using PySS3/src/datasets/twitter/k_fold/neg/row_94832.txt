Special personSo I've been highly depressed since almost the beginning of my life. It feels like I didn't even got to read about nihilism to know about it.
Nothing matters at this point, it's all too fakey shitty to me.

I saw psychologists 2 times, once at 5yo and once at 19yo (1 month prior to this post) and they both told the same thing: I was too smart way sooner than I should have been and it made me have all those belief. 
I just think its too simple to just say that and call it a day. 

Told my mother about all these suicidal thoughts and even tho she seemed to try to understand it, she couldnt.

Only one person managed to make me feel good and find inner peace, she understood whitout even talking about it and helped me in a way I always thought was impossible. I was feeling so good? 
Even in defeat, even against the whole world wanting me down, I was smiling like "hell all this shit ain't nothing" 

Now if I'm speaking in past tense its for a reason and I guess you all already know it. She was the only one who could cool off the morbid heat in my heart and even tho we still talk from time to time, I can't talk to her about this.
I just feel so down again, to be honest its even worse than before. 
I lost my inner peace. All my life I just survived with the fact that I feel different and  accepted that. But now that I tasted what happiness is, I can't bring myself to survive with a sick hearth, sick mind or wathever.

I don't know what I'm gonna do in the close future but I know too damn well that I'll do it whatever it is.
