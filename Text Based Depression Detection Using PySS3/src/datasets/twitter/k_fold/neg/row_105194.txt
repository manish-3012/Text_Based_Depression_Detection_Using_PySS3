Venting probably helps.I have a reoccurring idea that, at some point, I will just walk over to my well ornamented butcher block, take out my favorite carving knife, and gut myself. There are some when I just feel like I have nothing left in the tank. It feels like less of a decision and more of an instinct. Nature calls. I know, from an intellectual standpoint, I lead a pretty decent life. The wife, the kids 2 kids, the two story in suburbia, and a decent career. The thing is, I've felt this way from a very early age and it's never gone away. I feel like the urge just gets stronger. It goes away sometimes, but when it returns it returns to a greater degree than before. I think part of me just feels overwhelmed by the responsibilities I've chosen to take on. I'm in a helping profession, so I deal with people in bad shape all day. But then I come home to a wife who has a collection of problems, which I thought I could fix, but who seems to take two steps back for every step forward. Our son is going to turn four soon and is autistic, which isn't that bad (he's very high functioning, more on the Aspergers side of things) but I see so much of me in him and I hate that. I really don't want him to have to live in the reality that I've lived in. 

Not even sure why I'm here at this point, but I suppose it's been than not going anywhere. Not looking for a responses, it won't change much, pep talks rarely do (at least not in the long run). I guess I just need to get some of this out there to see what I'm really dealing with.
