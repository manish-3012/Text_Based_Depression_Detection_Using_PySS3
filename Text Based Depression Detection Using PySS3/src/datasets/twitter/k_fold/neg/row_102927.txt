I'm not sure what to do about this guyhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/3hf0m1/not_feelin_so_good/

He might not return to his post. He last commented just four minutes ago but he seemed pretty dead-set on ending his life because of the way his acid trip was going.

I'm sure there is someone here who is more well-versed in what to do in this situation. I've got nothing. Please help if you know how.
