Detergent methodSo i tried the inert gas method 2 days ago. For whatever reason it didnt work obviously. Ive been reading about the detergent method of mixing 2 chemicals together in a confined space to make hydrogen sulfide. If enough is mixed together its deadly almost instantly. But cant find much information other than it was popular in japan.
