Why didn't I jump on Wendsday?My dad expects nothing except perfection from me. My mom treats me and my siblings as slaves. One of my best friends can't remember who I am. I'm 12 and nearly jumped off a wall last Wendsday. I don't know how long it will be before I do jump. Oh, and I just found out I'm bipolar on top of my autism.
