I wanna go..My grades are the best they can be at this point, schools going well. But I always feel sad, I just don't wanna be here anymore. Idk why i feel sad, but i'm too scared to tell anybody. My friends have reddit too but i hope they don't see this, i'm scared they will confront me. I also feel really anxious when theres a deadline for a school project or something, then i just can't get myself to do the project. I just bought a switch with minecraft, but it would be a waste of money if i'd go now. I don't know if i'm gonna reach the end of this school year...
