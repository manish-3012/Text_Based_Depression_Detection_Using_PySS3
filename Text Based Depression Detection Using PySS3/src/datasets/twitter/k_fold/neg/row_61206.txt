HelpI feel a bit selfish posting here, when there are others that are closer to death than I am. I just... I don't have a plan yet, and I'm scared that I'll come up wih one soon. I don't want that to happen. I don't want to die. But everywhere I turn, it seems like all I do is fuck up everything. My own mother tells me I'm useless. Almost daily. And she knows I'm suicidle. Which leads me to wonder, maybe she doesn't want me alive? It sounds so selfish, I have younger siblings that would miss me. Or at least, I hope they would. But I'm 15 and turning to alcohol for an escape. I'm trying to stop, for my boyfriend and for my best friends, but I dont want to live like this any longer; on so many slopes that one day I'll trip and everything will snowball and I'll be alive to watch everything I have, and everything I am, burn to the ground and I'll just be left to pick at the ashes.~~I want to be dead before that happens~~ 

I don't want this life, where my own mother knows I'm walking towards the edge and won't help me, but encourages by her hateful words. Where my best friend's overprotective boyfriend tells me I'm just like the rest of the generation of stupid girls who give up everything for nothing. Where the only place I know that is safe is my boyfriends arms, and that this paradise is so rarely visited. Where I don't want to jump, but the unknown at the edge of the cliff is so much more inviting, and ~~maybe the angels with soft down wings will stroke my hair while I sleep~~ forever~~ I just don't know what to do. Or where to go from here.
