Death sounds pretty good right now.I've hit a really low part in my life. Probably the lowest i've ever been. I recently moved from Utah to California (Huge change) And I left behind my only friends i've ever had and the lifestyle i'm used to living. My mother dragged me out here in the middle of the school year, which  was really bad since the curriculum is new and I don't understand how it works. The school system is different and so nerve racking for me, I can hardly talk to people due to anxiety. I've always had a strong disliking for my mom, but I now realize it's just hatred. For basically all of my life, she's used her religion to abuse me. "Stop acting like a faggot." "I can call you a faggot because i'm the parent, and since i am the parent, you obey me." (She actually said that) And my dad likes to slap me and punch me when I tell  my mom to stop acting like a jerk. I'm sorry if any of this is confusing, my mind is so lost right now. So really, the thing that's pushed me over the edge is, my mother and I arranged for me to go back to Utah this week since it's spring break to see my friends and hang out with them. Well, yesterday, my mom left me and my sister home alone. My sister had been complaining to my mother all day about wanting to go swimming, however, my mother would not let her. Once my mom had left, I told my sister she could go swimming for twenty minutes then she had to do her chores. She agreed and we hopped into the pool. Well, my mom came back to pick something up and saw us in the pool. She started screaming and yelling about how I knew my sister had to do her chores before getting into the pool, and how it's a huge health risk. And now, because of that, she isn't going to take me back to Utah to see my friends.  Now, this destroys me as  I was only trying to keep both my sister and my mom happy. Ugh, I don't know. I'm just tired and upset with everything. Death just seems like such a easy way out from all of the pain.
