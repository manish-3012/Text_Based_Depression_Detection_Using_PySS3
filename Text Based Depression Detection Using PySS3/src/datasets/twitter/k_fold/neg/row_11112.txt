Life sucks, it really doesThere's no point to it and there really should be an easy way to kill ourselves if we want to exit this shithole early.

Eat, sleep, shit, work and repeat. We're in a rat race that only ends when we die. My only hope is winning the lottery because then I won't have to worry about working for the rest of my life and being a damn slave- but odds are millions to 1 against. I don't want to be a contributor to society, I fucking hate society!

I would donate my body to science/medicine for the rest of my life if it was possible. I posted a thread about "alternatives to suicide" but nobody has any ideas so it looks like I'm eventually going to commit suicide if I don't get lucky in lotto or gambling. If anyone has any ideas post them or inbox me because I really am hating this life and the way it works.
