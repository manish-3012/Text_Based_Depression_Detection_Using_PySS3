I hate my lifeI am not depressed just want to die. I feel good for most of the day and then I just hit a little snag and it's too much for me. Why does life have to be so hard. Why does my social anxiety have to be so bad that friends coming over makes me so anxious I want to just leave. Can they read me like an open book? See how sick and fucked up I am? Do they only hang out with me because our mutual friend is my room mate? I hate my fucking life but I can be happy maybe eventually... I cant even write anymore because I actually judge my work now and it's awful. I could never write but I liked to pretend I had good ideas. Maybe my other hobbies will evaporate too... slowly, agonizingly. Christ, I want to die but one piece is still going. Why the fuck cant oda just write every week...
