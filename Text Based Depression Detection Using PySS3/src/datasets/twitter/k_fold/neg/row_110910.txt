I'm broken and can't put myself back togetherI can see my breaking point, and its coming up once again but this time I don't think I'll want to survive. I have no family that'll lift a finger to help me in any way, in the words of my father "all you'll ever do is sweep floors and pick up boxes" 

Im just so tired of being poor, hungry,tired, lonely, and sad at all times. That feeling you get when your about to cry. The chills down your spine, the sinking feeling in your gut, and that weird feeling in your mouth/throat you get when your about to cry or just really sad. I've felt just like that every day for the past 3 years and I just want it to stop... I wish I didn't fuck my life up but its far far too late, I just want to throw in the towel already. My games already over and the credits are about to roll.  Its not what I want but at least I wont feel anymore pain.
