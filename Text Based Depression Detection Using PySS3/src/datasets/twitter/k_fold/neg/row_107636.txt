Being transgender is a death sentencePeople are born female all the time. Probably one being born this minute. How fucking hard would it have been for me to be born female? Yet it didn't fucking happen. Fuck this. 

I wish it didn't come to this, but I'm starting to see life as not worth living. Compare having to endure pain and suffering for the rest of your life versus a few minutes of pain and then... nothing. Nothing is so much more preferable to the bullshit my transgender condition puts me through every moment of the day.

Sometimes I feel like my friends don't even understand the kind of pain I go through on a moment to moment basis: look at that incredibly beautiful girl, gee I sure wish I was born like her; I always feel this way, maybe transition is the right idea; but what if I transition and I don't pass, or don't feel comfortable for some reason, and then I have to detransition?; but if I don't transition I'll always wonder and I can never date anyone because I couldn't trust myself not to have a gender dysphoria breakdown like I did with my last girlfriend and completely ruin their life.

I know that I want to be female, and I have some doubts such that I wonder if what I want is what I actually need (what you want isn't always what you need, which is a truth that is taken for granted in transgender circles). Something is not right in my brain and it feels like no solution will work. I could pick up the phone and hire a new therapist, or call the LGBT hotline, or call a friend, but I just don't want to and I don't know why. I can't stand it anymore and it seems like my only two options are ending it or enduring it so as not to hurt my mom who hate to have to bury her child.

In the end, I'll end up dead like so many other transgender people and the world will continue having little-to-no compassion for the "dude in a dress" because why the fuck would you want to change your gender you sick sexually perverted fuck?
