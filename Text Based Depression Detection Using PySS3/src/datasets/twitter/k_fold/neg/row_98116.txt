Lost it allI lost my job today after a 6 month battle against false allegations. The other person is my ex partner and he also used to be management there so has a lot of friends in high places. I was fighting a battle I couldn't win.

The man I love now, and who claimed to love me just left me here crying and doubting us because he doesn't want me when I'm like this. I'm devastated and have given up on everything because of the events of this year. I want to kill myself and nearly did. I'm desperate for some kind of reassurance from him but he just cut me off. I don't know where else to turn. If it wasn't for my parents I would end it right now. I already have the rope around the door handle ready but I can't because it will kill my parents, but dealing with all this is killing me.
