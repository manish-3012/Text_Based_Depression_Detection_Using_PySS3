No matter what I doItâ€™s like no matter what happens in life, it comes back to me. My mom doesnâ€™t have any respect for me and has moved away, my dad is out of the picture. My girlfriend left me because of how negative and suicidal I was. I dropped out of college for the same reason. Thereâ€™s no doctors that listen to what I say. My body is pumped with drugs every day and I still feel completely numb to all my emotions and pain. Itâ€™s just not worth it. 

This shit isnâ€™t worth it.
