for all the supporters, thank you and goodbyeHello,

I'm a long time lurker. I see the posts people make and read the absolutely heart warming comments you all post, regardless of ones' reasons behind wanting to die. You're all such great people, and I feel as though karma will come back I your favor. You all have helped so many people.

Unfortunately I am beyond that help. I have my goodbye letters written to what few friends and family I have. I have some other subs I need to issue goodbyes to too, but this one in particular I felt deserved more than that. For as many of those that fall through the cracks, like me, you all have kept so many others from falling as well. You need to know that people like you are what kept people like me alive for this long. Thank you all for being so kind and caring. If I could hug each of you I would. 
Keep on with the altruistic support, more people appreciate it than you know. &lt;3
Goodbye, and thanks again.
