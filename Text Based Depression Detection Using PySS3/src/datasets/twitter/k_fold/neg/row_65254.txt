32 and time to goI know I know, it's not worth it blah blah. I'm 32 and getting a divorce. My wife is going to take everything and she should, amazing person that I've been married to for 12 years but I never loved her. Married at age 19 out of guilt. Took her to Tennessee with me from Utah and got her pregnant. Anyways I chose to leave while the wife still wants me home but I've had multiple affairs. The current affair recently came to light. My kids are 8 and 12 and they are going to hate me once this all comes fully out. My plan is to settle all my debts by selling off my semi successful construction business and make it look like I just disappeared. I want to leave them the house paid off  and whatever cash I have left over. I want to die and just want to know the easiest way and how to make it look like I disappeared instead of commented suicide. I'm not depressed or in a crazied state of mind. I want to do this the least painful way for my family. If I'm still around I feel like my wife will never move on and the children will suffer. Not going to work it out.
