i lost the genetic lotteryitâ€™s not my fault. a lot of things are my fault, but not any of this. itâ€™s not my fault iâ€™m so ugly. itâ€™s not my fault iâ€™m so annoying and awkward. itâ€™s not my fault iâ€™m gay.

itâ€™s sort of my fault iâ€™m so fat, but when iâ€™m being told i need to go on a diet by someone who eats three chinese takeaways a week and does zero exercise by their own admission yet is perfect and skinny as a twig, when i do hours of exercise every day and iâ€™m still disgustingly overweight, i canâ€™t help but sense some unfairness.

because of all of these things i have no friends, not a one in the world. i used to, i had a very good friend who i loved, and still love, very much. but heâ€™s gone, he just ignores my messages and heâ€™ll never want to be my friend again. ever since heâ€™s stopped replying iâ€™ve just felt lost and empty, he meant everything to me. iâ€™m 16 and heâ€™s 20, but iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s not why because weâ€™ve been friends for over two years, he just doesnâ€™t like me which is understandable. obviously iâ€™ve never had a relationship, but the idea that i could is just preposterous and iâ€™ve already given up on that front.

it almost feels surreal. this is my life. despite being born into this world where most other people look like supermodels, as long as i live, never will i experience what itâ€™s like to not be ugly, fat and insufferable. i suppose thatâ€™s why i want to end my life as soon as possible. iâ€™ve been told that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but i have so many permanent problems that suicide is the only thing i can do.

sorry for my rant, itâ€™s probably quite hard to read because i just wanted to get all this off my chest as fast as possible. thanks for reading i suppose.
