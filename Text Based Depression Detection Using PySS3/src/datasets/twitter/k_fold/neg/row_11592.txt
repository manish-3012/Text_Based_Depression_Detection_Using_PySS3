College is ruining me/my life is falling apartI'm failing college and if I don't get my GPA up by next year, I won't get any financial aid. No financial aid = no money = no college = no desired future career. I try as hard as I can but I score low on everything. I try to study but my mind goes blank on tests. I follow the requirements for any papers I write and I still get low scores. I keep telling myself to get academic tutoring but I have no drive to. School is a big reason for me being on this subreddit.
I have a job that pays shit and when i apply for countless other jobs nobody ever gets back to me. I live with my parents because I cant afford an apartment. im fat and trying to lose weight. I work out frequently but I can't get into good eating habits, so i've been maintaining my weight. I'm loveless and alone with few friends. All of this is making me depressed and hopeless. I want to die. But i don't want to put a gun to my head or swallow pills. I don't want to die like that. I just want to die. Maybe just starve to death or dehydrate to death or something. Thought about letting myself fall off of an overpass into traffic, but I don't want to physically hurt others in the process of my death. I just want to die.
