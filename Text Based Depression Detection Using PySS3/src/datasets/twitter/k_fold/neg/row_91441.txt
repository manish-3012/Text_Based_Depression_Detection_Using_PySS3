Nothing helpsI think I've exhausted all my options in life. 

I've tried my best. But I am defeated, humiliated and alienated. Life is just too bloody tough. 

There's simply nothing more that I can do. 

I don't think I am brave enough to kill myself. But I wish to god I'd die. 

I've been talking to myself for the last two hours, trying to convince myself that there is still hope. This only resulted in a fever and a sore throat.
