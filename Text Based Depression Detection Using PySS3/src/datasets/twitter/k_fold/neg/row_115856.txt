I'm so scared I might actually do it somedayI was so stressed during college, whenever I closed my eyes I could see myself jumping out of a building, hanging myself, or just lying down on my bed with blood coming out from my cut wrists. I also have sleep paralysis often, it was so fcking scary at first.
But now, I'm just staying at our house and sometimes the thought of hanging myself crosses my mind, thinking which area of our house should I hang myself.
No one in my family knew I've been suffering for years. My Dad is verbally abusing me since I was a kid. It really piles up. He is so great at making me feel so worthless.

I'm so scared I might do it someday.
