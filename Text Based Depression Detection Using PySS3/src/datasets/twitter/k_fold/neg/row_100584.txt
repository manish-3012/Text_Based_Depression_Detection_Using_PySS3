Just lonely.I wish I could stop posting here. I wish that not having friends or family members (close by) wasn't enough to make me want to end my life. But what's the point of life without relationships? I've tried to make up for it with reading and writing and volunteering but depression has sapped my desire and ability to do those. My doctor wants me to go inpatient at my clinic but I can't afford it.

I just wish I had someone to help me through this all... who I didn't have to pay hundreds of dollars for the privilege.
