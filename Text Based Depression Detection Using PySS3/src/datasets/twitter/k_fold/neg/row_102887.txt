Dont know what im doingGot fired a week ago. Went to sleep on a friend's couch for a week to distract myself. Now I find myself looking for work and jobs away from home and always feel like I'm ready to jump infront of car.

I'm scared of myself and get anxious around people for whatever reason.

I'm struggling as a person, as an adult, and I don't think I'm even worth it.

I haven't killed myself yet because I know there would be a few people devastated if I left this earth.

I'm blessed to have a few friends, to have a family that loves me. But I still want to end the pain of me feeling like a huge idiot all the time.

Every day feels like a new struggle.
