HurtOver the past few months I've begun to feel like I'm losing my mind. Nothing feels real anymore. I never thought it would get so bad but my situation's been pretty rough lately. I live with a single, abusive parent who I sometimes feel sorry for but can't stand. They constantly force feed me guilt for not being a good son, for not living up to their standards. I hate that they make me feel like I'm not normal and their twisted perception of reality and society is. Except for me, they are all alone and I hate that. I wish they had a single friend so that I wouldn't always feel guilted into talking to them and continuing down this spiral of abuse and guilt. 

I've been increasingly disillusioned with people. I fall in love and once I get what I want, I don't want them anymore and feel like shit for going after them in the first place. I can't trust anyone. I feel so trapped and am tired of trying to not show it. All of my normal forms of escapism don't work anymore. I don't want a lot from this world but I don't want to live with this guilt. I'm so exhausted of always feeling like shit. I know that I probably won't live til next year but a part of me wishes that it doesn't have to be that way. I'm tired of being sorry.
