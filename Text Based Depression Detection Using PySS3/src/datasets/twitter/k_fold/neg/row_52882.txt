Some thoughsSorry if this is bad written or smthng but english isnt my native languaje

I've been in a constant battle with myself lately, thinking if im good enough to even be here, thinking that i dont have anything to be remembered and everyone will be a lot better without me, maybe the pain will be visible the first days or months, but in some time everything will be better.
I'm aware that i have everything that i could possible need, my two parents, little sister, a lovely grandma, even a gf, and thats why i find so frustrating this struggle of mine, i dont know where to start to attack this problem, and i feel lile i have no hope to be better at this point, i mean, there is a lot of people that have more issues than me, but for some reason, i cant seem to be happy besides very very specific moments.
 I dont know what will happen this next days, because i've been feeling very bad lately, but i need to tell my family that i love them, that nothing of this is their fault, they are the best family that i could ever had, im the problem, not them
And to my gf, Anita, you were the best person that i could ever met, you made me the best version of myself but im ashamed to say that im not enough, and i dont want to be deadweight in your life anymore, i deeply love you
