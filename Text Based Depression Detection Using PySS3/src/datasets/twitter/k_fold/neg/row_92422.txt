Am I born to be a failure?Is this my destiny? living to be an idiot that makes everything a bad luck? I know life is hard, but why am I feels like the only one that makes good thing turned into bad thing. I wish I can end my miserable life. I pray to god everyday so I can die in a next day,but not answers. I want to end my suffering, I hate this life, I need to die, PLEASE.
