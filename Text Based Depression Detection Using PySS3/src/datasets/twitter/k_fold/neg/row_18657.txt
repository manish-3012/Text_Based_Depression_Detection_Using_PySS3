I insulted my mother and I want to kill myself.I am 24 years old and have not been able to have a job for 8 months now due to mental illness (depression). I have tried medications and therapy but they have not been effective.

My mom tries to push me to do more things but I am just unable. Today I lost it and I called her bad things. We ended up yelling to each-other and now my neighbours probably think I am completely insane.

I feel really bad and considering suicide at the moment.
