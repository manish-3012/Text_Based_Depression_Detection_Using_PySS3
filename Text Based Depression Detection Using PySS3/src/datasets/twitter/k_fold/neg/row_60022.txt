I need to vent.10 weeks Iâ€™ve wasted every Friday night was spent talking doing CBT. Hoping against hope that it might just about help. But shit nothing came of the whole damn thing. Iâ€™m no more normal than I was those 10 weeks ago and yet if anything Iâ€™m worse. Iâ€™ve had more complete breakdowns in the past month than in a very long time. The epicentre of it all is a bitch of a graphics teacher who doest do shit except tell me that the only person I can blame for her mismanagement of our time and resources is myself and that itâ€™s not her problem when she expects us to hand in our final pieces that are worth 60% of our grade fully finished and evaluated( work that is supposed to be spread over 3 weeks as a minimum) in a single weekend without even us having asses to our necessary equipment eg our photos and our files. So all in all. Iâ€™m depressed over the edge of finally ending it all and whatâ€™s more there is no way I canâ€™t talk about it because then weâ€™ll I donâ€™t know what will happen and yet I need to vent. 

So to whomever felt the need to read  this piece of unorganised shit vent I hope to god that you will forget it quickly for our lives are but an insignificant speck in our society let alone the planet and universe at large.
