You know mebetter than anyone. You know every little tiny detail. I canâ€™t hide anything from you. Youâ€™ve known me longer than I have known me. Longer than my own mother has. Youâ€™ve seen every part of my life. You can tell me everything that has ever happened in excruciating detail from start to finish. Not only do you know what happened, you know how all those things made me feel. You know how all those things affected me, whether I knew it or not.


You must also know that I feel Iâ€™ve seen too much, that Iâ€™ve been through too much. You must know I want out. You must know I feel like this game isnâ€™t worth playing anymore, that Iâ€™m just running around in circles waiting to die. The things Iâ€™ve experienced have left me empty, with no desire to see another day. Iâ€™ve given up. It wonâ€™t get better. I am irreparably scarred, battered, broken.

 
I have seen too much. All of my hard work has been for nothing. Nobody cares. I donâ€™t even care, as long as I can just go to sleep now for the last time. If you understand, please donâ€™t make me wake up to this world, to this life, ever again.
