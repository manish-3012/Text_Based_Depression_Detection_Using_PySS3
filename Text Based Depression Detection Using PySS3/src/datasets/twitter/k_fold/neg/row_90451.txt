Constant Suicidal ThoughtsEvery day my mind spends 1-2 hours thinking of nothing but committing suicide. I have been like this for a few years now but it is becoming overwhelming as i am in my last year of my Bachelor in IT and becoming super stressed and depressed to the point i cant take any information in, Let alone function correctly. I am seeking help from the school counselor, but she will have to notify the mental health team as i have a plan set and i had attempted a few times before. I want to get better but i regret trying to get help now as the mental health where i live has done nothing to help me but make things worse. Suicide seems to feel the only way out for me to be at peace as i am sick of having to fake enjoying life to try and fit in and spending nights upset and crying. I see very little hope of living past the end of this year with the way things spiraling out of control for me.
