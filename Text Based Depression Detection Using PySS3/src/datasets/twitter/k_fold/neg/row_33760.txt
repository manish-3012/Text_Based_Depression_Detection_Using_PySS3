Can I die now without repercussion?It would bring me happiness everyone wants me to have! Right?

Don't think I should've done it, but I did. I married the guy anyways. Married to be used. And we are "just friends". Maried and "just friends", which we're not even that. So I can't even hold hands with him as that is crossing boundaries. So why did I do it? So I could at least make someone happy by giving them citizenship, and since I'm **forced** to stay alive, suffering, figured I mine as well do this and maybe the dread will kill me soon.

Today, three of his friends were over (which he ended up having sex with while I sat in my room next door just), told me I'd never have a chance with any guy with my body. I already was someone with low self esteem on my appearance, this just made it 10x worse.  I've seen called ugly by a lot of guys in the gay community and I'm just sitting here wondering if me dying voids his citizenship becoming a widow.

At this point I really don't have a choice but die, before I married and moved in with him I was homeless and suicidal. Still I can't believe assisted suicide is only for the terminally ill. Fuck THAT.
