I'm trying, I really am. Why can't I fix myself?For the past few months I've noticed an alarming increase in depressed thoughts. I noticed I would beat myself up even more harshly than usual, and whenever I crossed the street I would fantasize about getting hit by a car or getting shot in some robbing gone bad at work. 
So I started hitting the gym, focusing on my grades and work and within the past 3 months I've lost nearly 20lbs, maintained an A- average and even got a promotion at work. But my mood has only continued to decline. More of my day is spent thinking about how Goddamn useless I am, how I can't kick this consistent funk. 

I can't talk to my family, and I've managed to slowly distance myself from friends so now I'm basically alone in this. I've been patient but honestly I can't keep faking my way day in and day out.
