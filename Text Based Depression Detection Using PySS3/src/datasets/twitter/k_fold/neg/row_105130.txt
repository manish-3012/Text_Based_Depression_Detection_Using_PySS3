Feeling really down lately...I am getting married in 6 weeks. I have a few grand in debt. It wasn't a big deal until I got laid off in February, 2 months after taking out a loan on the ring. My Fiance is pissed I took out a loan on the ring, but that's not really a problem to me. I'm sure my problems seem small to most people. I have like a year left on my car loan, and only 1,600 dollars in credit card debt, but I just feel like shit. My job promised me 40 hours a week, but so far has only given me an average of 17. I can't make my payments and every time I get in my car I want to drive it off a bridge so my fiance can collect the insurance money to pay off the car and all my debt and be free of me as a financial burden. I am trying as hard as I can to work and dig myself out of this hole, but it seems like I can't do anything. I've told my boss every week that I need more hours, but he refuses to give them to me. I've put in over 100 resumes with specific cover letters, and only gotten two interviews. My resume feels strong to me, but I don't know what else to do. My monthly bills alone are $750. I know that seems small, but when I only make $400 a month, it sucks ass. My savings is completely drained and I'm starting to drain my fiance's as well. I feel like utter shit and a burden to everyone who tries to care about me. I don't know what else to do. I just can't help this feeling that everyone would be better off if I were dead.
