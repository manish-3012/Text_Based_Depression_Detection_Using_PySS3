For everyone in contemplation....For everyone wanting to die, I am in your boat and have been for quite sometime. I have wanted to leave this shitty life for most of my life. I am 29 years old now and have made six attempts to starve/dehydrate myself in the woods. I have hitchhiked to desolate spots in national forests and walked miles off-trail to my own secret spots. I've used a backpacking pack with a tent and survival gear (recommended) and then your everyday Jansport book bag. I've slept many of nights thinking I would never talk to another soul and just peacefully go. I have grown to love the woods, it is very calming and relaxing, however the cold and rain can be brutal. 

     Everytime I've gone, something has pulled me back, I've walked many miles with five days of no food with a heavy backpack and made it back to civilization. While I sit here now, planning to go back into the woods, I am glad I've come out when I did. I have had many adventures, hitchhiking around the country and even Costa Rica, where I made one attempt and actually became so dehydrated (it was dry season) that I drank my own piss to get enough fuel to make it out of the jungle and to the nearest village. I remember going to an old Spanish-speaking man whispering "agua" over and over to him as I could hardly talk cause my mouth was so dry. He was taken away and I'm still kind of embarrassed about the whole thing. 

     My reasons are deep, and revolve around dislike and distrust for modern day society. I have an embarrassing history sexually and i can't get over my shame. It's all a very long story, and not to sound grandiose or egotistical but I've always had a unique soul who believed in a deeper spiritual reality than to which the gen. pop believes in. I ended up searching to far and found myself severely isolated from my piers. I have made mistakes, betrayed friends (long story) and just made a fool out of myself. I have found a love for the road, but I feel like I have ruined my reputation with fellow travelers and homeless people in too many towns. I get really weird/paranoid when stoned. And am overall weird. A born hermit persÃ©.

I'm writing this because I feel like there are a lot of lost souls on here and I think that sitting in the woods would be beneficial. If you all really want to kill yoursleves, go buy some backpacking gear (it's about to get cold) and go to the woods and just sit there. Make sure it's a spot where no one would stumble upon you as that could be awkward. I like to be by a small creek. Maybe wait till next spring. I can almost  guarantee you that you will not stay in the woods till death, your mind wanders, you re-live moments you had completely forgotton. You find your true self and usually find a reason to come back. If you believe in enlightenment, meditate. Look up bhatki yoga, it's the meditation that intrigues me most. 



Just think about this. I'd wait till spring, which seems like a long time, unless you can get to Alabama, georgia, Florida, california, or arizona. Good look with all your hardships,
