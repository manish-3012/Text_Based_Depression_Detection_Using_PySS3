Failure after failureIâ€™ve moved back in with my mom....itâ€™s as bad as it sounds. I feel pretty ashamed of myself. 22 and no degree and no job. I fucking hate my life, just going through the same shit everyday. Looking for jobs online and never hearing back, then being reminded by my Mom that Iâ€™m jobless. Not doing anything all day cause I feel to pathetic and low energy. No friends because Iâ€™m too embarrassed for people to see me like this. 
Canâ€™t muster the energy to continue living. 
Just put me out of my misery.
