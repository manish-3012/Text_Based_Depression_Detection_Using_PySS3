For the first time I've kept ammunition in my house at the same time as my pistol. And the intrusive thoughts are a little disconcerting...It seems surreal to me, I normally don't keep ammunition in the house at the same time as my pistol just so that it isn't a physical possibility to use it, but I went to the range last weekend and they had a special for a box of 500 rounds, I didn't use all of it and I took the remaining rounds home. Now I have live ammunition in my house.

It would be so incredibly easy, the ammo is over there and the gun is over here.

In reality I only think about it when I'm a little drunk, and when I'm a little drunk I'm just too lazy to go unlock the safe, assemble the gun and then to find the ammunition and unlock that and load it and use it. By the time I think through doing all of that I've already forgotten exactly why I wanted to use it in the first place.

So the only conclusion I come to from all of this is that these are really just "intrusive thoughts", and not really anything serious.

But what if it WAS serious? What if something clicked in my brain to make me do it?

I guess the bottom line is you don't need a gun to kill yourself. A knife, hell, a spoon would be more than enough to make it happen. 

Just intrusive thoughts, surely, nothing more.

Sorry to bother you guys, I guess I'm a little drunk tonight.
