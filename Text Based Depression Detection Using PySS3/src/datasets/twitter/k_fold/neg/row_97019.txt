Me and my girlfriend have both attempted suicide, I'm afraid of how messy the breakup will be.I don't plan on breaking up with her any time soon but we both have depression. She attempted suicide after her last break up and Ive done it due to failing out of college, being unemployed and socially isolating myself. Now that we are dating and its the best thing Ive ever had I'm worried on how this is going to end if it does.
