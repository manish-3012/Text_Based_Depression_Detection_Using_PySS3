I just don't get it.For the past 8 or so years, my life has felt like a constant struggle. I've attempted suicide before, and come close to numerous other attempts. Sometimes it's spur of the moment. Sometimes it's been planned in advance. The thing that has always stopped me is that there are people who love me who would hurt if I was gone.

But I'm tired of that! Life is so painful. I just keep working hard, and then I find that when I finally have a free night I have no one to spend it with. No one to talk to. And I know why - I don't like most people. There are only a few people that I really value. They don't understand how important it is to me to have contact with them. But it's not just the loneliness that makes knife wounds feel so good. It's the fact that when I am alone, when I finally have no distractions at all - I can tell that my life isn't worth living. I know it in my heart. Conversations seem meaningless. Love has proven to be unattainable. Even my greatest passions no longer give me joy. I'm like a robot going through the motions, trying to stay true to myself and yet so stuck in my own routine that I'm trapped. Even doing random, pointless things, trying to make my own adventures - None of these things can bring the breath of life back to me.

There might be more ahead for me. I accept that. But it would be several years (again) before I could try for love, and I'd just fuck it up like the last time. And the time before. And the time before that. Right now, that's the thing that interests me. And it simply feels like a long, long, painful wait. 

All of this is my pain. And yet, I have to force myself to keep living for other people? For people who don't help me even when I ask for it?

I just don't get it.



EDIT: Thanks everyone who responded. I wish I could've come to a concrete decision tonight but it looks like I'm just stuck in limbo again. If I'm alive though, there is still a possibility for hope. Even if it seems too tiny to touch.
