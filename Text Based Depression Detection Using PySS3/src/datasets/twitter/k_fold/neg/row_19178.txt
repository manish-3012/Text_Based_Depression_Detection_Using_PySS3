Is it wrong to have a date set?I kinda gave myself a timeline: the middle of December. If things donâ€™t turn around by then, well, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be making it to 2021. 

I feel awful having a â€œset date,â€ but knowing that this can all come to an end if things donâ€™t start to look up soon is honestly one of the only things giving me hope.
