Everyone in school hates me. I want to die 

Give me a reason to live and Iâ€™ll stay alive.

My life is fucking shit. Everyone in school hates me because I was a little shit my freshman year. I would preach about communism and call people comrade and say tons of edgy shit which pissed a lot of people off.

Iâ€™ve changed but people still hate me.

I never get invited to shit unless itâ€™s for some project or something like that. Other than that, no one really wants me around.

I am the epitome of a loser. I have nothing and no one, Iâ€™m unattractive, have bad grades and no friends that actually want me around. The people I do have donâ€™t really want me around.

Mention my name in the hallways and your bound to hear something negative like "Oh Drew that commie whore" or "Ugh, Drew, the annoying sophomore"

If I donâ€™t post an update by Sunday, Iâ€™ll have a bullet in my head.
