Everyday every fucking dayI can't go a day without feeling the need to end it. I hate myself. The visions make it harder to resist. I'm losing hope. I don't talk to anyone about it. Anytime someone asks it just makes me anxious. 

Even if a day is somewhat good. I am still picturing it with relief in mind. My head feels like it's about to explode. 

I don't even know why i came here. I don't think I'm a danger to myself, but the urges are getting stronger. 

What's the point, if you truly hate who you are?
