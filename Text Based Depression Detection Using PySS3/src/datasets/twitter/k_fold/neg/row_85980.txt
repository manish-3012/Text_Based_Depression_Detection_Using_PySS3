Tired.I've spent the last 8 months living in hell. Divorce. Losing my son (in the sense I havent been with him in months and have no means). Loosing my home, and job. Many many friends. I've tried several times...
Medication hasn't helped, counseling hasn't helped. The hospital made it worse. Made me feel less than human for feeling like life is meaningless.
Every time I fall, I think I'll hit the bottom, be done falling... but it never ends. Every day is a new pain. Every day. Im not planning far ahead, only far enough to say goodbye to my son. im here to stay sane long enough to do even that honestly... If I could say goodbye and I love him to him now, I would be gone the next minute.
