I only care about one thingMarijuana.
I lost 6 months of work and money and time all to mold. The worst part is I have to try and save some every time I find more so I go through these fitsites of rage and anxiety attacks every day. And I can't bring myself to throw it all away. I may Jay try to kill myself with all this moldy fucking weed. At least I'll be stoned. That's all I care about anyway.
