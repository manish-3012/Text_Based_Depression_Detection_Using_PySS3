Passively suicidal.I read a post on here recently about being passively suicidal and it really struck a chord with me. I've been thinking a lot about it because  it made me realise that I have been passively suicidal for the last 2 or 3 years. I have made no concrete plans to die since my last serious attempt,  but I am taking deliberate risks with my health. I have insulin dependent type 2 diabetes, have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high anxiety and I need medication for all of these. I have not injected my insulin for months and I have deliberately not taken my blood sugar readings either. I am intelligent enough to know that I will have a heart attack or stroke but I honestly don't care. I wish i did. I honestly do hope I die, but even typing that doesn't really make me emotional. I guess I feel numb.
