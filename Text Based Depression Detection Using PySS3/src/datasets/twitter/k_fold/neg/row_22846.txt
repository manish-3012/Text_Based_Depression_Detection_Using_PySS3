I'm really sick and nobody cares.I have quite a number of mental and physical diseases. Brain tumor. Brain cyst. Other neurological abnormalities. A bunch of other tumors in random places. Chronic intractable migraines. Every neuralgia there is. Anyways I was scheduled for a brain procedure tomorrow. A pretty big deal. Full sedation. Supposed to be off my feet and monitored at home for a few days. I couldn't even get a ride. My husband said he was too busy and I still was expected to watch our child later that day. I'm in pain all the time. I feel like I'm a burden to everyone around me. And it would be easier for me to end it now then to wait until everything gets worse.
