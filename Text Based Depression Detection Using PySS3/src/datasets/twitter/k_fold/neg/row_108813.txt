After visiting various suicide/death related subreddits and reading stories, I feel forever turned off by suicideThat's a relief, I suppose. I've never had feelings where I feel nothing but suicidal, but I've thought about suicide before. Each time I thought of it, I ended up crying as I remembered what would happen to my family afterwards. My family isn't very stable right now. Whenever something serious happens, my mom and dad get into a fight about how my dad is never around, always working so long and never spending time with us kids. Each time they get closer and closer to divorce. With my suicide, divorce would be inevitable. In fact, I believe my mother would end up committing suicide as well. She's told me before that she's very depressed and suicidal as well whenever she's scolding me. I can't blame her. My siblings and I are awful, and her childhood was pretty shitty. However, she said that us kids are the reason she's still here. If I died, the string that's barely holding my family together would snap. I just can't fathom doing this damage just to leave the world. Thinking about what would happen to my 6 year old sister and 2 year old brother after my suicide just crushes me inside.

I dunno. I guess I'm just doomed to be sad and depressed forever. But I'll take that over being a home wrecker.
