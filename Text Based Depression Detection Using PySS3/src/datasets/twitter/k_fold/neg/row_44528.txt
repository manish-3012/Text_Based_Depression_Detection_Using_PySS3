Howth PierI've had a suicide plan for longer than I'd like to admit. I fantasize a out it a lot whenever I'm struggling. For whatever reason, I can only ever conceive of throwing myself into the sea.

It's always the same in my head. A cold grey sea and a cold grey sky. I'm in the pier and in the same moment I'm crashing into the water. Then I just dissipate like foam.

I can't swim and to be honest I think there would be impossible for me to survive. It's been on my mind a lot recently and I think I'm a fair bit closer to that point than most would realise.
