I feel hopeless that I have to accept that my life is like this.(Throw away account)

(I have apsergers syndrome and OCD.)

Backstory/context - I live in a dysfunctional house hold where I am subjected to mental, emotional and verbal abuse by my mother, she sits me down in the living room, where she she tells me that I'm a bad person, who abuses people, and only cares about himself, and if try to leave the room she screams at me, in the past she would be physically abusive by slapping, spanking, and on a few accessions beat me to the ground, this has lead to a issues.

When I was younger I would just lash out at anyone. (likely due the anger i had built up from the abuse) This made me become friendless. Where no one wants to be friends with me. I can't go to anyone as they think that I am an abusive person. As when I did go to the police she flipped the script, and framed me as the abuser. The result is that if I go to the police they will charged as they warned it would happen if they had to visit the house again. 

I can't tell my therapist because they would have to talk to the police as they have to duty to do so, in a situation like this, I also i can't move out as I do not have enough money, nor can I get assisted housing on behalf of the government. 

All of this has resulted in me losing hope, I'm in a world of shit, and I created it.
