My love for her makes me wanna die and at the same time it is the only thing keeping me aliveAfter more than 4 months I still love her. No matter what she did, I feel the same. she is still the most beautiful being I have ever seen.
She obviously doesn't care anymore and has completely stopped communicating with me almost 2 months ago.

I feel like I'm worth nothing. In 4 years she never told her friends or family about me. There were months long periods when I didn't get to see her because she was "busy" although sje lives few miles away. We never had sex and now she is going wild. She gave me a ton of conditions which I have met all so she would be my girlfriend. I got distant with my friends and now they are almost all getting married and have no time.

I have a job opportunity where I work part time right now. Big pay, not particularry hard work and I just don't care. I don't need that kind of job just to come home to an empty apartment.

I'm ugly. I was told that few times. Above all I got fat due to my sports injury. I have been working out for the last 6 months and eating healthy and way less again but there is no real result. Who am I kidding. Even if I lost weight I would still be ugly. Noone will love me. If she didn't love me after everything I sacrifised to met her demands, than noone will. 

Last few days were terrible. Every day is worse than a day before. Today I didn't go to work, didn't eat and didn't get out of bed. I can't sleep and my eye is constantly twitching again. 

I wish I was dead and wouldn't have to feel all this. At the same time, I don't want people to blame her. I can't do that to her. People would be talking behind her back and show fingers her entire life. I'm trapped.

I'm in a bath, even though there is a huge storm right now. Maybe I get fried and it will look like an accident. That way no one could blame her that I did it because of her.

Last night I went to bed wishing that someone would just shoot me.
