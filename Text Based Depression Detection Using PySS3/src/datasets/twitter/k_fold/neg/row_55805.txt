Feeling trappedI have avoided these thoughts for a long time but I can't help but feel that they were true all along. I couldn't accept them, what would be the point of going on after that? Knowing that how you feel and how you live can't be changed no matter what you try. That's why I held on to hope for so long, I hoped that I could one day live and be the person that I always imagined. However, you can only try and fail so many times before you lose all belief. Truth be told, I don't think I ever actually believed in it. Maybe that's why I failed but I don't think I can change that. Even as a young child I've never been a person completely sure about what they're trying to do. So now what do I do? I think this is my only option. I am not the person I want to be, I'm not living the life I want to be, and I don't think I'm capable of changing either. When you factor in those three things, there is only one thing left you can do.
