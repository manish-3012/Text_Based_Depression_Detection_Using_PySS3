reasons worth living? 

# what are the reasons worth living?

I don't know if that's the right place

for such a topic.

Since I can't think of anything better

from my perspective, unfortunately,

my only way to do anything. Before

I completely give in to this longing for death.

what are the reasons worth to live?

I need serious help I don't know what to do?

I can't stop thinking of death

yes that is an outcry for attention

because I don't know what to do next

sorry for my broke ass writing iam way too drunk too think off Grammatik and shit
