I wrote my suicide note todayThis is my first time posting in this sub. After losing my ex, all of my friends, being smear campaigned, discredited, judged, ridiculed, and criticized. I wrote down 10 things that led me to my suicide. Called these people who have hurt me out by name. I plan to post this list publicly and hang myself in my exâ€™s yard. I feel oddly calm.
