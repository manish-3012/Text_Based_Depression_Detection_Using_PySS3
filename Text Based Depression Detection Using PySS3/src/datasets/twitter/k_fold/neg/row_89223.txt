Just give me a reason... pleaseI am gonna be real with yall right now, if I can't find a reason to live within the next couple hours then I am done. I am sitting here pounding some vodka and jingling the keys to my dads car. Hell its a Friday night and I have been known to go out drinking, maybe I had just a little too much tonight and made the terrible mistake of driving while under the influence and lost control of my vehicle while doing 90 and not wearing a seatbelt. It would be the perfect way to go, I could leave this world and no one would know that it was suicide. I have been thinking about this for a while now and every reason I can think of to stay alive is nothing compared to the pain/regret I feel every time I open my fucking eyes in the morning. Its so overwhelming that I can't eat/get out of bed and when I do its just so that I can play some video games to hide away from the reality that is has become my life. Put simply, reasons for living&lt;my incurable soul crushing suffering.
