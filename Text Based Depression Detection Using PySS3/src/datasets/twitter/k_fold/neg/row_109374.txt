UPDATE: I'm sorryI [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/77k6gy/im_sorry/) here two days ago I'm slipping again. I hate myself and I don't know what to do. Sleeping only pushes the problem to later. I don't even want help anymore. I just want how it was. But it can't be like that. I hate myself.

I just can't anymore. I'm either spiteful or sad or numb. I've started making a plan and I'm scared. Not of death. But that I won't die. That all be caught and I really don't want to be put in a psych ward. 

My legs are weak when I walk. I don't want to eat. And when I do it's just junk. Like I'm subconsciously trying to kill myself with food. I can't sleep normally. I don't even know if I have a job anymore. If there is a god why did they do this?
