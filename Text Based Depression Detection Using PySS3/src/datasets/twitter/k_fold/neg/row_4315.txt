I'm fucking losing it.I already suffer from depression, gad, and OCD. And now this I can't eat, sleep, think, and or interact so it makes things a million times worse. Hypochondria is something I suffer from hugely. I have been driven to the brink and looking for answers good news or anything I don't know why I'm posting this maybe because others might feel the same way. This virus has latched on to my mind and made me completely numb to the point where all I think about is how to kill myself and when and where before this happens why the fear I don't know but it's like I'm on flight or flight mode the past month ramped up to the extreme.
