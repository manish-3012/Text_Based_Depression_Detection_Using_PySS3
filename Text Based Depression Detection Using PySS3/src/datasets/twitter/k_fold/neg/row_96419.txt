FUCK YOU for using guilt against usI should be allowed to end my own life. Each of us has a right to self-determination. 

You can't just say 'oh what would your mother/dog/cat do if you were gone? How would they feeeeel? 

I don't care, it's none of their fucking business. I can't stand being emotionally hijacked like that. I made the decision and it's the only thing standing in the way so fuck you all for constantly invoking it. I want to be nothing, I've been nothing before, and that is my prerogative. Sentimental fucking idiots. I don't know why I'm posting this
