I lost the only friend i had today. I am alone and afraid and i need someone to care abiut what happens to me.I got mushy and ended up growing feelings for her and I told her I didn't think I would ever not feel that way.  She stopped talking to me.  My wife died in an accident a number of years ago.i let my gaurd down and started to feel strongly for he  I opened myself up to her and got too mushy and now I have no one because she won't talk to me anymore and now I'm just alone and afraid and I feel unloved and unwanted and I cant handle the idea that I broke this.  And I kinda feel like what is the point anymore for really anything. I need someone to care what happens to me right now.
