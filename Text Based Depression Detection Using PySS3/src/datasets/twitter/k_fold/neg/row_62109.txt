Abused all my life and now i'm virtually suicidal. Is there really any reason to live?I was sexually abused at a young age by another guy (i was 8 he was 14-15).

I have also been bullied virtually all my life, i am a joke in my hometown (London
I continue to be bullied at university. I am 19 and i still look 12 (seriously prepubescent i basically look like a younger version of tay zonday but darkerskinned) so assholes pick on me all the time and i am isolated alot. It's like nobody that is cool in anyway wants anything to do with me, even when i try and be nice. I've spent all my birthdays and summer holidays alone

I have so many memories of being abuse in my life, like if someone was to do a movie of my life story it would be the most depressing thing ever. All i do is sit in my dorm, thinking about all the pain that others have caused me.

I am failing uni because of this and frankly i don't care cus i just wanna die anyways, like i have no motivation for life at all. In my opinion, its just a compilation of suffering. Everyone else around me live happy lives all the time smiling and partying and having a good time with friends but me never. I believe in God so that's literally the only thing that prevents me from ending myself.

Is there any hope to life? I only want others who are losers to comment because the winners in life won't understand the pain i'm going through.
