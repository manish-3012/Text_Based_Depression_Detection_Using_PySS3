nobody believes in me, everyone thinks im a failureIm a 17 year old girl and Im a senior in high school. Everyone thinks Im a fucking idiot including my parents. Ive been so depressed Ive missed a month of school. Everyones given up on me. I got into an argument with my parents today and they said they did all they could but they dont care about anything I have to say anymore. I really wanted to go to school tomorrow too but I have no way to go. There isnt a school bus thatll get me, I dont have bus money, and its too far and cold to walk. I just dont know what to do. I might as well just kill myself tomorrow when everyones at work. I fucking hate myself.
