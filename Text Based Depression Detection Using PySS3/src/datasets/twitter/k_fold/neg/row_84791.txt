I'm going to kill myself on my 23rd birthday if nothing has improved by then.I've been suffering for several years now. ADHD, Asperger's, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression are taking their toll on me. I've never been in a relationship, never had any real friends, and I'm sick of being alone. Sick of being out of the loop in my family. Sick of being in a family where I'm invisible beyond my physical self. I always feel like my family is only pretending to care about me. They never ask me if I'm okay mentally or emotionally, and they never seem to notice that I'm suffering when it isn't physical. I'm unemployable, I've never worked a day in my life, and I honestly feel like a poor excuse for a human, let alone a man. I'm trying to improve but progress is unbearably slow. I've already nearly attempted suicide, and that was three years ago, when I almost attempted to jump off the Centre St. bridge. I've often thought about killing myself, but I've never had the balls to do it. Now, I have a plan. If my 23rd birthday (which is exactly 6 months and 12 days away) comes and nothing has improved, I'm going to get piss drunk and jump off that fucking bridge, this time for real.
