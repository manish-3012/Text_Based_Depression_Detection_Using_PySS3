Teetering on the BrinkIâ€™m about to give up. I have lost all interest in doing anything I used to do. Nothing brings me joy anymore. Iâ€™m alone and donâ€™t have a single person that lives near me to talk to. I canâ€™t find work. Iâ€™m an amputee with PTSD, and that has scared everyone away from me. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized 11 times in the last year for health reasons. Iâ€™ve fought hard to just stay above water financially, but now it has all gone down hill. I am tired of fighting every day to live when there isnâ€™t a single thing I want to live for. There is nobody I want to stay alive for. Iâ€™m exhausted from trying. There is nothing more to my life than being miserable and in pain each day. Every day I wake up makes me feel worse. I should just get it over with.
