titleWhen I write a long post no one reads it so I'll try to be brief.

I have planned for a while that once my parents have died and my brother is married, it'll finally be okay to leave. When I see these two things getting ready to be fulfilled (at least six months in advance), I'm going to distance myself from friends and break up with the SO if I have one, and get everything ready (buy a gun, whatever else I need to do things cleanly). Under these conditions I'm minimizing the number of people who will be alive to be hurt that I killed myself, minimize the impact on my peers since they won't have been connected with me for a while anyway, and leave my brother with someone to lean on when it happens.

I'm having a really hard time waiting today though, and I'm wondering what I should do if I can't stop myself. I don't really have the means so the plan would be to drive to the nearest tall bridge and dive. I guess I could get really drunk so I can't drive but that seems counterproductive to the goal of not wanting to die.

So should I call a suicide hotline, go to the hospital, what? I think I'd rather die than have the people I go to lock me up somewhere, but if there's someway they could keep me safe until tomorrow that would  be nice. I don't really have anyone to lean on or I would be doing that right now.
