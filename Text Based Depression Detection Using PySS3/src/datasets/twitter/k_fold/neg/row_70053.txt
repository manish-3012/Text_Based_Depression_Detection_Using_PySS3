Has been on my mind for several days now. Checking inLast night I had suicidal thoughts due to a hatred of my body, acknowledging how ugly I am, becoming upset about how i gave up on being romantically involved with anyone. I just have a massive list of problems in my head that I'm going through on my own, Its like i've been struggling with these issues for so long I just want to give up. I found out tonight I cant make it to my university graduation and for the past 6 weeks ive spent it on my own in my apartment not socializing being constantly stoned.  Theres no where on the planet I want to visit, I dont want to be apart of the society i've grown up in because im not accepted by it. Tomorrow my plans are to tell my parents &amp; doctor this information but it feels like all the time on my own is just grating me down but i have to much anxiety about my body to deal with it.
