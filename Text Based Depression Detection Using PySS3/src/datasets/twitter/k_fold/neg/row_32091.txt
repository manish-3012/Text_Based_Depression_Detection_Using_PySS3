I don't know what to do anymoreI am not alive 
I am simply living 
I don't feel like I ever get better, I either stay at the level of sadness for a while or I get worse. I have dealt with depression/mental issues for the past six years and I am exhausted. But lately it has been getting much worse. I relapsed after two years of sobriety. I don't care about school anymore because I feel stupid and I can't handle the workload but I want to be successful. My job keeps bringing me down but I cannot leave because I make good money. All my friends are depressed so I feel like an ass going to them and talking about my issues with them. And on top of it all I have been actually feeling suicidal. I have self harmed in the past, but lately I have been having suicidal thoughts. I can't tell my family, they would be devastated. I don't want to keep living but it would destroy my family if I killed myself. 
Sometimes I wish I would get hit by a car or get cancer, so it would be easier for my family to deal with my death.
