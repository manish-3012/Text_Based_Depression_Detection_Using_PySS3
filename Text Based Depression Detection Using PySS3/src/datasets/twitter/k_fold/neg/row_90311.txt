I dont know why i continue to live and what to do in life nowI have been sick for 4-5 years now with CFS, chronic migraines and a form of skoliosis being depressed/suicidal through out it because the pain, somone really close to me told me that i was faking + playing the victim + manipulater and i pretty much need to grow up on 2 sepret occasions also that they have secret meeting with other people really close to me saying they agree, some teachers belittling me saying i need to get my act to together ur nothing special u have no reason to go home and stuff like u have no right to be late it was arranged that i could aswell as being called a cripple every day for those 4-5 years also due to me being sick i missed a shit tone of school and only passed 1 gcse i was only doing 4 all mine was cut even mandatory shit like science. I was going to start cutting but didnt cause a friend stopped me who did and heavily regretted it but still constantly think about doing it and killing myself i wrote a suicide note a while back but didnt go through with it cause a family emergency came up and didnt want to leave it in a even worse state that family emergency still isnt over being the main reason i havnt gone through with it. I have had a break down at least every month since they said i was faking + everthing else they said what happened during the first year then again in the second year the break down being about life and them lasting 30mins to 3 hours of me balling my eyes out usually in my room or in the bath room but it has happened afew times in school when i still went there what was weird to my friends cause i acted like nothing was ever wrong all the time and havnt told anyone irl about my depression due to me having really bad paranoia that they say am playing the victim or that they will use it against me in some way. I tried to go on a self help site during year 1 or 2 and it was helping but then got banned for saying PISS i made a new account then it instantly got banned after 30mins. So pretty much due to the depression getting even more worse through out the years and not knowing what to do now with my life or were its heading with the only way out being to take some sleeping pills and kill myself.
