Nothing ever works outI'm tired of giving 100% for nothing. I am beginning to understand that no one gives a single fuck about anything of anyone but themselves or close family. I've tried so hard to build something for myself. I'm a failure. I have failed my whole life. There is something wrong with me. I'm broken and I'm missing a vital part of being a person. My life so far has been disappointment after disappointment. I'm tired, I've given my all and gotten spit on in return. From childhood to adulthood, i really don't want to go on. Nothing good ever comes my way. There is always a catch. I feel so sad its hard to describe. My chest hurts my mind is exhausted. Its a struggle to go on. I know I am depressed, I have a lot of issues. I'm on meds but the docs don't give a crap also. Just take these and come back in 6 weeks. I hate myself. And no one in my life really gives half a fuck about me. Nor do I.
