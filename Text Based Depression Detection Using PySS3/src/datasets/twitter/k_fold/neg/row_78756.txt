Canâ€™t bring myself to go to doctors appointments to get antidepressants, even when the result may be my suicideIf it were easy to get back on my antidepressants, I think I would. Iâ€™ve been hurting pretty severely the past couple of weeks. 

My doctor requires in person meetings, though. So do most, it seems.

The reason I went off my pills months ago was simply because I ran out, and I couldnâ€™t bear to go in for an appointment just to get more. I was required to go in after two weeks, then after four, and I hated it. Nothing was as hard as dragging myself to that first appointment and talking to this stranger about how I want to die, felt nothing, etc., but the follow ups were still just awful. Iâ€™m sure the anxiety is a factor. 

So when the prescription ran out, I tried to refill it by having the pharmacy fax the doctors office (you can do this birth control) but no dice. So I stopped.

I just donâ€™t think I can do that again. I think they helped, but I canâ€™t.
