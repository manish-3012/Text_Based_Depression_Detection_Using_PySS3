I plan it, then back outRight now I've been toying with the idea of getting a suitable knife and trying that way. I'd probably just hold it and cry though and halfheartedly try to stab myself somewhere non-fatal.  Today I thought about looking for a good place to jump, and then at the last minute I decided I'd rather call a friend and get lunch coz I was also starving and I remembered  I'd rather not be remembered as that person that jumped off the library. I think about ODing on my pills. I know how to find out the fatal doses, but try not to let myself go looking for that info.  I'm like, stuck between wanting to die and that piece of me that insists to live.  I have a treatment soon and will probably look back on this like I was completely nuts.  Idk if I'm hanging on for that or because I don't want to be remembered as a total screw-up, or what. It's exceptionally frustrating, wanting to die so badly, but some part of you not letting you do it.
