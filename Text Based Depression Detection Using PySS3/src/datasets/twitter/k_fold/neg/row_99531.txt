I've never felt like it would be so easyI've been battling with depression and suicidal thoughts for awhile, I posted here not to long ago(I'm on mobile and don't know how to link to another thread) going into more detail about what set off these feelings, and I've been thinking about suicide on a daily basis. Things started to get slightly better when I met a girl and school and we started talking. We set up a date for Friday which she canceled due to strep. She said she wanted to reschedule for this Friday bit today she said that things have started to get more serious with someone else in one of her classes and just want to be friends with me. I feel so incredibly shitty. I feel like I'm constantly just used as a placeholder for girls until better options come there way. I had to took 3 sleeping pills earlier in the day just to get to sleep and pass the time. Now I've taken 7 more if not to put me back to sleep then to just numb my mind so that it won't feel so bad. But I feel worse then I ever have. Anytime there's even a little bit of a glimmer of hope, it flickers out and plunges me back into darkness. I can't think about anything but killing myself. I've never felt like it would be so easy to actually be able to follow through. I always have too much fear to actually do it, but they fear is nearly non existed right now. I'm so temlted to just grab my gun and quickly pull the trigger to get it over with. Even if things somehow get better in my shit hole of a life, it can't possibly be worth all this pain. Plus once I'm dead, it's not like I'm going to regret what could have been. I just want this pain to stop, it hurts so fucking bad and I can't take it anymore
