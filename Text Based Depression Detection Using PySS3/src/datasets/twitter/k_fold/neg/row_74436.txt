everything hurts..i donâ€™t think i can do this anymore. i wanna end my life so badly, i honestly donâ€™t wanna live to see another day. iâ€™m a depressed suicidal loner that nobody loves or cares about. my friends are no longer my friends, they have all disappeared and ghosted me. i know my fate and future, iâ€™m gonna die alone with no friends or anyone by my side. i just wanna be happy, positive, and be loved. everyone has left me and it hurts so much on the inside. i donâ€™t how to think anymore, my mental state is completely messed up. it sucks that everyone else actually has real friends and doing cool things, while iâ€™m sitting here depressed as fuck and wanting to die. i know when i disappear off the face of the earth, nobody would care, everyone will move on with their lives and pretend nothing has ever happened. iâ€™m done being positive and trying to think everything is okay, iâ€™m tired of being told the same things over and over again. i canâ€™t even get a text from my friends letting me know they care about me. part of this is also my fault, i pushed away the people that cared about me and now iâ€™m dealing with the consequences for it. suffering through depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts is not easy. everyone thinks itâ€™s a game and people actually donâ€™t go through this. imagine living a life where youâ€™re constantly thinking about killing yourself and ending it to feel peace. imagine barely having any friends that care about u and decided to dip out on u. yep, thatâ€™s what i have to live and go through everyday. i donâ€™t care if people tell me suicide is selfish because itâ€™s the only way to finally feel peace and i can finally be out and laid to rest. thereâ€™s more i could tell you, but i think thatâ€™s good for now. i hope you understand the struggles i go through on a daily basis, i didnâ€™t choose living like this.â˜¹ï¸ðŸ™i just wanna feel like iâ€™m in paradise when i end it.
