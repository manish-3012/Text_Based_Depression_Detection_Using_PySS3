I cant do this anymoreMy whole life has been falling apart recently i keep reading things on focusing on a happy memory but every time i try to think of one nothing comes up and i cant remember when i was last truly happy all i can think about now is the bad parts of my life and i know i had to of had some happy memories but i cant remember anything besides my shitty life. Ive been cutting myself nearly every night and then crying myself to sleep for being such a shitty person and then i have to go on the next day acting like everythings ok. I just dont think i can keep this up ive been debating suicide but i just dont think i can do it. i just want to stop existing
