Should I even continue with my life?My life is pretty shitty. I live in a small close minded town in Tennessee, my boss is an asshole who wants all the money for himself and treats me like absolute dog shit, I can't move away due to student loans and being screwed over on the car I just purchased so I can't move away, my father just passed away, and I just can't take it anymore.. I'm 21 years old, and I know people are going to say that I am just young and things will get better, but I honest to God do not see anything improving for me..
