I'm 30 years old. I should be over this.I haven't thought about suicide in a long time. Sure, I've thought about the idea of it, but not actually doing it.

Even when I used to consider it, it was from an egotistical narcissistic perspective. "I'm better than this world and I can't stand to be surrounded by these idiots in a place with so much evil" type of thoughts. And if I dwell on it, I can easily get to that place again, so I choose not to dwell on it.

But tonight is different.

My husband and I have been squabbling a lot. I can't stop thinking that he would be happier if I weren't around. He could find someone else that he won't be mad at all the time.

We were sitting at dinner and he looked up to see a tear rolling down my face. Only when he asked what was wrong did I realize that I'd been sitting there thinking about the best way to kill myself so I wouldn't leave a mess for him.

I couldn't bring myself to tell him that. I did tell him that I thought he'd be happier without me around. He said no way, he wouldn't have married me if that were true, he wouldn't still be here, etc.

So I'm okay right now. I haven't completely convinced myself that I should stick around. I'm just worried about my thoughts.

What if our fights get worse? What if he cheats on me and I tell myself to go through with it so he can be happy with her? What if we have kids and I have a major depressive episode and decide they'd be better without me?

I told my husband a couple of months ago that I felt like I needed to go talk to someone for some compulsive lying issues I have. He said no, you're not crazy, you don't need to talk to anyone.

But do I need to now?

I'm kind of worrying myself. I've never felt worthless like this, even in my deepest depressions.

Thank you so much for reading.
