I'm only here still because I don't want my best friend to kill herself if I doI have been self-harming again lately but I just can't bring myself to get the job done. Everytime I think about it she runs through my head. If anything were to happen to me, she would fall apart and likely follow in my footsteps. I love having her around but I don't want her to have to see me like this anymore. I want it to all be done but I just want her to be ok.
