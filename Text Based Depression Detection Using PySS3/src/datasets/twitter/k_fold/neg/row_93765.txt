I dont know how/am scared to get help..I want to change. I want things to get better. i've never been diagnosed or anything, but im pretty damn sure that 4 years straight of pure suicidal thoughts isnt okay or normal. like, yeah, theres obviously something wrong with me. 


i dont have any irl friends.. just some acquaintances in like 2 of my classes, so that rules out reaching out to friends. 
i want to tell my parents, but i know they wouldnt take me seriously because i threatened to kill myself years ago and they just played it off. recently, ive been trying to hint that i need help, but they ignore everything i say.
and of course, i could talk to my school's counselor, but the thought of opening up (and probably bawling my eyes out) with a stranger really scares me. 
lastly, my last doctors checkup was a few years ago, and im probably not having another in the next decade unless something "serious" comes up. 


i dont know what to do. all ive been doing these years is deciding on a date to kill myself on, reaching that date, procrastinating, and repeating the process. i dont want to have to resort to suicide as either an escape or a cry for help, but at this rate, i dont know...
