What's the point anymore?I struggle to find reason in my life, every day I get up and glaze by half-assed barely passing and doing just enough to stay afloat in my education. When I get home I immediately walk into the wreck of a house and get ready for bed. I often spend around eighteen hours in and out of sleep. Laying there all the time I do nothing but look back at my rather short life. Involving sexual, physical, and more importantly mental abuse. Addiction to prescription meds as well as being on and off so damn many that doctors described me as in a constant manic state. Being in and out of facilities more times than I can count. And even being there while watching my father die at an rather early age of thirty-four to a condition that would have taken his life at an earlier frame of time if not for his lung transplant. Having said condition as well (mimics Cystic Fibrosis) I never find comfort in simple tasks such as breathing. Constantly my lungs feel heated from what I can only guess is a multitude of lung infections . And today I find myself in constant pain and inflammation. Only recently has the majority of my already torn family found equal footing in hating me. And what can I say? I am a rather spiteful dick.

Constantly I ask myself when this will end? 
It's been seventeen years on this Earth and slowly but surely the years get worse. 
At this point I'm rooting for my condition to kill me, God knows I've tried and that only made things worse. Now I got PTSD from a previous suicide attempt along with all other bits of mental issues from watching death and abuse. And I find myself thinking about suicide everyday.
