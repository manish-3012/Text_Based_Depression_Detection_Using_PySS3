i cant fucking take this anymoreiâ€™ve lost interest in everything that has made me happy, my best (and only) friend of 10yrs is replacing me with her boyfriend of 5months, and school as been so stressful, i have a c or below in of my classes and all i do is make people feel bad. i donâ€™t want to die but i donâ€™t want to live like this anymore.. i want to make a change in my life i donâ€™t want it to end like this but i genuinely donâ€™t know what to fucking do anymore. it seems like suicide is the only option yet the thought of death terrifies me, i canâ€™t even SH because itâ€™s hard to hide it here because of how hot it gets. i havenâ€™t vented to anyone i know in over 2 years because iâ€™m afraid i wonâ€™t be taken seriously and i donâ€™t want to be a burden. suicide just seems like the only way out of this terrible way of living
