Can't cope anymoreI can't cope with my trauma anymore, I can't type this again so copied from my post in the rape subreddit as it got no replies and I'm spiralling. I've been raped by two men, the first guy who raped me was an abusive ex, he did a lot of awful things but I've kind of accepted this was my fault and I pushed him to his limits (I cheated on him once and stopped being intimate with him) accepting it allowed me to get back to 'normal'

The second guy who raped me was a stranger, he found me very drunk sat on the street, took me home in his car, had sex with me and gave me herpes. This one really upsets me, every time I have nightmares I remember another detail. I know it's my fault for being so drunk I could barely walk but I just can't find that acceptance I found with my ex, I don't know how to be okay, I just feel like I've only got way out of feeling this way is to just end it. I should have a strong network but the only person who knows about this is my partner who shrugs it off and says 'no point in worrying, you can't change anything' I've just had enough.
