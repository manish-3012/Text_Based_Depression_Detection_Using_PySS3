The belt felt loose when I tried to hang myself today.I had the belt wedged in the doorway and looped around my neck, and slowly started to slide down, let my knees support myself less and less. And then I woke up, face down on the floor in a ton of pain, and in complete confusion. I didn't know who I was, where I was, anything except for the pounding in my head. After about a minute it started to come back with tbh was even more painful than not knowing. My best guess Is I blacked out and brought the belt and everything down with me. Don't really have anybody to talk to about it super openly so I thought I'd share the story here. I feel better at the moment, shaken up tho, and annoyed that I have a fucking ring bruise around my neck because that's so damn inconspicuous /s. On one hand now that I'm still alive there's always a chance I could enjoy life again. On the other hand its shitty that I went through the hard part of suicide, and all I had to do was stay unconscious and feel nothing but nope here I still am wasting air and space. I really have no clue how to feel about this
Edit: The title should have said the belt fell loose
