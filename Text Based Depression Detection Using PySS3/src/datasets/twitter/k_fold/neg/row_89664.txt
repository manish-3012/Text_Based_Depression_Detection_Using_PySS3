My friend has been thinking about suicide and even made a weak attempt.One of my best friends is currently overseas in Korea for summer break (I'm in the States), and he has been going through some tough times it seems. The way I see it, there really isn't a reason for him to be like this, not that there ever really is a good reason to contemplate and experiment with suicide. As far as I know, he has made one half-assed attempt while texting with me. It came out of nowhere and he didn't reply to me for a good ten minutes in the middle of a conversation. He says he's too scared to actually go through with it and that he's fine now, but I don't want him to take another chance at it. What can I do to bring my friend to his senses? What can I tell him? I wish I could hop on a plane and go be with him, but with tickets being $1500+, it's not exactly something I can do right away.
