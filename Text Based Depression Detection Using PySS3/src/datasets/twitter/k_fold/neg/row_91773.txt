I have 25mg+ ativan, vodka in other room.Love isn't real everyone just meets their own selfish needs and lies about it. EVERYONE. I broke a chair two days ago and keep punching things but dont feel anything I started drinkin first time in my life 4 days ago and could feel but life is still empty and pointless - 6 psych wards, no friends, electroshock therapy there is no point
