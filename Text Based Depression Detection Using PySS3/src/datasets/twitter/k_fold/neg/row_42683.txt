first plan for suicide.I feel like most people have contemplated suicide once or twice.  Maybe not seriously, but there is always something bad enough to make you want to end it all.  For a few moments, that thought of suicide is the most comforting thing that there is.  Like a warm bath after being caught in a hail storm.  I imagine taking my own life all of the time.  It's the only way I can find comfort.  

I thought things would get better when I found a person that loved me as much as I love them.  Well, I found that, and it didn't get better.  

I thought I would feel better when I helped create a beautiful child.  Despite her amazing intelligence, love and energy, I still don't feel any better.  

So, now, pathetically,   I am seriously thinking of taking my own life.  My thoughts are this: my daughter is just over 18 months old.  She loves her daddy, and I love her, but if I disappear now, she'll have forgotten me entirely by the time she is old enough to make a difference.  I won't be there to show here how miserable life can be.  She will grow up happy and won't have the burden of wondering what is wrong with her father, something no child should have to bear.  If i liquidate all my assets she'll have a good amount of money for college and her future.

I don't think I can feel good in life.  I have felt this way for 20+ years and nothing has helped.  I feel so dead and sad all of the time.  

Sorry to bother you.
