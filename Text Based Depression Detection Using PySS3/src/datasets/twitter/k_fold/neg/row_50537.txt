Forgiving MyselfI'm 22. My anxiety/depression has made me housebound for 2 years. My grandparents tell me things like, "I do this all to myself" and ask me, "will you ever move out?" This added pressure has made me self harm myself daily. But I realized... I don't have to live my life for ANYONE besides myself. It's time to forgive myself! I am in control of MY OWN happiness and I can't let ignorant negativity keep me down! Thank you for listening and I wish you the best of luck!
