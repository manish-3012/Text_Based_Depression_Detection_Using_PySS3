What I would give for a hug.I don't want somebody to make everything easy. I don't need to be spoon fed love. I just wish I could get a hug or something, and it doesn't matter who its from. Life seems to be hurling out of control at this moment, and I would give so much if I could just get a hug.

It seems a paradox that it becomes ever the more difficult to get things back together once you become to depressed, its like a self feeding current. I don't post on here, or even on Reddit at all much. But I have no phone, and I am alone at least until next week. How is your day going?
