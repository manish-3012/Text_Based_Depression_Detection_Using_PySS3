Going down that road again.Hi. I've attempted suicide twice in the past and been hospitalized both times. After my last attempt, I went back to college and everything was fine up until I graduated In December, up to now. I feel myself losing interest in life again and going down the same old road that Ive been down twice before. I just want to stay in bed and sleep all day. And yeah, I get that suicide is a temporary solution to a permanent problem, but I'm becoming more and more okay with that solution if this problem is just going to keep recurring. My family is abandoning me, I've chosen to ostracize myself from friends all the while taking a back seat to it and watching it all happen because I know none of them will understand and they would be better off without me. I'm tempted to sell the things that are valuable to me. I have no motivation to do anything at all. I wish I had money to see a doctor but I don't, just like always. Please let me know, what are some ways I can subdue these feelings for as long as I can? Is there anything thats been particularly helpful for you? I want to stay off this road for as long as I can but it just feels like I'm being pulled further and further along it.
