It's not worth it for me to keep livingI've been trying for so long to fight depression. Ever since 4th grade I've had problems with it; I'm in 9th grade (15) right now. I've been hospitalized in an inpatient unit twice over more life, and twice in an outpatient unit as well. I've tried to kill myself 3 times, and before my most recent hospitalization I began choking myself secretly to forgot about my pain for that short period of time (no cutting). I've been to two psychiatrists, and none of it works. During my hospitalization, it made me hate my life even more. They promise me "dignity and privacy"; oh how wrong they were. I played along with them so I wasn't put on "Safety Watch" or "Constant Observation", yet I couldn't sleep at night. I hate school with all my heart, yet I excel at it. The one thing that keeps me alive is video games, and now that's being restricted too with the trash that is "Circle by Disney". I don't want to live. I don't want to go through four more years of school. I don't want to go to college and then have a cruddy job. How many years is all that when you add it up? How many years until retirement? I'm doing ECT right now (here's a link if you don't know what it is: http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/electroconvulsive-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20014161) and I feel no change. I don't want to live.
