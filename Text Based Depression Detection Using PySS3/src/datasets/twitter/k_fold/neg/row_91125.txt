I have no-one to help me through thisMy ex would always comfort me and make me feel better by talking to her. I woke up to my family having an argument and yelling. So my day started off horribly. Not to mention I had a dream about my ex, and me calling her a whore and disgusting for what she did and she retaliated and said, "well I must be because I fucked the guy for 2 full hours while we were dating". I wish I had a friend to help me through this. One that I trusted.
