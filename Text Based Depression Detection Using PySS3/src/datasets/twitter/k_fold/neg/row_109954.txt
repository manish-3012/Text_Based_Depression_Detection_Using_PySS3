my life is "fine" but i want to dieI have this desire to die that I can't get rid of.  My life, objectively, isn't bad.  I have some issues such as anxiety, bipolar disorder (depressive state right now), panic attacks in response to any stress.  I cry everywhere - at home, walking, reading, at the gym, on the bus - and honestly I don't even feel shame because nothing matters.

The reason I won't kill myself is because I think it would be a waste of my organs and corneas since I would not be brought to a hospital soon enough for them to be viable, or I would have to kill myself violently outside the hospital.  So I am pretty sure that I won't kill myself at least until a suitable method is in order.

But I can't anywhere find at least one other person who is going through what I feel. Knowing that I am alone makes me unsure that I can survive this feeling much longer. Once I had a mystical experience and there was something so beautiful on the other side, that now all life is flat and pale in comparison.  It is utterly pointless and I cannot feel any pleasure because there is such a strong desire to end this waste of life. I love everything and everyone and I don't want to hurt anyone. I am dissociated from my body and want to be free. I used to feel ok with this feeling, but now I think that I should be ashamed for feeling like this, and so I start to feel horrible guilt and want to die.

Someone help me or tell me that I am not alone and crazy.

I can't take this feeling anymore.  I have no one who I can talk to and I can't keep doing this alone.

edit: and I don't know how to talk to anyone because they are scared of me or for me, and whenever someone says suicide people call the cops to come get me.  feeling better after getting out of the mental ward is worse because my life is less organized and effed up. so it just makes it even worse.  so I can't even tell anyone about my feelings.
