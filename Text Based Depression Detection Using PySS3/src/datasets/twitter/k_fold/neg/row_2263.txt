I've had itIm 40 years old, single, failed relationship after failed relationship. The one girl I fell in love with and I thought fell in love with me has moved on to someone else. Another girl who I tried to get to go out on a date, I gave up on after hearing excuse after excuse as to why she can't, then finally getting stood up. I'm just done. My dad is in failing health and I'm sticking around for him. Once he's gone, I'm out. No family left after him. I'm so sick of hearing girls tell me "oh but you're so nice. I wish I could have a boyfriend like you." Yeah... Like me. But not actually me because I'm  fucking old and beat. I'm sure someone will tell me to forget those girls and move on. It's too late for me. I want a wife and kids and to be happy. The girl who stood me up said she wanted the same thing. Yeah, just not with me. Fuck. I'm out.
