I don't knowI feel like many people don't care about me. I feel unwanted. I feel stupid. I feel naive. I feel needy. I feel everything and nothing. There are so many sides to me but I don't know how to be all of them. I'm scared of loss. I'm scared of being alone. I don't know who I am anymore. I just want to lay here and listen to sad music.
