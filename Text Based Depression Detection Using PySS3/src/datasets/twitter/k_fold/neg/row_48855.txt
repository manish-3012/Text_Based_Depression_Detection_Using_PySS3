Should i let my parents know that I have these thoughts?I am 19 years old. There is an university exam in a week. I had a good score last year but I didn't want to settle in an university because my score wasnt enough for the one I wanted. Now I want to go to any kind of university that is far away from where I live, far away from my parents. But I didn't do anything for it. I didn't study I didn't even try to study. I always thought why would I bother if I dont have any dreams. It feels like I'll be dead in 1 or 2 years so why should I force myself to build a future?

I want some things like that to change but I can't do it on my own. I've seen a therapist for longer than 8 months and used antidepressants. It didn't work. Now I use another one because of my anxiety but I dont see a therapist right now. I know that if I cant earn a right for any university this year, things will be much worse since I still have to live with my parents. What I want to do is to stay at a mental hospital to change my thoughts about life. I dont know if it's gonna work but only other choice is to end my life now.

By the way I've tried almost anything. I did sport I had friends, i tried to socialize but now i hate people so much that I dont want to see another face when I wake up except mine. 

Am I doing the right thing by wanting to stay at a mental hospital? And should I talk about this with my parents?
