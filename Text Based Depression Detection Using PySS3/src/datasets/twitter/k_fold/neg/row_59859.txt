Am I too sensitive?Am I too sensitive?

Long story short, Iâ€™ve been planning my own death since the beginning of lockdown. Am I too sensitive? 

This time last year I was somewhat depressed, there wasnâ€™t much going on in my life. I worked 9-5 mon/fri (hated it), my social life was almost nonexistent, however I was paid well enough to save up towards my goals.

Fast forward to today. Iâ€™m 25, unemployed, without a degree, without any savings, no car, family or friends. Iâ€™m not the definition but the embodiment of failure. 

To make things worse I owe Â£3,500 in CC debt, and growing. 

At this stage I donâ€™t think that there is any other way out. Even found the most perfect cliff with scenic views.

(Yes, I agree. Some of my past actions led me to this situation and that Iâ€™m at fault for the most part) 

Although Covid havenâ€™t hit me as hard as it did to other people who have lost their loved ones, lives and livelihoods. I feel like Iâ€™m done with living. Or am I too sensitive?
