DepressionLately ive been really going through it. Between the mother of my child and generally just dealing with life on lifes terms i have been crushed by anxiety and ive never been so fucked in my life. The strange part about it death dosent scare me. I want to die, and i wish i could desolve into thin air. My daughter and parents are the only thing keeping me going because i know my mother would be devistated. But i feel like im only a burden on everyone i know including my parents and my daughter, even my friends. I dont know what to do, i dont know how to fix it. I want to feel loved and bbn i want to love but i feel dead and broken. Im not sad i just dont want to live anymore and i feel guilty about that.
