I have never tried to kill myself, but Iâ€™ve come closeOne time I slit my wrists and it bled a lot but I didnâ€™t even pass out. There are scars but it wasnâ€™t deep enough to really be a suicide attempt. No one found out. A few times Iâ€™ve rigged a noose with a belt and tried the partial hanging thing but I chickened out before I passed out. I need to do it in a way I know will work.
