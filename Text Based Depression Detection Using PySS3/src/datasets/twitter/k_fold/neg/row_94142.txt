What can I even do anymoreEverything just hurts so much. I want to cry so badly but nothing comes out. I want to be successful but I can barely even motivate myself to get out of bed in the morning. The last girl I dated I felt so strongly about that I told her I loved her, just to be told that I like her more than she likes me. Pretty much everything that has ever made me happy has come back to bite me in the ass. In some way I get disappointed by in or ashamed of being so worthless. I hate talking about how depressed I am in person. Iâ€™m scared to talk about it. Iâ€™ve opened to so many people before and my myself vulnerable only to get hurt. Im sick of it. Im sick of everything. I just want the hurting to stop.
