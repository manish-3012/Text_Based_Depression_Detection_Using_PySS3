I want to almost die so people maybe will appreciate me. But if I actually die, that's good tooI'm sick and tired of being not even third wheel. Everyone is fine without me, takes everything I do for granted. It doesn't matter what I do, they'll always be grateful for literally everyone who isn't me. And yet I can't ditch them because I'd be completely lonely and that'd push me over the edge
