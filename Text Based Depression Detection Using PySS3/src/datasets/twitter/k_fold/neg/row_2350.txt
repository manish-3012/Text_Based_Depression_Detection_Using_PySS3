i cant kill myselfi had a dream a long time ago that i was in hell. it looked like a charlie immer painting. surreal, colorful, but still morbid. i knew satan and he looked a good deal like marilyn manson &amp; hades from disneys hercules. i had done something to anger him  and he took my body and broke it in half across his knee. then he dangled the two pieces over this black hole in the ground maybe as wide as a queen sized bed. he threatened me. he said if he dropped me in the hole it would be worse than death. it would obliterate me entirely. everything i had ever done would be erased. like i had never existing on this earth at all. instead of being afraid i fell in love with him. i wanted it. 

thats why i cant kill myself. if i die i will still have had this life. i will still have existed at all. suicide isnt enough. its not enough to remove me completely because others will still know of my life. 

im crying. im insane. but i cant stop.
