I just feel so down.This happens every month and a half, I'm getting through life and then the thoughts come. It's a circle of worthlessness and guilt and a lot of crying and giving up on so many projects and plans and papers.  Iâ€™ve never been so lonely before in my life, I know Im not friendless. Iâ€™ve got people to call, to write, to text. There is no one to nudge and say to â€œHey look at that.â€ or â€œYou know what she was wearing todayâ€¦ I hate looking at my life and asking â€œwhen am I going to be happy again?â€ I hate looking at everything as an escape into something else. Why do I have to run from my life? Why does every moment have to be a chance to dream up another reality. I hate thinking that the best times have passed and I hate that my best friends in the world are scattered to the wind and I absolutely hate telling them I am unhappy. Thatâ€™s all I do when we actually talk, I keep so quiet through out the day that when I get a chance to talk its just the bad. Whats awful right now is that my Dad lost his job and is sick, with lord knows what and I am scared. What if heâ€™s really sick? and the worser thought after is: Will I have to stay to help take care of him?
The thing that is so awful about this is that I dont know what scares me more, my Daddy being sick or the thought of being stuck here for anyfucking thing longer that this year. I donâ€™t think I could make it more than that, honestly. If its anymore than a year Iâ€™m going to be six feet under, incarcerated or institutionalized and Im not being too melodramatic, Its a promise. And I feel guilty for not knowing which is the bigger fear, how can I think about that for my own Father.
All I look forward to is leaving and every â€œstep forwardâ€ I make here in this place seems to make it harder to do so. I just got a job (yay me!) but this meant I wasn't able to leave for Thanksgiving or Christmas. The thought of getting away this past month is whatâ€™s kept me sane and now it seems so out of reach.
Every time I think I can cope, it just gets worse. This is the stuff I am supposed to tell my people late at night, and someone is supposed to comfort me then they say their fears and our friendship grows. This isnt the stuff I say in email or text or instant message or video chat.
One of the main reasons I wanted to go home was so I could see a doctor, I know they say crazy people dont know that they are crazy. Well I know Im not okay. I know I need to see someone and I hope to God (capitalized and everything) that someone can fix me. I just dont know how to find a Doctor like that up here, and get to them and all that.
