I can't no moreHonestly I feel like I've had enough of this, I feel so alone in many ways, life seems so grim and cruel and its just not worth fighting for and its not even that special, life is not a gift, its something that was given to us by force and eventually we will have to return it, death is inevitable, there is no way to avoid it and I no longer feel comfort by thinking about how fragile life is and how all this bullshit will have to end, this feeling of dread is overwhelming and I can't believe that I've been using fiction to cope with reality, I can not believe that simple characters on a screen and words on some paper were one of the few barriers keeping me from ending it all, I also don't want to fall low enough to do drugs, that shit has been on my mind for so long but I have no way to access to them since I don't know any dealers, I just want to cry right now since I don't want to live but deep inside I'm afraid to die but I'll take my chances and hope that whatever is waiting for me is not any worse than this.
Please someone out there, I don't know even know my self sometimes I feel like I am doing this for attention and it just feels so wrong. I just want to know what is the quickest and most painless method I can use, I know a bullet to the head is not quick enough, nor is a noose, an overdose would be painful but I have many types of medical pills at my disposal, a knife to the neck also seems painful
