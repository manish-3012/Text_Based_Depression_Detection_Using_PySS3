Relationship Me [29 M] ex [26 F], i fucked up I feel I have no other choice than kill myself.
TL;DR Got in a stupid end of relationship that makes me feel very bad about myself, feel I'm not far from killing myself and reaching for advice.

Hi there, I posted on relationship but got advice to post in here.
So here it is :
A girl I was with was the only girl I fell in love with. I was her friends with benefits. She said she didn't feel any love for me except in friends, I said I couldn't stay friends since I loved her. I couldn't be strong enough to contain my sadness and I harassed her with texts every few months. We broke up 2 years ago, she said she never wanted to be in couple with me, said I lacked confidence, now she is in free couple with someone and I think she moved with him. She said I was too damaging for her and never wants to speak to me or see me again. When I told her I just needed to talk once to get closure she said I needed to talk to a shrink. I feel like a worthless piece of shit, and I can't really deal with all the sadness, although I have good friends and my brother that support me, I guess I don't really have any reason to live, I stayed alive because I needed to feel love for someone, now I guess I fucked up and I hurt myself and the person I felt love for. I know I am not seeing things with a clear state of mind, I need help just to see things a bit clearly, so I'm reaching for help. I have a huge ego and I know I might kill myself if I don't change something about this situation.
edit : Please feel free to give any advice, trolls are welcome too, I'm just searching for people to talk to, and I know talking to a suicidal person can be very difficult because of the risk of influencing or convincing the wrong way, I won't make a choice because of what people give in advice but I just need to talk.
