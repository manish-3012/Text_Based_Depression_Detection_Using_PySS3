Friend just committed suicide. what now?one of my friends commuted suicide yesterday. the whole town is in shock. things like this never happen here... until they do, i guess. We live in a good town, with good people, he was a nice young boy, athletic, sweet, and quiet. He had plenty of friends, i just donâ€™t understand how this could happen.
