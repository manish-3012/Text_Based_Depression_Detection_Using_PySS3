Please don't send me PMsI feel guilty that some stranger is showing some kindness and I can't repay them back.

Anyway, just a few more days. I feel empty. I've given myself the liberty to do whatever I want for the next couple of days but there's nothing I want to do, you know? I've given up trying to finish my reading list; I read a sentence--sometimes a page--and then close the book. I even bought the VC Pokemon Silver thinking 'well, might as well' but I regret buying it now :(

I don't know why I'm typing this. I'm just bored, I guess. Well, more restless than bored. I'm probably not thinking things through again--maybe the rope I'll buy won't be able to hold my weight, maybe someone will find me before I die, maybe I won't even get that window of opportunity, etc.

In terms of planning I don't have much to think about. I had one constraint at first--I didn't want my grandma to know I had killed myself--but recent events has made me realize I don't care about that anymore; my parents will probably hide it from her anyway.

I feel weird, like I'm just faking this. I've thought about suicide countless of times before but I was always sad or angry. Now I'm just... content? Like I'm not sad enough or angry enough to even think of suicide but here I am anyway.

No, I don't want to do anything about it. I know you're thinking I wouldn't be posting this if I didn't want help but I just want to leave this here like a note of some sort. Obviously this still doesn't explain why but I want people to know I had thought about this for a while and it wasn't a spur-of-the-moment thing.
