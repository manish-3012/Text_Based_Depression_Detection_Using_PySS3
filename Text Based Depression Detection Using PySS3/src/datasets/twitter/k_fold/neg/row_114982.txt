I need to die. It's no longer a wantI really need to die. I just figured out that I have no empathy. I don't care about the emotions of anyone. I understand why I haven't had a friend in 8years it's because I'm not capable of being in a relationship where I care for another person. I never learned empathy because I never had a friend and now I can't make a relationship with anyone because I'm evil I'm not human. I can't believe it took me all these years to realize this. I have to die someone like me shouldn't exist.
