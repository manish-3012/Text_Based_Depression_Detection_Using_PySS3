Raising a childI feel like raising a child is a lot like Chinese acupuncture. You need to apply the correct amount of pressure on just the right spot in order to get the best results. The problem with most parents is, the ones willing to have kids and the ones that have had one against their will, that they perform this acupuncture therapy with nails and a hammer. Then after about a decade of so of so called raising you and teaching you, they shove you into the world, expecting you to know stuff that nobody really bothered to teach you. Then when you fail, when you get lost into the world, when the world punishes you for not knowing what to do in "simple and everyday" situations, they look at you with surprise, shock and most of all disappointment. I would rather face a bear with nothing but my clothes on than raise a child and therefor ruin a life. Too bad most people that have kids are too stupid to understand that they are bringing a lot of hate into the world instead of love. But what do I know, I'm just an idiot.
