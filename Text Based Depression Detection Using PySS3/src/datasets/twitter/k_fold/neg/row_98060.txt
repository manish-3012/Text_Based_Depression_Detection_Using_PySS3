My parents are in a divorce for 2 years now and itâ€™s still not fixed and I canâ€™t take it anymoreI have been sitting in my bedroom with a knife for some time now, thinking if I should just end it there. I mean, what did I contribute to society? Nobody would miss me when Iâ€™m gone. I have no friends, no family... 

Please help me
