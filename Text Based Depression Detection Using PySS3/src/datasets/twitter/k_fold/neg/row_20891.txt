Each breakdown leads me closer to the endBasic background: I've been suicidal since I was 8. I've attempted suicide upwards of 9 times. I have severe depression, anxiety, and anorexia. I've been hospitalized upwards of 5 times for suicide attempts.  

I've been good for about a year with keeping my suicidal stuff in check. I'm a high school senior who moved in with my aunt and uncle. I refuse to kill myself while I live with them. It's just not an option for me morally since it's not my home and it would be rude to have them have to deal with it. However, I'm going off to college soon, and that mentality will not keep once I get my own place.

I'm just postponing the inevitable but it gets harder day by day. I'm at the point to where I'll wake up, go to school, spend time online, do work and go to bed. It's routine, it's unfulfilling and there's nothing I can do about it. My therapist is sincerely worried that I have no 'fun things in life' and it's laughable to me because it's so usual for me to just not do anything other than schoolwork and numbing myself with the internet.

But yeah. I'm probably going to be dead within the next couple years. It's weird to think that I'll most likely never be 20.

I don't know if I'm looking for help or just a place to actually say what has been running through my mind ever since I was 8.
