I am a piece of shit and I deserve to die.Iâ€™ve never wanted to die more than I have the last 2 weeks. 

Itâ€™s all hitting me now. I have zero friends. The ones I used to have dont care about me anymore, or they never did. I miss my ex boyfriend. I know itâ€™s my fault we arenâ€™t together anymore. I know Iâ€™m a piece of human garbage for cheating on him. I didnâ€™t want to. I tried not to. I said NO when it was happening. I wish I could some how take it back. Iâ€™ve gained 70 pounds in a year and a half. What the fuck is wrong with me. Iâ€™m disgusting and ugly. Thereâ€™s nothing I can do to fix it.

How can I just end it all already.
