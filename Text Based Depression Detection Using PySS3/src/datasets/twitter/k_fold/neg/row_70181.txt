School stress School is one of the main reasons I want to kill myself. You can see other reasons here. Iâ€™m doing a "virtual" program but I have to go in public to do tests every Tuesday and Thursday. It doesnâ€™t seem like a big deal to anyone I vent to but itâ€™s crushing me. My anxiety and stress is off the charts. I canâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t go to it publicly. And I already have weeks of schoolwork due. My mom is helping and doing some for me but I feel like an ungrateful brat for it. My mom was talking about how sheâ€™s trying to be patient with me when I go on about school stuff but I have to suck it up. She says everyone else has to suffer too. And itâ€™s invalidating as fuck. I know she means well but to me it sounds like sheâ€™s saying "youâ€™re no different, everyone else is doing this too and theyâ€™re not a dramatic fuck." Cause I know Iâ€™m being a sensitive, overdramatic, ungrateful, annoying piece of shit. I know everyone around me is done with me at this point. They love me but I know Iâ€™m a burden on their life. I make everything a big deal for them. I make everything some kind of movie where I have to be the little victim. I want to switch to homeschool but itâ€™s going to be expensive and I donâ€™t want to make my mom go through anything more for the stupid little bitch I am. 

Nothing helps now. If it does, itâ€™s very short term. I try drawing and listening to music, the only things I like now. But then I realize my art sucks and I canâ€™t draw anything well, and the music Iâ€™m listening to is all from a time where I was happy and not so messed up. Then I realize how meaningless and stupid the world is. I hope someone can just take me out easily, quickly, and painlessly, without traumatizing my family.
