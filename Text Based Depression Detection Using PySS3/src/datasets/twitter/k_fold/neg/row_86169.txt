I got sexually abusedI can't take it anymore.

I've literally been in treatment for depression my whole life.

This guy forced me into sexual acts as kind of promise for a relationship.

Then said he didn't want to have "full on" sex with me later.

I literally feel like stabbing a knife to my throat.
