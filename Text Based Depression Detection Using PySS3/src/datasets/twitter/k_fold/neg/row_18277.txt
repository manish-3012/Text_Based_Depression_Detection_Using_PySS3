Im drowning in undiagnosed adhd and if I donâ€™t get help I worry what will happen.I finally worked out that 6 years of depression and torture of school and relationships is probably because of adhd. I know self diagnosing is bad but fuck it, I know myself and have dug deep enough to finally know whatâ€™s wrong and it fits together and unveils the puzzle. Problem is I donâ€™t know if the psych that is testing me believes me or even fucking knows enough about adhd to know what it really is, itâ€™s name is so deceiving for what it is. If we called autism just bad social skills disorder it cuts out a very large part of what it really is. If I donâ€™t get diagnosed Iâ€™m going to continue drowning in my life. Iâ€™m 18 and I canâ€™t even do a 3 day a week art course. My housing situation is fucked because I went into foster care and I have no clue if Iâ€™ll have a house in 2 months. I just need help, but to actually get it, it comes down to some person who doesnâ€™t know me. If I donâ€™t get help, I am going to drown, itâ€™s torture finally knowing whatâ€™s wrong but no means to fix it.
