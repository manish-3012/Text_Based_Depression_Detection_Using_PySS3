25 weeks pregnant and bipolar suicidal.Hi. This is my 2nd pregnancy and I contemplated terminating it early on because my depression was so bad. I have a seemingly perfect life- a wonderful fiancÃ©, beautiful 2 year old, and a nice house in the suburbs. But my bipolar wrecks havoc on all of that. About 7 months ago I spun out of control and went manic and cheated on my wonderful man. We broke up (a month before our wedding) and called it quits. We got back together in august and immediately decided we were still getting married and wanted another baby. We tries and conceived a baby boy. From the I lost it to severe depression. To do the point of suicide.i struggle with whether I want this baby. I'm thinking quite often of suicidebut I don't  want to hurt my unborn child.
