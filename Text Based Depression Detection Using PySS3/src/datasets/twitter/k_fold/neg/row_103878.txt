Hahaha have you had a very vivid dream of hanging yourself up? hahaha...2 nights ago, i had this very vivid dream hanging myself up with a bedside table cover lace. i still remember putting it up on ceiling, putting my neck over it. it felt kinda good. i should have woke up screaming and sweating all over, but i didn't. Instead, i woke up smieling and happy. When i knew i was dead, it felt like the moment when relax all of my tight muscle. i have been taking medicine for depression and panic disorder, in the clinic i go through this relaxation therapy. it felt like the best feeling i can feel from the relaxation therapy. Tightning the muscles and letting it go. I told my mom about this dream and i felt like crying while telling her i dreamed of hanging myself up. Suicidal thoughts come into my mind everyday, but somehow dreaming of actually doing it sort of made me happier. Weird.
