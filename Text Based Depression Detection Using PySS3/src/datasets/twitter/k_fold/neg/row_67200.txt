When the opportunity comes, I'm killing myselfI'm just not dealing with this anymore. Right now I'm so volatile that I've just numbed myself out. I'm planning on leaving the house and taking with me a rope and some Tylenol PM, so I can hang myself when I'm too drowsy to get any way out of it. 

I don't know how this sounds to an outside person at all. Maybe it sounds whiny, pathetic, or inconsiderate. It's probably all of those 3. But when it comes down to it I am so happy that I will be going through with this. My only regret is that I didn't do it sooner, when I was calm and everything was serene and wonderful. But it just can't be that way anymore I'm too stubborn to do anything but kill myself.

This is dumb and I'm dumb. I'm not making it.
