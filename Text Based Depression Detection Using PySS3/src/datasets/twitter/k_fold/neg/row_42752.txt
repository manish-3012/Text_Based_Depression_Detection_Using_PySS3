Life has no redosI've wasted a big chunk of my life. Never went to parties, always been a bit of a recluse, never had a gf, barely have friends. Point is I'm 26 and barely have a life. The clock keeps ticking and before you know it, you never enjoyed your youth like you should've. I always seem to have an inability to just let go and enjoy myself. People say you shouldn't look back, but the longer you fuck your life up, the harder that becomes. For example, people have great memories of school, or college, or after college. I mostly have bad memories. Life works in stages, and you should embrace each stage as it comes, or live with regret. The longer I have no life, no memories to share, the closer I step in the realm of committing suicide. Death would be bliss right now, but I'm still trying to find better days it seems.
