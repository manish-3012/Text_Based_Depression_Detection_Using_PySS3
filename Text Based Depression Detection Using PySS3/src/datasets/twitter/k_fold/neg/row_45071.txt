All day, every day, I think about ending it. Here's why.In 2017 I robbed a bank.  I was suicidal and since so much of my depression was financially motivated, I decided to end my life but with a small chance 
of solving my problems.

I got caught. I went to prison for 20 months.  I'm now out and can't find a job that doesnt background check.  I don't live in the same state as my family and I lay around all day.

I have nothing to live for and feel that I'm an awful person.  I have no future, or present.  Just an awful and tainted past.

I feel I'm justified.
