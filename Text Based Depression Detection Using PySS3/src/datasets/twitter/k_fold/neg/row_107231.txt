I think I am going to commit suicide in the summer.I don't know... I feel like things have gotten so bad mentally that I've just accepted that things wont get better and it feels like things in my head just equalized themselves out... like a moment of extreme calmness after a bad storm before it all fades to black. Next month ill be back in my home state, and I plan on doing it on the beach one sunset in June. I think knowing when im going to die makes life more managable. Summers were always nice as a kid so I find it kind of poetic. I know nobody cares about this, and I dont care if anyone cares or knows, but it just feels refreshing to say it out.
