Iâ€™m doneIâ€™m 20 years old, male. Iâ€™ve been going through therapy for almost 6 years now. I have a loving mom and dad and siblings who I love and who love me back. I have a great girlfriend who I love. Iâ€™ve traveled to several countries, and play soccer. But for some reason I still feel empty. And Iâ€™m tired of it. Itâ€™s getting to the point where I lash out at my family very, very harshly to the point where it even hurts me to do it. Iâ€™ve been an inpatient before at a behavioral hospital for attempted suicide / thoughts. Iâ€™ve been on all sorts of medications. Nothing helps. Life is pointless. Whatâ€™s the point in working if you canâ€™t take that money to your grave. We are nothing but flesh and bone. Iâ€™m just so tired of everything to the point where I just want to end it.
