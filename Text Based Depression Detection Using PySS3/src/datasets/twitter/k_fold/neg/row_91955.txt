What the hell is wrong with me?So basically i have been scrolling through this subreddit for a few days now, reading peoples posts. One thing most of them have in common are mental illnesses. I am 13 and have not been diagnosed with anything. Yet somehow every time i get angry or upset, my mind resorts to death, suicide and self harm.  I have no idea whatâ€™s happening. I have had many opportunities to commit suicide and have missed all of them. In the end I concluded it wouldnâ€™t be nice for my family to have to go through losing one of their 2 sons and chickened out. Instead, I thought of stabbing a knife through my left hand until i cant anymore. I have self harmed before but nothing extreme like the aforementioned knife through the hand. My mum has noticed the cuts and sat down with me to talk but i feel too awkward and have shyed away from telling her the truth multiple times. Back to the main topic, I have noticed most, if not all, posts on this subreddit are made by people who have legitimate reasons for their actions. I feel i do not belong here and am psychopathic so i am making this post to ask for help and advice on what the hell is wrong with me and how to fix my messed up brain. Side note - last night i cried myself to sleep because my brain made me imagine seeing my brother die from slitting his wrists in the bath tub. It was horrible. I have a weird relationship with my brother, he bullies me and i hate him but no matter what happens i will always be there for him and do my best to help him. 

Anyway- rant over, can you please help me identify what the fuck is wrong with me and sorry for making you read my lame attempt at describing my life.
