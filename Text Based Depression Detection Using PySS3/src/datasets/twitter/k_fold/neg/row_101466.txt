Sometimes suicide is selflessIf I ever left my house, I really think I would be a danger to other people. I get so obsessed and have stalked two people in the past. It troubles me that I'm becoming more and more indifferent towards myself possibly becoming violent. It doesn't help that moments of clarity are becoming fewer and far in between. I worry that one day I'll just wake up and not understand the difference between right and wrong anymore. It's already happening. I can see how other people would think it's wrong to kidnap people and keep them in your basement, but there's a big disconnect with me. I don't want to hurt other people though. 

I should just kill myself.
