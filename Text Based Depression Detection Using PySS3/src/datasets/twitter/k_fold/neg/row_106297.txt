Why me? Plz Someone Why me? I'm fat, ugly, bored and doing horribly in college right now. DO I really think I will be able to be a financial advisor? Probably not, On the verge of me doing one wrong thing and being fired from my job, lost my school scholarship and my parents fucking flipped on me. I have talked to the hotline but they dont really offer real solutions. I haven't said anything to my parents about what i'm feeling, it will only make them worried about me which I don't want. I feel after having this issue for around a month of being depressed and sad now. Suicidal thoughts now flood my mine if anything bad happens in my life. Sometimes I just want it to end but my family couldn't deal with it, nor understand why. Please someone talk to me or something? I guess I will play my favorite game tonight to get my mind off of it.
