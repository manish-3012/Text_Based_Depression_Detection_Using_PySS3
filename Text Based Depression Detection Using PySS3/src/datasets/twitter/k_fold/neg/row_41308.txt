I canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™m really tired of living. Iâ€™m typing this as o sit next to my â€œfriendsâ€ and I feel more anyone than ever. Iâ€™ve been having the same thoughts over and over for a long while now. â€œWhatâ€™s the point in me being aliveâ€  â€œWould anyone even care if Iâ€™m gone, probably notâ€ â€œI couldnâ€™t be more irrelevant to everyone around me if I triedâ€  

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m typing this. I donâ€™t know if I want someone to convince me to stay or if I want someone to tell me to follow my thoughts and just get it over with. 

I donâ€™t even have a reason to feel this way, a lot of people have it worse than me but here I am acting like my life is the hardest. 

If you actually read all of this thank you. I hope I can be strong and beat this.
