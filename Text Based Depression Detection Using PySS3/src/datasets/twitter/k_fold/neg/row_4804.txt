Thoughts of ending it give me comfort?So as a new year's resolution I came up with a decision to kill myself on my next birthday, which is in december, if I keep feeling like shit because nothing helps. And what do you know, everything is much brighter, I'm happier than ever, just because that thought gives me so much comfort I guess? 

Yesterday I did some thinking and realized there's no way this is healthy (like no shit). I could keep faking it but I feel like that will only send me deeper than I was before. This is the first time in 4 years I'm seriously considering ending it. My life is not that bad, I'm actually trying very hard to be active and do lots of stuff but all of it feels like it's for nothing. I used to feel like shit when I was broke, now that I am earning something I see that money really can't buy happiness.

I just don't know for how long can I keep living like this.
