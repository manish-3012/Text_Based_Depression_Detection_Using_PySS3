No one, nothing, is worth it.Corruption, careless, frivolousness. 
There's not a single person on this world worth enough to stay alive for. No one cares about anyone else. It's all just greediness and evil. Conceited, corrupt pricks in power all over the world as it dies. There's fucking concentration camps in China for fucks sake and no one gives a damn. Idiots in the United States with their minds numbed by hatred and senseless entitlement. No one is worth the mental toll it takes to stay alive in a world that has turned to worthless shit.

And how could you possibly make it better? There's absolutely nothing you can do. You can't fix yourself when the entire world is a shit show and you can't bear to see everything keep getting worse and worse and worse.

God I just wish I could gather the courage to get everything over with once and for all. Nothing is worth it anymore.
