I May Have Tried to Kill Myself a Week Ago...And I Don't Know How to Come to Terms with ItDue to a lot of factors, but the biggest being excessively loneliness and isolation, and a long history of self-loathing, i wandered home one day last week a little drunk. My roommate was out of town for the day, so i was alone. I had this very weird sensation of having my life in my hands, and i remember sitting down with a bottle of rum and a shotglass, and deciding to see if i could drink myself unconscious. Shot. Shot. Shot. I have this little voice in the back of my head that freaks out whenever i do something dangerous, and i remember it saying "watch out, patrick. People have died from drinking too much." And i remember feeling encouraged and sort of disoriented at the same time. More shots. "No," i thought. "Im just drinking until the pain stops. Im not actually trying to die. Just pass out in bed, is all."

I remember writing to a friend "is that why its called a shot? Cause it feels like sitting here with a loaded gun in my hand."

What happened was my roommate came back a few hours early. I was embarassed so i stopped drinking, ended up vomitting, and just went to bed.

I don't know if this could actually be considered a suicide attempt. Part of me thinks there were definitely moments in that "session" where i was pushing to die. But part of me is like "no those were just random thoughts you had. You were just drinking cause you were lonely. You would never ACTUALLY have done it."

I dont know. I dont know how to process this event. I dont know what i did, or what it really means.
