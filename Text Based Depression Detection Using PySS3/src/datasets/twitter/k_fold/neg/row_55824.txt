Been really stressedI have social anxiety, bipolar, major depression, hasimotoâ€™s thyroiditis, and chronic suicidal ideation. Itâ€™s been like this for half my life. This is the first time Iâ€™ve publicly stated any of that (itâ€™s always been with my psychiatrist and therapist).

I have a lot of problems in my life and recently itâ€™s been very bad. For the past two months my employer put me on personal leave because I requested an ADA accommodation, four months ago, that still hasnâ€™t been reviewed. Two months unpaid. Iâ€™ve been looking for work; job boards applying non-stop, temp agencies, staffing agenciesâ€”I canâ€™t land anything, even though I get interview after interview. My personal life is in shambles and I rarely leave my house. Iâ€™m going to be homeless soon, and the only joy I get is from my two cats and trying to escape for a few hours into GW2. But even that has been a shitshow. I worked really hard on something that everyone thinks Iâ€™m lying about. It hurts. 

I donâ€™t eat anymore and rarely feel hungry. Iâ€™ve stopped taking my medication. I just donâ€™t see the point anymore. I worked and tried so hard to get help and get a job and be successful, but really, it just bought me a little more time here to fuck me over again and again, proving to me even more that Iâ€™m a worthless piece of shit and so is my time here. No one fucking gives a shit about meâ€”everyone just thinks Iâ€™m lying, Iâ€™m pointless.

How can I die painlessly? I donâ€™t want to feel anymore pain. Iâ€™m so tired of pain. I have many plans, but havenâ€™t worked out the details.
