Life In quarantine4 years ago I was arrested and was put on probation for nearly 3 years. I dealt with depression as well as a cocaine addiction along with a break up I was going through. Life never seemed to be so dark for me. I spent many nights alone drinking alcohol and stuffing my nose making bad choices and waking up with regret on my mind. The toll of everything weighing on my brain and negative thoughts always made me consider taking my life but never got the strength to do it. The day I was released from probation I experienced the first bit of happiness I had felt in YEARS. It took me some time to get over my previous relationship but addiction still has a grasp of me. Although I donâ€™t use as much as I used to I still do occasionally but am in a much better place than I was years ago. However, during this quarantine period Iâ€™ve seemed to slowly fall back into this dark hole I once was being slowly killed by. I havenâ€™t worked in weeks. Iâ€™ve been at home with the same routine, wake up, force the same ol breakfast down and watch tv/ play video games. Itâ€™s starting to get to me. I canâ€™t take being stuck inside .. the little bit of happiness I used to have is slowly leaving me and Iâ€™m drained. All my friends have their own lifeâ€™s to live and well family isnâ€™t always the easiest to talk to.. but even then... I donâ€™t want to talk. I just want everything to go back to normal. Had to get this off my chest just in case some of you are feeling the same during these times. Please stay strong and remember it will be over, hopefully sooner than later. Stay strong my people &lt;3
