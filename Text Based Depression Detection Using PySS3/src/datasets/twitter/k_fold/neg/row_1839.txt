2 months and then I'm freeMy "friends" literally never want to see me and I'm pretty sure actively hate me at this point, I don't have a job and haven't for almost six months now, I've lost any and all artistic talent I once had, and pretty much all I do is watch TV to distract myself from my life. If it weren't for my family I would have killed myself years ago and the only reason I haven't yet is because I know it would make them sad. I have a plan now and think I'm gonna do it in a couple months on my birthday so that at least my mom only has one day to mourn me. Honestly I'm nervous but content, life just isn't for me so it's comforting to know that I won't have to deal with this bullshit for much longer. In the mean time I'm still going to try to improve my life by getting a job so that I don't look like quite as much of a loser who just couldn't handle life even though we all know that's basically exactly what I am.
