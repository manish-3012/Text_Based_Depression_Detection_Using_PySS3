I have PCOS and a benign tumor that make me feel less and less like a woman every dayThat's it. It's a condition that's very hard to manage and causes a lot of damage while you attempt to figure out medications,  diet,  hormones,  ect. I can't live anymore.  Trying not to curl up into an empty tub and cut an artery.
