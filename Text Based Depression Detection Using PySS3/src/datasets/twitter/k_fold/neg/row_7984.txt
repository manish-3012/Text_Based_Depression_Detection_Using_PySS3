My father and I are both suicidal. Today he was fired, and I also found out I'll be homeless in the summer. PLEASE HELP - I need advice.I wish I could give a quick, bite-sized synopsis, but there's a lot going on here, so I have a lot to say as quickly as possible.

I come from a pretty rough background - I was disowned during high school by my biological family (because of my medical issues, not because I was gay). However, I was able to continue attending high school while homeless, and after receiving US government benefits, got my own apartment and surgeries needed to live. I subsequently dropped out of high school in order to homeschool myself via a local university, which led to me graduating early and going to the state school of my choice on partial scholarship.

There were, and still are, two goals in my life. One, is to become a manager of a psychology research lab. The other, is to be adopted and be a part of a family.

The research experience I coveted came pretty quickly. I joined a research lab, where I ran experience, managed research IT, and taught behavior analysis (facial action coding systems I.E. Paul Ekman), but resigned during this past summer since my employer was a horrendous professor who withheld overdue wages and refused my authorship. I subsequently tried taking on an IT job with my university, but had to resign on bad terms (it drove my ADHD crazy and I spiraled into a depression I am still in right now).

During these employment experiences I mentioned above, I met and eventually became close to a programmer I met online. He and I are both gay, although we do not have a physically intimate relationship. Instead, we've become a sort of family. I've always wanted a dad, and he's always wanted a son that he couldn't adopt with his late husband. Thus, we meshed together and decided that I would be adopted by him after I graduate from college (in two years or so) due to how the legal adoption process would complicate my taxes/scholarships/federal aid.

My depression has gotten terrible over the past few months, and this past week I was planning on shooting myself in a lake. However, I decided to hang out with my father one last time.

...And today I just found out that my father was just fired from his senior developer position at a company he's been with for ~5-6 years. He no longer has healthcare, and has a very severe bipolar disorder that can barely be controlled even with several stabilizers. This is compounded with some back issues he has, and brain scans show that he is developing alzheimers at the age of 55.

I spoke with him and it sounds like he's given up on finding a job and is placing all his proverbial money on achieving disability status, which he'll be eligible for in 3? months. I also happen to know that he has practically nothing in savings, yet has new car payments to make, just signed a 1 or 2 year lease on a small house rental (~1800$ a month or so, customized lease, no subletting) and has his *own* 80-some year old mother that relies on his remittances. Quite honestly, it's a recipe for disaster.

My father went to his shrink shortly after being fired and mentioned that he was considering suicide and has a couple of methods in mind. He shared this information as we drove home from his appointment. Now, this is only the second time he's contemplated suicide in his life, and I'm not entirely sure if he's being serious or not, but it's quite alarming. Alarming because I wonder if it's my fault (my depression has pissed him off lately, to the point where he's yelled at me and made me leave his house for crying) and also because I am in the same shoes (as mentioned before, I was going to kill myself on Monday. Today my dad made me go through his pill box and tell him if any of his medicine could be used to kill himself. (He did this because one of my research interests is behavioral medicine and psychopharmacology). I lied and told him no, but it's pretty obvious I lied.

There may be some hope for me. I'm attending a university on partial scholarship, which begins on Monday. However, I have been struggling immensely with my ADHD. I recently (as in, 4-5 days ago) received a formal psychological assessment for ADHD so that my psychiatrist would feel more comfortable prescribing the "hard-hitters" like Adderall (I guess you can't fault a psychiatrist at a university not wanting to hand out amphetamines to anyone claiming to have ADHD, no?). I'm hoping this medicine will help pull me through the intense courseload of this upcoming semester and allow me to focus on getting an A+ or Pharmacy Technician certification. However, this is not going to be a guaranteed success.

A little more information about my situation - I have had mental breakdowns from being a full time employee and student concurrently, and know for a fact I cannot do that. I wish I could, but even at age 20 I don't have the mental fortitude to do that, especially with all my personal problems. This is problematic in that I do not have a lease set up for the summer. Who will I live with? I haven't the slightest idea - the only person I know is my father. I've taken a look at my finances and holding a lease, even with a roommate, would not be feasible with a 10$/hr job... assuming I could get one. I also do not have a car or anyone to lean on at this time. So really, I have to pull myself AND my father through.

I really need advice. I'm trying not to let my feelings out at this time, but it should be aparent that I'm quite flustered. No, I'm terrified.

So if I had to list out all my issues and questions in a bullet form, here I go:

* How do I deal with my own suicidal tendencies? I'm not calling a hotline, checking into an ER, etc, but I do want to work through this. I can't find anyone in my area (Denton &amp; Dallas, TX) that will work with my lack of insurance / disposable income.
* What do I do if my father is serious about being suicidal, or shows signs of getting depressed? I need to take responsibility for this situation, and I don't know how, seeing as I'm not a paragon of mental health.
* What do I do if my father kills himself?
* What do I do if my father ends up going of his medicine and becomes manic?
* How can I assist my father in applying for disability/SSI? I've heard that you get rejected the first time... Anyways, any info on this would be appreciated.
* What do I do if my father defaults on his house/car/ends up penniless? I barely have enough money to feed myself.
* What do I do if I end up homeless during the summer and my father doesn't take me in? He threw me out of his place when I was feeling depressed this past week or so, and I doubt it's a safe place to count on being in.
* Really... Just anything constructive anyone has to say, I will listen. I'm at a complete loss here - my mind is stretched so thin here that I'm falling apart at the seams.
