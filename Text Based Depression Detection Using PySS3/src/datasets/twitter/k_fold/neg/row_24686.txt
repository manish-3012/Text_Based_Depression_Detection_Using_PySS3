One in 400 trillionFor all of us out there who suffer from mental illness/suicidal thoughts I want us to remember one statistic. The chances of you (or me) being born are about one in four hundred trillion. Each one of us beat the fuck out of the odds! We deserve to live because we are all statistical anomalies. Love yourself more, you are so worth it! You beat all the odds just to exist! You should not feel worthless because your very existence is proof of your worth, my friend!

Be you. Do you. And never forget you are one in 400 trillion! 

Oh yeah, and fuck 2020!
