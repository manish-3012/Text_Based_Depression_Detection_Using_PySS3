I just can't do it anymore.Every time I think my life is under control it all turns to shit. I try to keep it together for the sake of my daughter. She is the only thing keeping me alive. She is a year old and I think how sad it would be for her to grow up without a mom. Of course I also think how sad it will be for her to grow up with a mom who is as mentally fucked up as I am. 

There is no winning in my situation. I want to end it so badly but have always been too chicken-shit. I have prayed to get some terminal illness so I won't have any guilt for dying. The guilt of ending my own life also keeps me alive. 

I've been drinking a lot more than ever and have considered taking up weed again. Maybe that would help. I don't want to be happy, I just want to feel ok. I have always felt I am not cut out for this world. I'm too sensitive and weak. I was sexually abused from 6 years old until 17 years old. I never did anything to stop it despite having multiple chances to do so. I am haunted by it. There have been other traumas in my life as well and at age 35 I am tired. I'm so tired of everything. 

I tried therapy but I kept getting switched to different doctors. I can't heal if I have to keep telling the same things over and over to different people. 

I am plagued by nightmares and never want to sleep. I feel if I stay up that tomorrow will never come. But it does and I live the same day over and over. I am stuck. I wish I could disappear from this existence and start over somewhere else. Again, the guilt keeps me here. I can't abandon my girl, she is truly the light of my life. She is amazing and keeps me hanging on, hoping for a better day. 

I want to go but I want to stay. I hold on to that small sliver of hope and fear that someday it will slip away. I just needed to vent. I hate these bad days, I hate my brain, I hate myself, I hate everything. I hate that I posted this, I just don't know what else to do right now.
