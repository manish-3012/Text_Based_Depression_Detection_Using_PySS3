just don't feel like doing this anymore...long time lurker...i just can't continue.  i don't feel like getting out of bed in the morning, i only do it because i feel like a schmuck for not getting up.  i eat and i eat and i eat.  i will stay online for hours at a time, only showering at the last possible minute before leaving for work.  i enjoy being at work because there i can be happy.  happy being someone else for a while.  while i don't feel suicidal every moment, i am depressed all the time.  i just want to cry, and i want so badly to talk but i don't know how.  i am not good at this.  i avoid the phone except for my bf but he battles it too, so the both of us seem to fight a lot.  i also work a lot because i want to move to be with him.  right now i don't have the resources but i will soon.  
i have the thoughts of wanting to get out and exercise, or eat healthy but i have no motivation or willpower.  tonight i was feeling really low, watched a movie to take my mind off it, now its over and i am back to my feelings.  i eat even if i am full, i stay online even if i am beyond tired.  and i am rambling and crying right now...i don't know what is going on with me.  i am 30 years old, i feel so lost and crazy.
