I wish it was cancer.I am experiencing worst back pain in my life and it's probably some sciatica or bulging disc or some other bullshit. I was diagnosed with slight scoliosis and a lack of lordosis in the neck.

  
**ANYWAY**

I am in big pain all the time for over a month. I have a sedentary lifestyle and job, I am an artist and tried to get this job for a long time.   
What I am trying to say it's that it looks like what I loved destroyed me. There is a possibility that I will be in pain for the rest of my life there is a chance of disability.   
If that was cancer that causes the pain there are only 2 options -&gt; you got it cut out and treated and you are pain-free eventually or you die and you are free. 

I don't want to live. I want to die and be free. I am only 29 and if I think I might live in pain for like 30 more years I am done. I want to live like max 3 more years, work a little bit maybe have one trip and fucking die. I want to make free place for someone new in exchange for a pain-free life.
