I'm absolutely done with the "it gets better" discourseI'm not a native speaker so i'll apologize beforehand. I'm also sorry if this doesn't go here but i've been fighting some pretty intense suicidal ideations lately and, like that meme, i'm at my limit lmao
People just keep telling me to get help, to go back to therapy, that i'm strong that i can get through it. I DON'T WANT TO GET THROUGH IT, i just want to die???? why is that so hard to understand, why can't they just let me die and that's it.
I have literally everything anyone could ever want, a loving family, with parents that care for me and siblings that depend on and absolutely adore me, a supportive network of friends; my emotional and material needs are completely fulfilled, AND YET I continue to be an absolute piece of ungrateful trash, wanting to die so desperately when there are so many people who would be the happiest in my situation.
I realize i should just be thankful and enjoy the life that got, but i'm so fucked up lmao, i just sour everyone's mood, i'm just a burden, an expensive little shit that no matter how much they try to fix just won't get better.
I just want to go, I know it won't get better, so the sonner the better
