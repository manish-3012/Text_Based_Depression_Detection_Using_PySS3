Family found about my drugsSo, Im 22yrs old and after 4 years in college, my parents discovered all about my drug consuption. I smoke weed everyday, but she also found about non regular cocaine, ecstasy, lsd and so.

In the next hour I will come back To my Town, cause she (my mom) ordered.

For a lot of reasons about the complication of my future, Im actually thinking about suicide. If they will fuck with me, Im gonna put an ending in my life, and at the same time, fuck with them.

I have a few sleeping pills and I do understand medication interaction, in order To succed.

Im nos sure about why Im using reddit for the first time, but I guess I need a way out.

Thank vou, people.

With some love.
Lucas.
