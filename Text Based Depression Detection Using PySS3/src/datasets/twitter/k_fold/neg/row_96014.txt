My name is Ahmad , I am from Syria, 17 years old. and I live in Egypt. My father died four years in the war. He was killed by terrorists. I live with my mother and my brothers. But I live in a lot of problems because of my homosexuality, I mean violence and beating because of my homosexuality. I am tired of this situation and tried to commit suicide a lot but I did not benefit from anything and I do not want to stay in this situation and I need help but I do not know what I need and I need help and do not know what to do .. The situation in Egypt is very bad. I have been persecuted and ostracized by people and my family and have not accepted me and there are no organizations to help, because the law punishes homosexuals and denies homosexuality! Please help me ðŸ˜ž
