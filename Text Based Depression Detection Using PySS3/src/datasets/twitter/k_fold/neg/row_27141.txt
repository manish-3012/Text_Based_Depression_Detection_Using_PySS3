Suicide fantasy and planning is my only joyI am 36 and done with life.  Major depression during my adult life.  It is just lies that things get better for people like me.  Not interested in being on this shit planet.  But man do I feel a burst of energy when I start planning my suicide.  Anyone else feel that way?  Thinking about suicide used to make me cry.  Then that stopped... Three months ago I realized with a shock I had lost a lifelong fear of heights.  Not here for long!
