I refuse to hurt anyone else.It's official. I'm done with life. I've hurt so many people and have made many mistakes,which let me say I've tried to apologize for but it matters not to those I've hurt. I will atone for all my screw-ups in the only way I can see how: By ending my life. 

I have zero friends anymore. My family hates me. I have no support whatsoever. I'm tired. I can't go on. I want to die.

I used to believe once upon a time that I was special,valuable and that I mattered in this world,but it turns out I was just deluding myself.

Goodbye. This world was better before I came into it and it will be much better once I leave it.
