Will these thoughts ever go away?When I wake up in the morning, I go through my routine. I look out my windows, shower, think and eat so I can take my medications. I go through my day with intrusive thoughts of suicide and search for the reason why. 

I don't have family and I'm recovering from emotional neglect and the passing of my toxic parent that I had been a care taker for a few years. In those few years I got to see who they were, their fears, worries and what made them happy. It was a bittersweet gift to be able to connect with them and for the first time i felt as though I had a family. 

Then they died suddenly and I watched it happen. This person I viewed as a parent, friend and child died. Wham! Their face was flat on the floor and the gasping is still in my mind - repeating. It has been a year and I'm still having night terrors and guilt. 

And now the holidays bring this cold and desolate feeling that I can't seem to shake. 

I feel like I want to give up on it all. I just don't want to wake up tomorrow.
