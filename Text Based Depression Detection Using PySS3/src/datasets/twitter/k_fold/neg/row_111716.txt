Aspirin???I'll get straight to the point

I take 6 up to 12 small tablets of aspirin every night before going to sleep

No, I don't have any reasons to take it

I've been doing this for approximately 2 weeks now and so far I'm starting to hear this high pitched noise for around a week now

How long will it take for it to kill me? Or will it ever?
And no, don't convince me otherwise.

I just need answers
