Beyond HelpEveryday I have a severe depressive episode. Iâ€™m on a few medications right now. Iâ€™ve tried so many of them and Iâ€™m honestly afraid to tell my psychiatrist that these ones arenâ€™t helping either. Iâ€™m just beyond the point of wanting to try any harder to get better. 

Iâ€™ve been through a lot of trauma. As a result I have PTSD and anxiety as well. Hospitalization sounds like a nice option but Iâ€™m terrified of going through with it and I know nothing about it. Iâ€™m pretty much too afraid to do anything, so whatâ€™s the point? 

Iâ€™m going to come up with some sort of plan to end my life soon. I donâ€™t care if people will miss me. Theyâ€™ll move on.
