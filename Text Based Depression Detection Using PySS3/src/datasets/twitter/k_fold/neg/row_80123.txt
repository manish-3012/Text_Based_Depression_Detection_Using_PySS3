My (now ex) girlfriend didn't care when I told her that I didn't want to live anymoreLast year I really wanted to kill myself because life didn't have any sense: my work was a shit hole where I was harrased for being "the new one", University was a mess and my parents spent all the time arguing about anything. But I had my girlfriend, who was my everything, so in a way she was my only reason for not saying "goodbye". But one day I couldn't handle it anymore and I was about to end it all but for some reason I told her about my feelings before that happened, and when I talked to her about that she replied "You can handle it, I'm going to sleep". She basically didn't care.
We broke up like 5 months ago and I really feel lonely, I don't have any kind of libido, and my head is making me go nuts about really killing myself now that I don't have her. And the worse part is that I really miss her in a way.
I don't know what to do. 
Thank you for reading.
