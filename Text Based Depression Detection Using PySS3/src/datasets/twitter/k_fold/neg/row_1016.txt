homicidewatch is empty. I'm also suicidal, but I think the former is more a concern now. Questions...I'd prefer if an actual psychologist/-iatrist/hospital employee/doctor/etc. answer this, but any help or support is appreciated. See my post history for more info. What would happen if I checked myself into the hospital for being homicidal? I.e. I'm not really an insane person, just severely depressed/enraged and in a completely intolerable situation that makes me feel this way towards the person I live with. I don't really have anywhere else to go (not much money.) I've asked my shrink before (not seeing her again until a few days from now,) but I forgot what she said, and I feel like she may have sugarcoated it anyway to make me more likely to go. Obviously, I don't want to be locked up forever, but the truth is that, unless the circumstances change, I'm probably not going to stop feeling this way, so as soon as/if they release me, I'll be just as dangerous as I am now. Also, I have insurance but ER bills are still insane (been before for different reasons.) As of this moment, I'm not totally off the wall, but I feel that way for a good amount of the day, every day and I don't see how it's going to get any better. Would a knowledgeable person educate me as to what would happen? ALSO, someone I know with a ton of mutual friends works in the ER of one of the hospitals in town. It's the one farther away, but I would NOT want to be transferred there. I think my shrink is affiliated with them, though. I'm sure I can find these answers anywhere on the internet, but I'd like the support here anyway. Thanks.
