I feel contentI haven't wanted to kill myself in over 3 months. This is the longest period i have been ok for in the last 5 years. I don't feel happy all the time but that's ok, because I don't feel sad all the time either. I'm glad this sub was there for me when I needed it, but I don't think I will need it anymore. I feel ok now. Best wishes to everyone else, good luck guys.
