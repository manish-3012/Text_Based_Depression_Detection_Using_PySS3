I don't want to hurt her anymoreIf she

I'm just a rude, stupid, alcoholic with no self control and the only 2 reasons I don't go downstairs and blow my fucking head off with my tikka is because I don't want my dad to find me like that and I don't want my ex to feel bad because she turned me away when I went back to her begging for one last chance. I miss her like crazy and I know that there's no chance I could ever gain her trust back cause I'm honestly a pretty shitty person. I wish I could tell her this but I swore I would leave her alone. I definitely don't want her to feel guilty about me killing Myself, because I just want her to be happy. Even if it means I have to pretend to be okay. I'll delete this tomorrow when I'm sober and can hide from my feelings better because it's the work week and I'm very busy. But right now, alone, drunk, missing Brittany in every way possible. I have to spew this shit out here for now so that I don't call her while I'm like this.
