WorthlessI'm not doing so hot. As a kid, I was probably an autistic mess and still probably am (I never confirmed for myself whether I'm not), I'm a social pariah, I lost two relationships, got fired from one job and quit the other, and now I can't graduate due to an inability to fulfill and might even fail out this semester. I hate my family and I don't trust my friends. I just want to quit, travel to Aokigahara, and put myself out of my misery.

I'm not sure why I should keep going, really
