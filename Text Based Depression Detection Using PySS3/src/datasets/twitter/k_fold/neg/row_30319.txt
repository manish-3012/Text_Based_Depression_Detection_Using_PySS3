Im too tired for this, please hear my S.O.S signal..Im tired of life... It seems normal, by now, it seems like everyone â€œwantsâ€œ to end thier life. Im tired of being overshadowed by people who love thier life, but take the help from the people like us. Ive been backstabed, Ive been lied to, My morals have blinded me. I try to put up a happy facade so others dont leave me, or feel sad around me, but thats crumbling quickly. I feel no motivation anymore. Nothing is interesting anymore. My crush has blocked me, and said that he doesnt like me. My friends dont talk to me anymore. My mother is a rageing acholic. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel numb. I shell of what I once was. All I can remember is one summer day where my dad took me out to the field with my sister, and we flew a kite. It seems dumb, but as a 7 year old, I was the happiest thing youâ€™ve ever seen. I wonder if heaven is like that. I feel surrounded by darkness... I just cant bear it anymore. Im sorry to my friends and family if im not as strong as you thought. I wasnt ready for this world, I should just leave it already. I was a mistake that should be erased. No matter what â€œgreat achievementâ€œ I obtain, it doesnt change the fact I still feel numb, and void. People only want to be  friends with me for thier advantage. And when Im no use to them, I get cutt off, disposed. I leave this earth knowing that i wasnt ever going to be great, i wasnt gonna be remembered when i died of natural age, make peace with myself for once.
