I tried but I failed (because I'm a fucking coward)I know this will be buried but I tried to hang myself. Turns out I'm a pussy because just in the last moment when I was starting to feel dizzy and my vision wasn't blurry but it was weird, idk how to explain it, I stopped because I was scared. I'd been planning this for weeks and I still feel like shit because nothing in life is worth it. To make it better, a month ago I did it just to know what it felt like (not to actually die) I tied the noose way better than this time (this was the second time). Fuck, I just know life is not for me and now my throat aches and so does my head.
