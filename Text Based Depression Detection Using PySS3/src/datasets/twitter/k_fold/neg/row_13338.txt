sometimes i joke about suicide and I'm not sure if I'm seriousI haven't been suicidal in a real, serious, planning sense for over 5 years. but there's always that low-level feeling and I deny it's there a lot but I don't know sometimes. does everyone lowkey hate their life? is that supposed to be normal? because it seems like when I'm not happy about something specific, that's how I feel. every time I make a mistake or someone calls me a name, that's how I feel.

the way I got out of it 5 years ago was to stay for other people. think of my mom, think of her crying. I don't want to do that and it keeps me from daring to even think of anything planning phase anymore but I'm not staying here for me. I hope my mom lives to a really old age and we never have a falling out or I'll be gone.
