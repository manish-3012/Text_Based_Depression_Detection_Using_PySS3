Looking for reasons to live.I'm 18 years old, living in the UK and to put it bluntly I no longer have any reasons to live. 
I'm not a well-liked person in general, probably my own fault, I don't particularly make effort to befriend people and never like talking to anyone outside of my immediate small group of friends. In this small group of friends I have no one I feel any particular closeness to, no one to really talk to about anything personal. (Hence why I'm using reddit). 
Just over a year ago I was left by someone that was in many ways my best friend, probably the only person I have ever been able to really talk to. After this long period of time being apart, despite efforts to distance myself from her I am still pathetically in love with her. (It's hard to illustrate through text how that feels but to summarise...agony). Within a few weeks she will have moved away, and I will likely never speak to her again. Added to this the fact that since we broke up, I have not been able to even successfully secure a single date and I have had to frequently hear from mutual friends how happy she is and all about what new guy she is dating.

But the thing that really breaks my heart, is the fact that my own family don't love me.

My mom is someone I have never gotten along with and she makes it apparent that she wants me to leave home as soon as possible, to the point where she has threatened to throw me out if necessary. (Currently I cannot afford to leave, despite working full time). I also have a brother and sister I wouldn't consider myself close with.

In conclusion, I have no close friends, the only person I've loved will soon be out of my life forever and each night I come home to hear my family tell me I need to leave home soon. 

It's hard to see a point in life anymore.
