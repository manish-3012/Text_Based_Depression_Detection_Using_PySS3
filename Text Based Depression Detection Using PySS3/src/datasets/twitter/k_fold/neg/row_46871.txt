How many failed attempts?I woke up yesterday with 50+ stitches on my leg cause I lashed out. Around my eyes are bursted blood vessels it's looks gross. My neck has the ring of shame and my leg will have another large scar :( I'd give anything to feel content with my life. I quit drugs, lost everybody, lost the love of my life.
