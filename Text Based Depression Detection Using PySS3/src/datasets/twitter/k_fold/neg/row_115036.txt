I've decided.I'm going to burn my last bridge today. I have no one else to tell, so here's my final thoughts. 

I'm glad everyone is happier without me. That sounds sarcastic, but it is a genuine comfort. I might be crazy but I did care. I still care. 

I'm sorry that I've never been a good friend. I'm sorry that I can't change. 

I have nothing else holding me to this world, and its painful but I finally feel free. I can't see a way to start over, so here I am. If I'm going to go through with it, now's the time. 

All I ever wanted was a normal life. To be accepted. To care about others and be cared about. Real human connection. But by some accident of birth, I've been denied it. It wasn't fair but life never is. Life won. 

Tonight I'm going to shoot myself in some woods, not far from my home. 

I'm sorry to the person that eventually finds me. Its not my intention to potentially disturb you, but I can't continue living. 

Goodbye.
