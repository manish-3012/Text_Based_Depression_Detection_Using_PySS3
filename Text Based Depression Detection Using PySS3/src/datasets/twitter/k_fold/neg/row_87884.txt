Love, what an evil and unfair feeling. I started feeling love for the first time in my life around 2-3 weeks ago. I have feelings for a girl who I met when I came to my new school, whom I became really close friends with, then we somehow got separated, without any particular event and that was the moment I realized I had a huge fucking crush on her. She is so cute, so beautiful, and smart that I can't even explain. She is like the first ray of sunlight I saw in years.

But here's the thing, she doesn't even want to talk to me and she sometimes tells lies to avoid talking to me. She leaves me on seen, 10 minutes later calling leaving on seen "rude", talking to others for hours and hours but then when I ask if she wants to chat she says "my communicaton.exe stopped", but simultaneously talking to someone else.

I love her. More than I have loved anything in life. But she doesn't, thus hates me.

Advice for you lads and lasses out there, never love anybody unless you are one of those "perfect life"s.
