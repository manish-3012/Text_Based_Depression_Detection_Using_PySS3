How to make it look like an accidentOk so Iâ€™ve confirmed that my insurance will pay if I kill myself.   So that base is covered.   That said, Iâ€™d prefer to not burden my children with the thought that I donâ€™t love them enough.    So ideas on dying include

1) driving off cliff
2) suicide by gang violence 
3) falling off parking lot roof
4) drowning
5) heroine overdose


Drowning seems painful but would look the least obvious since Iâ€™ve been swimming a lot lately.

Thoughts?
