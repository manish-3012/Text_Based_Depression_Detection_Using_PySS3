Seriously thinking....(vulgar)Why does it matter? Like... Iâ€™m gay and my family hates me for it... I have no friends, Iâ€™m not attractive enough to have a relationship with someone. Iâ€™m seriously thinking of just fucking killing myself, or going to a bar and letting people use me and throw me away; then Iâ€™ll at least have some feeling from it even though it will just be pain.... I honestly donâ€™t even care anymore
