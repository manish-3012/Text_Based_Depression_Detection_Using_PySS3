To the 19 year old meBack when I was 23, going on 24, I tried killing myself and I wanted to write the 19 year old me a letter but I have no other outlet other than this one so Iâ€™m posting it here.

She doesnâ€™t like you, she doesnâ€™t care about you, she doesnâ€™t think about you. She might find the interest flattering but thatâ€™s about it.

Think about the way youâ€™re being treated right now. Theyâ€™re acting like you canâ€™t be gotten a hold of, but they quote cherrypicked parts of your MySpace and Facebook to make fun of you. Does that sound inviting? Do you really want people like that in your life? Is someone who does nothing to defend you from that worthwhile?

What about your friends, your family? Do you want them to be treat like this?

Whenever someone youâ€™ve been trying to reach does respond what do they do? Gaslight you.

Thereâ€™s billions of other people out there. Do yourself a favor and pursue people who pursue you. Stop chasing folks that treat you like garbage.
