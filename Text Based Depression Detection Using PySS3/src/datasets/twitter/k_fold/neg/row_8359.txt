I might end it now. My girlfriend is having sex with another guy on our anniversary, as I write this. On Christmas Eve.I would literally pay someone to come to my house and shoot me in the face. 

She was my first, at 26. I thought I'd be alone forever. I threw everything away for this girl. My friends, my loving family. Moved many hours away. Took care of her, treated her like a queen, worked hard to pay her bills and cook and clean. Became a live-in servant. But no more.

 She stopped sharing any kind of intimacy with me. I was all alone, truly alone. She explained she was polyamorus and "only liked sex when it was new". I begged and pleaded, and she drew further away. She knows I have no other options, no one to turn to, no place to return to. I'm trapped here. 

She's been texting her ex all day, excitedly making plans for a late night "drive". "He's going through a tough breakup right now, I should be there for him as a friend." She thinks I'm a fool. A child. I'm lying  here alone in our apartment, a place I thought would be filled with love and joy. Now I want to paint the walls with my brain. I'd jump from the balcony but it's only three stories up, definitely not lethal. Perhaps I could OD on something and go quietly. 

Either way I need this pain to end NOW. I want to die. Please someone end it so I don't have to
