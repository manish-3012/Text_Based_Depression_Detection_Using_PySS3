....Anyone else feel like whenever someone raises their voice, cant help but start crying and backing away from the individual who raised their voice? Like its only little arguments between husband and I.... raisng voice and speaking in the manner is how to get point across straightforwardly.

He hates that my reaction is always crying, backing away, retreating to the bedroom or corner of the closet. He hates that I get a sense of fear when this happens. Sometimes I end up hyperventilating a bit and he tells me to do the breathing exercise  to calm down.
