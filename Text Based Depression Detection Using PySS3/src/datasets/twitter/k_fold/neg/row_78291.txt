Literally crying for helpIâ€™m usually the type of person that keeps everything bottled up (I know you not suppose to, but I canâ€™t help it) but as of lately I been having many crying fits (only when Iâ€™m alone) I have tried to talk to my parents (it kinda helped, but they donâ€™t understand) I throw hints in my speech that Iâ€™m not happy I havenâ€™t been in a while I have a lot Iâ€™m grateful for and happy to have, but overall Iâ€™m not happy I feel like im going through a midlife crisis at the age of 25 I donâ€™t have any kids I donâ€™t have any significant others itâ€™s just me by my lonesome i hate I put myself in this position to be this alone I donâ€™t vent to anybody and the main person I did vent to was my niece weâ€™re like best friend and life screw me over (itâ€™s a sad subject to talk about) I use to able to find happiness in my writing (I wrote poems and stories) but now I havenâ€™t been motivated to do that simple pleasurable things I once enjoy are now just a distant memory I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m putting this out there to a bunch of people I donâ€™t know but I need help Iâ€™m literally crying out for help and Iâ€™m willing to take any advice from somebody because I canâ€™t take this anymore alone Iâ€™m tired of dealing with this ache I have; I have nights where itâ€™s hard to sleep more than often and when I do I end up waking up at the middle of the night and mostly cry I want to pray but Iâ€™m at this point in my life I feel like Iâ€™m being ignored by God Iâ€™m just on his waiting list to be answered and Iâ€™m just tired so please help me and thank you for listening and Iâ€™m sorry for this long rant.
