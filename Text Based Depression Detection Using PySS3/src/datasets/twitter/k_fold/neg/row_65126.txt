i want to end my life??? idki dont even know why am talking about it on here? its pointless anyways. everything is pointless. my life sucks and i hate hearing people say talk to your problems with me because it wont help. talking wont help. i cant find a job and i have been trying for so long. my eating disorder is acting up like crazy. my body is ugly and i cant even sleep at night. nothing gets better. it gets worse. 
literally everything is making me cry. i am emotionally unstable if i can say it like that. i yell at everyone but i dont wanna yell. it just happens. 
i decided that i will give up on life and just enjoy some little things a bit and then end it because iâ€˜m done trying to be happy because there is nothing to be happy about. should i be happy about me being unemployed?? should i be happy about me being underweight??? should i be happy about me not talking to half of her family anymore? should i be happy about me having no friends anymore??? 

i hate this world so much and now bc of the pandemic my mental health got so much worse because iâ€˜m so paranoid i cant even go outside and this situation scares me. 

i dont even want to try anymore iâ€˜m so tired iâ€˜m so exhausted iâ€˜m so so so done with everything iâ€˜m so done. whenever i get mails i get so anxious because iâ€˜m so scared of getting job rejections. 
checking my mails makes me so anxious i cant do this anymore. 

i just talked to my dad on the phone and it made me feel like shit because iâ€˜m so close with him and my grandparents and i feel like a disappointment and i feel like i didnt achieve anything in life. i already know that i will never find a job that i will forever stay like this. 
i hate it so much. i hate my life. i cant even cry anymore because i cried so much now i just feel numb
