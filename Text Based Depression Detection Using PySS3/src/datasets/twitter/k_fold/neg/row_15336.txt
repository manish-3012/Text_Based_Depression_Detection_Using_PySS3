I can't make a decision and I think the exit way should be the best choice.Ok, so I am a 18 years old who doesn't want to continue his high school. Now, I am not someone who just plays games 24/7 or procrastinate all day long, I have a business and I want to open another one, I want to be successful more and more and I feel that high school  is keeping me from improvement. My parents started to be really sad, I said that I will move out out of anger and now I regret it. I love my family so much and it's just hurts me that they don't understand that I want to do something really big. They just tell me that I will become homeless and my grand parents the same, this isn't a problem for me because I know people will not always understand you, but since it comes from family makes me wanting just to end my life to be at peace in the end.
