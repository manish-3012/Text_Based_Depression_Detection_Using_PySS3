My situation is growing too familiar to the storiesEvery time I have those *you know what* thoughts and think about how my friends and family would react to my death, I keep getting reminded of those suicide stories where "no one saw it coming" and they say things like "he always seemed happy", "he made everyone laugh" or "he was the quiet one". 

Every time I have these thoughts, I struggle to think of anyone in my life I can talk to (other than-or before-a therapist) that either care enough to listen or won't freak out about it. Which I guess is kind of what frustrates me, that it seems like everyone would be shocked by my decision, despite never caring enough to talk to me or notice the signs. 

This is my first time on this subreddit so I don't know if I should be posting this. Apart from random Google searches and the pages of notes I have written expressing my feelings in greater depth, I feel like this is the last place I can turn to.

If you have read this far, thank you for taking the time out of your day to read my thoughts.
