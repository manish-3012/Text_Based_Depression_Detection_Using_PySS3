Itâ€™s in my handsI canâ€™t wait for it to happen. Iâ€™m going to make it happen. I promised myself, if i Was going to die, itâ€™s going to be high as shit. I can no longer sleep, i get anxiety trying to sleep, or in the middle of the night i just wake up with my chest hurting, feeling uncomfortable in my bed. I canâ€™t get a full night of rest. I canâ€™t be around people without getting a panic attack, I canâ€™t make eye contact because iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m constantly getting high to forget what i feel, to try and get rid of anxiety. but i donâ€™t want to be like this anymore. I donâ€™t want be here anymore. i feel uncomfortable in my own room. In my own bed. Around my own family. I just donâ€™t want to be here, Iâ€™m going to OD. My birthday is coming up, i feel like, thatâ€™s the day. Thanksgiving is the day. Thank you
