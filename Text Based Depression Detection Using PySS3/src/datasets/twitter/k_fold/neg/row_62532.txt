I have nothing90% of my family despises me, I have no friends, I do nothing but drink all day and do drugs, I live in the middle of nowhere, I have no education and no future and I am flat broke all at 18 years old. The only thing I have in my life is a steadily growing youtube channel and I'm developing a promising video game with a team, other then that I have nothing and everyday I wish I had a shotgun to blow my brains out. I am so stressed 24/7 that I wish I was dead every single morning when I wake up. I'm also cripplingly addicted to drugs and alcohol and it's the only escape I have in my life and when I don't have it I wish I could jump off of a tall place to kill myself.
