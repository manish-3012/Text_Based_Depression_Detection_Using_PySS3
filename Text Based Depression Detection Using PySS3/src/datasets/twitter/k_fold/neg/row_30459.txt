dont even know why im posting thisI am basically posting this because I feel I need to at least put my thoughts out somewhere into the ether as it were

I feel absolutely crushed by an overwhelimg weight. Everything seems so hopeless and out of reach. The best feeling I get during the day is hopping into my bed and pulling the covers up because I know for a brief amount of time my stress and worries and fear and anxiety will disappear when I sleep.

It's not about choosing not to live or be healthy and normal and happy, it's the feeling that I simply can't. It's impossible.

I dont know where to go or who to talk to, no one in my life understands, as cliche as that sounds. I just can't relate to anybody, I don't "sync up" with anyone in my life, or society in general.  I am utterly alone.  I am sick of having to justify my existence to other people. It's completely taxing and draining.  Every part of my day and time seems to feel as though I have to provide a reason for being around.  Sometimes I just want to leave everyone I know and maybe move to another country. The more people that know me the more people are aware of my pathetic existence.  I can't let people know me or know who I am because it's just increases the overall volume of disappointment  directed towards me.

I really wish I could be happy, or content. But it seems impossible. 

I don't know if I will kill myself, it wont be today... which is a good thing I guess, but I have to confess that it seems to be an increasingly tempting idea. Maybe I am just trying to build myself up to it. I don't know.

I wish all the best for those out there that maybe are sort of in my boat as well. I just don't see a way out for me
