What is wrong with me?I have been lost for years
For some reason ever since i was little i wanted to be a girl. I grew up playing bratz dolls and dress up until i was 16 then my dad told me to stop being a "fag" and always tried to get me to do "guy" things that i have no interest in. I just want to go shopping and drink a venti with the girls. I could go on and on about more examples. Idk why i feel this way. I was going to try and start hrt but im too scared. I dont understand. I wanted it so bad and the opportunity presented itself but i scared away. I dont know how i would even explain it to my family. I cant even explain it to myself. Due to this i have had years of suicidal thoughts and alienate myself from everyone around me. I tried to make it obvious sometimes just to talk but nobody seems to notice and bitch about their feelings and never ask how i feel. Nobody cares about me. I dont even care about myself but im too scared to commit suicide either. I dont think i will ever be able to actually transition. Even if i transitioned would that fix all my problems and suicidal thoughts. I dont know. Im sure id be happier but i dont want to regret it. I hate myself and the way i look and i dont know why. But when i crossdress i feel great and so pretty and on top of the world. I feel like im trapped in my current situation. Im only 20 and dont want to regret not doing it while im this age but im still confused on if their is a deeper source of pain giving me these thoughts and i dont actually want to become a female but instead i want to just to mend mental issues. I dont know why my brain is like this. I dont even feel like going on anymore. This seems to be a never ending fight and the prize is an unachievable happiness. I have never felt true happiness and i dont understand why im full of so much pain.
