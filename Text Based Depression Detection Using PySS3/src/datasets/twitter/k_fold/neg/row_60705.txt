Iâ€™m here for you. Please.I know your brain is going to say things like â€œoh sheâ€™s just saying that to be politeâ€ and â€œoh she doesnâ€™t have time for me because sheâ€™s too busy with everyone elseâ€. You know how I know this? Because Iâ€™ve been where you are. Maybe not in the exact same situation, but Iâ€™ve been days away from killing myself. It makes me so upset that people cry out for help on here and no one answers. Iâ€™m always here for ANYONE if you need some one to talk to. I can give advice, tips and you can rant to me. I can also just have a different conversation. I can (hopefully) make you laugh. I can just talk about your interests and your beautiful, unique views on the world. Whatever you want. The things your brain is saying that is discouraging you from talking to me, is not rational, true or welcomed by me. I will help you fight your demons. I am in YOUR corner. Always.
