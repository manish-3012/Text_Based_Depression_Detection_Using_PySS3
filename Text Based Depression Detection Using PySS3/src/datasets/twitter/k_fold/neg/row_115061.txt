I want to kill myself right nowI'm 23 years old, suffered from depression about 10 years now. 

I've had severe anxiety about everything and everyone for about 5 years now. I can't even go in my own backyard without fear of someone seeing me. I can't hold down a job, I focus too much on my mistakes and I can't see ways to fix them so I quit the jobs/get fired because I can't do them or even show up for them.

I'm a pathological liar, I lie about everything because it's easier than telling the truth. I don't feel guilt or anything in the moment when I lie, just the fear and anxiety that causes the lie in the first place.

I've tried to kill myself when I was 18. I was put into inpatient twice (last one was voluntary) I've been to therapy twice. I can't do anything right and everything has gotten worse and worse these past few years. I ***want*** to get better but how can I? I just keep failing again and again and repeating my same old mistakes. I can't run from my problems because my problem is **myself!**

I don't know what to do. Should I check myself back to inpatient? Go back to therapy? I can't even really afford either of those. I'm still $2000+ in debt from the last time I checked myself into the hospital to get to inpatient. And therapy around here is so expensive too, even the cheapest options. I really want to kill myself right now. Please help me, I need advice.

I'm so tired.
