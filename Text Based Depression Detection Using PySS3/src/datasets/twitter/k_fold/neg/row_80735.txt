Kind of losing meaning and feeling like I'm going down a slippery slope. Please help.As the days go by, I'm kind of losing sight of the future. I used to have all these reasons for wanting to keep going, but they're kind of gone now.

At this point I'm just thinking about the point of going besides keeping my family and friends from being upset. I used to want to be a lawyer, now I'm just trudging along through law school and I honestly couldn't care less about the outcome.

I can't seem to find any companionship either. I thought maybe if I find someone I love, I'll have a reason to keep going, but I suck at that too. I get told that I'm handsome, but I constantly get rejected. 0 for 20 now, maybe it's because it's obvious to people about how fucked up I feel.

I used to just get lost in video games, but now I just stare past the screen and can't find a reason to have my only hobby left. I know it sounds stupid, but it just felt like the only thing I had to look forward to in the day. It was my last hobby. 


Can someone PLEASE help me try to find some way to find a purpose again? I doubt I'll stop being depressed, but I feel like if I don't find a reason to keep going again then I just won't be able to.

Thanks guys, and if anyone is struggling out there please PM me. I'd love to be able to try and help someone out.
