i donâ€™t really think i have a reason to live anymoreno one talks to me, no one really shows they care about me.. so whatâ€™s the point in continuing? ever since i cut them off, itâ€™s been kinda sucky. but i know that if i try and talk to them again, itâ€™d just hurt me a lot and make me wanna kms even more. i donâ€™t want to die, but iâ€™d like to. iâ€™m probably never gonna have anyone ever again who shows me affection, so why even try anymore. notice how i have a calm approach to all of this. why? because iâ€™ve accepted it, or iâ€™m going through the process of accepting it. iâ€™m probably never gonna be loved ever again, which sucks, but when youâ€™re a fat and ugly waste of space like me, you kinda get used to it. so i donâ€™t really know what to do anymore. no oneâ€™s probably gonna read this and frankly, i donâ€™t care. just had to get it off my mind, thatâ€™s all
