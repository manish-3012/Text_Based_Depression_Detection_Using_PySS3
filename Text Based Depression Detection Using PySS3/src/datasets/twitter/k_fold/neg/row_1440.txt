I feel readyIâ€™m so lost right now. Today I had to walk away from the people I thought cared about me. They broke a promise that was very important to me. I just canâ€™t deal with people lying and cheating me anymore. If I had a gun I know Iâ€™d blow my brains out. Or Iâ€™d shoot myself in the heart.

The unselfish thing to do would be to take and aspirin and hang myself. That way my organs could be salvaged, and maybe I could save someone.

Iâ€™m alone. Iâ€™m alone again; and Iâ€™m sick and tired of being alone. Depression is dominating my mind and body. Iâ€™m lucky I didnâ€™t get into a car crash today. I canâ€™t move my body in a normal fashion. I can barley talk.

It needs to stop. The pain is so overwhelming. I feel so worn down and old. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting this here. What good will it even do?
