'Enter captivating title here'I finally wrote my suicide note. 

It has everything i've always wanted to say, everything I've felt for the last 10+ years, just everything. It is long. It can be a novella for fucks sake, but I wrote it. and I have every intention of mailing it out the morning I've decided I've reached my end. 


I have people I love. I have people who I should "live" for. I know I have people who love me, and yet I still feel this way. 

I hate feeling like this. I'm so overwhelmed with stress. I'm so fucking angry at myself, and worried about money. It's always all about money right? 

I know he looks at me and sees a disappointment. Thats what I see when I look at myself. A fuck up. A fat bitch who can't get motivated worth shit. 

I just don't care to try anymore. For years I've felt this way. I should have died the first time I attempted. I should not be here. I should have and would have if someone hadn't fucked meddled. 

so here I am again on the cusp, thinking of the many options I have. Do i want it to be painless? Fuck no because I deserve to feel pain.

I just need to shut down everything, shut down the emotions, shut down and pull the plug.
