killing myself is the most practical thing to do in my situationI want to kill myself on or before my birthday this month. I wanted to when I was 17 but said iâ€™d wait til I was 20 in case things got better. but they got worse. I now am going to be homeless and Iâ€™m disabled so I canâ€™t work to get myself out of this situation. people like me, without friends and family, and disabled, always end up in the shittiest situations. weâ€™re homeless, forced to sell ourselves or do other things for money, weâ€™re raped, beaten, robbed, look down upon, etc. and I just donâ€™t know if i want to deal with all this when i can just kill myself and avoid the stress and shitty life iâ€™d end up living. Iâ€™m homebound, which means I never am able to leave the house. and so iâ€™ll just be like sleeping in my car all the time and that scares me. I donâ€™t even have blinds for my windows but I plan to try to use towels. itâ€™s hot af out, which makes all my symptoms worse, like iâ€™ll be miserable and literally nothing. like Iâ€™m already nothing and a huge waste of life. I hate that Iâ€™m about to have lived 20 fucking years when itâ€™s just be such a waste like somebody else should have had 20 years added to their life instead of me being boring. idk Iâ€™m just rambling but I think Iâ€™m really going to kill myself because I almost did the other night. like itâ€™s just so easy to kill yourself and thinking about that is the only thing that gives me peace right now
