Nobody cares...Got to see / talk to my mom for the first time in about a month... tried to reach out and talk about how Iâ€™m doing and got told how even though she knows her moms not healthy an abusive me haveing being sent there multiple times in my life to live for a total of 5 years now is not really something to be upset about and how my experience of her abandoning me was inaccurate / not reality...really I all wanted to hear is that she cares ...
