I am so burned out that I want it to all end. bunI am burned out with work to the point of where even a different job doesn't seem like an escape.  I'm burned out in my relationship with my boyfriend. I am burned out of caring about anyone and anything. I am burned out in just living, just trying to breathe is too hard. Just getting out of the fucking bed is a struggle nowadays. I just want, need it all to stop. 

Any plan that I have ever had always turns out to be terrible when I research it. And I know it would hurt my family in the long run anyway. I just feel like such an empty shell of a person. I don't even know who I am anymore. Nothing is enjoyable. I don't feel emotion much anymore, just sad and irritated. I don't know what to do.
