Why do I always feel this waySo I'm definatly not on here for attention and I guess its more that i just need help or someone to talk to but man have I been having a tough time lately and it just seems like ill look back and just everything in my life seems like a big failure i go back to my youngest memories as a kid and even then i am like wow you were always at the bottom in life, I dont look bad either and im very outgoing and sociable too, some would even consider me to be the life of the party but man if these people spent a minute in my head theyd be in for a real shocker. I dont know what's wrong with me but i cant stop blaming myself hating myself and everything negative that goes with it and it seems like i don't have the willpower either to get ahead because i constantly feel like shit or when it starts getting good then boom something bad happens so its like this constant feeling of failure and it just makes me want to give up ðŸ˜” i don't actually want to commit suicide i just want to feel better and stop telling myself that I'm better to the world dead
