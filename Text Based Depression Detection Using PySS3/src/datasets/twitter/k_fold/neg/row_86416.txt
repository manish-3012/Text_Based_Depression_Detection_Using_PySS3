suicide note etiquette?i couldnt find any advice like this with a google search (gave me a helpline number) so i made a reddit account- i hope this is the right subreddit. keeping it brief, im very depressed and dont have the energy or will to keep going on anymore; i dont want to keep dragging down the few people i hold dear, but ive been advised that saying nothing is going to hurt them more than leaving some last thoughts

&amp;#x200B;

are there any particular yes-es for writing a suicide note, or a checklist of sorts? and how long should it be?
