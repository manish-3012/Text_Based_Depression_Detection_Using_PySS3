sometimessometimes i just feel that my feelings are invalid. that my whole life is just some teenager drama that rolls in my head. it doesnt matter if professionals said it was real. it doesnt matter if i need to take high doses from medications. it's just feel so numb and empty. people say that i cant think about death bcs i'm young and the only thing i wanted to say to them is: yeah, i know. neither i wanna feel like the shit i'm feeling rn.

sometimes i just wanna die. i dont think this would awnser my questions. i dont think this would make anything better for the people who, once, loved me. but i'm just too fucking tired for this.

i failed today. i dont even had the courage to hurt myself. but i dont think i will pass this month. :(
