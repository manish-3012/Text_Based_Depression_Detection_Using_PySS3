I think this is itIdk how much detail I'm gonna go through on this post, I never thought I'd be here
For the past few months my life has gone to shit. I've lost all my friends, the only friend I have left I have a hopeless crush on and I won't sy anything because I'm too scared to lost my last friend. My family hate me because I do drugs and a lot of lsd recently has made me realise how fucked I am
I don't understand my own, or others, emotions and it really plays with me and everything is way too much and I can't take it anymore
I'm going to kill myself tonight, I doubt my friend will see this but if they do I love you
