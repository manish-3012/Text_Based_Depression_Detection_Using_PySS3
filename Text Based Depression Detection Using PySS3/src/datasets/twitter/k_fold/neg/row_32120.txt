Wish I was dead. feel guilty for even that, because "other people have it worse." But I don't care. I don't want to be alive.Wishing it will all be over soon. Thought i was having heart attack or something a couple days ago when I suddenly lost most feeling in my left arm and leg. 

I was happy at the thought, and just laid back down to see if it would happen. no luck

i't s okay though, suicide will fix it all.
