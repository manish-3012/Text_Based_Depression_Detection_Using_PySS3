Have any of you guys had success with Anti-Depressants or Therapy?I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, I used to get bullied relentlessly through high school and my father was a heavy drinker who left when I was around 12 and acts like I don't exist. I'm not saying these are the reasons I'm depressed but they definitely linger in my brain all the time. I'm 27 now and recently these thoughts have been getting over overwhelming. I have everything that's supposed to bring you joy, a girlfriend, a dog, a house, decent job and a car but I'm still miserable. I'm miserable to the point where I fantasize about killing myself multiple times a day and I think it's time I got some serious help. Do anti depressants actually work? I've heard they just make you "numb" which wouldn't help as I hardly feel anything as it is. Any advice on finding a decent therapist? did therapy help any of you? Thanks guys.
