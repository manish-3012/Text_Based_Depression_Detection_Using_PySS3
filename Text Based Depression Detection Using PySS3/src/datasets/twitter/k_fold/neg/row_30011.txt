Too scared to ex myself, still wanna ex myself.How do you put any effort into anything when you hope you're a solid drunken binge of extra 'kill yourself brain chemicals and thoughts' away from offing yourself? Nothing inherently wrong with my life I've got friends who care mostly and a puppy and a job I hate but doesn't everyone? I just don't want to be around in a reality where people are so replaceable or forgettable. I understand time makes things better across the board(unless you've got incurable cancer) but I rankle against that. It's not fair to be a sentient being that is self aware of the futility of everything and everyone and still tries. Especially since I can't be the only person I know self aware enough to feel how I do which means other people lie to themselves to feel better. Or they let the time fix them. Fuck that. That's fucked, the staple of people being so replaceable fucking wows me. I'm uninterested in it. Kill ya boy.
