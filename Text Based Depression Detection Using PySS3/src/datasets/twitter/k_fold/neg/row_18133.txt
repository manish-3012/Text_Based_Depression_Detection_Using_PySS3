It's rainingI've thought about it and I don't want to wait to get pills. I can just hang myself easily. I want to do it outside somewhere, but it's dark and raining.

I can't die in my house and traumatize anyone. I figured I would go somewhere quiet and phone the police right before so my body isn't just hanging around. 

I don't want to die but I can't live like this. I don't want to die at all. I can't take the pain and I'm losing my mind. I have been barely hanging on for weeks. 

I'm ready for it all to be over, now.
