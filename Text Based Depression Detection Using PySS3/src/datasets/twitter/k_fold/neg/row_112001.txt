social anxietyI've always been really hard on myself. I end up hurting the people closest to me emotionally and mentally. I attempt to change how I act and what I say but it becomes a viscous cycle and repeats itself. I sought help from a Psychiatrist but only lasted a month with her due to language barriers and my thoughts that she wasn't really listening to me and was willing to help me. I get really anxious and depressed when I'm around other people; sometimes I feel like I wish I was them instead of me. I'm not sure what else to say here but I'm hoping some of you have feedback. I could use some help.
