I'm really depressed. I want to commit suicide: I've wanted to for years now.At this point, I'm at the lowest point I've been in years. I'm missing college, making frequent visits to the doctor, and only now I've been considered being prescribed anti-depressants. I feel like I'm losing control of my life and my emotions.

My anxiety is getting worse and worse. I'm afraid to do anything social and just being in any situation remotely related to a social situation, it's enough for me to mentally shut down out of fear.

I genuinely believe that my life won't improve, no matter how much therapy and medication I get. I'll still despise myself and all of my flaws. I'll still hate the way that I think and it'll still be driving me insane for the rest of my life. So I don't want to do anything to improve it: I think it's pointless. I just want my life to end and the pain to stop.

There are still things worth living for, but not in this much pain. It's not worth being alive for 3% highs when lows make up the other 97%. Not when they're this bad. I still want to:

&gt; Go to Miku Expo 2020 in January
&gt; Play Project Diva: Megamix in February
&gt; Play Animal Crossing: New Horizons in March

...but I don't think I'll make it. I'm starting to care less about them, and I'm questioning their worth.
