Can't do it anymoreI'm doomed to minimum wage warehouse jobs thanks to my fucking dad, I had hopes for a better life than that when I was younger but obviously I'm not allowed that, I want to make electronic music and make people happy but I'm so fucking dumb that after 2 years I can barely put together a basic drum beat,  I've now promised myself I'm not making it until Christmas and for the first time in my life I think I mean it,  I'm not even sad on anything I may miss out on.
