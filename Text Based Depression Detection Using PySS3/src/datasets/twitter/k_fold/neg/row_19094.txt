I just realized something, I've never thought of it beforeThis is a throwaway, for obvious reasons.

I've kind of just... lost my fighting spirit.

I'm so worn out that the thought of even reaching my dream future disgusts and repulses me because I truly do not want to deal with negativity anymore. Life is gonna have it's downs and I don't mind dying and leaving the future behind and all the good things i've experienced because I'm so tired of fighting.

My bad if this is triggering, I wanted to see if there were others like me
