I'm a freakAm I the only one who feels like a freak? I'm so messed up in my head. I'm scared of letting people in because I see my past of pain and hurt, and tell myself it isnt worth the risk. Still, someone manages to break my walls and I bomb them with all my feelings and problems. I start to feel like such a bother for all the emotional support. I count the days until they realize how toxic I am and they tire of my neediness. I cut and cut when I'm crying and full of anxiety, in those moments nothing else makes sense. Somehow this blade marking my skin will make things better.. but it doesn't. Then once I've dried out all my tears I feel shame.

I hate how insecure I am about everything except dying. Only then would all this madness and buzzing in my head be silenced. Only then would I be able to rest and stop feeling so drained. Only then would everyone understand how much pain I was truly in. Sometimes I think about giving myself a black eye or breaking my arm so that someone would show me an ounce of concern, and ask me if I'm okay.

I'm such a freak. I lay awake at night wondering what to do with my life. I fantasize what it would be like to be normal, to be happy. Life hasn't been fair and has left me as a broken child trying to be an adult. I'm such a freak. 

I'm sorry for this rant. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know where I'm heading. The only future I see for me now is one where I'm at the bottom of a river, resting for the first time in my life.
