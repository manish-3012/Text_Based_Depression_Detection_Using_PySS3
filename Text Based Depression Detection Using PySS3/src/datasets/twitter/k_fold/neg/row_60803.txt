I just want a way out of this suffering, is that too much to ask?I've been wanting to die for years now and people say "just wait for it, it'll get better you'll see" but it keeps getting worse and worse. I used to be able to mask my anxiety but now it's so bad I can't pretend anymore. And bad things keep happening to me out of my control and the good things don't come. I feel like I'm god's worst joke. I just want to die peacefully... I'm just tired of everything... but there's no easy way out, and no easy way to stay in. What a cruel fucking world. I don't know what to do anymore.
