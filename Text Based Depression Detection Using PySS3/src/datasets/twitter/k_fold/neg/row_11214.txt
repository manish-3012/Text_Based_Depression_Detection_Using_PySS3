Constant Suicidal ThoughtsI've been battling with suicidal thoughts for most of my adult life, and about eight months ago had a particularly bad break-up. Since then thoughts have become a lot more intense, and began desperately reaching out and started two different types of therapy.

Unfortunately I've found all this little help in the long run and although I can be vaguely happy in myself at times (very vaguely, the self-loathing has arrived at an all time high) I find it impossible to imagine carrying on for another year. I've tried overdoses and self-harm before, which has only caused more alienation and misery at failed attempts. This time I've found what seems to be a better option, and have started ordering the equipment required to carry it out.

After reaching out for so long and not feeling any better I've started shutting down on friends and family, and blocked a lot of people to save them from any burden, and continuing to lean on them without any progress.

Happy new year I guess.
