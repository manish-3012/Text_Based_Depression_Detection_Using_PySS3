I really want to end it all as soon as possible.I've been struggling with depression for about 9 years now. I've been through some really rough times; I've lost my best friend to suicide, I've had friends tell me they no longer want anything to do with me without any reason being given, I've failed out of college, and more that I don't have the space to mention.

Today takes the cake.

I was driving home from getting my family breakfast, and my car wouldn't shift into second gear. Transmission problem, obviously. I'm taking it to get a price on fixing it tomorrow, but I'm estimating minimum $1k USD. This is after spending over $2.5k on my car in the last month.

That's every penny I've spent working, plus a maxed out credit card.

And to add insult to injury, one of the last friends I have, spent the afternoon hanging out with my older brother (I was not invited), and even came to my house and caught up with the rest of my family. I was not informed until after they left.

I'm realizing now that I don't have any friends who will talk to me unless A, they need something, or B, I message them first, and they will always be too busy to hang out and will never reschedule.

So now I'm about $2,000 in debt from fixing my car so I can go to work, and I am realizing I have no real friends that actually want to spend time with me.

I just don't see a reason to continue living.

I don't think there's anyone left in the world who really cares about me.

I know this is generally frowned upon on Reddit, but I've tried turning to God and I've begged Him night after night to help me turn my life around for the better, and to lead me in the right direction. I've started going to church every Wednesday and Sunday. It just feels like He's telling me no. Like His plan for me is over, but for some reason I'm still here.

I don't know anymore. If anyone has any advice, please let me know. I don't know what to do.
