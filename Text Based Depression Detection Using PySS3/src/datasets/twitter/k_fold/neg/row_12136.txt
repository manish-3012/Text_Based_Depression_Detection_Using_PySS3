Being human is too much for meIn all honesty, I've probably been getting along fine in my 20 years of life so far, but I feel like any day now, it's all gonna come crashing down, and I'll be too scared to figure out how to fix it. And I don't wanna be around when it happens.

I've always let anxiety rule my life. Always. And I can't see a single good thing in myself that would make people like me. I take away so much more from the world then I'll ever be able to give to it. Every little thing I have to do, and should have done already, I make into an impossible-to-begin gauntlet. Confirming college courses that will start soon, going to work, asking others to talk about how I feel, I never gather up the strength to do anything because I know I'll fail like I always do.

I don't think I'll kill myself soon, but the feeling is always there. I've had all different kinds of treatment which never does anything. Sometimes I get scared away from the notion when I'm reminded about suicides effects on others, sometimes I just get distracted and forget it for a while, but that never lasts.

I could die, and make the world a better place. Nobody would realize it, but it's true. It's the only way to overcome what I am. I cannot hope to survive in this fucked up world, and I really am lost. I have no idea what my life can become, and I feel like a defective human being. People may like me, but they really shouldn't. I don't belong here.
