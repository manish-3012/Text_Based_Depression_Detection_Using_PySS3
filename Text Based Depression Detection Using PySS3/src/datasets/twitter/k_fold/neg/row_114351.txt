How do you get it off your mind?i'll try to keep things succinct. i have had depression all my life but i have always dealt. suicidal thoughts from time to time but never any actual attempts, just thoughts and vague plans. lately i have been really struggling so i went to a doctor and got referred to a psychologist/psychiatrist and put on a low dose of welbuterol which i have only been taking for 3 days. i can't seem to get the thought of killing myself off my mind. it's an invasive thought that keeps me from doing anything that would help me get out of this. it didn't get worse with the medication and i'm not sure i have been taking it long enough for it to really have much of an effect. 

i want to make it perfectly clear, i am not going to kill myself. no matter how bad it gets i'll get through. i always do and i know that ending things is never the answer. but i still need advice on how to make things easier as i keep moving forward.
