Obsessive RegretI worked at a very noisy job. I came home one day and my ear was muffled with extreme ringing. I naively filed a worker comp claim mostly because I was so pissed off about what had a happened to me.

I went to worker comp doc who said not shit can be done for tinnitus.

Now that it's considered a 'work related injury,' I will never be able to use my own health insurance for it ever again.
I feel absolutely sick about that.
