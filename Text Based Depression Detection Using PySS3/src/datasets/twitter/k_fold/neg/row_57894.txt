I've been trying to asphyxiate myself all morning before work.But I'm too goddamn scared, every time I start to lose consciousness my body panics and I stand up straight. I can't do this. I can't work every fucking day for my entire life. I don't want to do it now or ever. I just want to fucking end it. So why can't I just end it?
