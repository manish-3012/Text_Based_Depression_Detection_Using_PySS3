you guys are the only ppl I can relate toI just can't relate to anyone else anymore. The same conversation at work, the gossip, the drama and back stabbing for no reason. Talking about the same topics over and over. I'm so tired of it, my entire life I felt loneliness. I can only relate to depressed and suicidal people now. thanks
