I really have no futureI am over 50 years old and I have absolutely nothing to show for it, except massive amounts of problems. I am not exaggerating, I never made one correct decision. Whether immediately, weeks, months or even years, the decisions I made proved to be wrong. Everything I did ended up being a complete and total waste of time, money and effort. I have no skill and no resources. I am unemployed living back home with my mom. She wants to sell the property and I have been here helping get the property fixed up. It is just basic outside work like digging, painting, raking, etc. The only way to make any money is a dead-end minimal wage job or get more education which will take years and money I do not have nor will ever have. In the near future, the only thing I have to look forward to are doctors, pills, tests, etc. Does anyone know someone who is near 60 years old who is unemployed, no skills and no money? What kind of future would such a person have or had? I have come to terms that I have no real future and by the time my mom sells this place, next spring, I will end my life. I have it all planned out and ready to go. These are just the beginning of my problems. Too many more to list here now, maybe in the future.
