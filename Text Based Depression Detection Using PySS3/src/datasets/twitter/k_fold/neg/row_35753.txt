I've messed up. I won't be able to graduate. I've ruined my life and I really don't know what to do.I've really fucked up. I have. This is my last semester. All I had to do was pass all my classes. That was it. Then I would have my degree and I had a job lined up perfectly. I was all set for life.

Then my depression kicked me hard. Really hard. I couldn't get up and go to class. Homework became an exercise in futility. I just couldn't keep up, it's so overwelming. And of course I lie about it to my parents, telling them that "oh it looks a little close going into finals, but I should be fine. Yeah, I'm doing okay" Total bullshit. And now graduation is in two weeks with finals week approaching fast. Maybe I don't deserve it. I'm just that shitty. Maybe I don't deserve anything. Friends, family, happyness.

I've tried getting help. I've been going to therapy and taking meds for like two years. Everything I try just makes me feel worse and worse. I don't even know why I keep trying to improve when I know it won't help.

I'm done. Just done. With school. With life. I don't know that the hell I want to do. I just want to curl up in a ball and cry until I die. I don't see any possible chance of me fixing this. I've dissapointed myself and everyone I love. I'm too much of a whimp to kill myself, but I sure as hell don't want to be alive. If killing yourself wasn't such a hassle or would hurt other people, I'd do it in a heartbeat.

I just don't know what to do or where to do. I want to run away from it all. Run far away, where no one can find me. Just be alone with my sad, sorry, pathetic self.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. Just to vent, I don't know. Maybe someone will get something out of my useless bitching.
