The EndI don't want to make this dramatic - I've posted once before and thought I was getting better. Unfortunately I believe I was lying to myself more than anything else. 


Life seems to refuse to get better for me despite my best efforts. I dated a girl for 4 months I thought I liked, but she used me for money. I starved practically to "help" her out and when she got all she needed out of me she cheated on me and then dumped me, on my 30th birthday, via the cell phone I paid for so she would have a contact number while applying for work. Unlimited text and calling I shit you not. 

I met another girl later on and she used me for emotional comfort and when she was done told me she just wanted to be friends for now. 

The point is I am being used and have a long, life-long history of it. I am a survivor of what I only willing to describe as slavery in another nation before I came here. My adopted parents here (I am an orphan with no knowledge of my extended family) used me to get kickbacks from the government - I was dressed horribly while my 2 brothers had every piece of shit trendy ass clothing you could think of. I don't care about the clothes but I do care about being cared for. 

In my life I seem to literally be a tool. I am tired, sad, depressed, and don't want to go on anymore. Not like this. I still can't seem to make friends. The ones I do have don't listen or understand how I am in so much pain over all this. I have never, ever experienced real happiness and have a large ugly emotional scar on me for being used so horribly during the course of my life - from people who I thought were friends in school (until they didn't need me) to my so-called family, to women, to my boss who despite my severe ass busting won't promote me and likely someone else, to people who only act as though they like me until someone else shows up. 

**TL;DR** I have been alone my whole life - I see no other choice or alternative to end the pain.
