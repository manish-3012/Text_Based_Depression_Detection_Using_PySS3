Goodbye.It is always my fault. I will never be good enough, I just know I won't. And it will never get better. Why everytime it starts to become better, things always have to turn upside down?

My mom acts like she hates me. She hates me for my dad. She won't even talk to me. I can tell that I am an utter disappointment to her and I will always be.

The only person who loves me is not at home with me. He's at work. I don't want to scare him with my messages. I already put him through enough pain. I am so sorry.  These last days we both experienced was the most beautiful of my life. Thank you for everything. 

I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I don't want it.
