Life scares me. I can't stop thinking about it - I don't know how anyone can or why they'd want to want toHomelessness is just a mistake or accident or illness away for most people. Almost every week it's a battle with a dead-end front line member of staff trying to assert a miserable fucking right of mine. Just around the corner is a disease I'll have to fight to get diagnosed and the treated, just the battle with another system full of people in itself hell for my autism but my low pain tolerance too and the compounded effective lack of compassion the NHS now shows for people in pain. I don't want to wait until I'm actually in pain and stuck, who the hell is prepared to put up with that? I deserve the right to treatment but I also deserve the right to die if the pain of living in our systems is just too much
