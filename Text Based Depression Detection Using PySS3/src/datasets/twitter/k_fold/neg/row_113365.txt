My mother needed me and I just went to bed.My brain feels like scrambled eggs. I haven't had thoughts this strong since I was a teenager. I really fucked up this time. My mom needed me and I just slept. 

I really fucked up this time. 
Am I really suicidal if I'm too scared to do it? Or is it an overwhelming, crippling feeling of angst? 

It's been days since this particular situation, I still feel like shit but not nearly as bad as last night.  I've been avoiding my mom and just now she said something so lovingly to me. Now I'm crying again. I know I'm a disappointment to her and she still loves me. I don't deserve her.
