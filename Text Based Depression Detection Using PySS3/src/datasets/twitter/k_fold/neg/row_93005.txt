Keep on living for her?I've been suicidal for a long time and I've made several attempts before. I'm used to people not caring about me so when I did an attempt after I've made a new friend I didn't think she would take it so hard. I was wrong and she got really sad and scared. She visited me afterwards and hugged me while crying and tried to make me promise her that I should keep alive for her. 

I don't want to make her feel like that again but it's so  hard to keep fighting. I still want to end it all but I have a feeling of guilt for thinking about taking my life when I know how much it would hurt her. I really don't know what I should do anymore since these feelings are constantly gnawing on me. It's harder now when my psychiatrist is taking a break during the holidays so can't speak to him either about all this...
