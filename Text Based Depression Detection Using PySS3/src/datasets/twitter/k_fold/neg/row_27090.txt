Let's do this!Alright. It's about time. 

Long time lurker here.

Just wanted to write something so I won't vanish without rambling a bit. Sober but tired. I won't write stories or how much I hate everything. Just what comes to mind. 

~~~

I prepared myself and comitted the whole last year for this to happen. Managed to cut ties with every friend and even with my parents. Moved to the next bigger town, so I can be alone. I planned this for a really long time and it feels good to have one last goal. I just don't want to fuck it up. If I am going to kill my self I want to fucking nail it. I don't need any pity or rumors or any of this shit.

2015 was a really relaxed year. I almost enjoyed it. I did not have to talk to anyone. Dropped out of college, which made me feel better. (I freak out when I am surrounded by people - mentally and physically) But now I know it only worked because I set a limit. A time limit. 

I could cry every day. Or rather I wish I would be able to cry.
 Let me explain: Every day I try to force myself to stand up out of bed or to make something to eat. But all of this takes energy. And by now I am completely depleted. I don't remember when I was sad the last time. I actually can't remember.

I would have liked to talk to people, especially to two of my "friends". (I cut ties with everyone) I really wanted to have a conversation with them, (especially with two "friends") without all this bullshitting and lying. No one wants or can be honest anymore. 

Actually I understand. I am hard to deal with. I just wanted to spend some time with them and you know, do what friends are supposed to do. Talk about life and music and other stuff. But I am too quiet or "boring" for them to waste their precious time for that kind of activity with me.

I have a fuckton of problems, yeah. And I really want to apologize for wasting your time by reading this.

Have a good year. Don't waste it, I guess?
