The path I choose cannot be real. (Crappy "poem")I don't know how I can tell this better.  
Education.  
Job.  
Marriage.  
I don't want any of them.  
I want to do what I love to do.  
Restricted by rules. Crippled, even.  
Take. They won't stop taking.  
My lap makes the perfect desk.  
Beg. Ask. Plead. No answer.  
Connections are necessary.  
Draw.. I love to draw. I make fan art.  
Anxiety and pain from the past keeps me from finishing fan art  
while my personal art from emotion is not of a desirable look.  
Money.. I need money.  
The root of movement in life.  
It only comes from people.  
Alone, with no hope of connecting.  
The path I want will not be real.  
The only way out is by getting out of this "real" world
The systems I hate so much.
The material possessions I adore taken with them.  
The people who don't want me.  
My undesirable outlook.  
My dangerous sensitivity.  
Met by hard logic. No compassion.  
I don't feel love anymore. I will not give it as an imitation.  
Betrayal. Lust for danger. 
But a desire to be listened to.  
No compromise for classes I need to pass.  
That's all people can offer at this point.  
I'm being pressured to move.  
I have to choose.
