Scared of myself..I have absolutely no reasons for any of this, I live a relatively good life. I have no real complaints about life, which makes this just feel so much shittier. Sometimes I have moods where I just want to cry and scream and... well not exist. I've been this way for about 5 years now, I'm 18. I always attributed it to being an angsty hormone ridden teen, but sometimes I wasn't sure. I'd spend nights when the river flooded standing on the river bank around midnight for up to an hour just contemplating ending it. 
Lately it's been getting worse, I've tried to suffocate myself with a pillow twice now (not to kill myself because I know that won't work, just to see how far I can go... I can do it until the response is involuntary...).
One friend who knows about this has promised me that I tell her whenever something is wrong, and that's worked quite well for a while. What I'm afraid of is the fact that when I'm in these moods I don't care about anyone at all, I know that once I die it's not my problem (Naturally that is a shitty selfish thought, which just makes me feel worse. Exponential depression, woo!) and this makes me worry that if the moods keep getting worse and worse I'll reach a point where literally nothing would influence me. What would convince me not to when my thoughts aren't for anyone, even myself. I treat everything scientifically, mathematically, and that allows me to treat death in such a flippant manner. My girlfriend get's so afraid when I accidentally refer to offing myself as an inevitability rather than potential fear. 

Due to the fact that I have no reasons to feel so shit, is it likely I have a chemical imbalance? IE depression. I call it a chemical imbalance. Makes it sound much more natural.

I don't know, even if none of this makes sense or doesn't belong, it feels good writing it. Do I need help or am I a whiny baby?
