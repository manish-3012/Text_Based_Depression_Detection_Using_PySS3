Am I a lost cause ?Hi everyone,
Sorry in advance for my English.

I'm writing here today because I need to talk and here is why.
I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 4 years ago and I was in depression for around 2 years. It was awful. I wanted to die , life was disgusting and I had no interest for anything around me. I started to feel better after taking a lot of meds, seeing a psychiatrist and all that stuff.

Once everything was behind me, I started to feel better. I found a way to progress in my life. I finally got accepted at the university and everything just got better. 

Until these last 6 month, I think everything is coming back at me and no matter what. I don't sleep , I don't eat , I hate my life. To be more precise, I hate life. And now I just don't know what to do. I don't want to get down that path again but what is the point to see a doctor again if everything will just turn it to be the same again and again? What is the point to try to fit in this life and beeing happy while I just can't ? 

Some day I feel okay and some I just picture myself throwing myself off a bridge. I am lost here. I see myself as a lost cause who will be unhappy forever. In the bottom of my heart I do want to be happy but I just can't... My head just won't let me. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. Living is unbearable and dying is not an option either but I know that each day just make this option more appealing.

Sorry for the long story but I needed to talk and here it is.

Thanks
