Do people just lie to themselves?If people knew what would come next, would they truly want to live? 

Anyone that I've ever known personally has a side like mine. I hear it when I ask them an existential question that they can't answer. That 'why am I here' tone in their voice.

I hate going to Starbucks. Standing in a room full of people that are nothing like me. In the same city, same street, same room... but we couldn't be further apart.

Does everyone wish they where somewhere/someone else, or is it just me?
