Does it help visiting graveyards?I've felt strongly suicidal for the past few weeks, and now i'm feeling so weird and calm. I guess it's just my mind became too worn out.

So, i want to visit some graveyards alone: i can feel some kind of the beckoning. Of those who have passed away...

Like they are calling me to join them, and to finally find my peace.

This is super-weird and creepy. Have you experienced anything similar?

Should i go or maybe better go for just a long walk as i usually do?
