feeling suicidal at nightit's so late. whenever i try to sleep I can't distract myself from the bad thoughts, so i just stay away for hours. I am scared to wake up tomorrow so i try to make the night as long as possible. i feel like my body is not mine again. i feel uncomfortable, i wish i could just relax for a moment. why does it get so bad at night?
