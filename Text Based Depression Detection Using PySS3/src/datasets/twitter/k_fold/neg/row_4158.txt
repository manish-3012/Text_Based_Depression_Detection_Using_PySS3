My cousin killed himself 3 months ago, and it's made me think about my own suicidal tendencies.Let me begin by saying that I haven't actively tried to kill myself in years.  I used to self harm too, but I guess you can say I've replaced one vice with another (frequent self-induced vomiting).

I know that my cousin tried to kill himself about 15 years ago, wasn't successful, and was hospitalized.  I know that he suffered from depression.  And I never reached out to him.  I was so focused on my own problems that I never tried to help him through his own.  I feel immense guilt over it, but here I am thinking about my problems again.

After my cousin killed himself, a lot of old feelings I had about my father's passing (he died from brain cancer) 3 years ago resurfaced.  I can't help but mourn both my cousin (who in a way was like a big brother to me) and my father all over again.  I feel selfish for thinking about myself and how I have put people through so much crap with my self harming/vices and suicidal tendencies.

I miss them both so much.  It doesn't help that my family is keeping his suicide a secret, either.  I have to lie to people and say he had a work-related injury, which is such bullshit.  They're keeping it a secret to "protect" his grandma from the truth.  One of the harder things I've done was lie to her when she pulled me aside and asked me "what really happened to him" because the story didn't add up--she isn't stupid.

I feel so overwhelmed.  I'm going to see a doctor about my vomiting next week so hopefully I'll get on the right track to recovery for myself.  I just wish it wasn't too late for my cousin.
