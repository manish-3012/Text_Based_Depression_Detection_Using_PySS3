Everything is traumatisingToday I had to ask an acquaintance if a girl (who i met in a psych ward) who was a compulsive liar and who got into a fight with me and afterwards walked around screaming that she was going to kill me and hurt me and that I was crazy and horrible, while I had to be locked in the hallway so she wouldn't hurt me. Of course she then had the entire ward bully, exclude and manipulate me was attending a special needs school I was thinking about enrolling in. Mind you, I just asked if she was there and when she asked why, I said I thought it wouldn't be a good idea for me to interact with her. No reason given. The girl told me she'd "rather not here me talk shit about her amazing friend" and I just burst out in tears. I called my girlfriend and asked her to pick me up and she's coming. How does this even happen? Am I wrong? Is what happened my fault? I can't remember who started the fight. What if it was me? I'm shaking and terrified right now.
