Not existing is an extremely attractive idea.24m. Iâ€™m definitely too much of a pussy to actually kill myself (for all of the normal fucking reasons, not trying to hurt the people that love me etc.). Thatâ€™s why I let my actions and inactions slowly destroy my health and relationships, because self-sabotage is my default setting. It would be so much easier to do it without guilt if people disliked me. I donâ€™t have the will or desire to actually end my life, but I have let habits form that will surely lead to my own suffering and early demise. Not only is there zero motivation to change this, itâ€™s actually an ATTRACTIVE idea that I would die sooner from natural or semi-natural causes. I even find myself hoping I get cancer or some other horrid disease naturally, so I donâ€™t have to finish the job myself. It follows that this is a disincentive to see any sort of doctor or health professional, in addition to being a disincentive to any sort of self improvement at all. Iâ€™m also 99.99% sure that the afterlife is equivalent to the before-birth, so I have no fear of what will happen â€œafterâ€ death. This eternal sleep is very, very attractive but not quite so that I will turn the vast uncertainty of life into the certainty of non-existence in a single moment. Plus, if there is a God and he wants to punish me in Hell for dereliction of his â€œcreationâ€ or whatever bullshit religious people come up with to keep people from killing themselves, then fuck him for making me in the first place. I just donâ€™t care. This is my version of suicide, a prolonged downfall not only from lack of motivation to improve my life but a perceived incentive to sabotage it. And if you think this is some long-winded bullshit that says and accomplishes nothing, youâ€™re absolutely right. But if anyone discovers that theyâ€™re feeling a similar way but couldnâ€™t put it into words, I hope it helps on any small way.
