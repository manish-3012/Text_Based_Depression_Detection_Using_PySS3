The reason why I come here and basically why I live.I have already attempted suicide days ago. However, I was rescued. Now I have to feed myself through IV, can barely speak or feed myself like a normal person. My hobbies have all gone down the drain and don't exist anymore. I don't go to work anymore and I still get paid but that is because my boss is a generous man who wants me to eventually get better whenever that may be. 

After attempting suicide, I feel like I can't do it until far later. I lament my decision. 

I come here and I live to help those with lives more worth living than mine. You're not alone but I will always be so. I help you because I have no life worth living of my own.

My enjoyment is to make others feel happy.
