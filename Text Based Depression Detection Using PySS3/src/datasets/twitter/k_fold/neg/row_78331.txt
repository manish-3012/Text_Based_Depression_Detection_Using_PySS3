Fuck everythingPeople say I care too much, that I'm too selfless and I think of others too much. I can't help it. I was born and raised that way. As soon as you tell me you need help, I'm there, giving my full support. That's just how I am.

But are other people doing it? No. Whenever I talk to my closest friends, all I hear is "blahblahblah my life blahblahblah I'm sad blahblah this happened to me." Do they ask how I am? No. I tell them if I feel bad, and all I get is "hope you're okay soon." Not even once did my closest friends ask me what happened to my day, or why I felt bad. All I want is a little appreciation, a little of the attention that I give them, and I'll be all set, ready to make them happy again.

So you know what? Fuck everything. The only way they'll appreciate me and really notice me is when I fucking disappear from their lives. I'll be selfish for once. I won't be there for anyone. Screw this bullshit about the nobility of being selfless. 

Is this my suicide note? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I wanna stick around and watch as they helplessly look for their confidante and realize that he's not giving a flying fuck about them anymore. After all, you only appreciate something once it's gone. I want to feel that appreciation. I want to die knowing that I wasn't simply a punching bag or a shoulder to cry on. I wanna feel that I existed as a full human being in their hearts and minds. I wanna die with that bliss in my heart. 

Well, thanks for listening, internet. It's been fun. If you need me, I'll be in my room or in a casket 6 feet under, not giving a fuck.
