I feel so aloneFeeling like shit right now. I want to kill myself, as much as I know I can't and won't. I had to quit my antidepressant. It was giving me migraines so bad I was throwing up and nightmares so bad I was waking up drenched in sweat and broken out in hives (cholinergic uticaria). I just want something stable in my life that doesn't make me feel like a complete fucking failure. I have a boyfriend (we're poly), but he lives so far away and there's no one in my hometown I can be with. I go out to the bars because there's literally nothing else to do aside from sit at home, and everyone I talk to is either too drunk, or not into someone like me.

I just want someone to fucking be here with me and there's no one. The one other trans person I was told lived around here ghosted me before we even met face to face.

I fucking hate this and don't want to do it anymore. And I still have to drive home tonight. I don't want to drive all the way there. I'm not sure if I trust myself to make it and it's only 20 min away.
