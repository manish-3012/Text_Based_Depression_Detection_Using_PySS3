Covid-19 may have helped me somehowNot trying to be selfish or a bitch, but before quarantine I was crying myself to sleep every night, I felt like I was on the verge and couldn't continue anymore, my school is pretty demanding and the source of a lot of suicidal thoughts (because of a shit ton of stuff), so when classes stopped I felt like instead of being on top of the railing about to jump, I could get down and lean on it, idk if you get me, but yeah, I just wanted to share my thoughts with you guys, and I'd like to know how's everyone doing. Stay safe
