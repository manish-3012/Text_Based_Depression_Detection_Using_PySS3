i cant deal with life any longer but ive tried really hardive wanted to kill myself for for years but i kept holding on and i moved and changed schools and got into a relationship but im still in the same place i was where i dont matter to anyone.

i wanted to get married and have a family so badly. i dont want to miss that but im so tired. i feel like ill never be someones family or loved one. i just chase after people who actually have loved ones. i dont fit anywhere.

im scared of going to hell and im scared itll hurt. if you're religious please pray for me that God will see i was in pain and i didnt want to do this but i had to. my heart hurts too much.

i have ocd and it makes me uncomfortable to think of my body rotting for days. i have so few people that think of me that i think i could be dead here until maybe january or february. maybe quicker if someone smells the body. i want to send an email that wont deliver till tomorrow to the maintenance of the building to come by mine so hopefully someone finds my body quick but idk how ro send an email like that.

i wish someone loved me now. ive waited so long but im not the right type of person. i mess everything up im an idiot. i hate myself so much. im ugly and pathetic and i dont need to be around. i really wanted to have a familt one day. im so sad.
