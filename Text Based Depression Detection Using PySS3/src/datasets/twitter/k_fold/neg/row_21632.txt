I started typing my willI couldnt stop thinking about suicide for a year now, I have a very loving boyfriend and he is the only one keeping me alive, Lately I feel like I am just a burden to him, he could be much happier without me, he doesnt have to live aboard in a city that sucks, do his own thing instead of taking care of my mental illness 24/7. 
 

Its 6am now for me and I just finish typing my â€œwillâ€ like saying im sorry I couldnt have a long life with him but my death will be a much shorter pain for him then in long term what he has to suffer.

He knows my reddit account, hope he will see this post, I love you lolo , im very sorry i have to go. Please get happiness after my depart.
