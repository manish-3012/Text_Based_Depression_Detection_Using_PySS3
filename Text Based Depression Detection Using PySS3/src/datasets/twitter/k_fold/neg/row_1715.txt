Withdrawing hardcore, scared where this road leadsI've been making a great effort to withdraw. I keep reaching out to people to combat this, but it feels more like I'm seeking one last goodbye with everyone. It's more a compulsion at this point than a thought. This weekend will be empty and all alone. I have a few planned activities; I'm blowing them off. I'm ditching regular planned classes/activities, telling people I need alone time to avoid any hangups. 

I think this weekend will be it. Asked a friend to spend the weekend playing board games, one last board game hurrah. Board games are the only thing that distract me from my intrusive thoughts.  But he's busy. Now I'm faced with 72+ hours of being stuck in my own mind. Don't think I'll be here come Monday. Going to order my favorite food, binge watch some Simpsons, and go out peacefully with Helium while I look at pictures of my dog. Don't try to convince me, I've got plenty of real life support, I've been in hospital, I'm in outpatient, nothing quiets my thoughts, and they hurt. No human being can convince me they will go away. I'll struggle to wake up Monday, it just feels increasingly inevitable.
