I plan to kill myself early Christmas morning on her front doorstepI'm going to go there at like 2 AM, put a big bow on my chest with and her name on it. Then I'm going to sit down against her front door, and shoot myself in the head. 7 months, and I still can't get her leaving me out of my head every second of every day. I still love her. We planned to do so many things together this Christmas. Well, I'm gonna make sure she never forgets ME!
