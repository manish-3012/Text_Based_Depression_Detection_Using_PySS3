I want to die.I want to die. I'm tired. I'm stressed. I'm heartbroken. I'm lonley. I feel unwanted. Im ugly... I'm every bad thing you can think of. And I just want the pain, the suffering to end. I don't want to go to work anymore. I don't want to have to see my ex-boyfriend end up with someone else and be happy whilst I suffer from this agonizing heartache. Everything is so overwhelming and I just can't do it anymore. The only way I can think of dying is slitting my wrists vertically and letting myself slowly bleed out and lose consciousness. 

I'm tired. I know I've said it before. But I am physically, mentally, and emotionally tired. I get up every morning at 3 AM to work this tedious job. 10 hour days. 50 hours a week. I can't do it. I'm still in love with a man I cannot have nor does he want me. It makes me feel fat, and ugly. I know he talks to other women and they're prettier than me and it hurts. 

Working hurts. 

Love hurts. 

Life hurts. 

I want it all to end. *And soon, I will make it happen. *
