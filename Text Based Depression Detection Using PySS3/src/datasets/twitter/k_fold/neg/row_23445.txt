Dealing with suicide in the ArmyI feel like I'm just wasting so much time. I do nothing all day. My daily routine involves:

wake up
go to PT
go back to my room
report to my sergeant
I'm told to stay out of sight and out of mind
go back to my room 
and repeat.

I joined the army for experience, and I don't need all the other benefits so my time here has been completely wasted. On top of that, a few things happened in my personal life that I cannot control so I just feel so stuck every day, unable to do anything about it. I feel like if I stay here one more week, I'm going to finally kill myself.

I've told my sergeant and my command about it, I self referred myself to a consular and have been seeing him for the past month or so. I've reached out to close friends back home, I've reached out to my family but nothing seems to work. I've done everything that I could ever think of to help me through this but I come much closer to just accepting suicide each day. Yesterday I even bought a knife just so I had the ability to just end it at any time now. I have a plan and I just know I'll eventually follow through with it.

I dont know what else to do and I don't want to live with this pain much longer.
