Suicide-another chapter I constantly failI can't die..nothing works..
I cant jump , I never take enough pills , I cant cut , 
that carbon monoxide doesn't work or Im too stupid and coward to use these methodes corectly 
The last thing I can think of is drowning
Why ? Why dont I die ? I want this more than anything else
I feel like Im immortal ..
you dont know how many people would be happy if I just disappeared 
But nothing is ever enough
