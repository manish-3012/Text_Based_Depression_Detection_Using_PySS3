Why does everything get worse over time?I can't do anything right, I always get in my own way and fuck everything up, I feel like I'm losing every single part of myself and I can't explain it other than I'm just tired of living. Everything is such a fucking chore or just not interesting, everything feels overwhelming and I can't even do basic stuff without wanting to be alone. Seeing my friends feels like I'm just acting like I'm okay when I'm dead inside. All of them think I'm doing super well when I've never felt worse in my entire life. I know that sounds dramatic and it probably is but I want out so badly.
