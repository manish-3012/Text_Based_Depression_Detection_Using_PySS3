I'm just so afraidI'm afraid of everything that is to come in life. Well my dad died when I was a kid so I don't have to worry about him dying. But I'm afraid of my mom dying. I'm afraid of my daughter growing up and hating me for how much I've failed her. I'm afraid of failing in my career and ending up broke and homeless. I'm a cisgender woman so I'm afraid of going through menopause. I'm afraid of becoming elderly and not being able to take care of myself or control my body functions. I'm afraid of having to go through all of this alone if my boyfriend and I don't get back together. The future just seems like it gets worse and worse and then you die. I kinda don't see which part of this is supposed to motivate me to want to not kill myself when I'm already depressed... ?
