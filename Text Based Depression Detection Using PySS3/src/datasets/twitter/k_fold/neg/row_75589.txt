Nothing makes me happyI tried everything. I tried getting a lot of friends but I'm still empty. I tried playing a lot of videogames but I don't like any of them. I tried the gym, walking, tried to go to the uni, I even started a Youtube channel and gained 40k subs but I still feel worthless. I got a girlfriend and she got bored with me. 

Last week I made a suicide attempt with 30 pills of sertraline and 20 pills of trazodone. But my family found me with my lips completely white and took me to the hospital, now I'm very sick and my heart has more than 130 bpm.

I hate being alive, I don't need anything, I have everything but I'm still sad. I want to this time try to kill myself with a knife or something, so they can't save me.

And sorry for my bad English, I can't even write well.
