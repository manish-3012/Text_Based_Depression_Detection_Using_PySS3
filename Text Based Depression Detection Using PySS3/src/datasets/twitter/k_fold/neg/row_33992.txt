Iâ€™m getting closer to acting on my thoughtsI fantasize about suicide daily and have begun subtly hinting to my partner about this. I wonder how long it would take to find me if I took a bunch of pain killers and locked myself in my room right now. No one ever checks on me anyways. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll do it, but Iâ€™m becoming less and less afraid. My partner told me it was selfish and I just stayed quiet. I always imagine spending my life with him. When heâ€™s not around is when these thoughts are all I can think about. I donâ€™t want him to be with some else and I love spending time with him, these are the only things keeping me alive. Iâ€™m afraid that if one more thing goes wrong it will push me off the edge and I will do something stupid.
