im thinking of killing myself within the next couple days.ive just failed a full semester of university thanks to my severe anxiety and depression which ive had since i was very young and have lasted a decade now. im about to get kicked out of university and my parents are going to tear me apart as they were paying for it. im trans and my mother, the only family member im out to doesnt believe me or support me. my parents house will be receiving a letter announcing my expulsion from the university sometime in the next 2 to 5 days. i plan to be dead before next weekend, when im finally kicked out.

i dont know what else i can do. when i do it, ill take enough drugs to knock me out while having a thick plastic bag elasticated around my head so i suffocate.
