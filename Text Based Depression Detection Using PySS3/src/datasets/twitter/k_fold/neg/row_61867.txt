I feel like trashI just got banned off a discord server for making a suicide threat even though I wanted to commit suicide, I did this 5 times and I feel like a piece of garbage. This was in the past and I want to die, the mod never forgave me because I was â€œmocking mental healthâ€ and â€œtrollingâ€, even though I wasnâ€™t. What I did was wrong because. I didnâ€™t take the help when I asked,when they gave it to me, I declined. Idk why am I still living. Like, Iâ€™ve said out loud that I want to commit suicide to myself because I canâ€™t live in this world. I havenâ€™t done anything on my dreams and Iâ€™ve wasted countless years and opportunities, here I am worrying about my ACT and SAT and my ps5, whatâ€™s wrong with me? Like, I have no one except online friends, I just wish I had friends, girl or boy. I just want to feel happiness, just feel love from a friend or even girlfriend. Iâ€™m incapable of love, no one wanted me, I want to honestly disappear. I wanted to apologize to the mod who banned me forever from the server Finding Yourself Again, but he hasnâ€™t forgave me, I hope that when he sees this message that, I will make it up to him. I want to change but I just canâ€™t find the willpower within myself to do it, I feel not entertained by working and I feel more entertained by playing. Iâ€™m lazy, ugly, skinny, a loser. I feel embarrassed whenever people at school ask me if I still have any friends. I donâ€™t know what to do. I actually want to become a game developer, programmer, artist, and animator, but I canâ€™t because of school and my procrastination. I want to become a artist and make manga and comics but I canâ€™t because Iâ€™m worthless. I just want to feel love, feel cuddling, and just be with someone, but I handle that through pleasuring myself to women whoâ€™d deny me quickly to be their boyfriend. Idk what to do, please someone help me. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™ve done bad things in my life such as pleasuring myself in the gym bleachers during 7th grade and cheating on a test in 8th grade. Idk what to do, I feel so dumb, I want to just end it this Christmas. Bye guys.
