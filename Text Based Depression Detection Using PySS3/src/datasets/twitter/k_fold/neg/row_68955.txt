suicide plannedhey. everything was already shit but i have recently lost my only reason to live, my best friend. she stopped talking to me. frankly, itâ€™s my fault. i tried to make her stay when she didnâ€™t want to and ultimately became just a toxic mess. i didnâ€™t mean to hurt her, i just wanted to fix things whether she wanted it or not. for a month iâ€™ve been holding on, barely, because i had hope. but hope is running out. i have my suicide all planned out and a suicide note on my head that i can quickly write down. i guess the only thing holding me back is the fear of not even having success at just killing myself. but i know it would be better to everyone, im just a waste of space and a toxic mess. i donâ€™t even feel like a person anymore. a few days ago i dissociated due to stress and i havenâ€™t felt like myself or anyone at all since. if i died then my best friend would be happier, even the boy i like would be happier since there is no more clingy bitch attached to him. my mother would no longer have to worry about her pansexual daughter and how disgraceful she finds her because of her fucking sexuality. it would just be better for everyone. im sick and tired of the pain. i lied to myself for a while telling myself i didnâ€™t want to die but goddamn i do. i just fucking want to sleep and rest forever because for a month i donâ€™t rest my head. i canâ€™t talk to anyone i know besides the boy i like because my â€œfriendsâ€ would just tell my best friend and she would tell my mom. i donâ€™t want her to know about this, itâ€™s the only thing she hasnâ€™t forced me to tell. i never cut myself before but lately scratching hasnâ€™t sufficed. i want to slit my wrists and just bleed out. it felt good when i scratched myself so hard that there was blood on my sheets and clothes. my birthday is in two months more or less. I donâ€™t think iâ€™ll celebrate it
