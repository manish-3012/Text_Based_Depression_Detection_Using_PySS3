My life is basically overHello.  I am not sure who else to turn to so I am on here.  I have been with my soulmate for 4 years now and with her I was able to get this amazing job, but recently I have messed it all up.  Well, during the relationship I have been cause texting other woman and this most recent time was the last straw.  I don't blame her for wanting to leave, but I don't understand why I do it either.  I know in my heart I love her, but it's like I'm two different people.  Anyways, I don't think she is going to stay with me anymore and on top of that I am probably going to lose my job and all my friends/family.  I don't want to move on to anything else.  In my mind there is nothing after her and I can't even bare the thought of not being with her for even a second.  I will find out soon if she will ultimately leave me, which means I will find out soon if I am going to commit suicide.  I don't know what else to do or anything and I'm lost.  But I know in my heart suicide is the only way out.  Thank you for reading.
