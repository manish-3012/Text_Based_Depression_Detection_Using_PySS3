ADVICE NEEDED (NOT ABOUT ME)One of my really close friends is just sad for no reason I ask her why and she always says "I don't know" and I figure there has to be a reason to and she always leaves little hints here and there that she wants to kill herself, she's talked me out of it and I've done the same. I need to be able to find out what is bothering her and how I can fix it so other redditors if you could please give my your advice
