slowly convincing myself suicide is the only answer. I feel constant panic and gut wrenching anxiety almost all day long.I had the opportunity of using a friends car for a month and last night I got intoxicated and got the car stuck. I slept in the car covered in sweat and vomit for hours. I think in the process of trying to get the car out I burnt up the transmission.

I went home and laid in bed for a few hours. Dreading the phone call to my friend. I can't enjoy the moment I am in at any point. I've watched my family grow up suffering. I can't take the pain of the world anymore. Everyday feels like I have to conquer mt everest just to feed myself. 

I owe a massive amount of student loan debt. I began the actual process of researching the most pain free way to end things. Its slowly growing into a monster which I will constantly be required to fight.

I've tried many different medications. My therapist is terrible. I don't even have enough money to feed myself to be able to work for 5 days a week. Some reason I just can't let myself live in peace. Im constantly walking on eggshells. 

I reached out a few weeks ago here and tried to make a plan to better my life. I don't have enough money to live.
