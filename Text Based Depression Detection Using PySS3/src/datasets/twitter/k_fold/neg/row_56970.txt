back at where I wanted to end itAlthough Iâ€™ve tried a few times, this is the last place I wanted to kill myself. Iâ€™ve been fine for a while although I have my bad days. I havenâ€™t been here in about a year. Idk really what Iâ€™m feeling right now. A part of me wants to take that leap and a part of me thinks i just wanna feel that desperation of wanting to live again...
