I think that my sterility is a sign that I am failure enough to just give upKnowing that I can never create a life, never have that bond with a child as their father is tearing me up inside. I can't pass on my genes or my values. I can't teach what I have learned and experienced to my children, and watch them grow up and go off into the world. I can never do something which most people end up doing by accident. I just feel completely worthless. I was making progress with my depression but ever since this bomb was dropped on me everything has unraveled. I just feel like shit. I cannot fulfill an extremely basic biological function. I am a genetic dead end, an evolutionary failure. Ending my pathetic existence would benefit others. I know that my parents are embarassed and ashamed of me.
