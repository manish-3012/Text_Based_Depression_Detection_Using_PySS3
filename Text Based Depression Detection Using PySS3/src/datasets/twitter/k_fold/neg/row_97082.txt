I planned to kill myself yesterdayFor the past few months, I've experienced multiple deaths in my family. I've been able to block it all out for a while but yesterday I couldn't. Combined with a few other factors, I researched and researched suicide and came up with a method to do it. I went as far as looking at train times and scheduling an uber there. I just can't. I'm scared. I told a few of my friends and they all pulled back and "need space". I keep thinking that there really isn't anyone who loves me. I've been alive for just under 16 years now and I've never truly felt like i belonged. This year was progressive, I made so many friends but yesterday I almost ended it all and for some reason still regret not doing so. I don't know what to do. Please help me
