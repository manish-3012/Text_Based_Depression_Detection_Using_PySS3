What should I do about a middle aged lonely suicidal parent?I don't know what to do. My dad talks is lonely (he has autism), and has no friends or family.I just used his phone and the last time he actually texted someone was last December. He goes years without any social interactions beyond required ones like the grocery store, bank, etc. He had a "friend" once but that was in 2016, and they were barely friends. All he talks about are his life problems which are usually social issues such as neighbors, religion, etc. He has also grown schizophrenic-like symptoms recently and thinks the local police, neighbors, and military are tracking and following him. I can tell that his mental health is deteriorating every single year. He has no job, hobbies, nothing. His apartment literally looks the same as it did 6 years ago when he moved into it. I plan on moving out soon, but fear that he'll commit suicide from loneliness. I think the only reason he's still alive is because he treats me as a pseudo-therapist to rant at. I don't know what to do... I want to leave and continue my life but he'll definitely kill himself.

Sorry about the unorganized thoughts, I just had to get this out. Although I hate my father, I would feel like a piece of shit for letting someone suffer loneliness and depression. I know how painful and crushing it can be... Any advice would be helpful
