I don't know anymoreWarning: I pretty much go into my life story, Don't read it all if you don't want to.
I have been stuck in this loop of wanting to die and wanting to try to fix the unfixable. At some point I had hope. "I can do this, I can fix my life, not have shitty sleep, do my homework, and actually not have to rely on people to do shit for me," but here I am. Still just my lazy old self. I try to do shit, but innevetably I fall back. It's an old habit, to do nothing. To sit at computer and play games, or lay in bed and talk to people. That's all I'm capable of. It's an old habit to have a shitty sleep schedule. All of this shit started in second grade, with one singular thought. "What is it to be alive, to exist, and what's it like when it's gone." I was suicidal afterwards, because I found that it was pointless, and that we would be stuck in a void with no emotion, no friends, no family, and ultimately that's how the universe will end to. Then more came to me. Do I even have friends, no. How long until I made a freind, 4 years. I loved her. Did not know it at the time, because I was not really looking out for that. But I did. Some point during 7th I did, but I figured that I was really not able to commit to something like that. I dated a girl that asked me, it inevitably failed. I did not care at the time, but it for some reason stings now. 8th grade was shitty. I lost her, my first friend, she avoided me, and as soon as I noticed that I avoided her, feared I was being clingy. I regret it and it lingers with me to this day. I still love her, and we did start talking again. But I can't talk to her physically, because each time I fuck it up and can't speak. I went mental after a rejection from a girl I liked in 9th grade, asked out girls I liked, asked out my ex, just to see if I could date anyone, each lead to a no(big surprise) and I attempted, well I say that loosely because it was more just a thought that lead to me not drinking water for a day then coming to my senses. I was failing classes and I felt like shit, my life was going to hell. Then this year I was so happy, I thought I could fix it all, hey I'm not going to stay up to 3 am wondering about what life is. I'm not going to start relationships until I don't overreact like that again, shit like that. But I fucking don't do anything. I stay up, I do try to work harder, but almost pass out from heat exhaustion for it. I just, can't do it. I'm failing classes again, don't have motivation to do shit, my parents still have not gotten me therapy, and I told a person I swore not to tell because she has shit to deal with and she really does not understand the concept of emotions are not just something you can change, all because she gets a little mad at me for not being able to motivate myself to do something. I just, I'm a waste of time, air, food, money. Everything honestly. I do like a girl, but there's a really low chance I will get to date her seeing as (if I'm not mistaken) she is a lesbian. I feel greedy, because I want stuff, I want to be happy, because I have not been, for 8 fucking years, all I had was gloom. I feel like I'm manipulative, every fucking time I talk to someone about this, like im an attention seeker. I want people to care, but at the same time I don't. I want love. But I know that this is something that will most likely get to me, and if it does I don't want people to be hurt. Another thing that's stopping me is, I have 2 little sisters, and if I did it, what if they see the aftermath. But again, I can't motivate myself, to do shit, I'm doomed for failure, whether or not I try to fight it, because this shit has been with me for 8 years and it's only been getting worse. And compared to my friends who are dealing with coming out to their parents, or maybe childhood trauma that I'm not sharing because that's their info, and I only lost a friend, I just, idk anymore if I want to or not. I have just been swinging between trying to live, and planning to die, that's just what I have to say, and I'm sorry. This maybe a goodbye to reddit.
