I almost did it todayI typed out the story why

But i realised that it is just stupid shit

I was going to do it today though. I was very close. It almost happened. But then I got scared about it not working. About being left with the results of another failed attempt. 

Isn't it weird though. You attempt suicide and you're attention seeking. You succeed and you're a tragedy. Why don't people ever see that the people failing their attempts are also a tragedy? Why are we demonised? Why isn't there proper help for people? Why are we left wailing endlessly to the internet, hoping someone will reach out to us? I hate dealing with mental health problems because so many people use it to treat you like shit. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of this. 

I have a plan. Im gonna execute it this weekend I think. Maybe I'll be another attention seeker. If I'm lucky I'll be a tragedy.
