What am I supposed to do?Iâ€™ve made mistakes, I havenâ€™t denied them (I donâ€™t like to talk about them because itâ€™s nothing that Iâ€™m proud of, sorry if sometimes it feels like Iâ€™m avoiding them), Iâ€™ve said sorry to the people that Iâ€™ve hurt and Iâ€™ve said that I regret the things that Iâ€™ve done 

What else do you expect from me?, what do I need to say to be forgiven?

Sometimes it feels like people are not willing to forgive me and this mistake that Iâ€™ve done is going to haunt me forever

People who were not even affected by my mistakes look at me like Iâ€™m a monster and it feels bad. I know Iâ€™m an idiot, why do you need to remind me every day. Everybody that I know looks at me with angry or with grief.

I canâ€™t live with this weight, people think that I did what I did for attention but I didnâ€™t
And now if I comity suicide all of my classmates are going to think that it was for attention and I donâ€™t wanna go back to be everybodyâ€™s conversation topic 

Iâ€™m always afraid of defending myself when people treat me badly because Iâ€™m afraid they will use my bad actions as a justification for everything. I feel like Iâ€™m the person that everyone can treat badly but well, I canâ€™t defend myself because people are going to act like they didnâ€™t mean to hurt me but I know they mean it. I always feel weak. My â€œfriendsâ€ back then didnâ€™t defended me when I was being bullied and that still makes me feel alone and weird. I feel like Iâ€™m the exception to everyoneâ€™s bad actions. I wasnâ€™t enough and thatâ€™s why they didnâ€™t defended me. 

I donâ€™t want to affect my friends but itâ€™s the only way out. Itâ€™s not only that mistake that I made that haunts me but many other things and I canâ€™t anymore. Iâ€™m tired 

Iâ€™m in a better place since last year and for the first time I have real friends but of course Iâ€™m fucking everything slowly. To all of my actual friends, sorry if I didnâ€™t opened up to you, I didnâ€™t see the point of it if I was going to die anyway. I wanted to give you my love so much, but I didnâ€™t because I knew it would end like this.

Maybe one day you all will forgive me. Iâ€™m doomed, I think Iâ€™ll do it soon, I still donâ€™t have a method but Iâ€™ll look for one
