Just want it to stopIâ€™m tired. Everyone asks me whatâ€™s wrong- I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t like myself at all. I hate it. I hate being confused. I donâ€™t know what I am. 
Iâ€™m married, sheâ€™s amazing. I have no idea why sheâ€™s with me. I try to push her away so I have an excuse or at least not feel bad. 
Iâ€™d never do it to myself but I often hope it just happens for me. Iâ€™m tired and I only have my therapist who knows the real truth. About me and how I feel wrong about myself. Everyone would likely accept me, but me. I wish I was a male. I wish Iâ€™d have been born that way or I could snap my fingers like Thanos and itâ€™s just that way and Iâ€™m not different or transitioned or whatever. My wife would still be my wife but sheâ€™d be okay with me being male. I canâ€™t risk telling her and losing her. Iâ€™m trapped and I hate myself. I only see my therapist once a week and itâ€™s not enough. Inpatient will not fix this. Nothing will fix this. I hate myself.!
I have no idea how this place works but figured I could say the truth bc I just joined. I really wish I could kill my self. I keep hoping itâ€™ll happen. I find myself not caring. I have to say it to someone. I canâ€™t do it, my wife depends on me to much and I donâ€™t want to hurt her. Iâ€™m just miserable and feel alone
