Sleeping forever sounds really attractive right now.I have so many problems. One visit to the hospital after trying to kill myself: diagnosed with several disorders. That was back in February. 

It's now a week into July, and things have only seemed to get worse. I'm only 15. My best friend left me. I can't do anything, at all. The only thing I even find remotely enjoyable is playing video games and even then I don't like playing them because I'm trash at them all or in multiplayer games I'm so bad and my internet is bad and people tell me to kill myself because I do so bad. 

I'm really lonely. I don't have any friends. My parents don't care about me; they tell me I can be out as long as I spend the night at home 2 nights of the week. I don't even care... I just sit at home and look out the window wishing I could go out there, but my anxiety attacks stop me. 

I'm not smart, at all. I fail all the classes I go to not because I'm lazy because I don't know anything. I try to go home and I spend hours trying to do the homework but I don't know how and my parents don't help me, I don't want to go online and do it because; I'm going to fail the class anyways and I want to truly get smarter without the help of the answer sheet online.
