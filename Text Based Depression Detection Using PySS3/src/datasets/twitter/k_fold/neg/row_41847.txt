I need people to talk to or Iâ€™m going to kill my selfSo, [this is me ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9t6xgh/my_23m_gf_21f_made_out_with_another_guy_early_in/?st=JNZBW55T&amp;sh=7a9078a6). I am comfortable linking to my main account but not posting on it as people irl know me and are on reddit.

On top of all of this, I am doing terribly in school since I found out. Iâ€™ve taken one shower in the last two weeks, I am fucking miserable, and she tells me she needs space because sheâ€™s hurt by how hurt I am that she cheated.

I am a failure, a fuck up. A terrible son, brother, grandson, boyfriend, friend, student, and person. I am deeply unhappy and am rapid cycling right now. I have letters written and a plan in place and I donâ€™t think I want someone to stop me, but i also donâ€™t want to hurt her more by linking this to her brain. Please, stop me.
