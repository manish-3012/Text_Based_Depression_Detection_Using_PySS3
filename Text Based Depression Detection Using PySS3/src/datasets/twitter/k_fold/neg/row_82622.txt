I don't want to go back to the psychward. I'm going to kill myself soon.I hate myself, I hate my life, I'm ashamed of about everything I've ever done, I'm ashamed of my body, I'm unable to hold a job, I have no passion, I'm alone and I have no friends, I'm scared of ending up in the streets, I have nothing to live for, I interact with literally zero person most days...


I'm 27 and I've been depressed for 10% of my life, alone for 50% of it, and bored for 80% of it. I've seen 8 psychiatrists, most of them told me they couldn't help me. I've tried 6 different drugs and only one worked and only temporarily.


Everything I wanted to do I have done.


In the last 2 weeks, I've seen my family even though they didn't know this was goodbye. I've met my former friends, I've taken drugs and had a last bit of random sex.


After I go, my family will cry and get over it. My mum might remain broken until she dies... My exes will be at rest. My bands will replace me easily. My art will continue to get published weekly for a couple years even though nobody looks at it. A few people will feel somewhat responsible but they'll be told that it isn't their fault and I'll just become a tiny scar from their past, no bigger than an old breakup.


I've chosen drowning. I've always liked water. A couple of concrete blocks chained to the waist and a last jump from an abandoned bridge.


I hope my dog finds a good home after I'm gone.
