Lost all my life savings to trading oil futures, no friends, dead end minimum wage job, never had a girlfriend in my life.I lost $45000 of my savings due to my gambling addiction. Also months of sleepness nights and years of staring at my trading screen with no end result except loss and high blood pressure. I have been working like a slave stuck in a  dead end low paid job and have burnt all that money i saved. I have no friends in my life never had a girl friend in my life and have no social skills. I feel nothing i am dead inside. And pretty soon i want to be dead outside.
