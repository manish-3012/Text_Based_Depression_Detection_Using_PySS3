Probably tonightâ€™s the night [16M]Iâ€™m just so tired of everything. Tired of living, which is a synonym of pain. Tired of being useless, which Iâ€™ve been since conception. Tired of being abused, like everyone does to me. Tired of work, the driving force of society.

Iâ€™m so tired. I donâ€™t want to do anything. Iâ€™m failing shit. Homeworkâ€™s a bitch, I essentially boycotted it. Got barely any friends and the ones I do have could definitely do better. The strongest female bonds Iâ€™ve made are with my teachers, and not in the fun way. I mean as teachers.

Iâ€™ve been wanting to die a while now. Iâ€™ve gotten an infection of hope, a thing that has only ever hurt me. Trying anything important results in failure. But hope was banging my head against a brick wall. I know better and I no longer have it.

The only thing thatâ€™s been holding me back from doing it was a lack of a gun. I remember looking in my ndadâ€™s closet for one I remember he showed me years prior, but I couldnâ€™t find it. So I put it off.

But I canâ€™t handle this shit anymore. I know we have vodka. I know we have pills. That could do, I suppose. Iâ€™ll just fake sick again, and if I live, Iâ€™ll wake up before they know I tried. Assuming I donâ€™t leave a trail of tears, pills, and vodka.

I donâ€™t know. Only thing holding me back at this point is chance of failure and discovery. I just want to be gone so, so bad. Please, someone help me through this hellhole.
