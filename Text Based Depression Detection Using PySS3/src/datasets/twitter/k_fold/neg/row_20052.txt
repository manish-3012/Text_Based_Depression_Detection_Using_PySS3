I hate having a disability... Anyone can relate/advice?I have a stutter itâ€™s quite mild. Mostly appears when Iâ€™m stressed or have anxiety. 
But it really makes me feel like Iâ€™m an alien. I k everyone has something going on with them. But my shit is out in the open. 
Frm having a stutter it has caused me to have social anxiety and Iâ€™m scared to interact with others.
At times it make me want to end it all.
