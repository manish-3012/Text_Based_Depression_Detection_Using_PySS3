SighI had such promise, they say, but now in my mid thirties I haven't been happy in 15 years.  I recently tried to remember a time I'd felt confident or happy and I couldn't.  

I've been praying on and off for my death for three years.  Now I've realized the good lord won't give me what I want, so I've started thinking about it. 

I'm here so at least I know I don't want to, at least some part of me.  But my god....

I don't want to talk to anyone about it.  My shrink has got back to me in a week.  I don't want to burden my family.  

I just want out.
