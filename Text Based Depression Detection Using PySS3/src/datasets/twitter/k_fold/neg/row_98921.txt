just want to disappearI want all the pain to go away. Had a bad break up and it's left me depressed, had therapy, on pills and it is still spiralling downwards. I have nothing in me, I wish I could live but I am just existing. I can't find anything to give me a lift. I just want to end it all, I just want to disappear.
