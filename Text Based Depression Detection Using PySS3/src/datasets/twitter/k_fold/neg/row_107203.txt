Friend nearly attempted suicide tonight...I really hope this is an appropriate place for this post...

About 5 hours ago, I messaged my best friend on Skype, asking if she was okay, wanted to talk, etc., because she was set to 'do not disturb'. She'd been upset about her next birthday and posted a journal online about it, and earlier she'd been feeling unwell so I assumed she was just a little down and needed someone to talk to. This was the convo we had:

&gt; C: hun? :x

&gt; D: hi &lt;3

&gt; C: Do you want to talk? &lt;3 I saw your journal? Or would you rather be alone? &lt;3 sorry, if I disturbed you &lt;3

&gt; D: didnt disturb me. idk dont think talking would help anyway s not the journal thing.

&gt; C: :( oh, ok hun :( what is the matter? :x I don't know if it would help, either, I'm sorry &lt;3

&gt; D: just dont feel good at all

&gt; C: :( do you want to go to bed? :s

&gt; D: no :(

&gt; C: aww hun:( do you think there's anything that'd make you feel better?

&gt; D: would you mind if i just stayed here a moment with you :(

&gt; C: Hey, hun, I have all the time in the world for you &lt;3

&gt; C: C hugs you tightly &lt;3

&gt; D: &lt;3 thanks &gt;&lt;

&gt; C: you're so so so very welcome, sweetheart &lt;3I always want you to be happy &lt;3

&gt; (20 minutes later) D: im sorry i burdened you and (her BF). i love you.

Now of course I knew something was up, my first reaction was to tell her that she was worrying me and she wasn't a burden, but she logged off shortly after that. Her BF told me she'd been talking about life getting worse and worse and I started frantically calling her, but she wouldn't pick up. After 10 minutes of that I went and told my mum what was happening, and sent D a message saying if she didn't respond to my calls I was going to call her mother, because at that stage I was desperate and the only important thing to me was making sure she was safe. That message got through and the next time I called she answered. 

We spent maybe an hour and a half talking, until she fell asleep (I didn't leave her, I woke her and asked her if she wanted to go to bed). During the call she told me she didn't know what would have happened if I hadn't called, promised me she'd stay safe, told me she felt a lot better now. I got her to agree to a promise to not kill herself, as a safety net (just, if things got so bad, that promise would at least prevent it long enough for her to get help). I felt so so SO relieved that I was able to get through to her. 

Losing her would be the most painful thing I've ever been through, and I admit I was very selfish in not wanting her to die. But I do also think that dying wouldn't make her situation better. I truly feel that if she holds on for a couple more years, her life will become dramatically better.

But now I just don't know what to do next. Her mother is horrifically emotionally abusive. The stories she tells about her family, they're the kind of ridiculous things you'd think somebody would make up for attention, the kind of things if you heard a stranger say, you'd go 'yeah, sure, like any parent would do THAT'...in fact I admit I thought that way myself a bit until I met the woman, and, just...wow... And that was her on her best behaviour. 

When she was 15 or so she was a bedwetter, and her mother sat her down to tell her to stop because 'it's me who's really suffering'. At this stage, D was getting up at about 5.30am every morning to sort out her sheets, while her Mum slept. D is MtF transgender, and is out to her family. Her mother repeatedly sabotaged counselling sessions (telling the counsellor D was 'growing a beard' after she stopped her shaving that morning) and takes every opportunity to point out any ways D is 'manly' (playing video games is something only guys enjoy, all women enjoy housework so if D doesn't she is clearly a man, etc). She also tries to set D up with random girls and insists D's 'straight': after having *met my partner* she spent the week before I came to visit trying to give D condoms, telling her she 'wouldn't mind if C stayed in your bed all night'. When I was there she sat me down and told me about this dream she had where me and D got married and had babies and I was all '...ok...' and then when D protested she was attracted to men, her mother said 'oh, all your crushes have been on girls! Don't be silly!' She takes every opportunity to belittle/humiliate D, telling her she's too fat, has aspergers (she has never been diagnosed with aspergers), is crazy. Throughout it all she simultaneously tells D she's so crazy/aspie that nobody else could ever love or understand her, and that nobody will ever love D more than she does, because she's so crazy, so she should feel grateful/lucky. This is a daily thing: it's sort of a morbid game between me, her and her BF to see what kind of insanity comes out of her mouth next. The ridiculousness of some of it makes it comical: but I do always try to be supportive when it's clear she's not in the mood to laugh about it, I would never take amusement from her pain. I'm just trying to emphasize that her insanity is ludicrous to the point of seeming like poor-taste comedy.

My friend also has a horrible continuous ear infection (pus and blood leaking from it often, heavy antibiotics and 'acid'(???) hasn't helped), which has kept her out of school for a long time, which only adds to stress. There are two women who harrass/threaten her often (they are known to the police, but nothing has been done AFAIK) who get on the bus she takes many places. She isn't popular at school and is mildly bullied often. 

But it's not all bad news: she's got an endocrinologist appointment soon, and in two years she can move out and go to university and pursue her dream. She has a partner who would do anything for her and friends who care about her. Again, I truly believe if she just holds on for a couple more years her life will completely change...

But for now, I have no idea what I need to do. I haven't slept since she went to bed because I'm so scared to 'leave' her. I feel like I need to wait until she's awake to 'check up' on her. I don't want her to feel like a burden, honestly I feel like a selfish person because I want to make sure she hasn't 'left me'. She's like a sister to me, and I have no idea what I would do without her. 

I feel helpless (and I'm sure she feels that times a billion): I can't get her out of her shitty situation, I can't even go see her that often (she lives about 5 hours away by coach, and it's Â£40 each time; I rarely, if ever, have disposable income, as I'm young and have no job). I'm worried with the constant stresses she'll slip into this state of mind again.

I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just need to talk to someone, I guess. I'm totally shellshocked; the feelings of 'My friend wanted to die tonight', of knowing she was really thinking she should die, when I value her so highly...it makes me feel sick. So yeah. Advice, or at least, anybody else been in a situation where they've had someone they love/value try to commit suicide?
