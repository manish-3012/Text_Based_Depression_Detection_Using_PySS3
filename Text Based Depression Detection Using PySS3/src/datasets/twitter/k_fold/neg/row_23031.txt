Itâ€™s too painfulIâ€™ve been too much of a coward, but now it just hurts to much. I want to stop being so afraid. Iâ€™m tired of crying every single day. Knowing you are so much better off without me. Knowing the harassment you and your friends are putting me through brings you pleasure. I canâ€™t live like this anymore. I want everything to be over.
