8th gradeIâ€™m in 8th grade and already contemplating this shit  the reason I have been thinking about this is I have anxiety and depression that never seems to go away I canâ€™t talk to my parents about it because they have my other two brothers to worry about so the only way to help myself is to hurt them and I donâ€™t think I can do that and Iâ€™m afraid to reach out to a friend cause I feel like we could never have a normal conversation again then thereâ€™s the fact that I know Iâ€™m going to grow up to be a man child who at best is a manager of a bar or gas station even though I want to do something with science but even the thought of responsibility scares me I have all Fs in my core classes because we just moved and I feel my parents are slowly giving up on me I just canâ€™t take this shit anymore
