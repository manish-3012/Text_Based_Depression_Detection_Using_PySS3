It's baacckk.Depression is back with a vengeance again for the millionth time. 3 day rule, 3 day rule. Must fight. So tired though. 2 months of freedom where i was relatively stable, not excited or happy, just no in the despair/pit of my depression. First time in years I've been so stable, for so long. Decades actually. But it's back again. I can't get out of bed. I just want to sleep forever.
