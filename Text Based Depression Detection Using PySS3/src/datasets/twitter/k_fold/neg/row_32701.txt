Havenâ€™t felt this close in a long timeThere have been a lot of traumatic things happening to me the last few months and Iâ€™ve been using people to cope but my behaviors have been a weird combo of isolating and obsessive and now there isnâ€™t really anyone left. Iâ€™ve been getting high all the time. Tried going to the psychiatrist and they acted like they didnâ€™t want anything to do with me after not coming in for months. I try to do things I enjoy but Iâ€™m alone so it just makes it worse and more depressing. Work is fine but itâ€™s a dead end job I donâ€™t have to do think about. Living this way for the rest of my life is difficult to think about.  Iâ€™ve been going to therapy as well but Every time I go I just hit brick wall after brick wall and I canâ€™t change because of my insurance. I planned a vacation to New York in March and Iâ€™m thinking about killing myself there. Party with strangers for a weekend and overdose on drugs. It seems like a simple way to go nothing out of the ordinary especially for someone with my use/mental health issues. I wake up and go to sleep crying. Itâ€™s feels so unfair because Iâ€™ve tried so hard after my first attempt to make things right but now I regret not being able to complete it back then.
