I canâ€™t do it anymoreI fucking ruin everything. I hurt the love of my life. Iâ€™m such a fuck up. I canâ€™t do anything. Every day is more and more of a struggle to stay alive. I donâ€™t know much longer I can do this. I donâ€™t know when I plan on taking my life but Iâ€™ve been thinking about ways on how to do it. I wish I could go back in time and never ruined things the way I did.  I canâ€™t do it anymore.
