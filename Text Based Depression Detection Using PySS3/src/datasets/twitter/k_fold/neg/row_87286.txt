Turning 30 at midnight. I cannot do this anymore.I hate everything about myself. I cannot enjoy anything, I have tried to love life but I do not have one. I want to be an outgoing fun woman but instead I am shy, awkward and have a lot of anxiety around people. I decided to treat myself today and grt a haircut and it looks awful, and that was the straw for me oddly enough. Nothing ever goes right and I can never have the life I want. I am too old to start over and my life is already done. Vaya con dios.
