Is it normal to be suicidalI'm asking honestly. Because we are at a point in our society and in late stage capitalism where I kinda feel like everyone is probably a little bit suicidal. I find it hard to believe that anyone is really happy or comfortable in this world that we've constructed. And I feel very much a little bit hopeless because I'm not sure it's even possible to fix myself without fixing the entire societal structure that I'm being forced to live in. How is it possible to be really content with your life under these circumstances? Are most people just literally lying to themselves every day about wanting to live, or have they somehow adapted to living like this? 

I feel like everyone I know hates being alive at least a little bit, whether they explicitly admit it or not. And it really makes me wonder what's the fucking point of even trying to get better. Either way I'm still going to live in this literally God-forsaken society.
