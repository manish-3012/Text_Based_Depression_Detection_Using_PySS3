Things that I've looked forward to and used as reasons to stick around always end up being disappointments.I'm a freshman at a university and I really haven't had such a great year both in terms of the calendar year and also academic year so far. I haven't made any friends, I've been fucked with so much by this girl, and things aren't working out at all. I've got 17 credits and there isn't much free time so there really aren't any breaks my roommate fucking sucks and it's hard to hold on. I've struggled with depression and various other things for a while now but it's only getting worse. This is really pathetic but there was this really cool jacket I saw online and I bought it to give me something to look forward to. It took like a month to get here and I didn't even get the right thing that I ordered and it's just everything is a disappointment anymore. I'm too introverted/concerned about grades/don't want a repeat of last experiences to go to parties or do anything where I'll meet people and it's just shit right now. All of my friends from high school are doing great except for me.
