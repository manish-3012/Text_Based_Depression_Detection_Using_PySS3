Reality truly ruins youAs a general rule people with suicidal tendencies have some form of mental disorder that makes them think their situation is worse than it actually is. All the different anxiety disorders cause some degree of disconnection with reality: life is not necessarily the way you perceive it to be.

In my case, I looked up all my past records (pictures, grades, etc) and found that... I'm actually trash. It's not that I think I'm trash, I'm actually trash.

I was horrible at grades. I never finished school. I was always an absolute zero in sports. I never had, and I don't have, any friends. I have zero value for humanity.

There isn't a single thing where I wasn't horrible at. Not just that I didn't have any talents, but that there wasn't even anything that I was normal at.

The world has no place for me.
