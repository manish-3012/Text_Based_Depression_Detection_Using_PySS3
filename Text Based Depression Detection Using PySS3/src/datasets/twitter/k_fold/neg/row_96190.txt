Why fight to get better?Hey everyone. I'm so tired of everything. I'm just sad, and sad for no reason. I think I have a decent life. Nothing that would bring me sadness. Just stubborn depression being a pain in the ass. I've had depression since I was 16, I'm currently 20. I'm so sick of not being able to enjoy anything. I also hate the fact that I cannot take a liking into anything. I see everyone getting all excited for something, but I can never relate. I've gotten better 3 times, only to then be put in a state where I'm far worse. I think I no longer have the will, or any vitality left in me to continue the fight. Why fight something and try to get better if it may never end? I think I'm going to shoot myself on Thursday, with some piss poor, low round, and take some pills to hopefully shut down organs. Unfortunately I don't have access to a shotgun with birdshot shells. Im so fucking afraid of the pain that I'll be in once I shoot myself. That's always been the reason why I have never really tried to, but I guess we all must face something we're afraid of. If I can get my hands on some weed, I'll probably take a hit or two to ease any pain that I may endure for the following minutes, or seconds. I'm so miserable, feel so lonely and have no energy to do basic, simple things.
