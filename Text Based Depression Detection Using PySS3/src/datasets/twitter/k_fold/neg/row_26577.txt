Tired of my miserable lifeIv been suffering from severe depression for going on 9 years. I think itâ€™s finally time that I end my suffering. My lifeâ€™s just keep getting more and more shit. Honestly just gonna go jump off a building. Iâ€™ll die either from a heart attack or die on impact. Easier than me trying to get a Gun.
