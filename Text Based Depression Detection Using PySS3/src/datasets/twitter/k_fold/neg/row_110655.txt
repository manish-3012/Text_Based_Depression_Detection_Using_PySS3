Back to schoolWith the new school year and people's classes switching around I'm in the same class as that friend I cut off and I don't know if I can handle it. She hasn't acknowledged my existence in these past 2 days so maybe if I just shut up and keep to myself it'll be ok. I have 8 pages of whap homework due Thursday. I haven't done any because yesterday I fell asleep at 4 and slept through the night and today I fell asleep at 5 and slept till 9 and I'm probably gonna go back to bed soon. 

I fucking hate my school. Who is the idiot that allowed 4,500 kids in the same school. People have told me that I'm blessed to be able to go to this highschool because it offers so much. It doesn't offer much honestly and they don't care about their students the whole town runs on football. We have atleast 30 kids in each class and it sucks. This entire town is idiotic and i hate 99.9% of it. 

I can't deal with getting dealt the worst cards in life anymore. Honestly I hope I get hit by a car or hope I drive into the side of the highway and die. Not like I'll be remembered anyways I have no friends anymore I haven't had anyone text me in weeks. I could just fade out of existence and nothing would change in people's lives.
