Why cant i do it?Hello

It all started with some gambling on those virtual items on games, I couldnt stop i spent thousands and thousands of $

And it all evolved after it was shut down. I then got into the online casinos, life was great at that time about 2 years ago. But its slowely built up the addiction step by step. And at this point i really cant stop..

I tried to do the right thing and sell my computer as it was my favorite thing to do. Didnt even have to gamble to find joy while on the computer but i felt like it was the only thing holding me back from gambling so i sold it. But it didnt stop me, i then started to use my phone to play. Its fairly easy as my favorite thing to play is roulette, im not a slot kind of guy. So im sure you can imagine the money drains faster on roulette as i cant stop re filling, and even when i win 5 figures i look at it as pocket change even if i needed it or if i was on some mad profit. It always went back in.

But it has all come to an end. I have no money and no computer to have fun on whether its gaming or watching movies. It was a very expensive computer with a really nice monitor so it was amazing. But anyway now that i have nothing and nothing to build on i believe it all has come to an end? Is this when i do it? How should i do it? What will happend after?

I almost did it today, i had the moment but then i stopped and couldnt do it. I now feel weak and angry. I dont feel sad. So what do i do if i cant do it??

There is nothing that can stop my addiction. Its been so many years and there is no return  tickets. 

This is the last stop.




Sorry if my english suck, I cant be asked to make it look nice on the phone. Didnt mean for it to be so long.
