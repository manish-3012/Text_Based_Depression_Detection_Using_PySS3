I hurt someoneI've posted here before &amp; I'm still around. But I don't want to be. Each day is darker than the next &amp; I feel like I'm crawling towards the inevitable. I used to look for painless ways to do it. Then I started becoming open to painful ways. Now I'm at the point where I don't care if I hurt anyone else.

Last night she told me she had feelings of pain &amp; lack of sexual feeling that weren't fixable. I destroyed someone's mind &amp; heart. I truly did. So it's not so much about meeting someone else or loneliness. This will always be with me.

Edit: Last night I planned out what I would do while I was in karate. I was exercising &amp; feeling good &amp; that's when I really started making a plan. And it felt good &amp; sound.
