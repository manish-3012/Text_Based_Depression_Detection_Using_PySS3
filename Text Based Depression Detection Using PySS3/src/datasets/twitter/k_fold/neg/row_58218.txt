I've been functioning beyond my limits for years, and something has finally broken downFor the longest time I kept thinking, do people know I'm breaking down but they just don't care, or am I just that good at hiding it? And I guess it's the latter, because I'm too good at hiding that I want to kill myself very badly. I guess it'll be quite a shock to everyone when I do eventually manage to pull it off (don't know when or even how that's gonna happen, but it will).
