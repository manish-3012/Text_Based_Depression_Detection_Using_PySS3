The feelings are back...I was doing so well for a while, I felt like I might be one of those people whose depression went away on its own. But then tonight, for some reason I feel as shitty as I ever have. No one is awake here. Theres no one in my house. I'm thousands of miles from my family. I feel alone, sad, hopeless and above all, suicidal.

I thought I'd post here just to give myself something to do and maybe just write out all my feelings  to help myself think things through, but I don't have the motivation.

 I guess there really wasn't any point in fighting through all the times these feelings have come before, since it's clear now, they'll just come back.
