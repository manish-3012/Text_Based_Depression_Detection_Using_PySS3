Planned Obsolescence; makes me feel suicidal every time I think about it.I have a pretty strong hate against the current monetary system. Yes, I know... it works! It fucking works..we have no other choice. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK!

Agh, for those that don't know about Planned Obsolescence, I'll explain it.

Basically, companies are **required** to create inefficient products; products that are designed to break down after so many years. Why? Profit.

In a monetary system, the companies that make inefficient products will succeed. By creating a product that breaks down after 2 years, it forces the consumer to buy the same product again.

What's the problem with this? We're wasting resources, we're destroying our planet.

Why do the paper companies cut down trees and not hemp? Because trees are a limited resource, they're finite. Thus the price of paper rises. Hemp is infinite, we can grow so much hemp in such little time..but the price of paper will decrease.

Planned Obsolescence is God. It rules our system and we are subservient to it. Companies have no choice, they must adhere to it so that they can succeed. 

Sigh, it just pisses me off and I wish someone would just give me hope. I don't feel like the human race is moving anywhere. We're wasting resources and polluting the planet whilst doing so. 

meh, meh meh and meh.
