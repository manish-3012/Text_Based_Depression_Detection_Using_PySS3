Not to be melodramatic, but this is probably my last post. it's been emotional. I apparently need tons of help, but am unwilling to give enough information in one post, or talk to someone irl about my issues. 

This is what we call a stalemate. 

my anxiety issues kept me from doing anything to avoid getting a 10 k judgement put against me. 

I'm stuck in a dead end job and any prospects I have to get out of it will probably be destroyed since the above is now on my credit report. 

I'm officially homeless. 

I have substantialy higher than average intelligence, which makes the above more ridiculous. 

I'm alone in all of this. my therapist doesn't even know how bad things are right now. 

 I don't trust people not to judge the hell out of me instead of actually giving me advice. 

All the effort I put in to improve myself does not seem to matter. 

I'll keep going just because that's all I know how to do, but bullshit will continue to appear. I until my life ends. 


I'm not checking this account anymore, but maybe some 
one else in a similar situation can benefit from this. 

take charge of your life, before it's too late.
