I should've read the content warningSo I recently played the first part of Doki Doki Doki Literature Club, and I half regret it. Beware this post will contain spoilers.

As I played trougth the game I already expected terrible things to happen, but this shit just hit too close to home. There wasn't one fucking thing that that dumbass Sayori said that I didn't agree with, and I congratulated (and still do) the game for it's stop-on portrayal of suicidal thoughts and people. But the last scene just fucked me completely.

When I saw her there, I saw myself. That awful scene is what I've been fantasizing about for the last 3 years. This pile of shit that was supposed to be a dumb graphic novel with a slight twist  has kicked me right in the nuts with a realization:

#I'm much worse than I thought I was.

You see, I've gotten used to it. It's normal for suicide to be the solution to everything. It's normal for it to be the only way it. But this fucking pile of shit of a game made me realize how close I am to snapping. How much research I've done on the subject, and how easy and simple and elegant and exit bag is compared to living. It made me realize how warp my vision is, and how fucked up I am in every possible aspect.

You know the worst part? Nobody missed her.

The game goes on. Life kept going, almost nothing changed after she left. Because she was right. I know this isn't what the game means and I know this is why they put the content warnings but this is what I got from it.

I've messaged a friend from school, she's the only one I've ever trusted, but I know she'll stab me in the back eventually, but hopefully I'll be dead before that. I asked her to meet up somewhere so I can talk about this in private*

*It has to be in private because I won't be able to keep myself together if I utter any of the words I've been avoiding.

Piece out you cunts,  hopefully I'll be dead in a few months
