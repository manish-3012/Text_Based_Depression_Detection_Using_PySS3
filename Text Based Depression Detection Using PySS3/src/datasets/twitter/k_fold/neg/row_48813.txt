I fuck up everything good in my lifeI canâ€™t handle it. Iâ€™ve fucked up. I donâ€™t want to be here; I donâ€™t think I actually can. If I survive an attempt it just means that ill have no rights to do anything on my own and everyoneâ€™s gonna just crowd me. Iâ€™ll see how today goes. Iâ€™ll try to see how today goes. If I can. One of the few reasons I want to live and my hope was within my reach and Iâ€™ve probably lost it. I donâ€™t want advice I donâ€™t want people telling me â€œtheyâ€™re here to talkâ€ because just everyone always leaves and doesnâ€™t care. I canâ€™t handle this.
