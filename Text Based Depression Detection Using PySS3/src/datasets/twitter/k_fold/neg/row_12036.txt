Alcohol poisoningI'm  doing it in the next weeks by alcohol poisoning 

Over a short period of time my live went from dream to shit and heres why 

Have an absolutely lovely gf with a good job 

Gf starts to give signs that she isnt interested anymore 

1 year and 2 months down the fucking drain 

Start to drink, gf hates it even more 

Get to a point where I need alcohol 24/7 to function 

Gf is madder 

Lose job cause drunk on the job 

Drink more, gf gets angrier 

Be me now drunk, listening to Magic city by Gorillaz smelling my gf's hoodie crying like every night of the last month 

This is it peeps one more bottle and I'm out to bed then when my gf leaves I will chug 3 bottles of my favorite liquor and drink a pack of my favorite beer and it will be it
