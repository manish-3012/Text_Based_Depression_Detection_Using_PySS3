Iâ€™m just done 21fI donâ€™t know how to keep going, thereâ€™s no point. I canâ€™t do school, i have no job because of covid. Im stuck in a relationship with a partner who only cares about himself. Iâ€™ve been guilt tripped before by family members when i mention my sucidical ideations, called selfish and entitled (yes entitled) and it made me sink further into the pit

I hate people

I dont want to live anymore

I have no future and nothing to offer the world

I wish my mom had aborted me i didnt ask for this
