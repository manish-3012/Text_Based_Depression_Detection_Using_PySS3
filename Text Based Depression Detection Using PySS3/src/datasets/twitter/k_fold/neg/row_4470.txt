I have done everything I can think ofAll I want is for you to give me some attention sometimes. You know how important you are to me. Why canâ€™t you make an effort? Why am I in the wrong if I get insecure? Youâ€™re the one that never talks to me. Itâ€™s not fair. I know you wonâ€™t miss me. So thereâ€™s no reason for me to stay. Nothing gets better. I knew it was stupid to think that I was anything more than just a distraction until you felt better and could find someone better. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m not good enough.
