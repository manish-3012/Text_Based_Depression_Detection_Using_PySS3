I want to OD tonight.I'm 20 years old (F), 125lb, 5'2" and I have a bottle of Teva-Lenoltec No.3 that was prescribed to me back in January for my wisdom tooth removal. 300mg of acetaminophen, 15mg of caffeine, 30mg of codeine phosphate.

My life isn't going the way I wanted to. I was happy for a period. I had an amazing boyfriend who I truly loved and thought was gonna marry. We had issues, but I thought there was nothing we can't fix together. I had the job I thought I wanted. I worked so hard to get through school and I thought I made it.

And then everything fell apart. My boyfriend and I broke up and now he just wants to be friends. Being friends isn't enough for me. I wanna feel loved and cared for. But at the same time, he's the only person I have left. I quit my job because it was too stressful and my parents don't even care about me and my mental health. I have nobody that cares for me.

I feel like I've tried everything. I've been told that I'm doing a great job of taking care of my mental health myself. But I'm so tired of it. I'm tired of having to take care of myself. I keep telling myself that healing is a process but this process is too painful. If it's not painful, it's empty. I just wanna end it all.

I have 18 pills. I don't want a chance of living. I don't want to deal with the process of rehab and recovery and liver issues. I want to be sure. 

With my weight and height, will it be enough?
