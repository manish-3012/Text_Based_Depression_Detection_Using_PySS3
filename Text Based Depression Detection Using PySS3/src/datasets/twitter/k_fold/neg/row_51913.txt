Is it normal to just feel empty?I canâ€™t really think of another way to describe it; sometimes I just have no emotion, like nothing is inside of me. I hate it so much. I feel like Iâ€™m missing a part of me and I donâ€™t know what to do. 

This feeling normally lasts for like a week then turns into depressive episodes of just not wanting to live anymore (currently what Iâ€™m stuck in, admittedly)

The thing is, I donâ€™t even have a reason to feel like this. My life is what many people would call ideal. I donâ€™t have an excuse to feel sad, I just am. I hate myself for this especially

If anyone could give any advice of how to get over myself it would be greatly appreciated!
