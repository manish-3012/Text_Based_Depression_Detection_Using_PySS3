I'm suicidal; I'm about to tell my father, need some advice.I have been having suicidal thoughts for six months now. For the last one month my tendency to self harm has increased exponentially, my left hand is a mess, these cuts look horrible, there are even cuts on scars of previous ones. I'm terrified of myself, though thankful to God none of them were deep enough to cut my artery. Even though there are these horrifying urges to kill myself I know one thing ; I don't want to die.
I'm about to tell my father but I'm not what or how to say it ?
