I just want to be doneA week and a half ago, my fiancÃ© of 1 year(together for 3) left me out of nowhere. It was totally unexpected and there was zero warning. He was not only my partner but the absolute best friend I've ever had. Everything about us just worked so well. We were preparing to move out for the first time, he just started a great new job, and I'm currently in school to become a nurse. Less than a week before this happened he was saying how excited he was to have kids together, how wonderful our future was going to be, and was getting a lot more involved in the wedding planning than he had ever been. I was truly, entirely happy. I had finally let down all my guards and was bare.

I'm just in a total state of shock. My life has done a complete 180 and I had no idea it was coming. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for almost 10 years now but I have never felt this low. I sit around aimlessly, doing anything and everything to keep myself distracted. I don't have many friends so I've been leaning on my older brother for support. But he can't be around all the time. I don't talk to my parents about these things. I feel like I have no one to turn to. My studies are falling apart as well. As hard as I try to focus I just don't care anymore. I sleep as much as I can but never get more than a few hours at a time. I can't count the number of times I've said "I just want to die" to myself in the last week. Where do I go from here? How am I supposed to move on? I'll forever have to tell future partners "Yeah, I was engaged once. My ex just got sick of me." and get looked at with pity. How am I supposed to plan a wedding down the road when even the word makes my heart drop? I just want it to end.
