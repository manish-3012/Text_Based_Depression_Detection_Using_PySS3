So CloseWhy can't I just do it? Its all I think about. Its so close, but still feels too far away to reach. I have no value and everyone hates me anyway, so I'd just be doing everyone a favor... It'd make everyone life so much better. Its just another mark of my pure selfishness that I haven't done it yet...
