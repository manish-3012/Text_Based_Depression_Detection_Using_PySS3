Reasons to live ?Iâ€™m a 23F and recently ended a 5 year relationship with 30M . Long story short Iâ€™ve always suffered with depression but Iâ€™m extra suicidal . I JUST got my first car , live at home , I think I may have dysmorphia because people tell me Iâ€™m attractive but I HATE myself . So they just say Iâ€™m faking it . I work at a laundromat so itâ€™s not like I have a REAL career . Either due to my ugly appearance or maybe lack of finance no man ever wants to take me serious they just want to screw me . Besides my ex but I had to leave because I was experiencing disassociation after 4 years of isolation and reprogramming (the first year was better ) . Iâ€™m up to a pack of cigs a day , and any day I have off I get drunk . Recently threw away my rollerblades which was the last thing I could muster up the energy to do . 
3 years ago I lost my only sister to a drug overdose so I feel kinda stuck here for my mom and nephew as much as I want to end it for my own sanity . Sooo yeah  I just need logical people to give me some advice , normally I can pull myself back but itâ€™s been nonstop for 2 months now suicidal thoughts .
