Nothing interesting about thisI donâ€™t know how this site works so apologies in advance.
I am a 20 year old Indian male so that means Iâ€™m ugly (even by Indian standards lol) , my grades suck and I have no talents.
I have severe acne scarring on my nose which makes me look like a fucking retarded orange
Iâ€™ve been rejected three times by girls who led me on for months so that crushed my confidence further 
I study hard but I still pass borderline 
I play guitar and write music for 4 years now but it still sounds like aural diarrhoea 
I am spending fuck tons of money of acne scar treatment (my dad is rich) but Iâ€™m still as ugly as a sin and itâ€™s  not really working 
I donâ€™t go out as a result of this 
My lips are kinda fat but I purse them all the time 
I feel very ugly and think that people are staring and judging me 
I feel inferior even to beggars on the street when I see their well developed features 
People around me are so supporting and kind even my parents but I feel unworthy of it all
Yesterday I embarrassed myself in front of my entire college 
I went on stage with my guitar played a few notes then froze and left 
I feel so embarrassed and ashamed 
I want to die now 
I canâ€™t go back and face anybody there 
I tried to explain to my parents I want to die but they are not ready for it 
I donâ€™t feel happy anymore in anything
I havenâ€™t felt happy in years 
I just feel embarrassed ugly and disappointed
I want to quit 
What do I do
Please donâ€™t pity me
