No one cares about meI have no family, no friends, no one that gives a damn as about me. I don't have any friends. My parents really don't care. I had a brother that used to care but he moved to another city. I have to go to a shit school every day. I live in a hell hole. I don't want to live anymore. I see no reason to. I'm useless. I can't do anything right either. I'm going to commit suicide. I don't care anymore
