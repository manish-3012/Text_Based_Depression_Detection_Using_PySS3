Had to Attempt Suicide to Get in to See a PsychiatristBeen depressed my whole life. Since graduating college 4 years ago itâ€™s just gotten worse and Iâ€™ve been suicidal for about two years now. 

Iâ€™ve called countless psychiatrists in my area over the last year. Never got in. My general practitioner has prescribed me 8 different meds and they all sucked. Been seeing a therapist for a few years but she canâ€™t prescribe. 

So I tried to kill myself because I just couldnâ€™t take it anymore. Life, I mean. Then I chickened out. Called the psychiatrists office again the following Monday, she asked if Iâ€™d ever made an attempt on my life, I told her yes, she told me to go to the ER, and that she wouldnâ€™t help me until I did. 

Spent 6 hours in the ER, where they held me against my will and took away all my possessions. Sat there in an empty room of the psych ward for the entire time not knowing what was going on, (no one told me anything), hearing people screaming around me. I had to go after work, so I hadnâ€™t eaten in about 12 hours. They took 7 vials of blood and I almost passed out from dehydration and low blood sugar. 

Finally I was surveyed, and determined to be stable. They told me to leave, offered no help, no explanation, nothing. 

The next day the office finally let me set up an appointment. They were baffled that the ER didnâ€™t help me. 

When I went to my appointment, the doctor accused me of lying to the ER, because â€œthere was no way they should have let me go.â€ Then she told me that she couldnâ€™t do much, and if I was really suicidal, I should be locked in a ward, because they have drugs that work immediately, and anything she could prescribe me would take months to start working. Then she told me to get more exercise, eat more fruits and vegetables, and try one of the drugs Iâ€™d already tried again. 

My fiancÃ© is blown away by the incompetence of the system at this point, but Iâ€™m just tired. 

The system is broken, but I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s much anyone can do for me. 

Iâ€™m thinking of killing myself tonight after work. Donâ€™t know if I can actually do it, but it feels kind of good to fantasize about it.
