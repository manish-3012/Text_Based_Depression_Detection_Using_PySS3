I feel so empty..I'm just so empty. There's just so much going on and the only person i felt comfortable enough talking isn't on the best of terms with me. She was kind of the glue holding me together and now I don't really know what to do. I lost my grandfather in December, right before Christmas. My grandmother isn't gonna be living that much longer either, so I won't have grandparents at all anymore. The deaths on that side of the family is tearing us all apart. And on the other side is just as fun. My job is working for that side, for my uncle. He is one of the biggest assholes I've ever met. All he does is criticize everything i do and scream at me. I'm in my freshman year of college and its so rough. I'm studying for software engineering and i have no idea how calculus works. I'm so terrified i'm going to fail this class. And i dont even know if i even want to be in this type of career field, but I need to choose now because i would need to change schools in the fall if i continue with software engineering. I dont know what my dream is anymore and im so so so scared that my future is gonna break and i'll be a failure. I feel like all i do is fail. I can't talk to my parents about this because their judgmental about mental health and therefore i can't ask for professional help. I struggle with a few personal issues that i'd rather not talk about to anyone. I just dont and cant care anymore. I dont. I drive recklessly as hell because i just dont care about anything. I dont know if im actively suicidal but if i died then cool. I just want some type of help and stability. I want my glue back too but i dont see that happening.
