Whatâ€™s the point?What is the point of continuing to survive if you donâ€™t see life going anywhere. I had ideas for the future, but they no longer seem reachable. And by reachable I mean like thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™ll live that long to achieve them. Just in my mind their all blurry, because I know inside that I wonâ€™t last that long. 

I have no more motivation from anyone or anything. Life is just a burden, and Iâ€™m just waiting for an accident to happen. 

My mental state is going crazy, Iâ€™m too young to get help, but my parents donâ€™t care.

I had a therapist, but I realized that they are not what I need.

Iâ€™m too much of a cowardly introvert to seek help without the knowledge of my parents.

It seems like this is it for me, because life has just stopped. 

I have now gotten memory loss so I donâ€™t remember anything from my past. And a wall in my brain prevents me from imagining my future. 

Iâ€™m just stuck in a limbo.

What is the point?
