I physically cannot commit suicideI tried to commit suicide, but I couldnâ€™t. I grabbed the biggest knife in the house and took it upstairs. The entire way there, my kitten was more affectionate than ever. When I tried to stab myself in the heart, I couldnâ€™t. Maybe itâ€™s because Iâ€™m weak. Maybe knives are harder to use than I thought they were. It only left a little scar. I tried to dig into the scar with the knife, but no matter how hard I tried I couldnâ€™t get deep enough. I tried my throat, but I couldnâ€™t cut my throat either, and if I tried too hard it would leave a red mark and my parents would see it. So I eventually gave up and played with my kitten instead. It was pretty stupid of me to try to commit suicide before Halloween, anyways, if I did my costume wouldâ€™ve gone to waste. But I donâ€™t have access to any guns or rope, so I donâ€™t think I really can commit suicide now. Unless I could jump from a high place. The only place I can think of is in my house, itâ€™s kinda hard to describe, but Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s high enough to kill me. I donâ€™t wanna risk getting hurt without dying. I wanna die to end the pain. I donâ€™t know what to do now.
