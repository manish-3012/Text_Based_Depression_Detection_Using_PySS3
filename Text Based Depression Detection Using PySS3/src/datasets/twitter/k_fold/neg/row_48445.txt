I can't feel anything anymore... I want to die but I can't ;_; I don't know what to do...Hey SW... I heard about you a while back and have been wondering if I should post.. I'm at a really low point tonight so... I'm kinda desperate... 

Mostly... I have a really hard time making friends.. I've been betrayed a lot in my life and I dont get along with others socially very well... I am very approachable and friendly but its just acting... I had some horrible things happen to me in highschool and it deeply scarred me... I can't feel emotion anymore other than sadness, extreme anger that I keep under wraps 99% of the time, or this weird empty or numb feeling... When I finally got over my problems from highschool enough to go to college I finally was able to make some great friends through my best friend...(another redditor) but I was kicked out for violating my schools attendance policy by being sick for abut a month... Now I live by myself in another city at least an hour away from any of my friends and I've lost all meaning to life... If it wasnt for the promise I made to my best friend that I wouldnt hurt myself I'd probably be dead already... 

I dont know what to do... ;_; I've been so alone in my life and after being truly happy last semester, finally having someone really close and special to be with all the time... It just makes me feel so much worse now that I'm alone again...

I'm sorry if my sentences are incoherent.... I'm not in the best state right now as you can imagine...
