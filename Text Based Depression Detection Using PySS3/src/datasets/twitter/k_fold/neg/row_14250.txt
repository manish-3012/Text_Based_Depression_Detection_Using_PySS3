I've set a dateThe day after my 30th birthday, almost 4 months away. I've planned a trip abroad with friends before then. I'm starting a new, better job. I'm going to be meeting with a therapist soon. In other words, I have given myself every opportunity to change my mind between now and then.

I don't know why I'm posting here. I guess I just wanted to tell my story. You can't really talk about suicide with most people, you know? It weirds them out. I have enough trouble keeping friends without that baggage.

So, here goes. I am estranged from my parents. They are not awful people or even awful parents by most standards, but they made me deeply unhappy growing up and I decided to remove them from my life years ago.

I am alone. I have friendships, but they are superficial. I have had long-term girlfriends, but they never worked out. I have been in love once, and it ended badly.

I have spontaneously developed chronic medical issues over the past year. My body is starting to break down.

I spent the last decade trying to improve myself. I made progress, but it has become increasingly clear that my best self just isn't all that great.

I'm not depressed. I don't have any of the symptoms. I'm just unhappy with who I am and I can't be fixed. I'm not likely to ever have the life I want. I gave it a real honest shot, but I'm tired. And I want to be done with it.

So, one day after my 30th birthday, I am going to kill myself. It's been a long, long time coming, delayed by years of hope. But I think I'm finally ready to go.

Thanks for reading.
