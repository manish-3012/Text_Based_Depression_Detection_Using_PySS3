everything seems to be in place for me to get better but I feel I should kill myself anywaymy mom wants me to go commit myself so some fucks can teach me how to live. a friend offers to help me get smart for ged testing. and almost all of my quality of life is improving.

but my mind keeps getting worse. i had two reasons to be happy today and the moment they were gone I felt death. Whether its stepping in front of a truck or off a building I really need to do this

I'm not on antidepressents but I dont think those would help, all the brands i took never did. It seems like its just something the universe wills. strange compulsions drive me, i guess even my soul judges me worthless------------

i dont know if im posting for advice or to rant. just fuck me alright?

 laughing gas is expensive 

but ive found a song i want to listen 

to when i go and you cant do that 

falling from a phone tower
