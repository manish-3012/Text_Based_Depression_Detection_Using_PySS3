Ugly argument with toxic Indian parents. Contemplated suicide.I can't believe I'm posting here. I joined this to keep an eye out and message people with support. Had a very big argument with parents (if you wish to know more, check my profile for post in r/toxicparents). I was so frustrated and riled up. I contemplated ending my life. I ran the whole scenario in my head, the execution, informing my friends, I have two pets stuck in another city with friends and how I will deal with them. Everything. I even thought of running away but with the very strict lockdown in my country, I wouldn't reach the other city (where I live and work). Can't even execute that. Parents are being so unreasonable that they are not trying to understand me, just stuck with how-dare-you-talk-back-no-shame-no-respect-for-parents thing that Indian parents have. I don't know what to do. I'm not saying I'll do it but the thought of being like this for.another month or two will drive me.over the edge.
