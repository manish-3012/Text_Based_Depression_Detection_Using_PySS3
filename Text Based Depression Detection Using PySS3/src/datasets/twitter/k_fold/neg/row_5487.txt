I donâ€™t have reasons to liveUltimately, my dumb ass ended up being happier than usual, because an old friend just came back to me. Before she arrived, I was feeling worse, and I canâ€™t be her friend anymore because she just distracts me of my purpose. I donâ€™t have reasons to live and she makes me think that I have them, and everyday y say to myself â€œwhat are you doing?â€, but I donâ€™t even have a way to do it.
