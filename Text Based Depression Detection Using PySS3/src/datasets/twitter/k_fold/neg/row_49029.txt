Change My LifeHi. I am 27 years old. I have been contemplating suicide for a really long time. For many, many years. I want to end my life. But I don't necessarily want to kill myself. I don't really want an advice. I don't want people to tell me that life has a lot to offer. I already know that. What I need is someone to change my life. I don't have the strength, or the motivation, or the money to do it. So, as a last resort before killing myself I guess, I am asking you. Do something to change my life. Marry me, adopt me, give me a job, give me a place, anything. I need someone to change my life. This is the first and the last time that I am publicly accepting that I am this weak. Please do something.
