I fckd upI have a possessive gf whom i dont love, she had suicide tendencies, I tried breaking up with her 3 times, and 3 times she tried to suicide because she said she cant live without me. So i was forced into a relationship that i dont want to for the past 2 years. In that time, no matter how hard i try to love her back, i just cant. The trauma i got from my previous relationship is just too severe that i think I'm dead inside and i cant fully love someone ever again.

And now i really did fckd up, got her pregnant. In a place where married by accident is a taboo thing, i just did that. To make matter worse, we have different religion, me myself are not a religious person. Thats one of the reason i still have the energy to be at her side. But not our family, which is kind of a fanatic. And again, we live in a country drunk on religion. I just did 2 of "kind of seven deadly sins" in my country. Oh, and i currently unemployed because of this flippin covid. I fckd up, big time.

I'm just tired of it, tired of living with all these never ending problems. I'm a coward, and a really bad person, i know. I'm a blacksheep of my family, I'm a bad bf for my gf who love me dearly, a useless friend, and for my unborn child, I'm a very terrible father. I just want to end it all. For once, i want to ignore all the feelings and opinion of everybody, and be egoistic just for myself, just for once.

Already book a hotel room for tomorrow for 2 nights, bought a lot of pesticides. I'm ready.

Thank you, for whoever reading this.
