"Romantic relationships aren't that important!" then why do I want to die when I know there's nobody for me.Whenever I see posts from other suicidal people &amp; I see things like "I'm alone-- but at least have my loving wife" I just feel shittier because lmaoo I wish I had a bf/gf. Guess I'm actually unlikeable! 


I'm a bisexual woman but heavily lean towards other women. It's been absolutely impossible for me to date. Isnt it pathetic for me to be mid 20s and only have dated ONCE as a KID? I've now accepted I'm doomed to be alone. I WILL die alone. Why not just kill myself already?

Sometimes if I'm lucky I can make "friends", but I can't seem to connect with anyone so they end up being mere acquitances. I can't seem to find anyone I relate to. Going to lots of vegan meetups &amp; I don't connect with anyone. I can't find much more in common with fellow weebs. I'm so out of place being an atheist with all of my close friends being believers. I feel like such an alien weirdo. I don't fit in. I won't be missed when I die except for a couple of people because I just dont have any friends.My social skills are shit, it's embarrassing. I'm traumatized from childhood abuse. Maybe I'm just ugly and stupid. Theres nobody for me and I'm just jealous of people who date.

I just wanted to find someone who would like me, so we could travel to foreign countries together, live in a nice house with rescue cows, fall asleep cuddling laughing looking at the stars-- all of that sappy shit. But none of that was made for me. I'll just die alone puking pills or something. Bummer! God this is so humiliating, the fact that even this will go unread. kill me.

I hope anyone who's reading this is having a better day than me.
