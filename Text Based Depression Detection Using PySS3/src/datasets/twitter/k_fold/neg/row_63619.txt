I don't want to feel this way.I just want to get my meds straightened out and be happy. I don't want to feel sad, worthless, or like life is pointless. I want to enjoy life again and feel like others love me. 

I just need someone to tell me that it'll all get straightened out and I'll be happy again. I really need some one to reassure me because it all feels so bleak. I'm sorry.
