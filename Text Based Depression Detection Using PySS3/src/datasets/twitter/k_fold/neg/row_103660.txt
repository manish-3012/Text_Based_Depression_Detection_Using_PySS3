The light is not always visible, but itâ€™s always thereTwo years ago I posted to this group about my plans to kill myself after having a year sober. Well, I didnâ€™t go through with my plans because of the tiniest sense of hope. It was barely there, but the slim chance of things getting better was enough to keep me holding on. Now I am over three years sober, and in six months I will be marrying my best friend and soulmate. The whole first year of struggling, I was hell bent on swimming upstream, against the current. It wasnâ€™t until I let go that things improved. I always tried to force life to go the way I wanted it too. I had to let go of the control and allow life to happen for me and not against me. Things became exponentially better once I relinquished control. I had to be open minded and willing to let my life unfold the way it was supposed to and not the way I wanted it to. Just because you cannot see the light does not mean itâ€™s not there â™¥ï¸
