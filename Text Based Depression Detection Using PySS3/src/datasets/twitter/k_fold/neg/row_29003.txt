No going backEarlier today I had a breakdown and I was sitting with a clip and my gun on the toilet and I knew if I put the clip in then there was no going back and I would kill myself

I didn't do it

Now I'm drunk and getting drunker and I don't know what to do,because I can just go down the hallway and kill myself and I realizedthat I really would today

The person I love has barely spoken to me for a week and he won't explain and I keep having withdrawals (I was addicted to painkillers for two years) and I had one really good year but depression comes back and if it's gonna get bad again I'm not going to be able to do this I just want to hurt myself now and it's a hard choice but I keep getting closer to convincing myself to kill myself

Not even my parents' feelings, and I love them, could deter me. It's just up to me.
