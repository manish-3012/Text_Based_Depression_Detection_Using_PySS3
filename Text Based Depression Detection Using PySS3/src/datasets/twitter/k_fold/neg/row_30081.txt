Can't get out of my head. The anxiety and paranoia are making me physically sick. Ready to head out.Quit my job.  Today was my last day with my therapist.  Can't hold any type of relationship to save my life.  Try to keep my emotions to myself but they usually build up to a point where I'll just yell gibberish at someone hoping they can make light of what's wrong with me.  I go visit my brother once a week but he and his friends are getting sick of me because I'm a drunken obnoxious asshole.  I don't know how to talk to women.  I usually just try to fuck them, which always ends really bad and cringeworthy.  I have no one I can go to.  And if I did I wouldn't know what to say.  My thoughts make perfect morbid sense but my words seem astronomically insane.
