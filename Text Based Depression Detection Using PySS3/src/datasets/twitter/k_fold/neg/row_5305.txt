WhyLife just seems so fucking meaningless. Iâ€™ve been on a cocktail of antidepressants referred by my doctor and it just seems like nothing has helped. I know the the drug itself isnâ€™t supposed to cure depression (you need to include yourself in social engagements and activity as well obviously). But everything I have tried just doesnâ€™t seem to improve anything, I feel so fucking alone and such a burden to everyone I come in contact with. I really just donâ€™t see how this is all worth it. Iâ€™m sorry
