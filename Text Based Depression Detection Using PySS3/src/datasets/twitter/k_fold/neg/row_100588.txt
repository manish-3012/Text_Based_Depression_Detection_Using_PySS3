Do hotlines or anonymous forums help to overcome depression or unwind for a while?Just wondering if you guys can share your opinion or experience. Personally, I find it hard to confess my feelings to friends, because I'm too afraid to be judged and misunderstood by them. I posted my story here yesterday and surprisingly Im feeling better now. 
Anyway, no interest to live, no balls to kill myself, no motivation, no joy, just emotional devastation. I'm tired. Just a pathetic human being pretending to be all right. 

If you die youâ€™re completely happy and your soul somewhere lives on. Iâ€™m not afraid of dying. Total peace after death, becoming someone else is the best hope Iâ€™ve got.
