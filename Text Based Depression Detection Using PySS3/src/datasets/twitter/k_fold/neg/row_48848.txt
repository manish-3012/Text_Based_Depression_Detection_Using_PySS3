Do any of you have a 'plan?'I mean, a plan for if you're going to do yourself in or not. We all go through phases that seems endless and pretty much cycle the thought of 'what's the point?' It gets so old, that for the slightly less bolder people, they wait on the idea of suicide, instead of physically acting on it. 

Do any of you plan to do it? Like, "If life doesn't get better in a year, I'll kill myself" sort of deal?

I've given myself until I'm 25. I'm 22. If nothing really changes, then  I don't think there's much a point keeping such a shitty outlook that not only affects me but people around. I don't know if I'll stick to it, but at the moment, I've been pretty cemented for a long time now.
