I don't know why I keep goingLife hasn't been good for a long time no, my hope that it will get better has been slowly going away. I don't know what to do with my life, thr pressure of college and having to become an adult is too much. It seems like everyone around me has a better life than mine. I don't even know what it feels like to bs loved, and ive given up hope that i even will. This new year will be the same, and I'm probably gonna end it before 2019.
