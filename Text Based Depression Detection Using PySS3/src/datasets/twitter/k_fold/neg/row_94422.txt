I just fail peopleI can't even do this anymore.  People ask a lot of me and I don't know if I can pull it off and I just overcommit in the moment and then fail out from fear.  This just doesn't stop.  If I can't even pull myself together enough then I really don't deserve anyone.  I don't want to go through another 20 years of this shit.  Walking around at night completely alone knowing I always will be.  Other people get to change their minds.  Other people get to have weaknesses.  Not me.  I'm barely worth it as it is, if I can't perform then what's the fucking point of me.  Last of my family dies I'm eating a bullet.  I'm normally scared of that too but I don't deserve painless.
