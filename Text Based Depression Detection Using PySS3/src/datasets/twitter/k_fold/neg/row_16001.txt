Maybe it sounds sillyI'm having a rough time, lots of heath issues, some craziness at work and some other things. I'm so fed up and exhausted. I'm also not feeling great about myself. 

But the thing that's really pushing me to my limits is that with all of that I can't even have a pet. I always love having a pet, but because of the landlord's rules and my partner's allergies I can't get one. I know you shouldn't hang all your hopes on one thing, but I really feel like a pet would make me feel at least a little better and so I feel like it's pushing me over the edge. I know that must sound silly, but maybe someone else can relate
