I don't know what to do.I have had long periods of time in my life where I feel immense sadness, and recently it's gotten worse. I have been going through a period where I often consider ending the pain and I can't figure out why. I've had no reason to be sad in any of this periods in my life, but especially now. I never thought of myself as depressed but now I don't know. I'm considering telling my sister, who I have a very close relationship with but I always convince myself that it's all in my head and she wouldn't believe me. I mainly made this post to get an opinion on if it's in my head or not.
