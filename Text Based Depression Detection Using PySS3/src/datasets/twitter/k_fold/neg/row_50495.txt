quaratine suicidal thoughtsthis pandemic has really been taking a toll on my mental health. it just makes me not want to be here anymore. not because im afraid of getting it and dying, but just the societal effects of it all and how nothing will ever be the same. thattt is really getting to me. i guess i should talk to my friends but i literally cant do this shit anymore. i dont want to end my life personally, but if something happened to me and i left this earth i wouldnt be mad. i also dont know if this is just me being dramatic but ive felt this way since january in general so yeah. any advice would be cool thanks
