Came home from a voluntary hospital stay still feel strong s/iI don't know what to do, I have a really strong urge to end my life which I'm struggling to distract myself from. Tried to strangle myself this morning but it was too uncomfortable. I know my new meds might be increasing my urges in this way but dont know what to do. Scared, guilty and feeling like stupid a burden.
