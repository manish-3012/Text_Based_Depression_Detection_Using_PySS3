I don't think trying is worth it. For any reason at all.So I've dug myself into yet another hole and I'm convinced it's not going to be worth it to try and get out.

I used to think I was really smart and clever, which exacerbated my extreme cynicism. Now I can only look at the big picture and it makes me so sure this life is just unending struggle without reward. I don't find the struggle fulfilling. Nothing makes me want to meet the challenge. My blip of consciousness is so brief that prolonging my lifespan, and my pain, by not committing suicide seems like the stupid choice. 

Yes, others in my life would experience pain when I died, but grief becomes a part of you, and it's sort of understood that people in your life will die. That's what we all sign up for every day we continue to live. People will find a rationalization that works for them and gradually move on.

The shitty part is the note. Because if I truly explain myself in a note, the people I leave behind will know I think all of their lives are worthless too. Individually, they are. If I had more faith in humanity I would consider sticking around for some things that humanity as a whole can accomplish, but right now it's still the dark ages. If I were brilliant and talented, maybe I could do something about this, but I can't, and neither can anyone I know.

Now how is it that I can justify my selfish behavior and condemn everyone's lives to oblivion? It's all because I'm lazy and disappointed with myself and wishing I was a different species because self-awareness sucks. And disappointed with the whole goddamned world.

I don't know what I expect SW to do with this post, I'm just getting pretty nihilistic I suppose. I'm at this really calm state, it's like double-checking your pockets before you leave the house. Considering my own irrationality, it's likely that no one will be able to convince me of anything that will change my mind. But it would be nice to be wrong, to feel something click inside me that says "if you don't try, things that are actually bad will happen."

And yes, there's all kinds of problems going on in the "small picture" too. I have been depressed/anxious for 16 years, have a history of alcohol abuse, my mother killed herself when I was 10, no parental figure of note after that, in deep debt, worthless college degree, no job, completely entirely broke except for pocket change, about to get kicked out of my place. Just to be clear, I've had suicidal ideation for years, which comes and goes in intensity. 

Thanks for reading. I welcome any insight.

EDIT: I'd really like to hear from anybody with a response within about a day. So that would be before 11PM EST on 1-29-11.
