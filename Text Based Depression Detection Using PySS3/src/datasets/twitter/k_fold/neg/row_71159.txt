I am patheticI post here hoping someone from my life will somehow recognize me from a throwaway account, as if any of them would be here in the first place. Besides, it wouldnâ€™t matter - itâ€™s not new information to anyone that Iâ€™m suicidal. I told Daniel I called the hotline 10 times in the past 2 weeks, and he didnâ€™t care at all. Hey everyone, itâ€™s Chloe. Iâ€™m going to kill myself when I finish the Masterâ€™s program (assuming I make it that long). When school starts and I have insurance again, Iâ€™ll find a way to get back on Lyrica so I can start hoarding pills. Then, on a cold day, Iâ€™ll go out in the woods and go to sleep forever. You all could have done something. It honestly could be as simple as a hug. Or telling me you love me. Or not moving across the country in the middle of a pandemic/serious political turmoil that could separate us forever (looking at you, Mom and Dad). Just tell me that you care, that you love me, that I am good enough not to abandon, not to forget about. Stop forgetting about me. Stop always always forgetting about me. 

Iâ€™m going to kill myself. In part, it will be all of your fault.
