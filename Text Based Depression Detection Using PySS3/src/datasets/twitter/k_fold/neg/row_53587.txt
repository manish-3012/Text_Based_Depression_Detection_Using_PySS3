Didnâ€™t think I would make it this far...Had my first day of senior year yesterday, it could have went better but thatâ€™s besides the point. Iâ€™ve realized that I donâ€™t see a real future for myself. Iâ€™ve never thought about the future because I thought I would be dead by now. Iâ€™ve always had fantasies of what I would like my life to be like but I havenâ€™t thought about actually making it happen. But now I have a chance to make my fantasies a reality and Iâ€™m not sure if I want to take it. Iâ€™m fearful of wasting this opportunity, but I feel that nothing good will come.

Iâ€™m honestly terrified of growing up. Iâ€™m terrified of being an adult. Iâ€™m terrified of living. Itâ€™s only been 1 day and I already had a break down. 

(This probably isnâ€™t the right place to post this, Iâ€™m sorry)
