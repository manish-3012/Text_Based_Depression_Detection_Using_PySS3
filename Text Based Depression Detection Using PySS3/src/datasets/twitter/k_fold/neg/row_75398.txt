Please helpSo I got dumped by the girl I loved a little while ago and it's been hard for me. But this community and my friends have really helped me move on and I'm slowly starting to be okay. I was too dependant on her for my happiness and she abandoned me and basically doesn't care if I live or die whereas I'm still looking out for her and making sure my friends aren't judgemental of her. Anyway I just need to vent my emotions out here because if I don't I end up bringing the negativity into my normal life and that effects the people around me. I used to think I could just find one "true love" and she was my girl. And then she broke my heart and I honestly don't believe in love anymore. I believe that humans need some form of romantic relationship because having a person is important but I don't think I could love so deeply again. Because with putting myself on the line I got hurt beyond the point of repair. The stats show that men commit suicide more than woman due to loss of love and I'm scared one day I'm going to become another statistic. I loved and now my heart feels cold and my brain feels calculated. Life had lost its shine. I only had that thing... happiness for the duration of our relationship but... maybe it is just not for me to feel. I feel tight in my throat and damp in my eyes constantly. I miss my ex so much because I had planned to grow old with her. She was the one. I'm so alone and so scared.
