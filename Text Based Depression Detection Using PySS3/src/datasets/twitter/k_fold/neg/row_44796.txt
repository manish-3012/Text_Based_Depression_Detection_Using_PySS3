I still want toI had enough of being an empty shell and not feeling anything a while back and decided to end it. I put a gun in my mouth and it jammed. I just sat there for a while thinking, maybe it jammed for a reason. Itâ€™s been 2 years now and I still want to do it and any time I think of why I shouldnâ€™t I know everyone would just be better off without me. The only reason I havenâ€™t yet is so my little brother doesnâ€™t see and think itâ€™s okay. When heâ€™s gone away wherever idk if I can keep it up.
