It would be so simpleJust a push of a button, really, if I use my method of choice. Even if that doesn't work, I have 5 back-up plans.

I'm trying to hold on a little longer. I'm supposed to get antidepressants soon, and incorporating Stoicism into my daily life helps a bit. But I don't know how much longer I can do this.

I posted here before, a while ago. Since then I've almost killed myself but was stopped by someone ruining my plan (if it isn't done pretty much perfectly, an ambulance might be called before I could die--possibly leading to a coma or brain damage or something else other than the desired result), sought out help for myself, and stayed in the ER for a few hours. I've been turned away by some therapists, but I contacted another one and hopefully he gets back to me while I'm still here.

I can't imagine that I'll be able to hang on for much longer than a few more days, maximum.

I don't have anyone that would care if I told them. I just needed to get this off my chest.
