I just attemptedI just attempted minutes ago. I tried hanging my self in my garage with a cord, I stepped off the chair and blacked out I felt my body fighting and it woke me up. I managed to pull it off because I had chairs around me incase i wanted to not go through with it. My neck hurts so bad I'm crying. I don't want to live but that was horrifying. I can't believe I almost did it
