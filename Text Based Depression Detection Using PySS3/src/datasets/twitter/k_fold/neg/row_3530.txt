I already feel dead and lifelessEveryday I wake I do the same shit day in and day out and feel like a zombie, lifeless and as dead as can be.

When I go past my local graveyard I picture my headstone being there with my name on saying 2001-2019.

I just want things to get better I don't want to end up in there but I don't see a solution to it all.
