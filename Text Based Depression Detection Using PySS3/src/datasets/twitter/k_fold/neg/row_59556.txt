What if I just stopped going to work?Work is slowly killing me. I call in sick at least once a month just to have a chance to "recover" but it's not enough anymore. I can't take a full-time schedule. But I fucking have to. I'm living paycheck to paycheck. I can't escape from the cycle. I'm stuck in a loop. There is no other choice but to work and to hate it. There is no other option. I can't escape. 

All of my coworkers look at me funny. They are constantly thinking things about me and not telling me what they are. A brief glance with a slight frown. What the fuck are they thinking about?? Why don't they just talk to me??

I cry for help with my eyes, but they don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Or what to say. Even the conversations we have are pointless. There are no connections made. No meaningful relationships. Nothing is good enough to ease the pain.

My parents have abandoned me. They don't know what to do with my emotions anymore. Mom said that I have "exhausted" her with my problems. Dad's never been one to talk with me. My sister is the only person who I feel truly comfortable with right now, but she lives far away. She doesn't understand how much I want to die. I've never told her. It's too painful. I would add to everyone else's pain. They would be mortified. 

Is there somebody who can help me?
