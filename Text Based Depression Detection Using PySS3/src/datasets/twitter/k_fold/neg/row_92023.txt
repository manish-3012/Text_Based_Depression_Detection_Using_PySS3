i just wanted to be lovedi really don't understand relationships, friendships anything. ive yearned for the feeling of someone to just care about me for once. it feels like everything i do is meaningless. i have no one i can rely on, no one to cry to. ive heard people saying that things get better, and that you'll regret it. but i regret not killing myself. i hate existing and experiencing all these emotions. its come to the point where id rather be crying than smiling. i found comfort in the very thing destroying me internally. i want it to end. im so much of a fucking coward. i cant do anything. im so fucking tired of everything. i just want to sleep.
