I dont even know what im expecting from thisI dont even know what to say other than my life sucks and i dont want to continue it. Im only 18 but ive had a pretty fucked up life. My abusive father left when i was 6 and has been replaced by an abusive stepfather who 'left' but still shows up fairly often. My mother is abusive, just not physically, like thats better though. I finished school with pretty mediocre marks and dont have a job. Pretty much my entire family is unemployed and a bunch of drug addicts, but i havnt touched the stuff myself. Really the only thing stopping me at this point is my small circle of friends. I really couldnt give a shit how it would make my family feel but i cant imagine having to force my friends, who have been through similar issues, to have to deal with me as well. But its really getting harder and harder to use that as an excuse. I dont want to but i feel like i should
