I fantasize about slitting my wrists with my boxcutter at workI think about it or slitting my own throat constantly. Just how nice it'd be to be dead finally. To stop this errant swinging between agonizing pain and paralyzing numbness. Nothing helps anymore. Not drugs or naps or new video games. Nothing fucking matters. Nothing distracts me. I'm just trapped in this prison made up of rotting flesh. I want my consciousness to cease. I NEED to escape. I'm so fucking tired of being miserable. I'm double tired of living so other people won't be sad.
