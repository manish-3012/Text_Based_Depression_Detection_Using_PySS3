BAMAnd all of those angry emotions come out like a whirlwind, all at once. I wish it was indifference instead..

I don't want to see you ever again. I cannot deal with the sadness you put me through. Where were you as a friend when I needed you most? Where were you as a boyfriend when I needed you most? 

You disappeared. You took my heart and smashed it into a tiny billion pieces. So hard that I was taken advantage of by others when I was down in the gutter. You hurt me, and it's a hurt that I could never forgive. 

I don't remember anything good about us. It was all a fabrication, a fling, to you. I fell for it, but I will never ever fall for it again. Have a nice ego trip.

I'm not suicidal, I am better than that because there is so much rage thanks to you and those selfish conceited idiots.

I'm just waiting for that day. That day when you can all kiss my ass. Then can I die happy.
