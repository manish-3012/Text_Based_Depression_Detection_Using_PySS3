I've backed myself into a corner.I have double depression: major depressive disorder and pervasive depressive disorder. I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember and suicidality since age twelve. I also have generalized anxiety disorder, which began at eighteen. The anxiety is pretty well controlled on medication. 

The depression is treatment resistant. I've been on over two dozen medications. Either they haven't worked or there have been side effects. Recently, I was put on Prozac, which made me vomit daily. I stopped taking it, but two weeks later, I'm still vomiting every day. 

I'm in college, in a pretty tough program. I hear from my first choice of graduate schools on March 15th. If I don't get in, I'm going to kill myself. It's not a threat, just a fact. I'm not telling anyone or being manipulative about it; it's just that if I can't get in, my life is over. 

But now. I'm in my last semester of undergraduate school and I'm tanking hard. I kept a 3.92 up until now. This semester I'll be lucky if I get Cs. I can't focus. I have no motivation. I don't care until the last moment, then I panic. 

Case in point: I have a big essay due Thursday. APA style, sources, synthesis of ideas, the whole shebang.

I haven't started it. 

It's my own fault, I know. I hate myself for it. I don't know if I can finish in time. It probably won't be any good even if I can. 

So I'm thinking - I'm suicidal anyway. Why not take this opportunity? I'm depressed anyway, who's to say I need a big event to push me over? 

The problem is that I haven't prepared. I don't have much in my apartment that could kill me, especially not reliably. The windows don't even open. 

I was going to kill myself to avoid my problems, and now I can't even do that. I literally have no options.
