College student troublesI attempted over the past summer unsuccessfully and out of no where. Since then I've reanalyzed every relationship I have with other people, and now I feel lonely. My self confidence has dropped and I stopped doing things that made me happy (e.g. Working out). I commute 8 hrs a week accumulatively to my internship but I still don't feel successful. I'm really scared that these thoughts will drive me down the wrong path. Any advice?
