Thanksgiving always makes me suicidal. Today is especially bad.I'm 25, turn 26 in exactly 30 days. I have zero real life friends anymore and feel slightly suicidal every day. I recently got my own apartment and spend 99.9% of my time alone. It's maddening. I am an introvert by nature but my introversion has morphed into bitterness, seething jealousy towards others, and generalized hatred of the world. I am a diagnosed massive depressive with GAD. I don't know if my medicine even works anymore.

Anyway, today is Thanksgiving, and all of my family are 300 miles away. I was offered a ride down, but knowing I would have to stay longer I declined and said I would take my own car. Well, my car is in no condition to go that far, so I changed my mind. Now I'm just feeling empty. I haven't heard anything from my family so they probably still think I'm coming. It's always super awkward but I wish I was there. I'm thinking about going to Green Top to look at handguns, maybe go for a run and decide what I'm going to do. Thanks for reading this.
