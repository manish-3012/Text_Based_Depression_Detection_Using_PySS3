I don't know how to deal with it anymoreHi, I'm 18 years old, living in a third world country and severely depressed. I've tried to kill myself twice but it didn't work.Now I'm being pressured to go to college by my parents and also my old psychiatrist. Really I don't get it, I've almost been hospitalized, my mom was the one cleaning up after me when I tried commiting suicide and yet when I ask my father to go see a new psychiatrist he tries to send me to college. So am I ill or not?Does anybody take me seriously when I say that I want to die? How many times did I threaten to kill myself? Right now I'm taking a certain medication that I could easily OD with. The temptation is real I must admit. Being depressed makes you feel hopeless but what if the situation really is hopeless? I'm afraid that I might try it again, I don't know how to communicate with the people around me and honestly I'm exhausted. If you were in this situation what would you do.(Sorry, too long, thx for reading)
