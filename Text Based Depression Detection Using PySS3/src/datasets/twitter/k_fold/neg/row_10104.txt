Im sorry.I torture myself all the time physically and mentally. I hate myself. Im already depressed as it and i make it worse. My Ex and i broke up a while back and i still have feelings for her. Everytime i talk to her i get short term happyness follwed by a crushing sence of dread. And i force myself to talk to her because i cant let her go. Even before her i just make myself sad because i feel like i deserve it. I dont know what to do all my friends are caught up in their own lives and i dont want to drag them down. I feel like i dont deserve postong on here because my feelings arnt valid. So im sorry
