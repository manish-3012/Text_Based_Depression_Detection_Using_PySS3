I found out today that the love of my life is dead... but itâ€™s not what you think...2 years ago I met the most amazing person ever. Funny... talented.... and just so adventurous... we had a lot in common and so obviously we got things off pretty fast... it didnâ€™t take long for us to become best friends and eventually more then friends... we where inseparable... skipping a lot of details about a year later she just ghosted next completely... it didnâ€™t make any sense? Sure we had ups and downs but it just seemed out of character completely for her... itâ€™s been a year since then and... you know what never mind. I donâ€™t feel like sharing. Iâ€™ll probably just get judged anyway.
