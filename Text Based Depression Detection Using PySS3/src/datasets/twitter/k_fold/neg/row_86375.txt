Just donâ€™t know howHello all, Iâ€™m new to the thread and this is my first post. 

Iâ€™ve been severely depressed for almost 10 years now. Went through the phases where you donâ€™t think about it as much but you know itâ€™s still there, but now Iâ€™m not getting lucky to have another phase start. 

Out of the thousands of times Iâ€™ve thought about dying, I couldnâ€™t never find a suitable way. I have a deep fear of knives and blood, which is apparently stronger than my desire to die. I live in Canada so Iâ€™m gun free, which is I think how Iâ€™d like to go. Thought about the ropes and everything but I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anywhere in my apartment thatâ€™s high enough. ETC

I frequently get upset with myself for not being able to make up my mind and get to it. 

In general, from one human to another, Iâ€™m scared, Iâ€™m anxious, Iâ€™m uncomfortable, and Iâ€™m tired of feeling the same nothingness day in and day out, every second of everyday, the same bland and miserable feeling. Iâ€™m just tired. 

Thanks for reading
