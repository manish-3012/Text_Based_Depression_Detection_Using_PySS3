I'm an entitled man-child, I literally don't have any issues, I just don't want to fucking work and exist anymoreI literally have no issues, aside from being a little lonely and feeling misunderstood. I constantly seek attention online under different accounts, but never actually get help for some stupid reason. I guess part of it is that I have literally no trauma, parents that help me financially so that I don't have to worry about that kinda stuff, parents who are also always there for me. I got to live a sort of lifestyle where I could do nothing but play video games all day and now that I'm faced with the reality of working a job I'm breaking down and wanting to kill myself. 

Man, I keep writing on this post, then stopping because I get distracted, before returning. I'm drunk as fuck right, so sorry if this seems messy. Right now, I just really want attention and I don't want to slave away in some shitty job I hate for the next 50 years. 

I don't know man, I just want to be held by someone who understands me, and I want to be showered with affection constantly. I'm sorry if this is attention whorish, but it's true. I'm think about slitting my wrists in some half-hearted attempt to get attention, but I have to keep functioning because I don't want to disappoint my parents even harder
