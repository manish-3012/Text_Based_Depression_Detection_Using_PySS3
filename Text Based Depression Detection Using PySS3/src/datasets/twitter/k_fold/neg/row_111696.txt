Would you leave enough for your partner to die too?When I go, I'd feel bad not leaving a way for my partner to go. I've been suicidal for 20 years and it's been very hard finding a method, and I hate the idea of leaving her to suffer in this world. But I'd then be responsible for homicide or even murder. And maybe she wouldn't want to die and it would enable her to do something she didn't really want to do.
