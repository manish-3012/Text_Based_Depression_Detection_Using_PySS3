Hey..I don't think of myself as suicidal, but I often think about what it would be like to do so.  I sometimes imagine how easy it would be to shoot myself if I had a gun handy.  I always follow up with "nah, that isn't something I would ever do." But sometimes when I'm down on myself I am glad I don't have a gun around because I'm afraid that if I did I might hurt myself.  This thought is the one thing that has ever kept me from purchasing a gun or asking my parents for my guns.  Why do I feel this way?

edit: This has recently started moving into my mind that it doesn't have to  be a gun, there are other ways I could quickly end it.  I don't want to die, but I always have ti at the back of my mind.  I hate to be making this post...I just want to fint a reason why I'm making it.
