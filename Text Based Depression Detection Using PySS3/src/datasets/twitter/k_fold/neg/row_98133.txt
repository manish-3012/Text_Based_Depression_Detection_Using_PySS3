Well here I am again.A year ago, I hit rock bottom over a bad relationship. Sitting in the ER.. i thought I learned, i thought it got better. Now, as I realize I'm slowly blowing off my chances with a girl who is actually worth it, I give up. I know it won't happen, I can already see myself falling further away. I'm losing touch with reality. 

Detached isn't a strong enough word to describe the feeling. I'm just....gone. The present is a struggle most times, the future is looking hopeless, and I wish I could change the past. So bad.Â 

I've been fucking up so many times, I don't even want to think about it...it's like all my attempts to make things better only make it worse. I used to be proud of who I am, now I'm not even aware of who I am. It's beyond pathetic, that this isÂ who I turned into.

My family and friends are so caring..but none of this affects me anymore. I have no one left to turn to, and I don't want professional help. Did it before anyways and it really was pointless. No one actually cares. Saying farewell is starting to seemÂ appealing for some strange 

I haven't been eating at all, and sleep is becoming challenging. Not to mention my dreams torture me.Â 

Tonight as I lie awake, I know my emptiness will expand...I think my time to go is soon

I further apologize for wasting your time
