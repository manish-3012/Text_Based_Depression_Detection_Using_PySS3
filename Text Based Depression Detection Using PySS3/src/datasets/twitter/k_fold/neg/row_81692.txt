I'm lonely and want to dieIdk if this the right place to post this.
 I want to die.  21 and I recently got committed and  got put on meds for my depression. Got released a while ago  The thing is I don't want to live and I don't feel like anything is going to change that. There is one person in my life who I think would care but she has her own stuff to deal with. I feel at this point I'm worthless and no one will love me I've never had a person who I can givey everything. Recently I've started to wake up crying because of dreams I'm having. The only thing I want at this point is a beautiful lady  to call but I don't think any one will ever love me
