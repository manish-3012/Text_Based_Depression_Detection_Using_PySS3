I think suicide is the best option for meI know that many of you will try to talk me out of doing this. But I feel as if living will only cause me more and more pain each and every day of my life, Iâ€™ve tried everything from counselling to pills to try and help but nothing does, absolutely nothing. I always got told â€œdonâ€™t do it,things will get betterâ€ but it never has gotten better. Iâ€™ve written my suicide note and i broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years(I got with her when I was 12)to spare her less pain. Iâ€™m failing school, I struggle a lot in school with things most people find basic and easy so i wonâ€™t have a good job and I wonâ€™t have a high salary so I just think whatâ€™s the point in being in school for longer to end up in a shitty job. Iâ€™m grateful for everything Iâ€™ve been given and for the people who have been in my life but Iâ€™m sorry. I canâ€™t live any longer like this, waking up everyday questioning my life and crying myself to sleep. I just canâ€™t.
