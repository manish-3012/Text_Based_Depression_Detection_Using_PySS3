What does it mean if my parents trigger my suicidal thoughts?Iâ€™ve been in therapy for about a year and they used to be my safe persons to call when I was struggling, then six months later I removed my dad, and now Iâ€™m considering removing my mom from that list and just sticking with friends and other family I really trust.

And Iâ€™m so grateful that Iâ€™ve been learning to manage my depression, but as of recent my relationship with my parents is getting rocky and itâ€™s starting to bring up a lot of old behaviors that I remember them showing when I was a kid. 

They didnâ€™t give me a sense of privacy and would look through my diary and outed me when I was a teen and did not want to come out yet. And they get angry over little things. Last night my little brother was having trouble falling asleep and he was stressed and crying so I put him on my top bunk to calm down and my mom found him and put full blame on me for ruining a months worth of progress.

They donâ€™t believe anything I tell them anymore and they make really hurtful comments about how they view my character and my body and thatâ€™s what triggers it the most. I havenâ€™t had any thoughts of suicide for months, until twice this week.

I havenâ€™t even wanted to talk about stuff like this with my therapist because Iâ€™m scared that theyâ€™ll somehow find out and call me crazy and tell me that Iâ€™m making these stories up. Iâ€™m still debating if any of this was ever real or just a figment of overactive imagination, you know?

It hurts my heart bc i have to force myself to remember that Iâ€™m not them and that Iâ€™m not as worthless as they make me feel
