I want to die but I donâ€™t know how to approach and say goodbye to the girl I have feelings for.I canâ€™t do this anymore. I finally decided to give up, Iâ€™m no longer anxious to die. It doesnâ€™t fear me anymore. I dread waking up in the morning. I completely lost my will to live. Iâ€™m a piece of garbage who canâ€™t stand seeing people be happy because my life gets shittier day by day. This world doesnâ€™t need people like me and Iâ€™m doing everyone a favour. My final wish is to get one final glimpse of her beautiful face. I donâ€™t care what people think about her, sheâ€™s beautiful and iâ€™ve always thought she is. Weâ€™ve been looking at each other for 7 years through primary and all the way to middle school. Not a single word we spoke to each other and itâ€™s my fault, she tried to approach me multiple times but I ignored her because I was shy and anxious, she probably hates me now. I once eavesdropped her and it turns out she likes someone else. She lives next block, I donâ€™t know how to approach her, confess everything and say goodbye. She deserves better anyways.
