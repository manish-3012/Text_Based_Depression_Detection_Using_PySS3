Noisy neighbours - at least death would be quietRunning on 3 hours sleep every night (unable to sleep because of constant noise - can't sleep until I'm exhausted and pass out, then the noise wakes me up anyway), exhausted, never a moment of peace, construction work during the day, dsh dsh dsh of bass at night, and screaming from parties. I work part time and study at uni, this is tanking my grades.

Going through formal noise complaint procedures, but they take ages and I'm not convinced it's gonna work anyway. The construction work is completely legal. Can't move out because I'm tied to my contract (although I've asked if the landlord can start looking for another tenant, then maybe I can move somewhere quiet, fingers crossed). I'd appreciate no advice please, I'm doing everything I can (contacting council, contacting my and their landlord, contacting university community liason team, contacting uni asking for mitigating circumstances about grades, contacting mental health services for support), but advice on how to cope is warmly appreciated.

Just wanna die and feel in serious danger of doing it. Death would be quiet and the noise is probably going to permanently fuck up my life (failing uni/getting terrible grades) anyway.
