Just everythingI've been keeping a journal of sorts on my phone notes. Every time I feel sad I add to it and write why. It's not very long because most times I simply just cry and rock back and forth while sobbing because I'm so sad. But there are times when that's not possible so I write. It doesn't help. It's more like a note that I would leave behind. I'll include it here and use '------' to block out any personal info of mine, because having my family angry at me for posting this would push me further to the edge of death. Even though I'm teetering on it. This is nerve wracking to post but since I'm almost finished my time on this planet, I thought I'd let the world understand a little what I'm thinking
---------------------------




-Nobody cares what I have to say, either they interrupt me and start talking halfway through or just say 'hmm...oh so did I tell you what happened today? This guy totally asked for my number!'

-I called myself an accident and the reason mom had to stay stuck with dad, [my youngest brother] said 'haha accident accident accident!' And mom just kind of shrugged 

-Tried making friends with [guy from school] and [guy I used to be friends with]. They now won't talk to me because I'm older and because [younger sister] made them hate her. 

-All the attention goes to the boys and [my younger sister]. Even negative attention. Nobody gives a fuck about [me].

-My own father doesn't give a shit about me. He wasn't even there when I was born. 

-I'm a mooch who has no place on this planet. I don't have a job and I'm currently not a student. 

-I've never kissed a boy. The one time I got close to he told me he didn't like me, but liked one of my friends instead. I've always been the ugly friend. 

-I don't deserve to be alive. I've been walked over and used for my entire life. I have to ask people to be there for me. All my friends have left. 

-The only time I'm not sad is when I'm asleep. 

-Mom keeps saying she wants to move to [another town] to be with [her boyfriend] so she's gonna leave me all alone anyways. Not that she ever cared much in the first place. She hates me because I'm the reason she had to stay with dad. She should have just aborted me. It would have saved us both trouble. 

-Nobody ever asks how I'm doing. How MY day was. How IM feeling. It's all about them. And when I say anything, mom says 'well sorry you're the only person I have to talk to. I have no friends'. Guilt. 

-Mom would have had a much better life if I had never been born. I'm the reason she was stuck with dad. It's probably why she doesn't really care that much about me. 

-All the stories she told me about myself when I was a baby were probably just lies...if I was gone she probably would be relieved...

-I told mom a funny story about the night she was gone at [a Halloween party] and she just kind of laughed a little and then asked if I was going to take the garbage out...That's when I kind of fully realized how little she cares...

-Mom keeps talking about how I'm 'on my way out' of the house, like she's hinting that she wants me gone...

-I feel like I'm such a burden on her, and on everybody. [my youngest brother] despises me when I babysit because I have to tell him what to do. I always get the feeling that I'm an outsider in this family. Dad doesn't care, mom doesn't care, all my siblings make fun of me and my weight...

-[my younger brother] suggested I be a teletubby for Halloween (they have big round stomachs and have a television in their belly) and it just made me feel so ashamed, like that's how they see me, as just a big fat teletubby

-I tried to show [my younger brother] some funny pictures and he just said he had seen them all and that I suck at finding memes and that he's better anyways cuz he has like 500 on his phone already 

-I always listen to what other people say, always, I try to be an active listener and not just listen but ask questions to show I'm interested too, but nobody ever does the same for me. Either they just interrupt me and talk right over me or they walk away and ignore me

-My diploma came in the mail and nobody even cared, not even Mom. She didn't even ask to see what it looked like. I showed everyone while mom was still in the car and they didn't even care. Just 'oh, cool'. 

-I always care what everybody else has to say. Always. Without fail. Whenever [my best friend] or whoever messages me in a 'struggle' I.e. Lonely cuz her boyfriend is out of town, I'm always there. I'm always replying with positive things, always try to make her feel better, I always wait until she ends the conversation. I never 'ghost' anybody. But everybody does to me. 

-How come I do my part to help my friends feel better, but nobody does the same to me? Mom and maddy and whoever can talk for ages about their days and about their love life and troubles and I always listen. 

-Sooner or later I'm just going to stop. Just stop caring about anything. Become a cold hearted bitch, it's easier than trying to share parts of myself that nobody cares about. It's easier than showing emotion and having it blow back up in my face. How embarrassing. Soon I'll just shut down, the old [me]  will be gone forever. 

-I am a background piece in everybody's life. Nobody would actually notice if I was gone. 

-If I died in my room right this second it would be weeks probably before anyone in my house realized I was gone. That's how little they care. Then they would all have a party because I'm finally gone and they finally don't have to deal with my crap all the time 

-All my friends. (The two I actually have) don't care. [guy who says he loves me] doesn't read my messages anymore and [my best friend] flat out ignores mine to change the subject to her and whatever boy toy she's after this time. 

-There is no place for me in this world. No dream career, no passion, no college program

-I do nice things for other people but they never return the favour

-I'm never doing anything right. Either I eat too much or not enough. I sleep too much or not enough. I care too much or not enough. I talk too much or not enough. 

-I have nobody anymore. Lost all my friends when I graduated and now they don't care. My current friends only care about themselves. [guy who says he loves me] hasn't even read my message I sent him weeks ago even though he's been posting and commenting on my stuff. My own mother doesn't even care what I say 

-I said 'oh hey, the new animal crossing game came out on the App Store today!' (Animal crossing pocket camp). She then interrupted me and went on a rant about how we don't have a lot of money and how she can't even afford a turkey for Christmas dinner and how welfare doesn't give her any extra money and how she needs a job and how I need to help her make a resume. Well the game is free and I wasn't even asking for money; she just does this alllllll the time regardless of what I say. It's like whatever issue I have is minimal compared to hers. 

-I keep trying to ask her for advice on finding a college program but she interrupts me and talks about [her boyfriend] or how much she wants a [puppy] or whatever

-I have absolutely no support system and not a single soul to talk to, I'm left feeling like I have no parents cuz my dad is out and now my mom basically doesn't give a crap about me 

-Everyday I scroll through my messenger app and see all the people who used to be my friends, who say 'oh we will talk later' and never message me, or all the conversations that haven't even been opened by them. 

-I'm beginning to lose hope in life and I'm beginning to not see the point anymore

-I don't have a meeting with a therapist until February and even then, they're not gonna understand my issues, I'm not gonna feel any better anyways. I don't know if I can wait that long for one sliver of hope that things will get better 

-[old 'best' friend] and [old friend] the two people who I thought were my good friends, cut me out the day I left Wagner. Everyday [old 'best' friend] goes to the bus stop directly across the street from our house. Everyday she comes home at the stop directly in front of our driveway. Yet somehow she's forgotten I even exist

I hope I've replaced enough personal info. I wanted to post this on a throwaway because I don't need the drama and yelling matches that would result from anyone in my personal life finding this. 

Reading this and knowing I'm posting it makes me feel like I'm just being a spoiled brat millennial who is a piece of trash. Well that line of thinking just convinces me even more to kill myself. 


I'm just finished. I'm all done. There's no real reason for me to be here. 'Oh we care about you, if you died we would be sad' 'oh people out there care you just can't see it right now' 

I'm not even having a breakdown right now that's clouding my thinking. If I was currently crying right now in my room typing this out then it would be worse. I'm literally just sitting on my couch looking out the window so this is really how I'm feeling, every single day. 

I guess if I really do kill myself then I'll write the link to this post in my note so my family can know why
