Still think killing myself is the best optionSo after a bunch of attempts to a help myself and getting advice from other I think is the best option for me is to kill myself since I feel like I can't be happy anymore and I lost interest in my favorite things. And attempting to make new hobbys? no point since I am already a failure at it.
