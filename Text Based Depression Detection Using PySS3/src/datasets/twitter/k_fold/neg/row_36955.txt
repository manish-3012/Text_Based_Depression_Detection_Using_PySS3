friend is suicidal, dont know what to dohey guys. my friend suffers from serious OCD due to sexual assault. these past few months she's been talking about wanting to commit suicide and my friends and i aren't sure what to do anymore. she's refusing to eat now and she doesn't want to seek professional help. her family is doesn't believe in mental illness and is super unhelpful. we do whatever we can to help like listening to her and talking to her about our experiences (i was suicidal for 4 years) and overall telling her how much we love and care about her but at this point we have no clue what to do. any advice would be much appreciated :/
