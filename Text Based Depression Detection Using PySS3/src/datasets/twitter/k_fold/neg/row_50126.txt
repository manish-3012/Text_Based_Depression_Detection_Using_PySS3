How do you banish the thoughts?I've battled major depression for about 12 years now.  Most of that time I've been able to maintain hope and hurting myself hadn't been a thought.  A few years ago I lost sight of the light at the end of the tunnel for a long time and I considered suicide from a rational perspective -- in that if things didn't start turning around in the future there wasn't much point in continuing the fight.  Lately though I've been overwhelmed with somewhat irrational thoughts of just ending it all and I can't keep them at bay.  Telling myself they are not rational isn't helping.

I'm getting kind of concerned and a little scared.  We've increased my medication but I'm not sure if it will help.  Can anyone share things that have worked for them to help keep those thoughts at bay, or at least keep them from becoming compelling.

Thanks for your time.
