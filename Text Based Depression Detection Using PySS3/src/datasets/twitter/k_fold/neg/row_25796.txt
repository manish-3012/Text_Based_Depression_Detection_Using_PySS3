(UK) Where can I get suicide counseling?I've asked for a NHS referral (9 days ago) but help is taking really long. I'm looking for someone to talk to in person. I'm not feeling like talking to my GP or calling 999 (in case my family find out or the police come).

[I went though all the recommended places](http://imgur.com/a/FNQj8)

CALMZone don't do my area, Paprus is phone only, and my local Samaritans says ''We are currently unable to accept visitors at our branch.'' Maytree is far and expensive to reach. 

I'm trying to get help, but I can't find any. I just want to talk to someone in person.
