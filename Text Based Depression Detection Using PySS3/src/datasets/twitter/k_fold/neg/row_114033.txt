I know and feel itâ€™s time to goIâ€™ve struggled for over a decade with depression, anxieties, and loneliness. I made changes to try and overcome them at the start of this year, but the pandemic has sent me on a downward spiral. Therapies are no longer helping or are out of reach, but Iâ€™m tired of waiting and trying. I just want the pain and emptiness to stop. 

Iâ€™m not a religious or spiritual person, but I do feel that fate has always been against me and kept me from achieving happiness despite my attempts.
