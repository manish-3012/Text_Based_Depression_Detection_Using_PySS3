Why am i like this?I lost my father at 3, he commited suicide too, left us here with my chaismoker/alcoholist mom and a bit mentally disabled sister. I lied my life from the beginning of middle school till end of high school. Im a notorious procastinator, but also called "smart" by others, because im a lazy fuck and always had luck with things, thats how i got into university, how i completed bsc and most of the msc. Never studied normally, and now it hits back, ill just fail a course which gonna cause minimum a semester plus on university(or dropout). And all because of myself, i always hated myself, all the things i achieved was only luck or others help, nothing by myself. My life is nothing, i lied through the biggest part of my life, always procastinate everything and being lazy... WHY I HAVE LUCK? WHY AM I LIKE THIS? WHY CANT I JUST DIE? Why i lied so much? Why i cant handle my life? Why am i afraid of everything? I know, none of you could answer these questions, i just had to write here, i had no better ideas. Anyone who i spoke with about it, they always said i worth and others but i know its not true, im just fucked up... I know its up to me, im just weak for all this shit and others but i have no other way, i want to die, end this suffer and hopeless life. My friends are ignoring me, my mom is just laugh on me that "what problem you could have? You only need to study",and others? They are just pseudo-positive fake people, who says commercial bullshit about how valuable am i, while i just say them the truth about all my achievements and they cant believe that i did not worked for them... and i think with suicide i can do something useful only by myself finally.
