STDS, cancer, depression, anxiety. I just wish I could disappear..I have multiple incurable STDs and a gynecological cancer. I wish I could just die.. or disappear. I can't seem to bring myself to kill myself. I am worried about leaving my mom and dad and them needing care. I often think about when they pass, I can pass too and join them. I don't feel right being alive. I feel I wasn't meant to me here in this body or whatever. I am not meant to be loved and my body has made sure of that. I have no family beyond my immediate family. I sometimes close my eyes and wish I would just start crumbling away. I hurt so much
