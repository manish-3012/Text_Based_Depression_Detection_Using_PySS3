I really don't want to live anymore. I've given up.I think about suicide every day. I don't have any plans to do it, but I really wouldn't mind just dropping dead right now. My life is a meaningless, empty void and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. My anxiety is almost debilitating, and it feels as though nobody truly loves me. I really want to stop living. I want this pain to end.
