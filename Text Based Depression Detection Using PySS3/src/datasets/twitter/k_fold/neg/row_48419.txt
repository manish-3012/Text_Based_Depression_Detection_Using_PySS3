Help me.I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me but itâ€™s getting worse. Last night I was in my hotel room crying because I feel like a failure for losing a good job I had. I mean I was at my end.  I wake up today and I feel amazing, I feel like the future is good.  But I know later on Iâ€™ll be in a bad mindset again.  Itâ€™s like a light switch. 

Iâ€™m a middle aged working guy and I have no idea why this is happening to me.
