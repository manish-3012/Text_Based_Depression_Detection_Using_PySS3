I'm too ugly. I want to die.I've never been one to feel confident. I was never the friend that people complimented. I was always the single one on the sidelines, wondering why nobody ever liked me. 
I eventually got with a couple of people, but one left me and the other cheated on me with his pretty ex. I'm still with the guy that cheated because he promised to not do it again, however, I get extremely jealous whenever he is around another girl now. I found a bunch of porn on his computer and also discovered that he looked up specific girls. None of them look like me.
So now every night I lay in bed, crying my eyes out, hearing my boyfriend become upset and angry over my insane jealousy. He tells me I am beautiful, but I don't believe it anymore. He rarely complimented me until I mentioned it to him.
So yeah. Just feels like looks determine where you are in terms of rank or place in this world. It's some bullshit hierarchy.

I don't want to live in a world like this. I don't want to live feeling jealous or insecure. There is nothing I can change about myself because they are natural features (nose, jaw,  lips, etc). and I don't like makeup.

I don't think anyone can convince me that life will get better anymore.

EDIT: People have also called me ugly and continue to do so to this day.
