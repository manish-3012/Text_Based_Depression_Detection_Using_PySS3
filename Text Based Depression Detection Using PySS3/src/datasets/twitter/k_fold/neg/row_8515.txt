HellI want to die. So bad. Im 20 and I have nobody to talk too but I also have so much that I havenâ€™t dealt with because thereâ€™s nobody for me to talk to without judging me or spreading rumors. 
I donâ€™t want to dump all of my problems on someone but Iâ€™m at the point where I canâ€™t coâ€™p anymore. I canâ€™t afford therapy and I donâ€™t know what to do. The last week Iâ€™ve been drinking myself to sleep because all I do is lay in bed and cry wishing I was dead. Iâ€™m at the point where I want it all to be over. 
Iâ€™m not sure why I even tried this thread. I thought maybe someone could help me but Idk.
