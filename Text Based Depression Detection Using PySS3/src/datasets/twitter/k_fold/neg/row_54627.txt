Iâ€™m just so fucking exhausted. I fucked up and became a 24 year old loser stoner, wasting away. I fucked up every relationship and opportunity.Iâ€™m so numb right now. I hate the person Iâ€™ve become. I hate the person Iâ€™ve become!! 

I literally picture different types of suicide methods daily. As I take the subway, or even when Iâ€™m by myself laying in bed. 

I am fucking done. I havenâ€™t accomplished anything. Never did school. Only worked dead-end jobs. Never had a relationship. Any girl who becomes interested in me quickly loses that interest once she gets to know me.

I donâ€™t know how I fucking fake it for so long. I close my eyes and picture the rope around my neck. Comforting...
