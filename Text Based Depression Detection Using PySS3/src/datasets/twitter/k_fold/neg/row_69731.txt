I still hate my lifeNo matter what I do, I can't seem to make myself. I quit smoking weed this week, as well as quitting my Effexor XR and Buspirone meds. I'm lifting, running, working, but at the end of the day I still hate the life I have created for myself. Next step is therapy, I guess. If I don't get on that I don't see how I can last another month. 

Thanks for listening, yah'll.
