Barely Hanging OnI've hit a wall in life. Nothing is fun and I'm extremely suicidal and pretty much homeless. I have no job either due to moving. I don't know what to do. I just got out of impatient a week ago and the day after became homeless... I'm staying with a friend bit only have another week. I'm so drained and ready to just give up..
