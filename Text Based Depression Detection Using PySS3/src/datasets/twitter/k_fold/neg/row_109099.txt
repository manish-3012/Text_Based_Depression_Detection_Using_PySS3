Titles are hardI am simply not satisfied with my life, I know if I â€œwork hardâ€ and â€œbelieve in myselfâ€ I might be able to get to a better spot but better is not good enough for me. I miracle is reqiured to give me the life I can truly enjoy and miracles donâ€™t happen. It might happen but I know it wonâ€™t. Its like winning the lottery, you might win but you know youâ€™re not gonna win. I donâ€™t wanna stick around and live this unbearable life to see if a miracle happens.  
  
I am not properly educated about stuff like fate but I feel like I was doomed from the start. Everything in my life is opposite of what I want. There are no exceptions. My name, my look, my height, my family, my friends, country that liveâ€¦  
  
Maybe my inabilty to adapt is my biggest issue, I donâ€™t like being grateful of what I have, If something canâ€™t make me happy why the fuck would I be grateful for it? Oh am I supposed to learn to be happy? I thought that was included. You canâ€™t learn to be happy in a bad spot, youâ€™re full of shit if you think you can. People with disabilities are the biggest example to this, everyone says â€œlook at those guys, they donâ€™t even have arms but they are happy, you have arms why are you not happy?â€ People with severe mental disabilities or physical disabilities get special treatment, thatâ€™s why they are happy. No one treats me different because I canâ€™t differentiate between blue and purple or because I am depressed.  
  
Everything is wrong and I can't make it right.
