Iâ€™m going to have to kill myself, my parents hate me and wonâ€™t let me recoverMy parents shouted at me today for being depressed since apparently Iâ€™m faking it for attention. They told me that everyone struggles and Iâ€™m privileged and not from a family of depressed people. They asked me why Iâ€™m depressed and when I said thereâ€™s no reason in particular they then went on to say that Iâ€™m doing it to be trendy. I hate them, they always act like my problems are nothing and think Iâ€™m a massive attention seeker. And now theyâ€™ve banned me from taking my antidepressants because at the age of 18 Iâ€™m too young to take them. No weaning off, just straight up stopping them. They remind me of how I canâ€™t make it into work and constantly tell me about how Iâ€™m going to lose my job, which Iâ€™m already absolutely terrified of. Iâ€™m so angry typing this, I want to cut myself loads and deeply, I want to overdose on all my medication, I want to get in my car and drive it into a tree, I want to jump in front of a train.

I just want to die
