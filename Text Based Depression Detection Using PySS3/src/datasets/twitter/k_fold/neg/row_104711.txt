SadI want to be happy, Iâ€™m only 18 I donâ€™t know how I made it this far, I donâ€™t wanna die Iâ€™ve been hopeless Iâ€™ve been close to doing it but I always knew deep down I just wanted to be happy and live, I want my medical issues to go away, I want to know how it feels to be loved &amp; not manipulated, lied to and abused by a girl. I want things to work out Iâ€™m sad, I donâ€™t wanna die I want things to get better, but if they donâ€™t soon I might end up doing something stupid.
