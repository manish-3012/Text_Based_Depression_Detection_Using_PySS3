Not living, just surviving...whatâ€™s the point?Iâ€™ve been heavily suicidal for about four months now. During this time Iâ€™ve self sabotaged more times than I can count, and have some half hearted suicide attempts, and 2 stays in the psych ward.

Can someone please tell me what the point is, when youâ€™re simply existing and not living. When every day is a struggle just to get out of bed where the bed often wins. When I havenâ€™t experienced pleasure in months. When there is no visible way for me to â€œget betterâ€. When I donâ€™t even want my own life.  When any sort of spark inside me dissipated forever.

What. Is. The. Point.
