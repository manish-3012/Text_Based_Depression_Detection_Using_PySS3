Well itâ€™s been four days since my girlfriend dumped me, one day after thanksgiving no less.It was a great day, better than my normal shaking-uncontrollably-with-anxiety days. Thanksgiving had just passed and I finally felt I had something to be thankful for, her. Going back I know she really did herself a favor by leaving me. I donâ€™t know how to treat a woman or how to truly love a woman because I canâ€™t fucking stand myself. I was always frustrated and screaming at her. At my lowest point I was hitting her and calling her names. Iâ€™m just so tired of hurting the people I care about. I feel like an uncontrollable monster. Is the off switch at the bottom of my pill bottles, sitting neatly on the third shelf of my bathroom cabinet? Please help.
