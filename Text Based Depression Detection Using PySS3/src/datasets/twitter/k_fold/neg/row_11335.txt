Life is pointlessThere is absolutely nothing to live for, especially to useless people like me who do nothing but leech from others. I just need to finally finish the job and everything will be fixed, after all, a corpse can't feel regret or sadness anymore. What is there for me to lose anymore. Besides more years of suffering and pain. It early doesn't get better after even 7 years I haven't gotten the slightest bit better. And I'm sure I will only be missed for like a week anyway
