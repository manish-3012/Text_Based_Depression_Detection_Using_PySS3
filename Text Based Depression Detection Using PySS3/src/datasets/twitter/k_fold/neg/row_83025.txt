I have completely and utterly given up.Iâ€™ve come to terms with dying, I donâ€™t fear death nor what comes after . I see no further purpose in living anymore, I see no further purpose in waking up anymore. Iâ€™m lazy, I barely workout now, My grades are lower than theyâ€™ve ever been, my mother eyes are full of disappointment, pity and disgust when she looks at me. I simply wish to talk to you one final time.. My friends of Reddit . Because you lot mean a lot to me, and regardless of if you still love me or not. I will love you forever and eternally and even after I die I will continue to love you because if I do have a soul.. that love I have for you will resonate. The end , of the road for me. I longer seek happiness, nor purpose in life, I no longer desire anything.. I do not wish to be better than the current me and I do not wish to be less. I wish to be non existent.

I wish to not have the ability to wish, to not have the ability to want or to breathe. I have no desire to continue to live.. I am a waste of space, time and air. I wish I could give my life to someone more deserving, I wish I could close my eyes and not open them, hell Iâ€™d even take a disease and slowly die from it , if it means the end.

Iâ€™m going to walk, just gonna go for a walk.. anywhere, wherever my feet take me and then stand in front of a 18 wheeler, or jump off a bridge or something . Tonight feels like the night.
