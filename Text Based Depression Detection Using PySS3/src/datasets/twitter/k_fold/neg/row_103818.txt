I'd be better off dead.I'm extremely unhappy and for the most part I can't place why. I feel like such a burden. Nothing seems to make me happy. I've met someone recently who is far from a romantic interest as far as I know, though I hold a small, school-girl crush. But, he's definitely one of the greatest people I know... I feel like an annoyance to him as well. He'll profusely state otherwise, however. I think I've really ruined shit with him. I don't know what to do.

I'm generally pretty comfortable within myself, but my depression is far too heavy and I'm sick of it. I honestly don't think I will kill myself (at least not in the near future), but I really want to. Like I should.

There's so much I want to do, but don't know if I ever will. I'm clingy and sad, and I swear everyone who says they love me actually hates me. I love them, though.
