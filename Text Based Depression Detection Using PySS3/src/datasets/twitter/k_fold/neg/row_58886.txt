I am so selfish.I am a 22 year old unemployed male who hasn't enrolled in school yet.  I am a parasite.  I am still living with my mom, eating her food, spending her money, and wasting her time. 

I tried to apply for financial aid a few days ago so I could be a little less worthless and get into school, but I can't even do that without her help. 

The job market is so bad in my area.  I have applied everywhere within skating distance but I haven't even received 1 call for an interview.  I have a car but I got in a wreck last year and fucked up the front end so now it won't pass inspection. I am afraid to drive it un-registered because if I got a ticket, I have no way to pay it, and I am afraid to ask my mom to help me get it fixed because that would just end up costing her (probably) more money than the ticket.

I sit at home waiting for my friends to get home from work so we can play some games.  I am really happy when I am gaming with my friends, but recently they have been spending more and more time with their girlfriends.  I am so selfish for wanting my friends to spend time with me.

The boredom is starting to get to me.  I want something to change, but I don't know how.  I am starting to think more and more about ending everything, but that would, again, be selfish of me because I know my family cares about me.  The more I think about it, the more it seems like a good idea.  No more money/time/resources wasted on this worthless excuse for a person.
