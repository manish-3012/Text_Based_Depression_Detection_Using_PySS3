Siblings are rich had tons of success and I have nothing   I've never worked hard in my life, I've lost all (i forgot the word) feelings to try to work hard. I'm in 10th grade or going to 10th grade and I don't know like what the fuck I'm going to do in life because I'm sure as hell not going to get a day job and I've lost all will to work hard and learn and I just don't want to do it anymore, I don't even want to go to school anymore because I have shitty reading comprehension and all I do is stare at the fucking ground all day bored out of my mind. My parents try to help me and my siblings who now moved on and are living a fucking happy life without any issues while I'm going through my own personal hell. They always tease me (or that's just how I see it) saying I don't try hard enough In school which is 100% true and one day when they were all at home I was walking pass one if them and one of them asked...

"So Jim how's school, ha" and I just turned around and said fuck you, and then he yelled back saying I've never worked a day in my life and I've had everything handed to me. I fucking flipped and responded with...

   "You didn't have severe depression or poor reading skills or adhd, you didn't get made fun of or had parents that didn't give a shit what mood your in or "handed me shit" to stop me from bashing my head into the wall or just straight up shooting myself"

   After that day I just locked myself in my room and played on my computer, draw, plucked my guitar for 8 months straight. I haven't seen any of them since and honestly I don't fucking want to and I'm probably going to drop out of high school and soon I don't know when but shoot myself because I know I'm going nowhere in life and I have 0 fucking plans.
