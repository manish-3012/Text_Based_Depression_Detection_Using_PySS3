Why is getting help so glorified? Why do people go to such lengths to stop people from killing themselves?I donâ€™t understand why I canâ€™t be allowed to make my own decision to be done. I have come to terms with dying, and now Iâ€™m just looking for a solid method that wonâ€™t fail. Iâ€™ve already decided. I donâ€™t need or want people telling me not to kill myself, I donâ€™t want to hear â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€ because look around. This world is shit and things only get worse. I know a lot of people would say that I only see it that way because Iâ€™m depressed but Jesus fucking Christ. Seriously? Wake up. Life is shit, the world is not going to get better, and if I decide I want to be done with it, who is anyone to tell me Iâ€™m wrong?
