Falsely accused of something a few years ago and it has destroyed my self-esteem.A few years ago I was accused of something \(nothing illegal although they made it sound like it was\). I could have sued the person in question for slander, but I didn't because I was worried it would 1\) Spread the lie even further and 2\) Legal proceedings would destroy me. 

I do think what I did at the time was wise \(as lawsuits are very stressful and even if I won, I would have lost really\). However, the rumour unfortunately is still there on the internet and since it has been over a year, the statute of limitations on libel has run out. I am worried that at some point somewhere down the future people will use it against me.
