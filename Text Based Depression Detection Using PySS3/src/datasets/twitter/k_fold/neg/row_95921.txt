Am I wrong for feeling the way I do?First time poster, but I had to get some things off my chest. This may be a little long but hear me out if you have the patience. I am a male who is 30 years of age and I have been contemplating suicide for the last 15 years, ever since my grandmother's passing. I have let just a few friends know about my suicidal thoughts, however they continue to tell me it'll get better and things will change. I am not looking for sympathy or even support, for a long time I kind of just accepted that I will be gone. I made myself believe that it wouldn't matter because by 25 , I would already be dead. You can imagine my surprise on my 25th birthday, realizing fuck, I am still here and my thoughts were not true unless I take things into my own hands.  


But I can't, not for any other reasons but my dad. He busts his ass everyday at work, hoping that me and my brother have a better life. My sister has been diagnosed with MS and i know the heartache of losing me would absolutely destroy him, so I drag my feet daily for his sake. Everyone asks me why I haven't got married yet or even pursued a new relationship. I actually broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years at 26, because i knew that, at the end of the day, if I did peruse my thoughts, I would just be hurting her as well. I have made it clear I don't want children for that same reason as well. Now everyday I just watch a clock slowly tick by, waiting for my opportunity to finally go.
