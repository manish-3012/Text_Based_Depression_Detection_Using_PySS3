I can't stop the images any moreBackground: I've seen a lot of shit, I was basically prostituted from 13 until 16 and in that time saw a lot of people get hurt, shot, as well as had a lot of people hurt me
The antidepressants worked for a bit but now I can just can't feel anything apart from the void that's in the center of my chest. 
At this point I can't stop the images in my head, I can't see anything other than the people who got hurt while I watched unable to do anything. I can't stop feeling the hands of people I dont know. I can feel hands around my neck.
I want it to go away and stop but I can't think of any other way apart from ending it. I'm scared, truly, I want it all to go away I want it to stop. I can't think of anything good any more and all my breathing exercises and ctb bullshit isn't helping.
I'm sorry for bothering you all, I'm just desperate. Really I am sorry.
