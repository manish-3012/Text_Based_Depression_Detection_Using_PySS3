If I fail any of my upcoming exams in school, I think I am going to straight up do it.Yeah, this is like the only solution available if I fail anything in completing those. This solution sucks pretty much I know, but if I fail, this is going to be purely my fault and you can't change anything in this point of no return. My parents might miss me, but they didn't even think about that one thing in the first place if they can afford a child or not before fulfilling their needs to create me.
