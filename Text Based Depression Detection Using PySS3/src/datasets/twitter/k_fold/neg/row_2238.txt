What draws the line between suicidal ideation and active plans?Like how can someone tell if you have an active plan enough to have you sent away?
Like I have very vivid suicidal thoughts to the point where I know multiple ways how and have the means easily accessible but it's not like I'm telling anyone I plan to commit on X day at Y time. I just have suicidal thoughts in excessive detail. 

If i said "I just gotta dump all my crap in the garbage or a storage unit, maybe get some shit paid off cuz i heard debts fall to the family, and maybe I'll see if I can't take a vacation real quick and all i have to do is x my wrists no big deal" I dont see that as a plan. Or even "I'm taking antidepressants but if i were to kill myself i don't see any reason why i couldn't just pool all my pills together n take them all at once with the door locked or something." Like if i said those things i dont think that's an active plan.

To me an active plan is someone that already has the means right in front of them or nearby and cant hear the word "Stop." Or someone who says if nothing changes in a week im finally going to do it. Idk how but I'll do it. Prepping wills and letters to be distributed afterwards also seem like a sign of an active plan. 

And no im not knocking or judging anyone whose ideas and plans dont align or match with the crap I'm saying, i would never, im just...
I don't know.

Am i missing something? I just wanna be careful with what i say about my suicidal thoughts when I finally meet with a therapist (should they ask ofc). Like i don't wanna be misconstrued as having a whole active plan and have people show up and take me away to some institution or whatever. Ill just be a waste of resources and not only that, the bill that will come afterwards is definitely going to be the thing to take me out.

Idk what im doing here.
