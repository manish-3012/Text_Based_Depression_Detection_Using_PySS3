Itâ€™s hard to believe this is real life, because it all feels like a nightmareIâ€™m so tired of being alive.  Iâ€™ve tried to end this so many times but it never works. If I told you an exact number you probably wouldnâ€™t believe me, but trust me itâ€™s a lot. Especially for someone my age. I have a full proof plan this time, Iâ€™m just not sure when to go ahead and do it. I want to live to see Halloween since itâ€™s my second favorite holiday, but that also means I have to spend it completely alone, again.

So much has happened in my childhood, the past year, and all of this year.  I canâ€™t go into detail because I donâ€™t want this to be too long, but itâ€™s all too much. I keep trying to make new friends and have a positive outlook, but that usually only lasts for a couple weeks or a month and then Iâ€™m back to being completely alone. Iâ€™ve tried drugs to take my mind of things, and they do, but looking back on times I took drugs every night I feel like thatâ€™s made me detached from the person I once was. I used to be quite funny and charming I guess you could say. Now I just feel like a hollowed out shell that used to carry a nice personality. 

Itâ€™s surreal to believe this will be it. This will be the age I die. Because as a child I had many things I wanted to do when I grew up. I wanted to go see the country my family is from, Iâ€™ve only heard about it in stories from my family. I wanted to study hard and eventually be a prosecutor. I wanted to find love and have a beautiful family. But the rosy image I once had of being an adult has faded. And now I just want to go to sleep. Dying before 15 is scary to some people I guess, but for me living past 15 is scary. 

So hopefully this will be my final attempt. Whenever that may be. I hope everyone reading this gets to live a life much more fulfilled and happy than I did.
