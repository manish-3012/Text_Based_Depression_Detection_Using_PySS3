Iâ€™m so tired of fighting...Life hursts, it hurts every moment Iâ€™m alive. I just canâ€™t fucking take it anymore, nobody cares there like 3 people in my life who will willing start a conversation with me, everyone else just tries to get out of it... 

Today I was talking to some body who I thought would be helpful and nice about my suicidal thoughts and cutting but instead they just made jokes about my wrists.

We live a cruel dark world and Iâ€™m tired of it I canâ€™t take it anymore...
