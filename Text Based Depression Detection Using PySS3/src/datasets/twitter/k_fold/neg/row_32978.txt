I need the freedom of knowing I don't have to be here tomorrow if I don't want to.In my lifetime, I think I've taken almost every antidepressant out there, at least the most famous ones, and that's without any effect.

&amp;#x200B;

In the last months I had been taking another one, and I got the impression that I was getting a little better, so I stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

Cause I can't not want to kill myself, for me is the only solution, if I lose it I get condemned to be here in this life, and I know how bad it is here.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I stopped in the last week, I think I felt bad again, but I need this, otherwise I go crazy, I need the freedom. I don't know if I'll last 'till the end of this year (though I've said this many other times).

but past the middle of next year sure not.
