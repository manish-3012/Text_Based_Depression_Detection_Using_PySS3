Bad day (NSFW, Trigger warning)For the sake of background... I'm a mtf transsexual who suffers from BPD and Social Anxiety. Today in therapy (DBT) we were focused on self-invalidation's, a large one for me is the thought that I will never be seen/ treated as a normal woman. During therapy another member of the group referred to me as "he" (causing emotional heightening) after already being emotional from the subject matter itself. Later on, the person who I rely on to get me to therapy and medical appointments (a married older man) suggested that I start cancelling some of my appointments so he won't have to drive me so much since he has "lost hope in our relationship's growth" (He has made sexual advances that were denied). When I got home I checked my e-mail and got a message... Well I will let it speak for itself.

&gt;So as you probably figured out I've never been with a guy...so is there any chance you would be willing to entertain the idea of showing me the ropes...I've always fantasized about have another mans cock in my ass as well as feeling a cock explode in my mouth but I just never had the guts to try it...

I am a lesbian and this person knows this, I responded simply with "I am not a man" and subsequently un-friended him. I am all alone and next week is my last week of group therapy meaning that I will no longer have any socialization outside of seeing my daughter and therapist, if I can continue to get a ride otherwise I will lose therapy and electrolysis. I won't have my license for another year at least.

All of this has led me to feel more suicidal then usual, I thought about self admittance to the hospital but all they ever do is tell me to take meds that don't help, now I just want to hang.
