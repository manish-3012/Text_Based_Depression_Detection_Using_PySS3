Starting over again, but I'm exhaustedI've been suicidal - off and on, but more on than off - for most of my life. The first time I remember wanting to kill myself I was maybe 7 or 8. I was an unwanted baby, and was made well aware of how I'd ruined my family's life. I was constantly bullied in elementary school and hated being around people my own age. The self-loathing and feeling of seperateness and not belonging started early.

Until the past couple of years, the driving force in my life was to prove I deserved to exist, that there was a "reason" for me being born, that everyone who didn't love me or see my potential was wrong to reject me. But now I'm inescapably middle-aged, and I'm tired. So tired.

I have always been a high-achieving student, and I was the first one in my family to go to college - and to really try to prove my worth, I graduated law school too. Thing is, I hated practicing law. I wanted to work in a specific social movement, but I applied and interned for a decade before getting a job in it. I was always praised in other positions outside the movement, and I didn't understand how other people walked into the jobs I wanted right out of undergrad. I'm a hard worker, smart, friendly, a team-player...the complaint I get from managers in the movement (but not outside it) is that I ask too many questions, try to change (improve) things too much. But still, I finally landed this job, and thought my real life was going to begin. Except I thought the organization was making serious strategic mistakes. When I'd been there for a while and thought I could start voicing my opinion, I was routinely ignored or shot down - sometimes with someone else "coming up with" the idea a few months later, sometimes with my manager seeming to almost purposely misunderstand my intent. After I expressed some very real concerns about the organization's strategy and tactics, I was fired. That was at the beginning of the pandemic, and I've been trapped in debt quicksand ever since.

I've also had two very serious relationships absolutely crash and burn in front of me in the past few years, although I did everything I could think of to save them. I think I tolerated much more than the average person would, tried many more resources and suggestions to help than most people would. I gave _a lot_ - too much, I'd probably say - to each one, with only a broken heart to show for it. 

I'm now in my late 30s and have absolutely nothing to show for it. My career has floundered, my relationships have ended painfully, I don't get along with most of my family, and I never stay in one place long enough (because I'm chasing jobs and/or relationships) to make lasting friendships. I do not own any property, I'm broke, and I've failed at everything I ever wanted or tried to do. It may be self-pitying, but I feel like a lot of people get a lot more in life with a lot less effort. 

I've held off for years on ending it because I know it would kill my mother, who sacrificed everything to raise me. My plan is that when she passes, I'll take myself out too shortly thereafter. I was never supposed to be in this world, so I'll just finally be righting a wrong. It's very comforting to know that when the time is right, I'll be able to end things on my own terms. 

The thing is, it's getting harder to wait. I used to have drive, passion, I used to relish an adventure and starting over. Now I'm forced to do that again, but I'm just so tired. The drive and the passion are gone and I just want to be left alone until I wither away. 

I'm on antidepressants and have been for years - this is the best combination I've found so far. I see a therapist who I really like. But living is just too much to bear anymore. I know it's horrible, but I just wish this virus would take me out so I wouldn't have to feel the pain and worry and stress anymore, but it wouldn't be seen as my fault. 

I don't know what I expect anyone to say to this, I don't know what anyone could say to a failure so complete it's almost ludicrous. Just wanted to get it out, I suppose. Thanks for reading.
