Me and a gun 4amMy wife who is my best friend in whom I confided everything left me.

No counseling. No discussion. Just done.

I'm 36 and have a background of abuse. As such I'm estranged from my entire family. I don't have close friends.

I have my 45 though. Clean, cold, loaded.

Even if I have the strength to put together another life I'm just not sure I even want to try. How does a 36 yo dude even insinuate himself into groups to make friends? I don't know and people don't tend to like me anyway.

Oblivion just seems like the best place to be. Like it almost has a sweetness in my mind.

I've always flirted with the idea of self termination. This is the first time I have the gun loaded and ready. The rest would be so simple.


So, roast away!
Oh, wrong sub :)
