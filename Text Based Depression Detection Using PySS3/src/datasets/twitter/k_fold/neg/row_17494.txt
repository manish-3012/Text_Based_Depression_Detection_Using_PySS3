Had depression for years, it always comes back, I'm here because I'm sitting in front of a pack of strong benzos and thinking of taking them.First signs appeared when I was 8 or 9, stuff got worse ever since, spent five weeks in a mental hospital when I was 12, depression sometimes takes breaks that last for a few months, usually after a year or two of therapy. I have tried killing myself multiple times, I fail because the rope breaks or the pills end up not being lethal, even though I sleep for 22 hours straight from half of one of those. I'm tired of everything and I know that depression will keep butt fucking me for years, because not only does my dad have it, but my brother had it, as well as my grandfather. I'm sick of everything, especially people because most people care only when I'm suicidal and ignore me when I'm not. Even though I don't play any role in their lives except for being that sad guy who's always asking for attention by trying to kill himself. I don't want to face reality anymore or ever again, I just want to fall asleep and never wake up. I think I'm gonna try to overdose and take a nap, hopefully I won't wake up.
