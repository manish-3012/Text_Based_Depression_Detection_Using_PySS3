I just want to get some sleepI canâ€™t hold on anymore. All I hear are voices in my head that tell me how worthless I am. How little I mean to everyoneâ€™s life. Iâ€™m sick of only feeling worth in the moments before Iâ€™m about to off myself and someone else doesnâ€™t want me to. They just donâ€™t want to feel guilty. They donâ€™t actually care about me. All my life Iâ€™ve just wanted to amount to something. Share the things that Iâ€™m passionate about to someone that wanted to listen. Talk about my favourite song and give a lecture on why it means so much to me. Share my favourite video games and movies and books. Fight for something or someone that I believed in, even if itâ€™s morally or inherently wrong. I wanted to stop looking up to people and become someone who was instead looked up to. How can I even begin to do those things when itâ€™s impossible to even lie my head down on a pillow and close my eyes to get some sleep. I just want the voices to go away for 5 seconds so I can go the fuck to sleep. I just want a week where I can sleep normally. I just want a week where I donâ€™t feel so much existential dread over my being and place in society. I just want a fucking hug man. I canâ€™t even get that shit. Iâ€™m so tired, physically, mentally, emotionally. Death doesnâ€™t seem so fucking bad anymore.
