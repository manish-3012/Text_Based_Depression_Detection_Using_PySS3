What am i doing wrong?I have struggled with my emotions for the longest,i believe i have severe bipolar disorder or even BPD (borderline personality disorder)
I have problems within my family,me and my mom constantly bicker and yell at each other,we never get along,just yesterday she came in my room at noon and started to say "Your not gonna like what i have to say" than listed that i am lazy,and that i dont do anything,im not helping my schooling situtation (homeschooled,and its failing due to theyre system) and i sleep all day (i was up at 6 am waiting for her like she said to the night before) i was super tired because of the amount of stress the pass couple months have been for me,for a while i stopped cutting and thinking suicidal thoughts,but currently they just have come back (thoughts,not cutting) i cant help but believe i am a failure,all i wanna do is please my family,but at the same time be comfortable,i left public school so i wouldnt have to be bullied by the adults and teens there,and now i am being bullied by my mother and brothers,constantly being told to stfu,and that im lazy (im really tired all the time,and i promise myself only a hour,and it turns into 5..) i apologize constantly,my moms main arguements are money,school and college,i dont wanna graduate highschool (believe me if i wasnt so stressed i would..but at this point,its hell and im exhausted and panicing and in pain and depressed..and ugh)

Someone...please,am i doing something wrong? am i a bad person for just wanting peace and quiet and alone time...am i wrong for wanting a little help and guidance,and am i wrong for not wanting to be pushed to a limit that i cant meet ? (i could if i had time..but they dont give me time in this case)
