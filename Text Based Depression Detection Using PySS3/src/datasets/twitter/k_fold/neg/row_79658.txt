If I tell a therapist I want to kill myself will they lock me up??? I want to when I turn 30, jan 5 2017. I am a fat pathetic women  who is not Married and doesn't have kids. The prospects for that won't change in the next few months. The only thing holding me back is my parents would be devastated. So I'd consider talking to a therapist but I'm afraid to mention suicide because I don't want to be committed to a mental hospital.
