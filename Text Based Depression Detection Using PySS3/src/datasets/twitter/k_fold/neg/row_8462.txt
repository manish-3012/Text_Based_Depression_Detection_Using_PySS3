Scared of covid 19.I am surely not the only one who feels extremely anxious because of the whole covid 19 situation. The fact of being quarantined, all these people dying... it is so overwhelming and all these empty streets are a perfect apocalypse scenario. This whole situation gives me terrible nightmares with people slaughtering each other and many morbid details. What is the most scary is the outcome. It is very important to be optimistic on this one, yet the risk of a terrible outcome is always a possibility, a possibility that haunts me all the time. I'm afraid of losing my loved ones, afraid of the world I know being totally changed. Having to create new basis. All of this seems so arbitrary, it is as if it could happen anytime, anywhere and there would be no escape.
