I can't trust anyoneOver the past few years I always had this little wish for death sitting in the back of my mind but I thought "boohoo family, friends, I can't do this to them". I made a horrible mistake of telling my (now ex-) friend a made up story of me basically fucking my mother boss. I've told her multiple times I made this story up. She swore she won't tell anyone. Thing is, her boyfriend knows as well. And he's been pretty lousy with promises, going as far a cheating multiple times on her. I can't trust him at all. They had proof I said such things on their phones but I asked her to delete them. She said they did. I don't trust them. I've never felt this anxiety I'm feeling right now. I just want to die, it can come up after I die, my mom can know after I die, but if she or anyone at my school should hear about this I will move to another country or kill myself. Hell, if the boss hears this my mom will lose her job ASAP. I don't know what to do anymore.
