Anxiety- can I post here?I don't know if this is the right place as I dont feel like I want to commit suicide but I can't see another community that fits this. 
My anxiety levels are super high atm, I can't concentrate,  my heart is racing, I keep crying and my head feels like it's about to split open. I don't have anyone to talk to, my only friend is too busy plus I don't want to burden them. My therapist is shut down for the holidays.
