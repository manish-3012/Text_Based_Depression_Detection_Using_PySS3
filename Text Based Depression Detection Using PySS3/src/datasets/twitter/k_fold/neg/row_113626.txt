I messed up my entire lifebecause i got high, procrastinated, failed post-secondaries 3 times, in four years, i`m quite smart, the brilliant one in the family for 5 kids, 
but really freaking lazy, i'm stuck in limbo right now, catch 22 situations, i've had many of them, but this one, takes the cake, living with parents, who are rich, but really strict, definitely have no chance of a gf for several months to a year, believe me, its a very dull lifeless city, plus the strict rules of the house, and the shame of not having my own place, completely shitty internet connection, cant even work on my hosting business i taught myself for 3 years, and no money to even work on something else, 

i just cant do it, i cant see myself living in this nightmare , 

i just want to sleep and not wake up anymore, with no worries, relieving the past, going through those moments where everything changed, and wishing, wishing i had made the other decision, i'm so stressed, depressed, with massive regrets, suicidal thoughts, shame in seeing old friends who are doing good, don't wanna speak to ex gf on the phone who is thousand of miles away and sleeping around, a lot, because i overreacted and bailed on her, but i really miss her, and i really wanna let her go, and not call her anymore, but im so bored most of the day,  with no friends to talk to, and i end up calling her, everyday, people here are incredibly dull, but im so bored, like really bored, there's really nothing to do to pass the time, 

i really wanna die, a fool proof method, that leaves no serious trauma for my family, i dont wanna be a burden anymore, i just cant handle it, last year, the year before that, and the year before that too,  i was really motivated to live, to experiment, to turn my life around, but now i want to, i really want to, but its out of my control, it rests on some one's decision, to make things better for me, and if i get the go ahead, I WILL GET MY LIFE BACK, but if i am denied, then all is lost, for i cant wait any longer .
