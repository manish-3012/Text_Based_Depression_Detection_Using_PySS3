Donâ€™t know where to startI have had depression for a while, 4 years. Before COVID I would cope by going to live-action events that would give an adrenaline boost and force me to see people. It was my main hobby, I would enjoy every weekend traveling through my country, running, playing and being with friends. 
Ever since COVID this has been gone, and I donâ€™t know what to do really. I am failing as a person, sometimes I canâ€™t event get out of bed and the only thing keeping me day to day is feeding my cats. I try to study but is like my body wonâ€™t listen to me, and I get called lazy and screamed at for this. I get extremely clumsy and forgetful and money is tight. The only thing I can stick to is excersise because it makes me feel good. But once that is gone I would go back to felling like shit. 
I donâ€™t get support from my mother (when I tell her that I am depressed and need help she just calls me lazy) and my country does not offer great support either, plus COVID has made medical centers imposible to reach to. 
If I wasnâ€™t in the picture things would be so much better, I would not suffer and my family wonâ€™t struggle financially to keep a lazy person. The only reason I haven acted upon this urge to end it all is because I am still deciding the least painful way to do it.
