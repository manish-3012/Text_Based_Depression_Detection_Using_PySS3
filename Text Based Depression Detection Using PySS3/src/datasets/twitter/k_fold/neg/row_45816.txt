My life is the opposite of everything I wish it was.I will admit I am privileged, and I am thankful for that. I live in a nice house in a free (sort of) country. Iâ€™m not starving and I donâ€™t have any health problems. I just needed to get that out of the way.

 Im an ugly straight white cisgender conservative Christian male so that automatically means Iâ€™m hated by a good portion of people. I donâ€™t have a lot of friends, the friends I do have either arenâ€™t really friends or just donâ€™t want to hangs out with me that much. I live in a town filled with absolute idiots. The rest of my family doesnâ€™t give a fuck about me. Iâ€™m ugly, have little to no social skills, and everybody disregards me and my opinion.

I look at others and I just wish I were them. They are everything I want to be. People who are attractive, have friends who like them and have the motivation to do things and better themselves. A part of me is optimistic and thinks things will be better one day, the other thinks the opposite.
