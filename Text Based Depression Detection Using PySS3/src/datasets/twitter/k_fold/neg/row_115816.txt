I've had a plan for awhileFor over a year I've had a plan to kill myself, but I have always found a reason to hold on for one more day.  
Then everything fell apart. Health deteriorated to the point of basically debilitating me physically and financially, the amount of stress my job puts on me has me in tears everyday, my husband cheated on me and lies to me, my closest friend lives on the other side of the country, and my other closest friend is now keeping me at arms length.  
Everyone who has ever told me they loved me has either hurt me or abandoned me.  
Why the fuck would I want to keep doing this?
