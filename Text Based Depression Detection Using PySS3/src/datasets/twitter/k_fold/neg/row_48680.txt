Dirty bottomfeeder tweakerI've been looking into all sorts of shit tonight that's fucked up my worldview. Long story short I've concluded that my status, as a low status male is causing me a lot of pain. I have no friends, people don't respect me, and my only friend is my girlfriend of 6 years as a 20 year old. I lost a prestigous job because I couldn't fit and now I work at a golf course. I have very little social skills and Im falling into meth addiction. I'm so fucking lost and I have no idea what to do now. I feel like my only options are to kill myself or join the army

The last time I binged I overdosed twice pretty hard last week, I might do it harder this time, I got double the supply and I want to scorch the fuck out of everything I everknew
