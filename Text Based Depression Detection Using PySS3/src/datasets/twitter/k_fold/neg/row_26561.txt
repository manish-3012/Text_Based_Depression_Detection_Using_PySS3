I need helpI dont know where to turn. This is year 13 of being depressed/suicidal for me, and though there were momentary lapses of happiness over that time I genuinely don't find there to be any joy left in my world. Nothing makes me happy, my career is stagnant and I've been out of work for 5 months. My sexuality is something that not even I can understand, let alone explain to others. I live alone, have no friends, and am nearly out of money. I'm already medicated, yet the effectiveness of the already maximum dosage has been wearing off. I'm heavily disliked throughout my community yet have no means to escape. I'm at the end of my rope with hands that are bleeding and raw. I dont even want to hold on yet I do because of the unfairness of the cleanup for my family once they hear of my escape. I need help so badly.
