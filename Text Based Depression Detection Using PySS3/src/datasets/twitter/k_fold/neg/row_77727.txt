Not sure I want to carry on.Just got out of a long lasting long distance relationship tonight. I loved her more than anything but we had a lot of problems, had an argument and she ended up blocking me without even saying goodbye. I really loved her so much, I loved her two children and my daughter loved her as well. I am not sure how I can carry on. I don't want to date ever again as I feel I will never be this close to someone. She was the one. I am 30 and really have lost interest in being here. I have no self confidence due to issues with our sex life. I don't feel attractive, I don't feel like I have much going for me. The only thing keeping me here is my daughter but at this point I feel like a detriment to her and feel like she would be better without me considering I brought someone into her life and my daughter loved her and now I have to break her heart again and tell her I managed to fuck things up.

I am completely broken.
