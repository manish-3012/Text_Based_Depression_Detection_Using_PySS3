The suicide hotline is a fucking joke. You'd be better off talking to a wall.I waited 45 minutes with 4 people ahead of me to chat. Once I got in, I waited another hour, and the chat automatically disconnected as it had timed out. It was not a network error on my part. On the after chat survey I left them a negative review, and then called the hotline. They told me I had already been helped and they had emailed me resources. (They did not). I'm not in good place tonight and no one is there to talk, so honestly I think tonight's the night I wrap my car around a fucking tree or drive into a river. I hate my fucking life, I hate everyone that claims to be my friends, who I do everything for, and they can't even be there to fucking help me once. I hate everything about myself, I'll never find love because I'm short, and I'll never have a life worth living. Goodbye everyone.
