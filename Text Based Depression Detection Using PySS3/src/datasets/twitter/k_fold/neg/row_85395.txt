Countdown to 18Iâ€™ve been holding off on committing until my 18th birthday. Mainly so that my mom wonâ€™t be the one to find me (moving out). But my dream is to just buy a one way ticket to some other country and just die off in a remote area, far away from society, so that way nobody will have to be traumatized by seeing a dead body. This goal of mine has been one of my main reasons for living for the last few months and I just hope it can come to fruition.
