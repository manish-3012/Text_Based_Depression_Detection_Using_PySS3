Do you realy Care?I just red this : "I do realy care about you." here on reddit.


Why?


When I think about it , I think when I am trying to convince someone that he should not kill himself I am realy trying to convince myself. 


The more i whant to do it the less I care.
You Care? Idk even if I kill myself tonight like I whanted to do for so Long. You won't even know and it wont move anything inside you. Propably hundrets of Users are already gone and sooner or later I know i will too. 


But why am I still writing this. I Hope for something? I don't know what I am hopeing for. In the End it doesnt even matter. 


Well sorry about this random shit.
