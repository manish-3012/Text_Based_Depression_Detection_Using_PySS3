Thoughts of being so aloneThis quarantine has messed me up so badly. Iâ€™m so used to talking to people at my school but now I barely have anyone to talk to besides my boyfriend and a few other friends (which at the most is only 2 that ever respond to me). He has a lot of friends and iâ€™m happy for him, yet I always wonder why I barely have any friends. It makes me cry everytime, and I attempted to do suicide almost 2 times because of this, but luckily I held back and kept on going with my day. Iâ€™m trying to talk to new people, though I feel like iâ€™m either too obnoxious or trying too hard to be friendly and whatnot, which makes me become so paranoid and feels like iâ€™m pushing those new people even further away from me. I havenâ€™t graduated high school and I have yet many goals to achieve, but iâ€™m hoping this will all be over soon and make this mindset disappear from me once again. Iâ€™m not sure where to meet people iâ€™m able to talk to with similar interests without being shy and scared to make the first move. I still think about this even when I have my loving boyfriend, but it still hurts me so much. Iâ€™d appreciate any help/advice thatâ€™s able to help me consider a positive, more outgoing mindset and personality and better myself as a person.
