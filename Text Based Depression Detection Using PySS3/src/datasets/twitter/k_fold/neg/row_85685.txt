Will attempt suicide tomorrow(again)Well, i'm on a very shitty day again. Will attempt suicide by jumping in front of a train tomorrow. Since it's a 1 way shot, i would say i have 20% chance of actually overcoming my survival instinct and jumping just in time to be shred to pieces.

Sig, i hope this world burns some day and everyone that isn't suicidal or depressed manage to get fine in the end.
