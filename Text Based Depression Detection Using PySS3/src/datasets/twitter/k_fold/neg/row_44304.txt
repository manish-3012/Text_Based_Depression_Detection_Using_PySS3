I just feel like whatever happens after you die must be better than this.I've been alive for almost 22 years, and I cant recall a single day I was happy to be here.  Everything feels so pointless and empty. I've been to the lowest points mentally already and I'm starting to think all the effort, just trying to get a few happy years in isn't the worth the struggle and if there's something anything waiting on the other side it'll be better than whatever time I can waste here
