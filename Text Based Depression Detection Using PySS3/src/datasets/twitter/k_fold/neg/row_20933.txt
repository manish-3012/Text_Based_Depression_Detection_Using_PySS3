3rd Failed Attempt - Wondering About PurposeI've been struggling with apathy about life for a few months now, since I was BA'd in November. I've read other posts about feeling like we're here for our loved ones. I can relate to that. I have a list of people that I don't want to negatively impact by leaving that way. I also think I want to live. But then I wonder, have I made any significant contributions in the decade since my first failed attempt? Have  I made the world better?   


Certainly, we each have magnitudes of impact that we can't even anticipate, ripples in a pond and such. I try to focus on that.   


All that said, I tried to slit my wrist in front of my fiance last night, and I wasn't being dramatic or reactionary. I sincerely thought the cut was deep enough, but it was shallow. Then he took the knives and I calmed down. Just checking in I guess. Offering something between encouragement and a thanks for being here to hear me out.
