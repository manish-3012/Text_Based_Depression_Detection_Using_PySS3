(Trigger warning) Not for the faint of heart.Is there anyone out there? I'd like to leave this world. Soon. I am tired, so tired. My heart is heavy, my mind is blank, the words are stuck on my palate and my mouth is dry. I stumble on my words as they leave my throat and my heart echoes with a dull, uninterested thud. I'd like to drown in alcohol and giggle hysterically. I'd like to smoke a pack of cigarettes to burn my lungs and hope they give up on me. My mind is filled with thoughts and chaotic images of blood then it just stops thinking. I'd like to go now, please. I've thought of ways on how to do it and they are all I think about when I am not numbingly sitting in front of the TV watching the images flicker on screen. Surely, i'll miss my family. I hope they'll miss me, too. I haven't been very nice to them; been too harsh, too unforgiving. I'll miss my dog, mostly. My dog is old. Maybe I'll wait for her so I can follow. I hope there is a dog heaven. I'd like to go there. I'm tired of breathing and strong emotions. I'm tired of hating so much that I cry. I'm tired of loving too much that I have none left for myself. Everything will be arranged soon. People left behind won't have to worry, my insurance is up-to-date. One less burden. One less pain. One last breath. Why does breathing feel like a momentous burden? I crave the quiet peace of death. I'd like to go soon.
