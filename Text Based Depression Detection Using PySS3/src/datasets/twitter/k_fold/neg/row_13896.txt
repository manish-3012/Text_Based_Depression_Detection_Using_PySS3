I hate myself and this worldOn my main, I got into an argument on another sub with a bunch of guys celebrating about suicide rates among a group of people. I said it was disgusting, and that I wouldn't wish suicide on my worst enemy. They called me a pussy and pathetic.

I see so much hate and ignorance everywhere. It makes me depressed. Nobody bothers to think rationally or educate themselves it seems. Do people just wish the worst for anyone that disagrees with them now?!

Then there's the people and animals around the world that are suffering. And the people around the world that are just evil. I saw an article recently about KIDS who did some truly horrific things to some animals.

Then there's me. I hate myself so much. For countless reasons. I want to go inpatient but it costs so much money and I am not worth that much. That money could be used for something much better.
