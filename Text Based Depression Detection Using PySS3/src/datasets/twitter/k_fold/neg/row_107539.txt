Lacking MotivationI'm at the point in my life now where I'm expected to start planning for my future, but I can't help but think every time I sit down to write my applications to colleges that I know I'll be dead before I even get accepted so what is the point. And it's not only that I just have daily existential crises where I don't care about showering or cleaning my room because I'll be dead soon so there's no need. I don''t know what to do really. People keep saying it will get better but its been 6 years and it's only gotten worse.
