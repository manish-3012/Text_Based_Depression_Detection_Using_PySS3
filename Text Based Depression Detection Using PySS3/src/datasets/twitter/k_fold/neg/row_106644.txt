things that (didnâ€™t) help me not dieiâ€™m pretty sure thereâ€™s a pinned post on this, but i just wanted to share what did and didnâ€™t help me. 

things that helped 

- talking to friends - my 2 friends have been super supportive of me. just 1 good friend is better than 20 bad ones.

- the internet, specifically twitter - this honestly sounds crazy, but itâ€™s made me realize that tons of people like everything i do and just want to help. (make sure to mute some stuff first)

- finding a hobby or club - iâ€™m really into computers, so i take computer science classes. itâ€™s been nice to do stuff i like an hour every day. if thereâ€™s not a club you like, make one! you canâ€™t be the only person who wants it.

things that didnâ€™t help

- therapy - PLEASE DO NOT AVOID THIS!1!!!1 i just get uncomfortable talking about my feelings to a stranger every 2 months. 

- being guilt-tripped - "thatâ€™s selfish!!! think about your family!" um..... yâ€™all never helped i donâ€™t care lmao

- loneliness - i was the quiet kidâ„¢ for years and it was my worst phase. i still am, but trying to get out of it and iâ€™m already much happier. :)
