I don't really get how everyone else is ok.I don't think I could ever actually bring myself to suicide, but I think about it constantly. It's pretty much my first thought everytime I wake up. I feel like I got hit with a curveball being born into this life and I just don't think I'm strong enough to carry on. I'll probably not actually kill myself, but I want to.
