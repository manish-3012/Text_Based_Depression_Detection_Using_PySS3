Help(POSSIBLE TW!) 


Iâ€™ve reached out to my loved ones, the ones I thought I could trust. To no avail. 

Iâ€™ve sat and self harmed tonight for the first time in 4 years. I am really struggling to find a reason to carry on. 

I spoke to my older sister and she said â€œI wish I could tell you things get better but they just get worseâ€ 

I just canâ€™t get my head off the thoughts of fully ending things now. Whatâ€™s the point?
