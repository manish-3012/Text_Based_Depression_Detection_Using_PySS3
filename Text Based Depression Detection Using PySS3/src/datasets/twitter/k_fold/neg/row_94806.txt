I feel suicidal after a mistake I madeIt happened on May. I was going through hard times in my life and wanted someone to take my exam for me so I paid this website takemyclassesonline to take my exam but they didn't help me and when I asked for a refund they blackmailed me and threatened me with contacting my school. they contacted me from 3 different numbers from May to July. I'm still scared as shit if they're going to inform my school someday. It happened 3 months ago but I'm still scared as fuck and I'm honestly thinking of killing myself lately because of it, the last message from the guy was '' '' You will see whether i was bluffing or not ''
