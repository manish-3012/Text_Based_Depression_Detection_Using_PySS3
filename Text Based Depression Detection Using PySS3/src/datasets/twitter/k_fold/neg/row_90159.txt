I feel shity because the way i feelI am a 23 year old that do not have problems with my parents, but i dont have motivation for nothing and I get sad for nothing, and that makes me angry, Im uncapable of fall in love with anybody since my first love that i dumped because im so sacared of feel emotions.

In 2011 my grandmother died and i feel so guilt since that, and i know that is not my fault, but i keep get this image of her in the coffin, and i just cant control

Years after she died i thought this sadness was normal, and in 2015 i planned to kill myself, and i couldn't because i though in everyone in my life and i was so drunk that i blacked out. After that i had a relation with the only girl i ever loved and that ended in less than a month because of my mentals issues

After that i knew i need help and start to medicate myself with a professional, and im better now, im working doing all my things at university, but i dont know why, because i still not feeling pleasure in nothing, still an alcoholic and drug user, uncapable of having a emotional relationship, still have suicidal thoughts and all that with perfect friends, family and a confortable economic situation. 

I just don't belive in the idea of happiness
