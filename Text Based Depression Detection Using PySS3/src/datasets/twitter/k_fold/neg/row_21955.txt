Nobody caresI've become convinced that nobody really cares about me. I only have one friend and he's not really a friend but a "fair-weather friend". One that only wants my presence if we are doing something he wants to do. If I suggest doing something that I'd like to do I'm always put off. He'll say that he has stuff to do first then never gets back to me, even after saying he will. I have found it almost impossible to make any other friends. There's nothing left for me.
