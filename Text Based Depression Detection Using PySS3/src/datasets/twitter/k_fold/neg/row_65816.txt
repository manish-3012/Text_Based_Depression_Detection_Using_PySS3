I tried... and now my life is even worseI thought I could confide in a longterm close friend ( that I'm no longer talking to again) that I was feeling miserable, desperate to stop feeling that way. I told her I tried to kill myself on Saturday night but my friend/roommate stopped me. And she called the cops, and told my parents that I tried and that I had a drug and alcohol problem, which I do not.

So now my family won't ever trust me again, with decision making, money, being on my own. And the crisis center I went to wants to put me in inpatient, they insist and I had to plead and bargain that my roommate would watch me to go home that day. 

But I have to go back to register for counseling and psychiatry and what not and I'm not going to lie about how I feel, I can't do that to myself. And my friend is getting tired of watching me and being afraid to go out. Inpatient is the only thing I can do for everyone and it is the last thing I want to do.
