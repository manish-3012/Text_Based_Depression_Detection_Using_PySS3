I'm not going to kill myself butI am acting out. I have attempted before. Probably won't do it again because I hated everything that followed after. I can't eat and I'm relying on some guy to keep me afloat. I hate being at home. I hate my memories. It feels like I'm in limbo. I am only happy when I'm high. I'm not really asking for advice, I'm just in the grayest of areas.
