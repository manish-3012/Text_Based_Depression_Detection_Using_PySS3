Is it healthy to constantly wanting to die but not taking the steps to follow through? Instead i post on here feeling like an attention seeker because im too scared to kill myself. I post in unemployment my problems and i piss people off..God please take my life. Satan please take my lifeI want to tell you all i hope everything goes well for everyone who sees this. I dont care about myself. I lost everything in this pandemic. I already had lost my mom, dad, and grandma. Nobody else was there to where i can go to them because idk no one but them. I sleep outside now. 27 years old and pathetic at that. I gave up on myself. I came to the spot i slept in and got a letter saying dont sleep here, we called the police. You know what hurts even more? That instead of them just telling me in my face, they trying to threaten to call the police on me. Just call them dont threaten like that suppose to scare me. It rained hard around 5am. I slept under another area with shelter. Contemplating suicide but if i dont i ll be arrested eventually. Imagine someone so mad at u for sleeping outside after business hours having MORE than what you have. Even the police dont care if i slept over there but if the people say something then the police will get involved. I hope everybody have a happy holidays. I dont want nothing, i dont want any blessings, i just want to die before this year over. I wanna see my grandma again even though she turning in her grsve disappointed in everything i did after she died March 25 2010. The day after my birthday. If your family love u, hug them. If they love u, stick together. Because once they gone, they not coming back. Im sorry grandma, but i wanna take my life away....
