Honestly, i dont want to die, i just dont want to live either.title pretty much says it all, i dont want to have to work to have money, thats pretty much my issue, i want things out of life, but i just dont think i can handle "work" or a "job" , and the thought that i might end up homeless one day because of this makes me really scared and not want to live, but i know ill never take my own life, im a pussy. a failure. a nothing.
