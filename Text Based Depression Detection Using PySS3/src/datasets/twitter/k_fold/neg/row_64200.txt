I want to kill myselfIm in too much pain to go on. Nothings worth it. Ill never be a decent funcioning human being. All I can do is play video games and make my friends happy, which is great and all except the fact that its completley useless. Im not good at anything, nor do I have motivation or energy to improve even a little. Getting a knife, jumping off a bridge, getting runover, or hanging myself sounds like a good idea right now.
