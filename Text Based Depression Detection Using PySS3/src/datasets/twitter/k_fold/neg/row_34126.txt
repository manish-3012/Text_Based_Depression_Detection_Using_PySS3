im in a debt and it keeps growinghi. i took a loan for like 3k dollars in the beggining of the year. instead of national currency, i took it in dollars since i always buy goods from amazon etc.

first 3-4 months, i could pay the monthly thingy but right now i am jobless and there is a crisis in my country. nobody gives a job, even for low prices.

currency exchange rates are constantly rises up, right now, 1 dollar equals 5.2 national currency. at the beginning, it was 3.7. so, my debt increased a lot.

i am thinking of suicide because i cant pay that and my parents wouldn't forgive me for what i did. yeah, i will be a disgrace because i took a loan.

what should i do? please, give me suggestions.
