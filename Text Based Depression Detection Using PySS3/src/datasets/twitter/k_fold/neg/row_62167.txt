How to talk someone out of it?I saw a guy in my class post something concerning and since itâ€™s 5am and I was probably the first viewer on it, I messaged him. now Iâ€™m just in the process of talking him out of the decision. 

Is he even going to take me seriously? I used to be kinda mean to him. When I used to be in his same situation I had no desire to socialize &amp; get people attached to me so whenever heâ€™d say hi to me when weâ€™d pass each other Iâ€™d just mumble back and almost ignore him in a sense.
