I think I might kill myself on FridayI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll really go through with this but Iâ€™ve been planning this since last week and havenâ€™t felt any regret towards my decision so far. I kinda feel bad because Friday is my moms birthday but itâ€™s also the end of the quarter and my grades are horrible. I just canâ€™t face being that much of a disappointment for probably the 26th time. I donâ€™t know what I have to stay for. I have no friends(seriously, no friends. The only person I could consider a friend is my brother and heâ€™s leaving for the army in a couple weeks) I keep trying to think of things to stay for and anything I come up with is meaningless like a new video game, comic chapter, or tv series. Theyâ€™re all pointless things to stay alive for so it feels pointless for me to keep on going. Idk why I feel the need to post this. Maybe so that if I do it my family will see this and understand.
