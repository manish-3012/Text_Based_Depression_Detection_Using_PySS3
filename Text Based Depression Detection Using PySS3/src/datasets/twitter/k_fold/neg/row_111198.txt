they're not really there for youI've been struggling with extreme anxiety and stress for the past week, I can barely think of anything else that aren't my problems. So because we're still in confinement my family members have to deal with my stress, and today one of them told me that my anxiety was affecting the mood of everyone and that it was irrational and I should think about others. I know that my stress is irrational but I can't do anything about it, it's eating away at me, and now with this guilt on top of everything, it's unbearable. I just want to down an entire bottle of pills and go to sleep, I'm tired of living, there are no good things for me here anymore. Dying would be so much easier than dealing with everything so why not just do it? I know people would be sad but isn't it a little selfish of people not wanting you to stop suffering because they'd be sad?
