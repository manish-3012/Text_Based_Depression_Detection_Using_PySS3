last night b4 i went to sleep i was feeling extremely self h8ful, insecure, and felt like i needed to be punished and pay for being such a piece of shit.

 i was prescribed clodiline and they come in .1 mg tabs. bc of my age i was only supposed to take half of that .1mg, but i was feeling extra depressed last night so i took .2mg. which was like triple the amount i was supposed to take, (but not enough to od or even kill myself). i didnâ€™t care and went to sleep. 


then about 3 hours later i wake up &amp; leave my room bc it was extremelyy hot &amp; go to the living room. after being on the couch for a lil bit i felt a cut on my thigh being irritated, so i get up and go to the bathroom and clean it. but then after i clean it i feel extremely light headed and dizzy. 


now, i didnâ€™t want to fall on the fricking tile floor or toilet in the bathroom, so i walked to my living room &amp; started feeling moree light headed and dizzy and then I just fucking fall and land on my living room table. thankfully my dad was sleeping on the couch and helped me get up. but i was so fucking light headed i could hear immense ringing in my ears and kinda had trouble talking. 


anyways itâ€™s been like 5 hours since that happened and i still feel light headed when i get up and itâ€™s not as bad.


tl:dr i felt like i needed to pay/suffer for being such a worthless piece of shit so i took triple the medication i was prescribed &amp; ended up super dizzy, lightheaded, &amp; my ears were ringing immensely.
