The Emmengard Suicide ScaleHey friends,

I recently came across The Emmengard Suicide Scale. Emmengard is a website dedicated to Dissociative Identity Disorder, which I don't have, but I found their Suicide Scale helpful in helping me monitor my own feelings of suicide (I've sat around an 8 for as long as I can remember).

I hope this post doesn't get deleted, and helps you all in knowing when to ask for help.

Stay safe x

*NOTE: I have no affiliation to Emmengard. I just find the Scale useful to monitor my level of personal safety.
