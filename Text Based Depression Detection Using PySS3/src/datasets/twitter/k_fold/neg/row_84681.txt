What?!So Iâ€™m getting closer to doing it, and today I decided to look up what happens to my debt when I die. It still needs to be paid?! What the hell. It almost makes me want to live just so that my mom doesnâ€™t get saddled with my debt. 

Iâ€™m also making a list of the people who wouldnâ€™t care if I died. Itâ€™s really fueling the fire. Long long list of people who wouldnâ€™t care.
