UpdateSo if you guys haven't heard, I gave my cousin my gun, because I don't want to give up just yet. I lost track of time, it could be about a month since then, but it feels like a year has passed. 

Just about everyday, I wish I had it on me. I feel like an addict, and it sucks knowing I don't have it. Granted, there are other ways of ending it all, but I'm too scared other than ending it quick. Nothing's changed for the better, but yesterday I actually felt happy for an hour. I didn't dread going into work, and everything felt like it was going to be okay ; probably the best hour I've felt in a very long time. I wish I could feel like that again, but it gives me hope knowing I'm capable of feeling that way.  

Just know I'm okay now if anyone here cares. And if there's anyone here that is struggling, don't give up just yet hold it out. You can get through this too. I'm here to talk if anyone wants.
