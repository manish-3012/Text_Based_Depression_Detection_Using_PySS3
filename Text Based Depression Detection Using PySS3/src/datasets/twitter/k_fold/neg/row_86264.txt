Nobody seems to really careAll people do is misunderstand and they don't seem to really care what I'm going through either. I'm so angry all the time. This is why I think about just dying all the time because people never want to just listen to you. They always criticize you and they don't try to understand. Then I get really angry when I'm alone. Everytime I try to talk about my problems people only make me feel worse and then I just want to die. Nobody cares and don't try to say that they really do because if they do then they need to prove it and so far they've done the exact opposite of that. I'm done with people being insensitive and not understanding me.
