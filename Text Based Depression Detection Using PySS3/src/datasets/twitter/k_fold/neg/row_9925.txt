life doesnâ€™t feel real anymoreiâ€™m 17 and this is my first time posting on this sub but after venting to a few close people i feel like i just want to spill my negative thoughts somewhere and hopefully no one traces it back to me.
iâ€™m in high school and i do theater and i hope to do music for college.
i have a girlfriend and weâ€™ve been dating for about a month and half after knowing each other for 3 months.
every single day that iâ€™ve waken up so far doesnâ€™t feel real.
i use e-cigarettes every now and then and smoke weed from time to time but iâ€™ve taken a break from both for a while.
i feel like every single time i wake up, i have the same day on loop until the weekend. on the weekends i work my job that i got from a close family friend.
i have a show for theater coming up this Saturday and i keep forgetting my lines 
my manager called me and told me that i keep calling out too many days and heâ€™s worried that iâ€™m not working enough
my family is middle lower class and iâ€™m practically my own income so the fact that iâ€™ve been missing a lot of days makes me have less money in the long run.
for the past two weeks iâ€™ve been thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend in the future because i donâ€™t want her to think that iâ€™m interested
i just feel bad because sheâ€™s dating someone who looks like they donâ€™t have a care in the world.
i lost all of my emotions and i canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself.
i know itâ€™s a joke to say it but the only thing holding me back is the fact that my mom would be sad.
i donâ€™t want to do anything anymore.
i hate having to go to school and force myself to strive for a goal only to spend another 4 years in college
i just want to work on music but i have no time for it because of work.
i just want to run away from everything and everyone and just do music 
but i canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself.
i have no motivation in anything anymore.
i just wanted to vent somewhere, so thank you for this sub.
