I see my doctor WednesdayI get emotional breakdowns and anxiety and am being treated for bi-polar. I only get manic downs. I feel like I am wasting my life. I am tired of living. I would feel if I brought somone into my life I would just hurt them. I don't enjoy working. I enjoy sleeping. I am too tired to game or watch movies. I am just a waste of oxygen
