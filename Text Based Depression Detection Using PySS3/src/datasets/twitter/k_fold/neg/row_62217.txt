I'm numbwell this last month has been crazy. with a lot of new friends and tears and just trying to be the best I can... but it doesn't feel like enough. I have been depressed a lot even on my pills and now I find out my bf was asking a friend of ours for advice to break up with me. I just am tired of not being good enough.
