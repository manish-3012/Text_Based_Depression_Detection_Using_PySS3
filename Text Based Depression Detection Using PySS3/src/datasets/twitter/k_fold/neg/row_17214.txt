Trying to reach outI donâ€™t believe in much help anymore but I keep trying to reach out but everyone is to busy to care just leaves me on seen without saying anything these are straight up adults and I donâ€™t think anyoneâ€™s gonna help the pellle at church Iâ€™ve told talk to me more cos of everything I told them. I try to call my friends or whateever no one picks up or texts back later asking why just silence from everyone and it makes me feel so crap like my social worker has shown to me how unimportant the fact that Iâ€™m really suicidal and hasnâ€™t got round to tlakiing to anyone like I really am so against them talking to adults about this but the fact itâ€™s been 3 weeks and itâ€™s on her todo list further makes me believe how unimportant I am to anyone oh wel I wonâ€™t be mucha problem anymore Iâ€™m gonna stop trying and when I do Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m gonna lose everything and one further but if thatâ€™s what will happen did I ever really matter to them in the first place :/
