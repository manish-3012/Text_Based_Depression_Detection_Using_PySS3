I need help, I have no motivation and most of the time I feel like whatâ€™s the point.I donâ€™t know if youâ€™d consider this suicidal because itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m thinking of killing myself, I just sometimes wish I could just stop existing. I feel sad all the time and I canâ€™t motivate myself to do much of anything, other than walk my pup because I know sheâ€™s relying on me. I have an amazing husband but that just makes me feel worse that I canâ€™t seem to help myself. 
I feel worthless and Iâ€™m tired of having to fight. Iâ€™ve had to for a lot of my life. My parents broke up when I was 7 because he was â€œback on the crackâ€, heâ€™s a crackhead and Iâ€™ve been told this most of my life. At 12 I was molested by a â€œfamily friendâ€ and then my step dad kicked us out because he didnâ€™t believe me. I went to stay with my sister where I was raped by her husband, so I went back home with my mom to live with my step dad again. The â€œfamily friendâ€ was still welcomed. At 16 I had an abortion and pretty much lived at the my boyfriends house. At 19 I started dating a new guy, who was emotional and physically abusive, I stayed with him for almost 5 years. He broke me down, called me a whore and told me my mom loved my step dad more than me and I believed him. When I started dating my husband, he was such a change from everything I knew before. He truly is an amazing man and all he wants to do is help me. But I feel Iâ€™m unworthy of him and he deserves better. 

I feel broken.
