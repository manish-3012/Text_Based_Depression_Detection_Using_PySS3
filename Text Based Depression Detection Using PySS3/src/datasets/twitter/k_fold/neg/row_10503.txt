I wanna die. I just want to die right nowWhy can't something fall and crush me? Why can't I just choke and die? Why can't I just not wake up in the morning? Why can't I just fucking die?????
I'm so fucking over everything. I keep telling myself it'll be okay but I don't know if it will be. The semester is over next week and I'm so fucking scared I'm going to fail my classes. My anxiety has prevented me from doing so many assignments and my depression prevents me from going to get shit done. My professor is emailing me now and telling me if I don't get all this shit done I'll probably fail the class. Not to mention I'm literally broke and not getting hours at work plus I've been sick and haven't been able to work. I've had 2 panic attacks in the last 2 weeks, one I'm recovering from right now....... can't stop shaking.....
I can't handle all this shit
I just want to die I want to end it all why won't it stop? I can't handle everything life is asking from me but I can't bring myself do do it. I could fill my fist with pills but I'll sob too hard before I'm able to swallow them. I could put a knife to my wrist but I'll have another panic attack before I'm able to slice it. I could tie a belt around my neck but panic before I figure out where to tie it. Why does school do this to me why does work want me broke why can't I just die???? Someone just come kill me please. I can't take the horrible thoughts the endless anxiety the just moderate expectations that I can't seem to meet. I'm shit and I deserve to die I want to die. Fuck it all
