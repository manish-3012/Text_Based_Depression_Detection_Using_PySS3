Online friend sends last message implying suicide and then never replies againI don't know what to do. She has been suicidal and depressed for years, I always told her to reach out but she kept on telling me that mental health care wasn't a thing in her country. I don't know where she is located because she didn't tell me, I don't know her full name, nor anything about her family or friends. She mentioned russia a while ago but when I mentioned it she said she wasn't there anymore. I had to talk her out of multiple attempts throughout our chats but this time she just left a message saying that she is tired and will leave forever. I spammed her with suicide hot lines and messages but she didn't even read them. It's not the first time I am facing the suicide of someone but I don't know what I will do if she genuinely went with it. Is there anything else I can do? 
My guilt is killing me.
