I want to go backOblivion released, we're kids, me and my old friend who only met up 2 weeks once a year in the summer would play it nonstop all day. We'd only take breaks to eat lunch and dinner, together we immersed ourselves into a fantastical world where we could be free to do whatever we wanted. We did the same thing next year and the year after that. 

Now roughly a decade since we grew up and lost contact I've yet to feel that sense of freedom and happiness. I've no longer got any friends, I'm all alone and no amount of games I've played alone can grant me that wondrous feeling I once shared with my friend. 

I want to die.
