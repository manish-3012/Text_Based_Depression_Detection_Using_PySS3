Why is death so hard?I'm tired of life... I just drunk a bunch of poison and I'm still not dead... I researched what should be a lethal amount and I'm still here? Why hasn't it killed me? I feel awful but I'm not dead...

So far the only thing that's happened is it caused my boyfriend to leave me. Said he couldn't deal with me hurting myself anymore. But it doesn't really matter. I already wanted to die that just gives me one more reason to want to leave this horrible world.
