Tuesday will be my final dayIâ€™ve been contemplating it for a long while now. 
I started off as a happy kid. Somehow over the years my mind turned into this negative shithole that cannot look at anything in a positive light anymore. Iâ€™m too selfish, Iâ€™m too paranoid.

I continue to make horrible mistakes that hurt the people I truly love and care about. This is something I cannot live with. Iâ€™ve made them suffer. I never ever mean to hurt them. I try my hardest to make a change but I always end up falling back and hurting them harder unwillingly. I try everything. But all I do is make these people suffer. I donâ€™t want to. I really donâ€™t.

I feel at this point nothing will work.No matter how hard I try to fix things, I end up failing and hurting my people more. No matter how hard I try to pick myself back up, things get shittier. Itâ€™s like I wonâ€™t ever be able to bring myself back up.

My life is going to go nowhere. I do art occasionally when I can bring myself to, I wanted to make a career out of it but I know Iâ€™ll never reach that with how lazy I am and how easily and oftenly I give up on it.

I believe there is no other option now now.

Tomorrow Iâ€™d like to just go say my final apologies to everyone (like theyâ€™d even matter at this point), and then head over to the highway bridge near my house and end it all.

I just donâ€™t want to bring my loved ones more sadness by killing myself. But I feel at this point I will hurt them even more if I continue to live and be my shitty self.

It feels weird to not be posting this on a throwaway because itâ€™s not like it matters now
