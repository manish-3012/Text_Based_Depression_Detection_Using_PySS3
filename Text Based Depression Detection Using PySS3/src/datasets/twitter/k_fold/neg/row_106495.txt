I've failedAs a student: I've failed my first year of uni and I don't know what to do, I failed one exam because I panicked and one because I tried to kill myself the night before, filled in a mitigating circumstances letter but got so scared I couldn't even leave the house without throwing up 
As a friend: idk how to support people or empathise with their problems, like I want to care but I j don't, I basically told 2 friends to leave me alone because I can't handle being near people rn, idk about one of them but the other one is doing a lot better than they used to and I've never been this bad in 3 years, so being near her feels so wrong, other friends I've had in the past j leave without a reason why as well
I'm also boring as fuck and hate socialising so there's that
As a son: I don't love my parents, I want to but I have no emotional attachment to them whatsoever, they've sacrificed things for me and I'm grateful but I j don't like being near them
The only thing I look forward to in life is playing a game that I love sm but I suck at it and get angry at myself for sucking, I get angry at myself for everything and it's always bc of something stupid, still makes me pull at my hair and relapse though
I'm prob not even going to try and kill myself tonight tbh, just wanted to vent at no one in particular, I will do soon though so if I do cya
