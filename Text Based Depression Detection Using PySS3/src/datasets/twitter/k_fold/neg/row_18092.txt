Don't waist your time, I'm just being a whining little bitch.I'm 19 year old girl. 

The only thing I want to do in life is to live in my imagination.
I put on a mask every day, it is getting harder every day.

I don't like the world, I hate people (myself to). We people are so stupid and we are destroying the planet and killing all the other animals and destroying their homes. 

I have no reason what so ever to be so angry and sad. I have no reason to hate living. But I do. I hate my live, I don't want to live at all.

I have a loving family, some good friends, all that shit. 
But I feel so alone all the time, and I hate it, and love it at the same time. Maybe because I am alone most of the time. I moved away from my friends, here I donâ€™t fit in at all (not that I like fitting in, but it would be nice to have someone with me that does not either fit in).

I'm not doing good in school, not at all. I think, all the other teachers and my classmates hate me, think Iâ€™m stupid. It does not bother me that much. 

I have always believed in magic, all that stuff. That someday someone is going to introduce me to that beautiful world that is not known to us "normal" humans. Where dragons fly around, where wizards are boiling some mysterious shit, people live in peace with mother earth, some can fly, some can go through walls. There is no time, water falls upwards and all that silly stuff. It is so sad that I know that this will never come true, it breaks my heart that I have to live in the "normal" world all my life.

Oh and I always think people are laughing at me when I here someone laughing near me, and I do belief that someone can read my thoughts, I'm always on guard. 

So, this is long enough. I have decided that I am going to kill myself. I just don't know when yet.

I was going to do it before my youngest sister became old enough to remember me, so I would not ruined her life. But it is too late for that now.


**Tl;dr: I'm going to freaking kill myself someday.**
