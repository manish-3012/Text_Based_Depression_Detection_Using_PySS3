Death is so appealing to me.The comforting feeling. 

I am tired, drained. I feel empty, weak, nothing left inside. I have been struggling with social phobia and depression since i was 11, and 17 years later, nothing has changed. 
I started therapy one and a half years ago. The worst thing that could happen, happened to me, transference. I have developed very significant feelings for my therapist. I got so attached that it hurts so much, knowing that she does not feel the same for me. We discussed this issue, many times, even though she tried to help me, it made things only worse.  

I experienced so much pain in my life, so much suffering, and this is the final blow. My scars are open again, i am more vulnerable than ever. Therapy was my last chance, and life failed me again. I am so depressed, so sad, it is so dark right now that i can't see the light of life. Death is so appealing to me. 
I cant seem to find joy, and tried so hard. Life is not for me, not for someone who is weak. There is no place for people like us.
The only thing that keeps me going, ironically, is the comforting feeling that one day i will take matters in my own hands, i will end it all, i will be at peace at last. Every night i am dreaming about the day that i will sleep forever, every morning when i wake up i get depressed that i am still alive. I have no idea why i am writing this, it's just, i don't have anybody else. It is sad to die without knowing the feeling of being loved, isn't it?
I have never been so close. I wish to die. That will be the moment when i will be truly happy, i will be at peace. Watching the sun set as i set in to darkness.
