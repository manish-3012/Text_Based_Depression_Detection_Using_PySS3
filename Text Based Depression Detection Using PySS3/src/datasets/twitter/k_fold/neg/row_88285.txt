I've set a goal to help motivate myselfI need something to help motivate myself. I've spent the last 2 months feeling basically lost, and it's about time I change that. In the next 6 months I intend to save at least $10,000; obtain some sort of employment that will provide me with at least $35,000 in income annually; have surgery to repair my hip; have my heart diagnosed and treated; and get myself in shape again including regaining a 6-pack, cutting my body fat to no more than 10%, and   increasing my total weight to at least 210 lbs. If I can accomplish this goal, then I intend to reward myself with a trip out of the country. I love to travel, and I've always wanted to do more of it. I always have a reason not to though whether it be financial or otherwise. For once I'm going to put aside any and all reasons not to go, and I'm just going to go for it! I will spend New Years Eve in another country no matter what it takes... preferably with someone to accompany me.
