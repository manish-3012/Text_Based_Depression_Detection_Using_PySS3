I don't even know what I want...I don't know why I just don't end it all. I've been put on medicine for my depression, and it's helped some but I still have these nights where I feel like going to do something about killing myself. The thing is, I don't know what I do want in life... I just want there to not be life in me anymore. I'm already dead inside... Why is it going to be such a big deal if I'm dead on the outside too? My life is meaningless. I lose every friend I make because they can't stand to listen about my depression... I don't know what else to talk about unless they want to talk about Dota 2, which no one where I'm from has even heard of.

I'm only writing here because I'm beginning to be afraid of myself. I feel like I'm going to push myself away like everyone else does to me, and I don't know how I could deal with that..
