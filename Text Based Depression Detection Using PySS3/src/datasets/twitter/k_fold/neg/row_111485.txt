I want out of this clownworldI'm a trainee high school teacher about to graduate and while I love mentoring and helpin young people I feel like I'm hopeless. I'm constantly fucking up in class and feel like I'm more of a burden to my supervisor and to my students who have end of year exams coming up shortly. In terms of finding a job I got unlucky in that the previous shortage of teachers is now an oversupply with teachers returning from overseas due to Covid taking jobs up. All my family is overseas but Covid is very bad over there and with the political situation looking worse and worse it's not an option plus they have issues and a different mindset to myself. I want to have hope, keep going, be strong and independent etc. But I also got to eat, pay rent and keep on top of mounds of paperwork. I really don't wanna kill myself but I'm starting to see no other option. If I don't reply to this thread let this be the explanation why: too many things keep going wrong too often
