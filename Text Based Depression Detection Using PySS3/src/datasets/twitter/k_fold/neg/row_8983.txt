whyMy mom looked through all my stuff on my phone and now everyone in my family knows that I'm gay. My dad thinks I'm faking it and I know he thinks I'm some sort of crazy person now and that I'm gonna go to hell. I can tell my brother looks at me differently but he isn't saying anything. My Mom hates me because she found messages i had sent to my friends about her and a private rant that I had written about her (shes kinda abusive) I had to block all contact with my friends so she couldn't look through the rest of my messages with them.  I've always kinda thought about killing myself and idk it seems like everyone hates me and things are in a horrible place right now. My parents are fighting my mom is gonna try to leave and take me with her to who knows where. I know everybody has always been kinda annoyed by me and I kinda just feel like ending it all and just being done with this shit for good. But  I'm probably just making a big deal about this like I always do though but I just wanted to post here to vent and stuff.
