I feel like i dont even deserve to feel bad, let alone goodIve been on reddit for over 6 years and ive posted off and on consistently for those six years. Since i was 19 years old... but nobody would know because i constantly get depressed and anxious, and then i delete everything. Looking at my reddit account reminds me a lot of my life. I have nothing after 25 (almost 26) years of life.

My anxiety stunted me emotionally and socially for most of my life, and yeah, now i have it under control. But its too late. Ive never been in a real relationship and i never will be. Heck, i dont even have but like 3 friends. Being alone, unable to make or keep lasting relationships has cause what used to be a fairly manageable amount of depression to skyrocket. Its killing me, i can barely take it anymore.

I have constant pain in my chest. It just hurts too much to be awake, so much so that ive started drinking basically all day now. I just cant be awale all day with this pain, i cant take it. And i know, im being dumb and self centered. Im only 25, i have a decent job, blah blah blah. Idk, it makes me feel even worse knowing i probably should have these feelings but i just cant get rid of them. 

Id just like a win, just one. But i dont see one coming my way :/ and im not going to force my self to struggle on for years and years just to die when im 70, sad and alone, when i can do that now.
