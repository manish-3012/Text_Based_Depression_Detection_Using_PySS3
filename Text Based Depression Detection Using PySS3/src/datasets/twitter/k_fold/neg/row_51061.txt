HelpEveryday i say to myself thisâ€™s it. Whatâ€™s the point of living like this, hitting, cutting, crying myself to sleep. My arms is running out of horizontal space to cut. I need a external pain so i can numb the pain inside of me. I live 2 life, no one know im depressed and I wouldnâ€™t dare to tell anyone. Whoâ€™d want to be with a loser. Come on universe, how else would you break me down, Im already broken. I dont do anything anymore. Living in zombie state of mind. Emptiness is all i know, looking out window like a vegetable, waiting for the next cut. Everyday i come here to stop other from committing suicide while i cant even stop myself...what a hypocrite right?

I have friends yes, but theyâ€™re all wearing mask. Im not in a relationship for a while and im not planning to. I live alone in foreign country, thousands of miles from my family. If im gone theyre gonna be looking for me forever. That thought scared the living hell out of me. However, if they know that i kill myself theyre gonna be living in hell for the rest of their life. I cant go like this. I cant be this selfish. But im so tired. Im such a coward who couldnâ€™t let it go. Tbh im afraid of dying, especially dying alone. But im more scared of living without propose. Im trapped here, i want to die but I couldnâ€™t let go. Please help
