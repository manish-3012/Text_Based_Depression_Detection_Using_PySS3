I have no idea what i am doing wrongI have a good life, i am 19 (soon 20), work a lot anywhere from 0700-1630, i train a lot to, both handball and strength.

But anytime i try to contacts friends, i always get answers like they are busy with something, are soon gonna go somewhere or the worst is when i get no answer at all.

I have no idea what i am doing wrong, is it because i joke alot, am i trying to help myself with joking? Am i a special person but have not noticed it myself? Because this happened all the time, please what can i do?
