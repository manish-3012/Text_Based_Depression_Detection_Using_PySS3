This world is a messIsolated from friends. Capitalist dystopia with technology ever increasing. All that matters is if you have money or not. Housing crisis and Brexit. Educated friends all with more than me. Not happy. Hate what society expects of us all. Hate that government welfare impoverishes so many. Hate the inequality. Hate my rich cousins who don't care. Hate, hate, hate that's all I have become. I'm angry all the time at my situation. This world is so fucked up. What is there to look forward to if you don't have money in this world? I'll fucking tell you. Subsistence.
