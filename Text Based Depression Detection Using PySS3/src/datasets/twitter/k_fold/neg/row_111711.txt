I saw two friends today.Ex teammates actually. They came and watched my game. One has been paralyzed for a year, the other lost his brother in a train accident about a week ago. 

The first time i looked over they were laughing to each other. I thought to myself if those two have things to smile about then I have no goddamn reason to be upset.
