I actually asked for help, for once.They ignored me.

The only person I had ever told how I truly feel completely blew me off when I asked for them to help me. I don't even know how to feel about this yet. I messaged them an hour ago, and again twenty minutes ago. They read both and just left me. I already knew everyone else wanted me out of their life. If you did too you could've just said.
