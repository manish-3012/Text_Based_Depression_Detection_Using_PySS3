planning on shooting myself in the head by the railroad tracks tonightim planning on getting my grandparents gun and shooting myself in the head behind my house.
my parents are drug addicts who dont love me, my grandparents are fostering me because of this reason.i dont have any real friends. i lived with my great grandfather for 13 years, he molested me when i was little and a few years ago he got parkinsons and i had to change his diapers and deal with him locking me in rooms because he was hallucinating. my mom was giving me meth when i was with her, i barely had food, didnt have clothes. ive tried 20 different medications and have been hospitalized 3 times over the past 2 years.
im just done. i dont want to feel this anymore.
