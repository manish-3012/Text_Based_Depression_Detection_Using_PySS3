I gave up on everything, why live?I am 18 and I already gave up on everything. I don't get why I should live, I am wasting my time on doing nothing, I am in bed all day or playing video games, I stopped eating, what can I even do anymore? I'm boring. I'm not important to anyone. I have 1 friend, which I had feelings for and they rejected me yesterday. I didn't feel happiness for at least 5 years... I tried making new friends but I keep on driving people away because I'm depressed and boring as hell. Hell, even my dog hates me. I am considering killing myself, but I don't want my family(and that friend) to feel bad that I did it, I don't have anymore hope in my life, I don't think I'll ever be happy in any way. I am suicidal for at least 3 years now and I harm myself for around 2 years now, 2 years ago I was in an abusive relationship which is what got me to start self harm, my brother, until 2 months ago, used to hit me whenever he wanted to. I'm about to drop out of highschool(last year) because I can't get myself out of my room, I have a therapist for 3 years now and nothing changed in a good way. And meds don't help. I just think I'm worthless and nobody cares about me, but people WILL care if I kill myself, right? Maybe that's the only option for me.
