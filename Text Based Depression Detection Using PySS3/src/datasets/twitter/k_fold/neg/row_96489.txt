I can't stop contemplating suicide...Over the past few months I've been contemplating suicide about 2-3 times a week on average, sometimes more, sometimes less. I can tell you my whole life story but that wouldn't do any good.
If I am happy during the day and something turns around I suddenly start thinking about suicide. I really don't even know what to say anymore, I can barely think. I am typically stuck in an emotional purgatory state, I am not happy nor sad, however in an instant I can snap and become extremely depressed or pretty happy.
