TodayToday I almost killed myself. I was alone at work and I grabbed an exacto knife. For a brief moment all I could think about was how much I hate my life and how easy it would be to end it all. I was able to -for a brief moment- stifle the thoughts about how much it would destroy my friends and family. It was all about me, and what I wanted. And I wanted to die.

&amp;#x200B;

But here I am, I've never come so close before. I've wanted to die for a while now, but always thought I was safe because deep down I can't bear the thought of what it would do to the people I care about. Today though, I could have done it. It made me realize that I am fighting a losing battle. I thought I would always be strong enough to weather the storm, and so far I have been. But today was different.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've decided to make a throwaway account to document my feelings. You can read them if you like but this is meant to be documentation of my mental state in hopes that when I do give in my friends and family can find this and at least have some answers.

Today's question: Why do I want to die?

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought about this a lot. I have lots of friends. I have an awesome family. I think I'm a pretty good person. I respect myself. I love myself. I feel like these points contradict the stereotypical borderline suicidal person. But here I am, and I want to die because I know that there is virtually no future where I can be happy. How can I be so certain of this? Because the only time I've ever felt truly happy was when I was with the person I love.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I don't believe they were the "one". In fact all evidence seems to point to the contrary. But they were the only person I have ever truly connected with. I've thought about this for years and I think part of it is because they were one of only a handful of people I've met that can keep up with me intellectually. God that sounds so arrogant and I hate writing it, but I'm not writing this for you to like me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the point is that for whatever reason, I can't really connect with anyone. I'm really good at making people like/love me, hence all my friends. But I really suck at loving other people. I've met thousands of people over more than a decade, and if the person I love is a ten then best I've seen since is a three. So here I am living life at a three cursed with the knowledge of what a ten is like, and that it will probably never happen again.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you are reading this because in a moment of weakness and selfishness I decided to kill myself, I want you to know that it is in no way your fault. I was constantly tormented by dreams that could never come true, as well as the inability to make new dreams that could. Even if there is nothing after death I am still in a better place.
