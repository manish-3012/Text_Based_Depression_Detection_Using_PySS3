The void taunts and teases meI lost my fucking job. It was a stupid, silly serving job but it was all a part of my plan. I want to leave this stupid town, I hate it here. I feel ostracized and on display, it's too small too tight. I hope somewhere else will be different but it probably wont, I'm a fucking mess and I destroy everything around me, different setting wont change that. I want to break my sobriety,  I want to take so many pills I float off into Neverland and NEVER come back. I know people would care but man I've fucked every single one of them in some type of way, such forgiving fools. And I DONT FUCKING CARE. But if i really wanted to try killing myself again i wouldn't even be questioning it, I would just do it. Some part of me wants to live, wants to see what else life is gonna give me. Because I live for the high and nothing beats the high of really, truly living. But it's so goddamn hard to be happy, there is constant pressure, constant judgement, constant pain. I feel vulnerable and weak and trashy. If it's not pills, its alcohol, if it's not alcohol its sex,  I need a rush to block out the never ending sinking feeling, the thick darkness that wraps itself around me. It's silly, how much my astrology prevails, even in suicide. A libra through and through, the scales ever tipping. Maybe I'm just a fucking pussy. I dont want to be a pussy, I just dont want to be here
