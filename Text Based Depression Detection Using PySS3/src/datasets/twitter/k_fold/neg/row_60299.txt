Thinking about ending all this.Hey guys, Iâ€™m new at this but the thing is I never thought that some day I could want end my life.

This whole thing started after I broke up with my girlfriend... Iâ€™m not seeing any point in keep living without her, Iâ€™m not seeing any reason why should I keep loving myself since I might never be with her again...

Iâ€™m thinking about this too much I kinda have it planned, Iâ€™m thinking about throwing myself from a building and the only thing that is stopping me form doing it, is just because Iâ€™ll meet up with her next week and Iâ€™ll try to get her back, but at the same time Iâ€™m thinking that this wonâ€™t work and she will say no.

And if she says no, I donâ€™t know what to do with my life and probably after this Iâ€™ll jump.
