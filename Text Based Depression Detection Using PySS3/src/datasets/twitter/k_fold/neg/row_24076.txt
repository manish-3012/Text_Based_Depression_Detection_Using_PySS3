I just donâ€™t know why to doIâ€™m sorry this is so messy, I just kinda give up. Ever since lockdown, and before then, Iâ€™ve felt like Iâ€™m utterly worthless. I moved right before locked down and went to my new school for two weeks before lockdown. I feel like I canâ€™t do anything right, i been considering suicide almost every day now. My mom keeps telling me stuff like â€œa lot of kids are getting depressed right now, tell me if you areâ€ in such a way and tone that itâ€™s a game. She expects me to be perfect in school, I hate her bf. He expects me to prefect, have a ton of friends and play sport after sport. This isnâ€™t all but I guess thatâ€™s all I feel comfortable saying. I just donâ€™t want to be here, I miss my friends even if I was hated at school. I want to get help again, but I donâ€™t want to say anything to my mom or dad. I donâ€™t know what to do.
