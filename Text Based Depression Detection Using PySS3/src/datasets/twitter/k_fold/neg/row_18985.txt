My plan is falling into place.I convinced my doctor to prescribe me zopiclone again. So now I have a bottle of them. They're a pretty potent sleeping pill if you don't know. I have taken one and I feel pretty spaced out already. Now I want to take the rest.
I don't know how to say goodbye to everyone without seeming over dramatic. But I don't want anyone to think I don't care. But I guess I don't, I'm being selfish. I don't really know what I'm doing or what I want anymore. I'm just tired. And a really long sleep is exactly what I need.
