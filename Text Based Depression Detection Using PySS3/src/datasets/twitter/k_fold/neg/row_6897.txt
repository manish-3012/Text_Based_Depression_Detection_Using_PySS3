I am still suffering and I don't even want to hope that it will get better for me anymore.My life is structurally bad, all I do everyday is just sit infront of my computer watching YouTube videos, being on this subreddit and reading some posts, playing some games occasionally and just using Internet in general. I am also still failing studying in my college trying to do all things that I need to do, but I don't really have that much motivation to do them really. And all of that makes my life look like absolutely worthless in almost every aspect. Also, as I said many times before in my previous posts that I want to create my own first game, well, turns out that its very daunting to make a game while being depressed and living like that, having zero experience in making games and coding, receiving almost no feedback on what I am doing and making my game free for everyone to play, which means that I won't gain anything for it. And because of that, I am thinking of just giving up on this game and just straight up killing myself instead. Noone really would give a half of a tiniest microfuck in existence about me or my game if I make it. Please, God, life or whatever let me atleast just die on my first attempt, I am not asking for that much.
