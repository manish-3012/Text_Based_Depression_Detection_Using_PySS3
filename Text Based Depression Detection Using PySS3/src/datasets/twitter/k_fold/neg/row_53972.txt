Turning 18 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­Ok so I turn 18 in a few weeks and Iâ€™m so so scared ever since I was 16 Iâ€™ve been telling myself Iâ€™m going to end my life when Iâ€™m 18 Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 10 and I tried to take my life at 11. Iâ€™m not ready to be a adult Iâ€™m emotionally around 14 I donâ€™t drink, smoke, work or do anything adult like I left school due to severe anxiety I just donâ€™t wanna loose that safety of being a minor it scares me Iâ€™ve always had a problem with growing up since I was young. My inner voice  in my head is telling me I need to kill myself I didnâ€™t plan to make it this far in life hence why I donâ€™t care about my future. I just feel like my time is up I physically donâ€™t want to be here anymore the thought of living makes me feel sick. I just want to be at peace away from everything. Iâ€™m nothing I have no looks, Iâ€™m a skinny twig all my life growing up I was picked on for how thin I was and my looks now because of that I suffer from BDD I feel like Iâ€™m the ugliest girl alive I look in the mirror up to 50 times a day Iâ€™m constantly taking photos of face then I cry because of It. I donâ€™t go outside because Iâ€™m scared people will hate me and Iâ€™m always wearing my hood up Iâ€™m just so paranoid about everything I canâ€™t keep living like this itâ€™s draining me ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­idk what to do please any advice Iâ€™m at my last point
