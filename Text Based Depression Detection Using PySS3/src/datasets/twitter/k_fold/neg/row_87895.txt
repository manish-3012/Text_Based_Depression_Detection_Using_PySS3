What type of life insurance do you need for your children if suicide is a possibility?Anyone have a plan already set up that can share some tips? Found or recommend a plan maybe? I know some do not pay on suicides if it happens within 2 years.  How much is a good amount to leave behind? I figure if I'm going to part ways with the earth I should have a life insurance policy to ease the pain of me leaving. 

I'm thinking a nice hotel-some sleeping pills, handful or 3 of  benzos  some alcohol, then drift off silently.
