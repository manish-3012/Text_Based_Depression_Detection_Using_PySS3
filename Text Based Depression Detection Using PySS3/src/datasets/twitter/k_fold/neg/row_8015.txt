Trying to stay strong but don't know what my options are and I don't want to throw my life away.I've had a long history with depression and anxiety and usually I'm able to push through until things stabilize again and enjoy life until the next wave hits. Another wave hit a few weeks ago and this one hit hard. Hard enough that it was the first time I've taken action and woke up next to a a spilt bottle of pills and vodka and dry heaved for about an hour before calling into work sick the next two days. This scared the shit out of me. Scared me enough that I haven't touched alcohol in the past two weeks. But I still feel just as bad as I did that day and I don't want whatever snapped inside of me that night to happen again. 

About six months ago I started a new job. I knew it would be a challenge but it was an opportunity I couldn't turn down. Lately I can barely make myself show up to even fill the spot at the desk. You know when you just made a huge mistake and feel your stomach tighten up? That's how I feel all the time. My depression is affecting my performance which makes me feel even worse, and I know people are noticing. I want to do better but I just can't right now, and I'm afraid they'll either find someone that can do better or I'll drive myself to snap again. I don't want to feel like a failure and certainly not because of my stupid brain. 

But I don't know what my options are. If I keep grinding I'm afraid I'll snap again soon. If I leave I'll ruin this opportunity and possible future ones because I'm leaving after only 6 months for unclear reasons. 

I don't want to throw my career away but I never want to end up where I was a couple of weeks ago again either. And I don't know how to do both right now.
