Right when I thought my life couldnâ€™t get any worse my grades come outThis is my first semester in uni and I had to do it online because of the whole Covid thing. And most my classes were really late cause I live in a different time zone and thereâ€™s an 8 hour time difference so I never really got any sleep cause I finish classes at around 1-2 am and I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning for work and for the college here in my home country. Iâ€™ve been struggling with my mental health throughout the entire semester and it really effected how productive I was and I knew I wasnâ€™t gonna do well but I thought Iâ€™d at least pass. I somehow managed to fail 4/5 subjects I was taking in the university and one of the two subjects I was taking in my college. And Iâ€™m in a situation where I might get expelled from the university and Iâ€™ll have to stay here in a homophobic country (Iâ€™m gay and if anyone here found out Iâ€™ll get the death sentence immediately because they donâ€™t mess around when it comes to these things) and that university was my only escape from here. 
I guess Iâ€™m just at the point where not only do I not have any reasons to live but I also have a lot of reasons why not to live and the idea of finally doing it seems like the only solution now and is probably the only way out of this mess I put myself in. 
Thereâ€™s no one to blame here but me because I obviously bit off way more than I can chew and itâ€™s probably the main reason Iâ€™m here right now. 
I guess Iâ€™m just tired of waking up every morning and trying to get somewhere in life but I just end up setting myself further back with every passing day. 
I guess the only thing thatâ€™s stopping me is the fact that Iâ€™m scared
