My time has comeI have finally come to the realization that I'm not cut out for life. I hate everything about it, so much pressure, responsibilities, and agony. It would be one thing if I could actually enjoy some part of life but nothing about it gives me any joy or hope. I don't feel anything but suffering anyways so not feeling anything at all would be an improvement. I don't know if it's my DNA, brain structure, or just cruel luck. Only thing I can say is that growing up I knew what happiness was, but now, it's just bleak bleak and meaningless. Those going through things or just living life still have this ability to "feel" to cope with stress and worries seemlessly more efficiently then me, I'm a mental mess and I just want out. Hanging myself is the way I'm going to go about it, may not be painless but I'll willing to through those couple minutes of excruciating pain because it'll save me a lifetime of misery.
