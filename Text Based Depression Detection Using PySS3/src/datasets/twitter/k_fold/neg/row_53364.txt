Iâ€™m scaredThe last couple months my girlfriendâ€™s cutting has gotten worse and she tells me about how she wants to kill herself. Itâ€™s been getting worse every day and it feels like no matter what I tell and try my best to comfort her she isnâ€™t getting any better. She tells me about how sheâ€™s scared that one day she might actually do it while in the moment caught up in the emotions and how she might do something sheâ€™ll regret. She has pretty bad anxiety and depression, something I canâ€™t relate to and understand as well as other people. I try to love her as best I can and be there for her, and I donâ€™t want her to end her life just because of a single decision she isnâ€™t thinking through, I donâ€™t know how to help, or even if I can help. She tells me Iâ€™m her only reason to live but then it stresses me out that I donâ€™t know what I should be doing or if anything is working. I just want to help get her through this.
