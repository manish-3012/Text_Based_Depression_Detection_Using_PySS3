Hopeless Turns HilariousSo, my area has an "Emotional Support Line" here in Chicago IL. I just called to get some resources because I'm flat out of ideas of who next to avail myself to for a major issue vexing me. The person who answered was friendly, reassuring and calming. She sounded older but truly invested in my issue. We literally just talked for AN HOUR at the end of which, after giving me several good suggestions, she asked how I got her number. I said it was online. She said "I'm not online." 

I legit MIS-DIALED calling the Help Me Hotline and actually got help!!!! Pro-Life Tip: Next time you need someone to talk to - purposely misdial. It can't turn out any worse than the normally useless suicide hotlines and it may, as in my case, turn out way BETTER. Unbelievable. Only I could fuck up calling the Help Me Hotline, I swear.
