Why should I bother living when Iâ€™m never happy?My mom says Iâ€™m selfish for wanting happiness. Or at least to get rid of this mental illness. I had a mental breakdown in which I lost control of my body and my mom got really mad at me for it. My mental illness just ruined a four year long friendship because my mind decided to start seeing her as extremely annoying and condescending when they werenâ€™t meaning it. I feel like a piece of shit every day. I feel like Iâ€™m already suffocating and when I donâ€™t have access to my coping methods I feel like dying. I want to break my fucking skull on the concrete. If Iâ€™m not doing something with my life I become suicidal. Iâ€™m gonna slowly lose all my friends because of this. I want to die. â€œGUH HUH GO TO A PSYCHIATRISTâ€ I have already been to fucking six of them. Nothing works. I have an incurable mental illness. And Iâ€™ve taken at least 6 different medications for it. I have no reason to live anymore and no resources. I want to cut my stomach open and rip my innards out. I want to fucking die. I deserve it.
