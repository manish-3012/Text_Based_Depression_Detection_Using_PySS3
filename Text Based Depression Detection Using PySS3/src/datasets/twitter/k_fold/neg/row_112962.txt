3 trips to hospital in 2 monthsWell, I never expected to be in a psych ward twice, let alone once in my life. But then who would have thought I would have debilitating depression and anxiety? 

Long story short, I got admitted 11/11, exactly 2 months from 9/11. I had a panic attack before an exam and took 3 mg klonopin at once instead of 1 mg twice daily. I was off balance (still am actually) and sounded drunk. I went to the ER where they cleared me. 

Except that maybe this would have been an attempt. It was to help my anxiety, sure, but I wanted to experiment what the overdose effects would be. I wanted to talk 4 mg but only did 3 because I would scared. 

I feel like this will be my life in an unending cycle until I die. First it was just fleeting thoughts. Then anxiety, then bad depression with suicide thought, then self harming and actually carrying out an action. I just know it will get worse until I kill myself and this wonâ€™t be the last time at the psych ward
