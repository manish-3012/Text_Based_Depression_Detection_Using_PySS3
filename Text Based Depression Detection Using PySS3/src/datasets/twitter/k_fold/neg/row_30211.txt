I tried hanging myself this morning.I woke up from a nightmare about a friend of mine, I woke up crying and my heart beating extremely fast. I decided to write a quick note, telling my mom to tell my online friends that I loved them and they were my 2nd family. I wrote other things, but mostly saying "Tell this friend I love them, tell this friend that" I didn't want to tell my friends. Eventually, I went out to my backyard with my chair, took the belt and I stood there, on the chair, waiting for the courage.. But I couldn't do it. I imagined my best friend breaking down when he heard the news, I imagined my friend group and my online friends. I imagined my parents and my family, if I were to kill myself, I would probably be the first suicide death in the family. I couldn't do that. I'm the type of person that cares too much about my friends and family. I'm the type of person that puts others first before myself, this often causes a lot of mental stress and people taking advantage of me. After this experience, I threw away my belts, I didn't really need them, all my pants fit.

I don't plan on telling anyone. Just you guys and me. I haven't cut myself, but I've been doing kind of better. Not yet done with my autobiography, but it should be interesting. If any of my friends or family stumbles across this. "I'm sorry for not telling you but I don't want anyone worrying about me. I feel bad when you guys do that. I'll gladly talk to you" 

Anyways, have a nice day.. And I'm actually, really glad that I didn't tip the chair over.
