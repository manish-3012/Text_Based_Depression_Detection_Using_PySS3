I didn't jump off a bridgeI was going to. It too me 40 minutes to walk there and somehow I decided for no real reason to walk back into my apartment.

Maybe eventually if I keep attempting I'll have enough adrenaline to finish it off.

I do have fantasies about the future but I know I'm a lost cause. My brain is too ruined. 

I have two choices. Die.

Or live and continue the same horrible days over and over.
