I donâ€™t know how to tell my friends/boyfriend that Iâ€™ve been feeling suicidal again*i have no intent to act on my feelings I just feel like itâ€™s not worth it to keep going*

The quarantine hasnâ€™t been nice to me, as Iâ€™m sure it hasnâ€™t been for many many others. Recently my boyfriends parents said that I wasnâ€™t allowed to go see him and Iâ€™ve been filled with such uncertainty about when I can see him again. 

Itâ€™s been years since Iâ€™ve felt suicidal and my friends have been there for me through the whole thing, but my boyfriend hasnâ€™t been here to deal with me feeling this way. 

I felt like things were going so well for me. I was finally healing from past trauma, I was about to graduate high school, I made it to my 18th birthday (13 yr. old me would have never imagined), and I finally felt genuinely happy, but it feels like everything has been ripped away from me. I donâ€™t know what to do
