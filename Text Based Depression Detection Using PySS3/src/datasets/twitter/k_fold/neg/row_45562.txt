My Heart Canâ€™t Handle It AnymoreThe loneliness, Iâ€™ve been lonely my entire life. Iâ€™m almost in my late twenties and I just canâ€™t take it anymore, everything I try is never enough. Thereâ€™s a whole side of human experience Iâ€™ll never get to experience. Not many people will be able to understand this, as itâ€™s extremely rare. Imagine constantly being an observer to other peopleâ€™s relationships and never being wanted. Never being able to experience intimacy, itâ€™s hell. Iâ€™ve done everything to improve myself, but itâ€™s never enough. Iâ€™m ready to die,if a heart could literally break from sadness and loneliness thatâ€™s what is occurring for me. I just canâ€™t take this anymore.
