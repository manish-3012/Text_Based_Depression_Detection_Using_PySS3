I'm going to kill myself tonightHello, my name is Cam. I live in the UK and have been fighting an already lost battle. I have realised over the past few days that my life is just a shit show. I have never had friends at school and spend my time sitting on my own. I am overweight and spend my free time by myself not even with people I know online. I sit here and talk to myself and it's disgusting how much of a waste I am. My mum hates me because I have given up hope on everything. Everyone thinks it's some sort of phase but Iâ€™ve tried so hard to break my cycle and I can't. I tried to kill myself before but I thought of my grandma and how sad she would be before she died seeing that I had gone before her. She always has looked after me and I love her so much but she can't do any more for me. I hate to say this but I hate my life and have done for a while. I lie online to people on Twitter about having a car and an amazing job to make me sound so much more interesting and donâ€™t even show my face because of how disgusting and horrible I look. Iâ€™m ugly as hell and it wonâ€™t ever change. I know everyone who looks at me thinks Iâ€™m a disgusting person and they have their wish I will kill myself and stop wasting everyoneâ€™s time and effort. My mum doesnâ€™t even know I feel like this and shows so much attention to my other siblings I feel like such a failure. I just wish this would all stop I used to hurt myself but it has got to beyond the point of caring anymore and Iâ€™m just going to kill myself. Itâ€™s the only option to fix my mess of a life I canâ€™t wait to die in my sleep tonight. My girlfriend cheated on me multiple times which shows how much a no good loser I am. Everyone treats me like Iâ€™m invisible and if I was dead it would be no different. My tears are rolling down my face while im typing this because I know I have no other choice but to go. My mind is made up. So, to all the people reading this family or not I hope you all have better lives than I did. I tried so hard to be happy I really did but it got too much. I a good for nothing loser and I donâ€™t deserve the right to live a life like this being lonely and wasting food, money and effort.
