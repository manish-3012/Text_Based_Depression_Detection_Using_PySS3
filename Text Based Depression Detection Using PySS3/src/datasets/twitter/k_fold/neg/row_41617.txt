45+ no health insurance cant stay aliveIf you're not middle age, you will not understand 

If you're not very familiar with what it costs to live on your own without parents &amp; a spouse you wont umderstand

If you dont know what the avg SS retirement ck is minus mandatory Medicare for when you &amp; I turn age 66 in the future, you will not understand 

If you're unaware of credit scores and the importance of paying down bills at middle age, you wont understand

If you are unfamiliar with the cost U.S. healthcare (not Medicaid, not Medicare), you wont understand

I put that first because Ive had suggestions thrown my way that were shoot from the hip and not relevent to my situation

I dont want to stay alive anymore because i cant afford to support myself.

Im not lazy, im highly educated and know that not everyome can do any job. Employers have a right to not hire a person who cant pay housing and health insurance on the lower wages being offered today.

I am financially literate so its not a maytter of cutting back

Look at apartment guide to explore "average rents" and then call ACA and learn the monthly cost  healthcare with the annual dedictible built in

I cant afford to support myself because i need two durgeries that i cant get unless i have the ability to pay for the health insurance

I cant  get sustainable work because im over educated (need challenge in my work and a living wage) and too old  (over age 45)

No one understands my situation
