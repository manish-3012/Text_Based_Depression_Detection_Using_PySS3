Iâ€™ve called twice now.I called first, just wanting someone to talk to. The recording told me I was second in line and was to wait about 20 minutes. Fine. Could cry myself somewhat rational to that point. Updates that, and lets me know Iâ€™ll be heard in 10 minutes, being first is line: great! They apologize for the delay and thank me. Of course they *sincerely apologize* but Iâ€™ve heard this same message each time, down to 15 seconds. Itâ€™s been like a fucking hour.... and now Iâ€™ve apparently jumped back to â€œcaller number 2â€ for the third time. Apparently Iâ€™m not even enough for the god damn suicide hotline....
