SectioningI've been feeling very suicidal recently and I feel like with the whole virus situation going on, if it would be of any benefit seeking help, I really feel like I'm unable to cope and am a danger to myself and was wondering if they would perhaps still section people even during this pandemic, does anyone know anything about sectioning and the current times?
