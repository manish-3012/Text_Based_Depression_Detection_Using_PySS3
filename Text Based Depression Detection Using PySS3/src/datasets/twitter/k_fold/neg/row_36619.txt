Hello again.Hey it's Seth. 

I made a post on here a few days ago, and I want to thank you for the support. 

Im trying to make adjustments in my life to ensure my marriage and career are more satisfactory for me.

I'm still having issues with my self confidence and making up situations in my head.

Yesterday I had to leave home to help a friend right as my wife got home, and during that time my wifes phone died.

I spent the next hour thinking she was packing up her car and leaving while I wasnt home.

And right now, my mind is telling me there was someone here yesterday while I was gone because I smell something weird.

Im going to start going to therapy on Wednesday, but right now im still feeling like my life is in shambles.

It sucks because I feel like I made a good bit of progress over the past week because I have a new job coming up and im putting for the effort to go to therapy. 

Right now im just unsure of who I am. Over the last few days I've been planning in my head what I would do and where I would go if she left me. 

My family isn't in my life very much, so part of me wants to move far away from the east coast. 

I'd have to start over with nothing. In somewhere new. 

But I feel like my life would be over before that. Not necessarily because of suicide, but because I just cant imagine making that adjustment.

I dont expect anything from this post, I just am feeling like poo and wanted to vent. 

Thanks again reddit.
