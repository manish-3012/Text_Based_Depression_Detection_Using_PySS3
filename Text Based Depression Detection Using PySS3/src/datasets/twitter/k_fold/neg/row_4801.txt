My girlfriend broke up with me this morning. There is no other woman like her that will love me. I am done.My girlfriend broke up with me this morning. She said that it was "because of her and not me". But I bet it was. I bet she got bored with me. She says she loves me, but wants to be friends. She used me, and threw me away. So, I'm gonna make her come talk to me tomorrow. I have something painful, and then I have myself. She will come see me. I told her what I'd do to myself, she got very upset, but still left me. I keep playing it out in my head. I said "I want her back. Failure is not an option" they said "You can't force love, that sounds like a hostage situation". Well, I've always got one hostage, haha. I love her so much, I'm not going to live without her. She was EVERYTHING

edit: this feeling keeps coming and going, and I keep convincing myself that it's a good idea. That, even if she walks, even after seeing my resolve, I'd be happier dead. And if not, she might see how much pain I'm feeling, and come back to me
