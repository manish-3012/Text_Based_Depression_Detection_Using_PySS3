Always feel like eventually I'll commit suicideWhile I have my ups and downs emotionally, regardless of whats going on in my life I always feel like eventually I'll commit suicide. When I'm happy, its not like I think things will get better, it just feels like a welcome break from an inevitable come down where, eventually, I'll commit suicide. When I'm feeling low again, it only confirms my fears. Its as if being suicidal is my baseline, and every other feeling is just a break from the norm.
