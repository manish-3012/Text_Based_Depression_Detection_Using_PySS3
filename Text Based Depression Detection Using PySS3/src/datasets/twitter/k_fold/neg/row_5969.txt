I'm gonna kms on ChristmasI made a previous post about how I'd commit if I had a gun but I've just had it. Everyone's an asshole to me, everybody always leaves me on read , and not to mention this dumbass virus. Between the virus and just people on my life I cant take it anymore. Sleep isnt sleep to me, it's just an escape. If I'm always sleeping I dont need to escape. This will probly be my last post because I'm better off dead anyways so bye. And thanks for reading, stay strong
