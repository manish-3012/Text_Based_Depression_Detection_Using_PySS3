I don't know what to doOk. So i usually take an SSRI once a day but i left them in a hotel this weekend and haven't been able to retrieve them. Its only been three days, can I already be this unhappy because of that?

My husband and I had an argument yesterday. I still don't think I was in the wrong but I don't think I was 100% reasonable myself either.
I thought it was done with by bedtime but after a stony silent evening tonight interspersed with him snapping at me it would appear that it's not. 
I'm so angry and so completely miserable.
I keep coming back to maybe thinking my lack of fluoxetine is making me act crazy but then I really can't agree that I did anything wrong (other than getting pissy once the arguing had started). 
I'm sat alone crying and having dark thoughts and I don't know what I should do now.
