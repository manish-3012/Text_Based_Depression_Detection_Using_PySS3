Make up a title yourselfSince I was 15 I have had suicidal thoughts but have been to scared to even cut my wrist. Even though I may be to scared I hope for an alternative way of ending it, what I mean by this is if I was mugged and stabed and somehow still had my phone I would not call for help, I would see it as a blessing. Now I don't know how long these thoughts will last but everyday they get stronger and every day I wish for something worse and worse. I jut wanted to get this of my chest as I can't tell my family but if this does not belong here I will delete it. Cheers for reading
