Never good enoughNothing I do is good enough. I try my hardest and they only ever point out the flaws or compare me to someone else who does/has it better... even when I try to get help all I get in response is â€œsomeone has it worseâ€ I guess Iâ€™m not good enough to care for. I guess Iâ€™m not good enough to live
