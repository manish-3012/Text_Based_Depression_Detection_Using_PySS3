I'm onto my last few days.I have been depressed for years. Anxious for a year. That's how long I've had the diagnoses, anyways. The depression has gotten to a point where it takes a huge amount of effort to just complete day to day tasks sober. I have a shipment of a ridiculous amount of acid and amphetamine coming in a couple days, and honestly that's the only thing giving me hope right now. Once I blow through that all, but before the amphetamine withdrawals kick in (fuck that), I think I am going to end it. Maybe I will "get help", whatever that means. I am probably not going to be here next week.
