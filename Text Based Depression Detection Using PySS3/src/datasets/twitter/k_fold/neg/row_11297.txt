Checking InA few months back, I posted that I was ready to die. I then took a very large cocktail of pills and went to sleep expecting to never wake up again. 

Here I am several months later, and I feel like I'm going down that road again, albeit much slower than before. I have an amazing fiance and a wonderful puppy in my life. Two of my three kids love me inspite of my shortcomings, and I don't want to feel this way. 

I've done therapy, and I'm trying to maintain all I've learned there, but I'm honestly a little afraid. Just looking for dome support. 

Thanks in advance.
