I feel like life is a simulation made by some sick entity who wants to see how long it takes for some people to kill themselvesI don't know if I'm on the right sub, because I'm not suicidal. But I have been having some suicidal thoughts lately. Sometimes I feel like some sick entity is experimenting with me. Like, trying to see how long it will take for me to commit suicide.

I sometimes have moments of hope/happy moments, but they don't last long. And I feel like this entity is giving me false hope and then takes it away just to make me lose my shit and put me over the edge.

Anyone else feel this way?
