If I'm still alone at end of the year, I'm going to kill myselfI just don't think anyone can love me how I am. Or even if someone deals with me briefly, they will eventually get fed up with me. I don't have looks, I don't have money, and I have childish hobbies.
The worst part is that I still have standards. Like I want someone I think I have a chance of connecting with over someone who I know I don't have much in common with.

I think it would be better to end everything soon than to go on lying to myself.
