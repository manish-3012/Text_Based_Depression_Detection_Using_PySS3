I'm doneHey, first of all, sorry if i write something wrong, English it's not my main language.  
Okay, I just want to see how you redditors see this, I've been these last years thinking about why i have to stay alive, i have problems with my family, friends, i have social problems, i have traumas, and i've been diagnosticated with depression, I usually think about an old friend that died a few years ago and she was my best friend, I'm sad all day, everything that I usually loved to do i'm getting bored of it, I cant talk to people because of my social panic and im always alone, and actually i think im staying alive because of a friend i have, i dont see her too much but i like to talk with her and its my reason of life because i want she to be alright, but these last months i feel like she is letting me down, and im so scared of been alone again, I can only think about taking my father's gun and shoot myself, i don't want to be again alone and no one cares about me, no one love me, i only want a friend but all people that I finally can talk or people that talk to me, ends letting me down, like always happen, i just want to be again with that dead friend.
