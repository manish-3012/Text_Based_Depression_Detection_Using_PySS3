So Im here again with these thoughtsI have been here before so many times. I have been sexually harassed, lived through first suicide attempt with a razor, a second time a few months ago, I have been bullied in workplaces and schools, lived in a neighborhood with grenades and guns. I have gone through hell to get two higher educations, but I still can't find a full-time job. I'm going to lose my apartment and I have not even reached 30 years of age yet. I don't think life is fair, and I'm not a lazy person may I add. I do my best to stay sane, but not much is helping these days. Everyone thinks I'm ok, but I'm really not. I just want a normal life you know?  My dream is just to have a rental apartment, a steady full-time job, and a sane brain. Is that too much to ask for since everything life has put me through?!

I really think putting my life to an end is the only thing that will give me some kind of peace.
