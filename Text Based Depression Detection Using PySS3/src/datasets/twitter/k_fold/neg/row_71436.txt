I want to die before New Year. I canâ€™t bear another year.I wonâ€™t be able to make it to 2020. I will jump off a bridge. I have no one who I can call â€œfriendâ€ and talk about such things. My only friend died, I only have my family with me. My family make fun of my suicidal thoughts. No one outside of family will attend my funeral. I want to go wherever my friend is.
