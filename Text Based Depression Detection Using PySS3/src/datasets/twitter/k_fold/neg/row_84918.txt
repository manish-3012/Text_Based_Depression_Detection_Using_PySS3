Used to be lonely, now im not sure i careFirst-off sorry for not being able to explain this well, communicating my inner most feelings has always been excruciatingly difficult. ive had lots of opportunities to talk to people that i do kinda have a relationship with but have just never been able to quite get there, even with the help of the ol recreationals. 

about a year ago i was at my worst state. i became somewhat of a hermit, venturing out only to hang with a gorup of people i really didnt like all that much apart from the fact that i could get high easily with them. it was at this time that i was my most suicidal, the closest i got was tying a noose around my neck, letter all written out - but i just couldnt do it. 

i dropped out of school, forced to move back home and get a job. things in the past year have technically been getting better. im planning on returning to university soon, have been getting healthier and cut out most of the drugs. 

but im not happy. in a way i was more happy living in the dreamlike state of a year ago even though that was far more up and down. now its seemingly a steady low.i tried therapy for a bit but as i said at the start i dont find communicating these things easy at all in person. and it was just a drain of my money. 

 i feel like im boring now. a trait that ive always thought of as the worst possible. i often find it increasingly hard to live in the moment when around people i used to have a very strong relationship with from back home. i get stuck inside my head. anxiety kinda distracting me from conversations. maybe i come across as not caring about them anymore, though thats far from the truth. 

i am excited for returning to education. but also nervous. i doo still get sucidal thoughts especially when these lapses of low self confdence occur and im about to go into what is likely to be a more stressful scenario.
