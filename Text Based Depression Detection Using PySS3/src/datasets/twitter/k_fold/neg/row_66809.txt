Why shouldn't I?The only reason I have for not doing would be my mom. But once i'm dead it won't matter to me anyway so I see no reason not to do it. I don't really have any friends or anything, i've barely ever touched a girl. I have several mental illnesses so I can't see it ever getting better. I watch my mom working hard for shit pay which is what I would have to do too. That or live on wellfare. That's not what I want for my future, i'd rather die.

I don't believe in any god or anything so why shouldn't I kill myself?
