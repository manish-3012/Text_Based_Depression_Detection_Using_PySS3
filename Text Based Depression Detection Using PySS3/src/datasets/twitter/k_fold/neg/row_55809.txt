I screwed up.It's okay if nobody says anything or if you think I'm awful too. It's just early morning and I'm alone and no one is awake to talk to and I'm overwhelmed and experiencing extreme anxiety.

Basically, I screwed up. I took a relationship long distance when I shouldn't have. 
I was sexually assaulted (when I tried to report it I was shut down) and afterward started seeing someone else even though I was in a relationship. It isn't justified, I know. I just didn't handle it very well. And I know I'm a piece of shit. I should have just talked to him.

I ended up breaking up with him as soon as possible months ago and didn't tell him about the aforementioned stuff. I've been cheated on and I wish I never knew.

I still care about him and when he started texting me I talked to him. He asked about it and I confessed. He hates me which I totally understand.

I just want to give up now. I'm so tired and sad and my heart and chest hurts so bad. I've tried to do something before and I was glad those attempts were unsuccessful but I can't deny that the urge is there again.
