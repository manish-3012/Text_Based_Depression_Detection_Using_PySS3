my boyfriend only likes me out of pity and charityit's the truth. we have been together for almost 3 years and it's just obvious he was only ever with me because he felt bad for me and wanted to fix me. i dont even think he ever truly loved me. im a burden to him and even he says that he knows he shouldn't be talking to me because im fucking horrible and delusional (not his *exact* words, but that's what he meant). im a fucking psychotic, jealous bitch. i honestly need to die. just recently, he smoked weed and that in itself isnt bad, right? but it upset me so fucking much. the thought of him smoking and getting high FUCKS ME UP. and i hate myself for that. i hate myself. im horrible. he deserves so much better. i should die. i need to die. enough with the failed attempts. i want to FUCKING DIE. 4 past attempts in these past 17 years of life. can someone please help me? give me a method that will secure my suicide?
