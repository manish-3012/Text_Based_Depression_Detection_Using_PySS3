I'm better off dead. I'm better off dead. I'm better off dead. I'm better off dead. I'm better off dead.I'm ready to die. Sooner or later this gun will be used. I'm done, just done. No more. Better off dying sooner than later. I keep listening to this Radiohead cd on a loop "i'm better off dead", "i'm better off dead". I really fucking am. Everynight, sometimes when I do actually cry I don't - I actually bleed myself to sleep with a razor. The only thing that keeps me up, anyway, but I don't want to be up. I wish I never opened my eyes on that day of August 8th, 1999. Why was I born? I didn't ask to be, I don't want to be, and I wish I never was. Your idiot god apparently thought it was a good idea, though. He also thought it was funny when back in 2008 I walked in on my mom dead on the bathtub overdosed on herion and when my dad shot himself right in front of me in 2010. After a year so far in the group home In 2012 I got mollested. In 2013 I got raped. 2014, I overdosed on ibuprofen once trying to end my life, again in 2015 when I tried to hang myself but got caught in the school basement. Got expelled over that, got arrested for stabbing a bully in the stomach at the group home, spent a year in juvy where I got jumped and most of my teeth knocked out. Here I am, got out last month when i was 18 and I can't eat, can't sleep, pattially blind and can barely see, I lay behind the streets and have mice and bugs eating what little clothes I have. I still love going to the library, here right now. I don't talk to anybody though. I really don't have any hobbies besides reading nor any talents nor a real reason to live. I walk around downtown in the cold and look around and see a dark depressing world I just don't want to live in. 


I mean it when I say I'm going to kill myself. I'm better off dead.
