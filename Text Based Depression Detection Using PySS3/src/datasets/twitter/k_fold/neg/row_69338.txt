My boyfriend just broke up with meI care about him so much, he is under alot of stress and ln the same day I attempted he relapsed with self harm. We all have our mental issues and are struggling so I dont mind that he broke up so he could focus on his mental health but I'm not sure what I should do to comfort him? What should I say to make him feel better? It was my first relstionship, I'm still so lost in what to do :(
