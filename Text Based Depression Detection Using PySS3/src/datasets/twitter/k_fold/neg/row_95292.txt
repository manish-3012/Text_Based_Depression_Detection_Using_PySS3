i just cant stop sobbing...Corbin had been acting weird and started ignoring me (long-distance boyfriend of 9 months... well ex) he finally says that i made him feel trapped and that he was feeling depressed, so i cut back talking to him. myself feeling really depressed as it was.... i cut for the first time, as i was cutting he made me promise not to, so i promised and immediately stopped... we talked even less and less. 

while this was going on the person i thought was my best friend (the only friend i had pretty much too) is suffering from anorexia, she's become so self absorbed and she never has anytime for me... so i browse her instagram that she uses to vent about things... and there  it is her trashing me... i had come to her she was the first person i told about cutting and she trashed me....

"then my OTHER friend cut last night and threw it in my face like it was something she was proud of or something. it bothered the hell out of me like i could tell she did it so people would pity her. but she does this all the time" -ex-friend...

i was just so angry so upset. i had told her because i wanted her to tell me not to to tell me something to make it better and all she did was make things worse...

then Corbin tells me he cant do it any more and we cant date, he blames himself for his grandfathers death... and the suicide of his friend...

she had confessed her love for him but he had explained his commitment to me... now he says he's broken and that he cant love me until he loves himself. he doesn't want to lose me but he cant be with me... i couldn't help it i cut again.... i'm so ashamed...

he made me promise not to hurt myself and never to try anything like killing myself.... if he knew i cut he said he wouldn't be able to take it anymore and that he's take his own life...

all the while i'm just a fucking health hazard.. I've been having asthma-like attacks weekly in gym, i don't have asthma and the medicine that the doctor gave to help me isn't fucking working. I've had chronic leg pain for years and the doctor said it was just tight muscles and sent me to a physical therapist... they're sending me to have a test to determine if i need surgery or not....

i just cant fucking take much more, i mean there is also the fact that the mentally challenged kid in my class talks and acts exactly like just ONE of the people that have sexually assaulted me in my life.. and all he does is talk to me all the time and i just want to curl up and cry.

the only thing stopping me from downing every fucking pill in my house is that it would hurt Corbin.... i fucking love him so much i just want him to be batter and i just want to have him as mine again... but for now he needs my friendship and ill give that.
