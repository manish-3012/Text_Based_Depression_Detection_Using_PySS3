Is this Sexual Harassment or Assault?TW TW TW

SO  I am 20 years old. This evening I met up with an older gentleman. He is my sugar daddy and it was my second time meeting him. First time was at a restaurant. Today was at a hotel because we were gonna order room service for a little bit and watch a movie. 
Anyways, since the beginning of time I told him NO SEX. He said he understood. He likes everything but doesnâ€™t do penetration. And he kept re assuring me that THAT wasnâ€™t going to happen.

Fast forward, we are making out or whatever (I just need the money lol) and he asked if he could put it in. I said NO. He did it anyways. I told him NO and to stop multiple times and he continued on. So eventually my ears were teary and I pushed him back because it hurt so much. 

He was really sexually aggressive but super nice to me after? I know I put myself in that situation so it is my fault as to why it would happen. But I also know it wasnâ€™t right of him to do that.

What do you guys think? 
Itâ€™s just now I feel so gross and sad, I didnâ€™t want to have sex with him. Never, ever. And he knew that and did it anyways. 

PS. I didnâ€™t fight him off because I was scared of his reaction as he was aggressive and I just froze.
