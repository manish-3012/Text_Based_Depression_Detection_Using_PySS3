I can't live in a world where hate is getting stronger every day.It's become inescapable.  I turned off the news, but I hear my coworkers talking about it.  I leave work and go to the gym, and I see news running on TVs everywhere.  I log off social media to avoid it, but then I can't communicate with anyone.

People tell me I make the world a better place just by being my normal kind self, but I'm TOO kindhearted.  I see the world falling apart and fear and hate and violence and corruption spreading their neverending rule over us all.  I have to escape and I've had a way planned for years.
