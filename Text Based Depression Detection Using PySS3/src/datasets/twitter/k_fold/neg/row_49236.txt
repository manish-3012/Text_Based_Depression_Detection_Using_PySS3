Its 2020 Fck offIâ€™m very uncomfortable at my new job. One of the coworkers in training with me has made me feel very uncomfortable. He stopped and starred at my bum for a very long time while I was getting water at the fountain. He then came up to me in the middle of class to tell me he liked my pants. recently me and a bunch of coworkers were all outside and one of the coworkers said it was super cold. And I said yes I am cold too. He then unzips his jacket and looks at me and says â€œcome here then come here. Câ€™mon.â€ I was puzzled and said the other girl is more cold ask her. And walked away towards other people. 

Honestly I am sick of being singled out for being a mixed race woman and sexualized by creepy  men. I live in a rural area and feel invalidated for all the things I experience.  

I have been sexually attacked and I donâ€™t like putting up with this shit. Why should I be professional at work if this is the environment. I donâ€™t even want to work here its too creepy! And  I find men atrocious. 

This accumulated sexual hostility and other abuse will be what leads to my suicide one day.
