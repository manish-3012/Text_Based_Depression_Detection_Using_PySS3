I'm not suicidalI'm not a suicidal person but I am very apathetic towards life. I constantly have deep thoughts on the philosophies of life. 

From birth to death everything in between is just distraction. Family. Friends. Tv. Food. All designed to keep us alive a little longer. Willing is to carry on. 

I hold the view of apethy because I care not if I die or live as in the grand scheme of things life does go on. 

I'm not a religious person so I don believe in god or any sort of afterlife. I believe in eternal peace. From the pain that is life. 

Because life is pain and suffering. Death is a release. 

I guess I am more Buddhist in my beliefs than anything. 

Just a few thoughts I've been having recently.
