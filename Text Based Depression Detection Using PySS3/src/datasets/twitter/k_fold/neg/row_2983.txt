Canâ€™t fucking sleepThe worst part about having a shitty life is remembering when things were good. Itâ€™s like a deep pain in your chest, worse than any physical pain. Nothing you can do can get rid of it. Itâ€™s the fucking worst, worse than just being sad. Iâ€™ve been laying in bed for the past three fucking hours and I canâ€™t sleep because of this deep pain. I canâ€™t stop thinking about when things were good and all the shitty decisions I made to prevent myself from being happy.
