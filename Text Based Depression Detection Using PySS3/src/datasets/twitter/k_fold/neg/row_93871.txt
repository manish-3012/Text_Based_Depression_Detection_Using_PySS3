i dont even know anymorei'm traveling around europe alone. Semi alone. the last week and a half i've been with guys i met along the way. but the last few days i feel like i cant compeet with these guys. when we go out, they all get girls and i end up on a bench sipping my beer or on the dance floor swaying akwardly untill i give up and go home. It seems like i become a non entity at sun set. I was thinkings of ways to do it on the bus ride into the city this afternoon. i decided i would go out one more time to see if i feel difrent. but my lack of meds and increase of alchohol seems to be a bad combination. I think i might just need some words of encouragement.
