Suicidal but I donâ€™t think soA little backstory to my upcoming question. I was in a toxic relationship for 10 months (Iâ€™m 15) and I have been self harming for over a year (with a 5 month clean break) and I started again a month ago. Iâ€™m definitely depressed and I really want to die but at the same time part of me feels like thereâ€™s nothing wrong with me. I have never been diagnosed with anything other than anxiety. I was depressed before, during and after the relationship. Is this normal? To think thereâ€™s nothing wrong with me?
