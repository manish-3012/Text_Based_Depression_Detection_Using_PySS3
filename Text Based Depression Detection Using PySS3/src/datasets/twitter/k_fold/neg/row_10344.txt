what's the point of livingI don't get any joy out of socializing cause I"m autistic. so it feels like I'm alone all the time. i haven't had sex in years. i have no skills, my body is old and weak, im broke, i hate staying alive. i always want to just give up and think about dying.


what is the point of life? you live, you work and u grow old. life is so pointless, there's no reason to keep going.
