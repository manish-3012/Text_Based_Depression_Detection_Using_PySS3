Suicide at 18Iâ€™m currently 16 years old and have an ok life. I am a upper-middle class teen and have it easy but thatâ€™s just the problem. My mother has tried so hard to give me the life she wanted and thatâ€™s not a good thing. She made it out the mud and worked so hard for her position in society just for me to turn out like shit. I have all Fâ€™s in school and have nothing going for me. I used to be a varsity baseball player but I started getting horrible grades so they kicked me off the team. I want to get good grades and I do care but I subconsciously just donâ€™t give a fuck about anything. Iâ€™ve been indirectly taught to not work for anything and my mother resents me for it. My father left me when I was 2 and I have never had a supportive father figure in my life to confide in and trust. Iâ€™ve been taught to not show my emotions so Iâ€™ve been keeping them bottled up for years away from anyone. What emotions you ask? Well, one of the 2 people I have ever trusted in my life passed away 2 years ago from an accident crossing the road going to the store. My cousin Kyle was struck by a car on October 14, 2017 at 16 and died on impact. Heâ€™s the only person I have ever shared my emotions with and he was taken from me, and if he was just 10 seconds slower he would have been fine. Now I have no one except my girlfriend but she has no idea Iâ€™m such a mess. She doesnâ€™t know Iâ€™m depressed, she doesnâ€™t know Iâ€™m failing school, she doesnâ€™t know about my childhood trauma Iâ€™ve been forced through. She doesnâ€™t know shit about me because Iâ€™ve only showed her the good stuff and she deserves better. I am depressed but thatâ€™s not really even the reason Iâ€™m going to end my life. The reason is I have nothing to look forward to. Everyoneâ€™s life ends at some point, Iâ€™ve just decided itâ€™s ending the day I turn 18. â€œ Good morning, today is October 27th, 2022. We regret to inform you all that native teen Dontei Lecue, aged 18, died this morning due to a high speed collision we suspect was due to a state of drowsiness from influence of narcotics. â€œ
