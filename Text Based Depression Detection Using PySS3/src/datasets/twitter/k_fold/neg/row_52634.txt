breakdown modeI've been in breakdown mode the last 6 months, unable to get out of bed and function like a normal person. I've gone back to therapy w/ a new psychiatrist and now have meds to manage insomnia, depression and anxiety, but, honestly, I can't see how I'll ever be better. I'm older (55) and married to someone I still love with two children, one 20 and the other 24. They're not independent financially, but they're on their way with school, friends, interests, etc... My husband has a good job and is healthy, fit and busy. He loves me, too, but this brain of mine is obviously in the way of everything. I would like to die, but can't seem to get past the guilt of hurting and stigmatizing them with a suicide. But I also can't stand the thought of being the embarrassing burden I am for possibly the next 2-3 decades (until I die of natural causes). It seems less selfish to get out now while my husband is young enough to find another partner. I do worry that my children aren't old enough to take the hit of a parent dying, but I also think they'd understand, and be able to forgive me and move on, after seeing me unravel the past half year. I wish there were a way to slip off unnoticed, but that option doesn't exist.
