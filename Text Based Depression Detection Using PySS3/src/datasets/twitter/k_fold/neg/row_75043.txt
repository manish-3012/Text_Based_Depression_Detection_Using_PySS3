Stopped responding to friends...I stopped talking to all my friends... I had to delete social media for the 472999877 time. I keep embarrassing because my emotions are so out of wack.. I've known about my bipolar disorder for a while now.. it hasn't got any easier.. I keep fantasizing going to Belgium and just ending it all.. I've wanted to die since I can remember... I have such a sharp memory of me going on a walk at night as a teenager because the noise in my head was so loud.. I called my dad and begged him to put me somewhere the rest of my life.... I had given up on myself as a kid... its not changing... I'm 26... I can't do this much longer... my fucking leg is cut up to shit.. I'm covered in scars I gave myself... I just give up.
