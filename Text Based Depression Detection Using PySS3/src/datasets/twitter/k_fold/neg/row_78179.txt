One big blowout/goodbye splurgeI am getting closer to the idea of suicide. What was once magical thinking is slowly coming to a more realistic scenario in my mind's eye. This brings me to a place of considering others and farewell prep. My big concerns are my parents, my sister and my cat. I have decided that killing myself when I made a commitment to love, protect, feed, take care of my cat is just selfish and not really something that is karmically sound. Not that suicide is karmic friendly? Maybe in my case it is... Anyway! I have a bunch of cc points and air miles and I am planning on going on a first class final whirlwind to see some friends and then to my favorite spots on the planet. Anyone else have a "big blowout" planned? Anyway have plans to travel or to splurge on their favorite food, etc?
