Is there anyone to talk to about this that won't have consequences?I don't want to go in depth into why I feel like this but I'll give some info. I have never had anyone close enough to talk to about this but I had one friend I felt close to. The friend (let's call her Rachel) had a cell phone plan where she couldn't get texts after 7:00. I used that time to confess everything about myself including my thoughts of suicide. Apparently she got a new plan two days ago and got one of my texts. She told the school guidance councillor and the councillor told my parents. Now this whole thing will go on my college applications and I won't get into a good college and I'll end up with a shit life and a shit job. I sent those texts to Rachel to serve as something like Journal but it felt closer to talking about my problems. I know if I talk to a therapist, guidance councillor, or parents I risk getting sent to a mental hospital or something. I'm coming here because I need to vent to someone. I don't feel suicidal but I just need to get these feelings out

Tl;dr I need to find someone to listen to my venting, preferably through PM.
