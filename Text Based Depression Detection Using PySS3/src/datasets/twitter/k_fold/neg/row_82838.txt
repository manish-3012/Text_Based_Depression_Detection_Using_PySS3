I need Help saving my friendso i've recently reconnected with one of my old friends, we went to homecoming, have been hanging out a lot yada yada yada all that jazz. but i'm really worried because she is planning to kill herself. ive managed to convince her to not do it but i'm not sure how long that will last, she has this bucket list of things she has to do and after she completes it she is going to swallow a bottle of pills, well atleast she was but i made her give the pills to me. but she could always get more. what do I do? i can't loose her, and nobody is taking her seriously. every time she says she's going to kill herself people are like "lol mee too school is so stressful" so what do I do? do i call the hotline, do i tell all my teacher, do I try to get her parents attention? how can i stop her before it's too late? time is precious so please reply sooner that later.

Thanks,
JustSomeGuy
