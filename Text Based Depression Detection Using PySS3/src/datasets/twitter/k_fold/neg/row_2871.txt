Going for my last swimThe current is really strong today. I think I'm gonna swim out and let it take me.

Why?

Because I deserve to die. I lied to my mom about getting scholarships. I cant stand the idea that I'll never afford college. I'll just be another bum like everyone else, living on minimum wage. Just another asshole.
