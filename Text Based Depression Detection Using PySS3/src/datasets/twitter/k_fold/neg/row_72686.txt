Feel like I'm retreating into nothingLittle things like a shirt having a spaghetti stain, laptop charger not working, or egg yolk breaking when it fries makes me so despaired. I've been trying to move and prepare to return to school but I feel like I'm wasting away, today I put on an unbuttoned torn unwashed oversized dress shirt (which I later realized a had put on upside down.) Feel like I'm stumbling and moving slowly, unable to focus on anything. My dad told me that I hurt his feelings.
