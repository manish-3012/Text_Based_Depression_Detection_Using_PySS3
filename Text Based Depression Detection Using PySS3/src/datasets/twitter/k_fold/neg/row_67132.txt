The stigma in asking for help.I've never really asked for real help; the most I've ever tried was through a friend and it went well for a bit and then everything went back to hell shortly after.

I've been really careful of what I told other people ever since, and whenever I'm on the verge of asking for help again, my mind just floods with questions like "How much should I tell them?" , "How should I say it?" , "Why should I even say it?" , "What if I make him / her uncomfortable?" and much much more.  
Eventually, I feel more drained than I was before, and I end up not doing telling anything at all. It has been this way for a long time, and whenever I actually attempt to ask for help, my mind just gets consumed in guilt for some reason, and it just pushes me further into never saying anything at all, ever.
