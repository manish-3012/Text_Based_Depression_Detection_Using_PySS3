Let's be honest, the world would be a better place if I killed myselfThank god my brain decided to turn up the dial to 11 so now the phrase "kill yourself" is pretty much just repeating in my brain over and over again. And it's not like I can do anything about it because suicide takes courage and conviction. So literally my only course of action is to just hope and pray that something finishes me off first. But why would I be that lucky? Everything is designed to maximize torture potential so of course the universe is going to drag this out.
