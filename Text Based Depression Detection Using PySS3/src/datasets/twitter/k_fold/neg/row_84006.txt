I work i go home and I want to dieHi I'm a 20 year old male that works at a McDonald's,my life is monotonous and conflicted and I feel like I'm a failure. I came from an abusive home and I failed college so I moved to the Midwest so I could get myself on my feet, my mental health got worse. I have Autism spectrum disorder,ptsd,and bipolar 2. My friends all say it's going to get better soon and I try to believe them. But in the end I feel like my life means nothing. To clarify I don't want to die but with me having a mental breakdown every day and my dreams wrought with reminders of my life and what I did wrong I don't know what to do anymore.
