Iâ€™m 14 but Iâ€™m a still just a little kid at the core.I canâ€™t cope with anything. I canâ€™t do anything myself. The only things that calm me down is my motherâ€™s singing and those calming videos meant for toddler to help go to sleep. I broke down crying a few days ago. I look at my old toys and cry. Iâ€™m still just a little kid. Iâ€™m not ready for this.

I WANT TO SCREAM BUT Iâ€™M NOT ALONE SO EVERYONE WILL HEAR IT. 

**FREE ME FROM THIS HELL**
