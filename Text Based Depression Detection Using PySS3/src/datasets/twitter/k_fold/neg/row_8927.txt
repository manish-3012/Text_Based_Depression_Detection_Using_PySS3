I cheated on the only person to ever love meI made the biggest mistake of my entire life and lost the girl who loved me more than life itself. she would have done anything for me at anytime, leave her career and move away to start a new life with me if i wanted to. and i cheated on her. i am devastated by my actions and the guilt is weighing on me so heavy she was a perfect match after having so many less than good relationships. she had one lapse of infidelity years ago when we were in the early stages of being together and it just never left me. i was cut very deeply and it stung for years, i made my mistakes two years after her one. i had sex with multiple woman to top it off who were so much less attractive then my then gf was, all because i thought it would make me feel better; it has done the exact opposite. i have starved for weeks i have slept 3-4 hours a day for 16 days, she will never trust me again and at this point in my life she is all i ever want. she has already moved on to a new guy, she no longer text me after four years of constant contact all times of the day and night. i am beginning to really take suicide as a viable option, i am not successful in life and i ruined the only good thing i ever had. she loved me so dearly after learning her mistake and i destroyed her with mean words and then cheating on her kind soul. i hate to say it but this world would be a better place without me in it. i have a gun, im just saying my goodbyes to my family inside my head at this point. i know they will miss me but i cant live with the guilt bearing on me at every second. recognize how good someone is to you before you give them up for nothing. it could cost you your life.
