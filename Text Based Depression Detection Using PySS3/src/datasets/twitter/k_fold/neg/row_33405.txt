Dead end for meI took a lot of pain killers and codeine cough medicine because I think this is the night I'm gonna do it. I wanna slit my wrists open but I know it will hurt like hell so I took all the pain killers. I'm also really drunk. There is no one I can talk and no one who can help me. I really don't want to die. I really don't. But I feel like it's the only option for me. There is no one who cares about me and no one who I can talk to. My boyfriend is tired of me and I know he wants to leave me. I'm just a burden for everyone. It would be so much easier for everyone if I would just die.
