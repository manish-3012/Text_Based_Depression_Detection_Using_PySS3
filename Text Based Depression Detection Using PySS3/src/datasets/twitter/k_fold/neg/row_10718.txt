â€œA permanent solution to a temporary problemâ€I really donâ€™t think what Iâ€™ve got is a temporary problem.

Iâ€™ve got a huge big world of injustice, with a fuck load of people who are more powerful and frankly a lot smarter than me who stand to benefit from keeping the world unjust

Iâ€™ve got the ever impending collapse of the worlds natural resources, an issue that seemingly everyone cares about but not enough to actually change any of their behavior.

Iâ€™ve got storms and fires and all the natural forces of the world laying waste to shit like antibodies that humanity is too advanced to be crushed by

Iâ€™ve got a peer group from which Iâ€™m totally alienated because I just donâ€™t understand normal people that well, something Iâ€™ve worked at my whole life but I just canâ€™t do

Iâ€™ve got a bad fucked up brain that canâ€™t make chemicals in the right amounts to let me see a silver lining to any of this, and Iâ€™m pretty fucking sure these issues are pretty much fixtures of my life. And Iâ€™m afraid, now, not of dying but of living

Living and seeing nothing improve, living and being forces to bear witness to the slow moving apocalypse, to the ending of all love, and to wake up one day, be older and wiser and just as miserable as I am now, and wishing I had just ended things a long time ago. Fuck.
