Nothing good in lifeI was in highschool, I had good grades, lots of friends, and I was talking to this girl. I got the offer to take college classes and my dad basically pressured me into doing it. My dad pressured me into taking more classes then I was told I should have. The girl I was talking to became my girlfriend, and I had just started taking classes the first quarter (fall quarter). Two months in, I was failing all my classes, I rarely talked to my friends, and my "girlfriend" had constantly been arguing with me because I had been working instead of texting her. I got kicked out of the college, I broke up with my ex (she and her friends harrassed me and convinced my last friend that I was a asshole), and now I'm taking online classes which I'm also failing cause they crammed a quarter worth of work into a month. So I don't have any friends that won't call me a douchebag, all I do all day is work, and there's not that much to live for. I'm not saying I'm gonna kill myself, but that "what if" question has been crossing my mind more frequently.
