Why? Whatâ€™s the point?I genuinely donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m still here. I donâ€™t see a point to living. We all die eventually and nothing in this world matters. Why live a life when youâ€™re sad all the time and thereâ€™s no end game?

I feel like Iâ€™m getting more and more disconnected from reality by the day and thereâ€™s nothing that can be done to change how I feel. I want to go ahead and get life over with, it doesnâ€™t make any sense anyway.
