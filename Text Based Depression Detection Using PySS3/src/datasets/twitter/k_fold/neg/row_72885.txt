I've got a dilemma....Basically, I'm at my "wits end", dealing with disabilities (physical and learning) and depression, and NOW social anxiety - at least when it comes to meeting and getting to know strangers/trying to make friends.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 100% ready to "give up" on life, and don't want to or enjoy living anymore, BUT (and this is a big "but") I lost a friend from High School when I was younger due to an accidental drug-overdose.  In that instance, even though I'm aware he wasn't TRYING to die, it occurred to me that to take yourself from this world is the single most selfish thing a person can do. Sure, MY pain will go away - assuming "hell" doesn't exist and all that, but I will have made everybody I know's life much, much worse and force them to cope and live with this terrible loss for the rest of their lives.

&amp;#x200B;

So to sum up, basically I WANT (very badly) to kill myself, but I'm too big of a coward to actually do it, because I think it's selfish.  

&amp;#x200B;

Can somebody either motivate/convince me to do it (preferably) OR help me, via advice, on how to get past or at least cope with my issues successfully.  And please don't suggest "therapy" as I've been in therapy, once as an adolescent-young adulthood, and once as an adult.  

&amp;#x200B;

The first "go 'round" was helpful in that it was one time a week when I actually got to "bitch" and get stuff off my chest, but I never really got to the crux of any real issues to get anything resolved.

&amp;#x200B;

The second time I went to therapy (technically, we still have yet to "finish up"), was arguably an even worse failure.  Basically, in the current experience with therapy, my therapist has more-or-less "given up" on me.  She is ending the sessions because they're focused more on my depression instead of my disability (and she's only seeing me as part of the "Spina Bifida" clinic at the hospital, not to talk about depression.)  But what she doesn't realize is their intertwined, and basically I feel like she's just using all that as an excuse and she's REALLY just "giving up" on me, because I've proven in the past - admittedly - that another one of my big problems is an un-willingness to put forth the effort and do the work to move forward in therapy.  I struggle with social anxiety, and have yet to take my therapists advice to force myself into social situations.  I just can't bring myself to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I've gotten off track and rambled on for long enough.  Thank you very much if you've bothered to read all the way to this point and I look forward to hopefully getting some good insight/advice.
