No way outIâ€™m 22. Nothing seems to change. I know that things are pretty subjective, happiness comes in waves, but the amount of bad things feels like itâ€™s just tipping the scale. 

Iâ€™m growing tired. Nothing I do can please anyone Iâ€™m with. Iâ€™m a toxic person, with a lot of mental issues I wish I didnâ€™t have to deal with. 

I feel like life is so heavy. Nothing makes me feel less empty. 

Life feels so bleak and has felt this way for so long. 

Iâ€™m thinking about maybe hanging myself. 

I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to, life is very lonely, and Iâ€™m stuck in a box all day.
