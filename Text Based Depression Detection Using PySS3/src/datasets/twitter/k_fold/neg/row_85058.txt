Im planning on ending my life tonight, what do you guys reccomend I should think about and be thankful for before I die?My looks rule out a future as girls just find my face too vile and terrifying to be even worth a hello. Not willing to float through life being seen as a monster anymore, what should I try and reminisce on?
