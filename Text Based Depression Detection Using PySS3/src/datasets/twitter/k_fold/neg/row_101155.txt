Everything is so much these daysEarlier this year, I was laid off from my dream job, my husband cheated on me and now we are getting divorced.
I had to pack my stuff and drive 20 hours alone to get back to my parents house. Shortly after I got home, I had a miscarriage. He already has another girlfriend. My car is falling apart and I can't afford to fix it or get a new one. My parents are divorcing so my college fund was drained for attorney fees, and now I have to withdraw my enrollment for college in the fall. My friends only care about me when I'm not "being a bummer." I was told verbatim "listen, I love you, but the divorce stuff is really old." I feel like my life has reached a natural conclusion. I feel like there's not really anywhere to go from here. My parents already have a grandkid from my brother, and if I die, theres a 200k life insurance policy on me that'll take care of everyone in my life. I'm a coward though and I'm mortified of physical pain so I keep dragging my feet. I wish I could just get my shit together and die, for everyone's sake.
