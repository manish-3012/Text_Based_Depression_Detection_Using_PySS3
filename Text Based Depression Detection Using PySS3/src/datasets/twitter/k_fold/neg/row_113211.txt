Killing yourself with compressed air?Okay so I just cleaned my computer with some compressed air and on the label it say a whole bunch of stuff like donâ€™t breath in, donâ€™t eat, donâ€™t shake, all that stuff that would make it dangerous. I feel like it wouldnâ€™t hurt too much, but Iâ€™m not sure. Like if I held it upside down and spray the liquid into my mouth would it hurt? Obviously itâ€™d be very cold so if it was possible with only the gaseous form that would due. Is this a good way to go?
