College was all I had going for me, now I've been kicked out.I was attending college for a bachelor in graphic arts online, in hopes to do something with my love of drawing. Sadly I screwed it up and have been kicked out, and now I honestly see no point any more. Everyone, my parents and boyfriend kept saying they'd accept my appeal, cause covid screwed it up and I became a primary caretaker to an autistic adhd boy, my cousin, but apparently that wasn't a good enough reason. What am I suppose to do? My social anxiety makes it hard to find a job,plus I'm 22 and never had a real one outside of working with my mom for a short time.
I don't wanna think this way, but college was all I had going for me. My art was all that I've ever been good at, and now I just feel like such an idiot and a failure that I don't wanna live. I'm such an idiot, I know I should have tried harder and done school, but I'm no mom or teacher and helping with my cousin, let alone teaching him after schools where cancelled was the most stressful thing up til waiting for the school to inform me if I'd been kicked or not. Which they never did, I found out on my own. I haven't even told my parents yet, but at this point I don't even want them to look at me I feel like such a failure.
