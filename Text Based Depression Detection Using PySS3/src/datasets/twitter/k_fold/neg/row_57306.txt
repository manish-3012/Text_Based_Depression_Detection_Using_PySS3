The world is so cruel, I don't want to be a part of it anymoreLast few years have been a complete shitshow. I genuinely feel like nothing good has ever happened to me. I've been happy about a few things sure, like birthdays, social events and been excited for new jobs. But none of those things ever happened. Like last year where I was in my senior year of highschool. I was struggling so much with depression and my grades were failing across the board. I didn't have many friends but I had one who said they'd go to prom with me. I was foolish to go along with this because they have ghosted me 99% of the time. I got my hopes up, and got crushed. Ended up with a suicide attempt. This person did not know or care how much that would've meant to me. And I've been home alone for 6 months after I busted my ass to pass all my classes. My friends no matter who they are do not want me anywhere near them. Either that or they do acknowledge my existence and do talk to me, but all they do is take hits at me joking about how much of a loser I am. I spent my birthday alone on a rainy day in a dark house. And then I see all these people, winning sports competitions, going to MIT, getting married and becoming rich, and even winning the fucking lottery. Whenever I entered a contest I lost and did mediocre, after weeks of preparing. I'm struggling to even get into community college. I'm 19 and never had a healthy friendship let alone a romantic relationship. I've never won anything in my goddamn life besides that one time at the state fair. So please tell me that if my life doesn't improve in the next year that I should keep living. I only have my parents who are barely here anyways.
