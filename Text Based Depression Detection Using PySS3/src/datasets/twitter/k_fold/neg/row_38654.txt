I'm just so, so tired.
I want to scream. I want to cry and god, I want to quit. I'm tired. I'm honestly so, so tired. Of doing everything, of giving my best to everything and everyone and it never being enough. I'm exhausted. I want out. 
I can't do this anymore. I've just had enough, and I wish that I actually had the courage to do something about it. I've tried a few times, but could never go through with it. So, now I'm just wish that something can put me out of this.
I want it to end. All of it.
