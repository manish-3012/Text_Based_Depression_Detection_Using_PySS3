Is it so bad that I want to die?I want to die. It's basically the only thing on Earth  I wish, since all I want seems too much asking. I don't want to bother anybody. I'm just not made to live this lie for any longer. I'm tired of being this hypocrite I am. I don't even belong in here. It appears that I never fit into anything or into any group. I refuse to keep going if it's gonna be this way all the fucking time of my pointless existence. I don't want anything but my death. It's come to a point where I don't care about money, about improving, about pursuing a career, about buying things, about anything. I fucking want to stop my existence, right now. There's nothing I want from life but its end. Just fuck you! And...world, fuck you too! My suicide means your failure as society and as human beings (as well as mine, I must add...). What you have created is a catastrophe. You all suck. I hope suicides are on the rise on and on. Your model of life is just a fucking piece of crap. I don't have anything else to say.

Thanks for reading if you did. If you didn't, thanks too.
