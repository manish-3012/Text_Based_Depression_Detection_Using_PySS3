I donâ€™t know how to fight this anymore.Iâ€™m having suicidal thoughts every fucking morning. Suicide is the first thing I think about every day. 

My mom needed me to do something for her in 2 hours and Iâ€™m waiting to do that and then try to die again. Isnâ€™t it funny? I might get scared halfway through it and stop it, well that only means that Iâ€™m gonna try again the very next day. 

I donâ€™t know how to fight it anymore. I used to be depressed and suicidal 4 years ago and getting out of it was the hardest thing Iâ€™ve ever done. I donâ€™t think I can do it again, I had hope back then but I donâ€™t anymore.
