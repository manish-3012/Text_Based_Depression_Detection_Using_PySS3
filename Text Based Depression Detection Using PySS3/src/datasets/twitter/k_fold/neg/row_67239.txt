Ignored and neglectedI do so  much 4 those around me,  help with house work, cook ,clean, hang out give money give my body yet still feel so invisible.  The female I like only pays attention to me if I'm giving her something..all relationships r that way, have to give something in order to be noticed whether it be physically or emotionally something has to be given.  Why can't i be Fukin liked loved 4 who I Am? Because I'm too wild, I love to be hurt, I'm independent, I can handle myself I'm anti-social I've killed an animal b4, I'm mean rude and will tell I what I'm thinking n u will not like it, fat weird looking been told exotic just another way to say I'm ugly. People say I'm too negative yet when I'm negative it helps me heal, not like others try to help, dae just want me to conform. Am 28everyday since I was 12 I wanted to be dead, people only notice when im nor doing things for em or need help, never oh  r u okay? How u feel ? Wanna go eat? Wanna play games? I just wanna Fukin die!!!!!!!! Drugs sounds so nice right now, I don't care, just want to not hurt this way anymore. And the only way I see that is logical is cutting everyone off, I don't want too I still wanna socialise. People say that u attract others with it energy yet all I have liking me is junkies or females that just want money and some help. All I do is help. Fuck just kill me
