I used to be in love.A few months ago, I fell in love. I had been good friends with this girl for a few months. She was friends of my friends. One night, while she was over hanging out with us, I decided to take a chance. I kissed her. Her smile lit up the room. The following month or two literally felt like a dream come true. It felt perfect, and it just felt right. We made ground-shaking love, not fucking. Love. Different. To be honest... we hadn't made it official, but I kind of thought we already were a "thing" by the way we talked to each other, and everyone else around us seemed to think the same thing. One night, I decided, ok... I want to make it official with this one. I had been going through a really tough time, and she was there for me through it all. She was all I ever wanted. She was nice to me. She's good for me. I asked her out. Long story short, she told me that she did care about me, but wasn't in a position to be in a relationship right now. My whole heart broke, right there on the spot. And since then, I have done every drug under the sun trying to cope... I've almost drank and smoked myself into oblivion, watched every Netflix show there is... but nothing seems to be able to fill the gaping whole in my heart. It literally does feel like a hole which can't be filled. I wake up and go to sleep thinking of this girl. I dream about her sometimes, too. There hasn't been a time yet where I've actually tried to kill myself, but I actually have imagined it a few times. Like, actually imagined myself, pulling the trigger on myself. I don't know where else to turn, so I am turning to you, I have faith in you, my fellow Reddiors. Someone please help me get through this.

edit: added a few important details.
