That feeling beyond suicidalIâ€™m so in peace with myself, nothing bothers or hurt me anymore. So ready to go, maybe in a few days, in a week or in a month. 

I have embraced my loneliness and transformed my pain in something positive. I wonâ€™t be sorry when I will be gone, I have done so good for this world.
