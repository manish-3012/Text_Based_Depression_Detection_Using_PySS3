TinnitusHey everyone, I've had Tinnitus for about two and a half years now. My condition is continually getting worse all the time. It's like every month I have a new sound drilling into my brain. I'm unable to pursue my dream of bartending and music making because of my bodies reaction to loud sound. 

It's like every moment in my brain is constant torture. I haven't gotten out of bed in days, there's literally rotting garbage all over my bedroom. And to top it off, the people I would normally see for support I cannot as we are in lock down due to covid 19.

What's hard for me is that even if I lost everything in my life, my job, my friends, my home or even my hearing, I could always pick things up again and start over. But this pain in my ears will never go away. No change in circumstance or working hard will make my body go back to being healthy again. Anyways thanks for reading this : (
