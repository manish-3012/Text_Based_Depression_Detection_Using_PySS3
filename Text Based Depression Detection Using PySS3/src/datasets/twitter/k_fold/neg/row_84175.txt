HelpYesterday night, my very good friend told me she tried to kill herself twice in the past two weeks. I myself suffer depression and have suicidal thoughts, but hearing this just broke me. I don't know what to do. I asked her if she was planning on trying again and she said she might. Someone, please help me. What should I tell her?
