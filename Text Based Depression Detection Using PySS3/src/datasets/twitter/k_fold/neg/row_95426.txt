I Really Want to Fucking DieI think my girlfriend is pretty much over me. She doesn't laugh or smile when we spend time together anymore but I constantly see her having a great time on social media with this one guy. I have addressed her disinterest in me but she pretty much brushes it off and still acts cold toward me. Today she said when she gets back from studying she wants to discuss some stuff with me. I love her so much and I genuinely think I am going to wind up killing myself if this ends tonight. It's not her fault though, its mine. I have been depressed forever and I don't have much of a future as far as I can tell. I don't like going to college. I don't like anything I do really. But I do like her. It feels like my heart is being slowly torn out from my chest. This might finally be what pushes me over the edge.
