Around 2 minutes ago, I took the pills.Now, I'm just kinda waiting for the pills to take effect.

Strangely, I've never felt more calm and happy in my life. I think I'll finally be able to be at peace.

I'm 14 years old. It's a shame I was never really able to enjoy my youth.

I never really had any good friends. My parents always thought I was overreacting when I said I was severely depressed. All my parents cared about were my grades, my looks and how many rewards I got. I was their "trophy," so to speak. Now that I'm about to disappear from this world, I wonder how they're going to feel? Secretly, I hope they feel extremely guilty.

I've been writing my note and revising it since I was 12 years old. I've attempted suicide 2 times, excluding this time. I really hope this one will be my last.
