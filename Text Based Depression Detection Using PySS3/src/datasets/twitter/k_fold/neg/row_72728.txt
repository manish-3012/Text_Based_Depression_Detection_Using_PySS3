Feel like I can't take it anymore...First of all, while I do feel suicidal, I can assure you that the chances of me actually doing anything are pretty much zero. I'm rational enough to know that pills wouldn't work, and the only other option is sharp things, and I'm too pathetic to handle the pain of that, if I had access to a gun, things might be different, but I don't, so don't worry about that...

Mostly, I just want to air my feelings, I doubt it'll help, but whatever.

Backstory, I'm a 40 year old pre-op (no-op, more likely) transsexual, with social-phobia, agoraphobia and anxiety issues. I've been suicidal as long as I can remember really, at least since I was 12, I feel cheated out of a life I should have had, etc etc. At the time of adolescence I was convinced that it was just the 'forever alone' aspect, but I have a loving partner now who I love very much, but it doesn't make the pain or the mental agony go away.

I'm not really sure how, or even if, I can get the suicidal feelings to go away. Sure I have the occasional 'good day' where I don't feel them, but they're few and very far between. I'm on the highest SSRI dose that my doctors will give me - partly for the anxiety, partly for 'depression' - so there's really nothing 'chemical' they'll give me that will solve things, and the mere idea of therapy sets off all kinds of social-phobia and agoraphobia alarms in my head.

The last few days has been a particularly bad spell, with me having a very public breakdown on thursday, and being VERY suicidal feeling today. Culminating in me sitting and staring at the walls for about 3 hours just feeling 'shit'.

I don't know what else to say, I'm not even sure what, if anything, there is to discuss. Sorry.
