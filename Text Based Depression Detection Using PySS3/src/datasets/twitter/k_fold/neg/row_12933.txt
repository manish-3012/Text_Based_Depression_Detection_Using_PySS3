I'd be happy to die in my sleep anytime soon.&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that I'm only 15 years old and my life has basically always been a pointless struggle.The worst part is that all I hear is that those are supposed to be 'the best' years of my life, and I don't know what real struggle is (I agree on that).So with that being said, I just think it's just not worth it living through as there is more pain and sadness than happiness and joy. I won't get into detail as of why I hate my life so much, but It's a fact. I don't enjoy living and I'd love to dodge the rest of my life.
