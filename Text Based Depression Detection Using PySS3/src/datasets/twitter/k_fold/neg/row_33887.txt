My boyfriend has no idea I'm ending my life this weekendI've been spending every moment I can with him when I get the chance since we're both in college. I just feel a little uneasy about how he will feel when he finds out what happens to me. I've been acting happy and joyful lately, which I do feel sometimes. I'm feeling determined. I already have a plan. I've written letters. I just have to go through with the next step. I'm not scared to die anymore.
