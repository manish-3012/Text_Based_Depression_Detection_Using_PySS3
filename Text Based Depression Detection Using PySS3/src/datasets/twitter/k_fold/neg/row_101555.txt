Don't want to end it but don't want to keep goingI've never been to a therapist (poor funding plus parents said no) and I've never been diagnosed, but something's wrong. I'm discouraged and unmotivated and I want to end it. Just so we're clear, **I am not asking to be diagnosed** (per the rules) nor do I want to be, but I do have some vents if that's okay. 

First, I want to end it, but also I don't. I don't want to put in the effort and I don't want the pain, I just want it to end. To no longer exist, having never inhabited this world. 

Secondly, I don't want to get better. I don't feel motivated to try to talk to someone or seek help. I don't want them to know because I don't want them to help. 

Thirdly, I have a paper due soon (I'm in high school) but I don't want to write it. The pressure is real. I'll be ashamed if I get a bad grade. 

I just want it to cease. Cease the paper. Cease the pressure. Cease existing.

I'm not sure why I'm posting here. I won't know if this is the right subreddit for my post. Maybe I'm asking, am I lazy? I don't want to do anything at all, not get better, but not even die? I don't know myself anymore, I don't know what I'm feeling... Maybe subconsciously I want to take a break, to figure it out, but I can't. Because of the paper. Because of my parents. Because of myself. ^(gosh, I'm such a mess)
