struggling with depression and PTSD following rape3 weeks ago I was raped on my way home from a club, I was threatened with a knife and left half conscious on the street before a stranger called the police who took me home. I don't know who raped me. I have reported it to the police and everything. 
Afterwards I thought I was going to kill myself and called an ambulance who took me to a psych ward where i was evaluated and discharged to the care of a community crisis team.
I have been offered all sorts of counselling from my uni, rape crisis centre and i have an ISVA. However i have received basically no support from my flatmates who blame me for what happened because i was drunk. They can't and won't talk to me about how i feel or what happened. They have basically stopped communicating with me altogether.
I have spent the past three weeks completely isolated, trying to sleep and struggling with flashbacks.
I just need a friend, not a professional or therapist or doctor, i just want a friend to come and spend time with me and hug me and just be there.
I have thought about overdosing a lot this week and have come very close. 
I just felt i should tell someone and i've tried phoning the samaritans, i just haven't found it helpful, maybe this will be more helpful for me?
