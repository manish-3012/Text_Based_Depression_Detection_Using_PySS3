My life is spinning out of control and I need advice.I can't tell how many times I've posted here. I've had suicidal thoughts since my sophomore year of high school and was hospitalized my junior year. I've been living with my grandma for a year now and I found out her mother is moving in with us. My great grandmother is abusive towards her and I can't stand it. It's caused her to start drinking more and I've been trying so hard not to cry. I know this sounds cruel but does anyone know how she can be sent to a nursing home? I might explode if she begins living with us soon.
