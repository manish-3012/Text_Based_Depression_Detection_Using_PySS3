I am this closeToday something stupid happened. Something that can and probably will ruin my life. I let a guy use TeamViewer to do his homework for an IT class. I saved that file as hisname.docx and deleted eveything and did mine. Except one mistake. I didnt even notice that task. I am about to be put on the academic dishonesty list if I don't get this mess straightened out. I will lose my financial aid and drop out. I can't sign up for any other college because I didn't actually do the finals but I got into it because of my interview. It's over then. I had so much potential and I wasted it. Because I was stupid. I'm just waiting till next monday to hear the results. I hope for the people that love me that I won't get on that list. I also have a suicidal history and I was in a psychiatric institution. There is just too much to worry about while living. Not to hurt anyone. All the while getting hurt yourself. Its too hard
