My emotional support is a catI don't have anything anymore. No one knows how to help no matter their education or personal relation to me. No one can give me a reason to live, no one can comfort me and tell me it's OK, no one can look at me and say I'll be fine. Everyone left, no one cares, except for my fluff ball who let's me cry in his fur. My emotional support is a cat.
