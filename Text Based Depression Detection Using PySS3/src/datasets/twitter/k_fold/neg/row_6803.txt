Today is the darkest in a long timeToday is the darkest day since I met my wife. It started with a long nightmare of me killing myself in front of everyone I love over and over and over again, in more and more Fucked up and painful ways, no one cared at all. I woke up hyperventilating and crying, I was supposed to be at work but I can't bring myself to call in. I'm thinking about killing myself a lot right now and have major panic attacks. My wife came home so that will have to wait for now I guess, but it would be so much easier...
