I hate it when people invalidate your feelingsI hate it when someone says I'm being too negative and that I just need to have a more positive outlook on life. Maybe what I actually need is for someone to just listen to me for once and quit telling me how to feel or think. If I want to express myself in a negative way then fucking let me. Quit invalidating my feelings. This just makes me feel even more hopeless because it makes me feel like my feelings aren't being heard. It's telling me that my feelings don't matter. More people should be aware of emotional invalidation and how it's very hurtful to people. Quit telling me that having a negative view of certain things is wrong. It's just my opinion and I'm allowed to fucking have one. No matter how much I say people probably aren't going to get it. So what's the point? I want to die because I feel like people aren't taking my feelings seriously. I just want the world to be a better place but that's never going to happen because people are too stuck in their own heads thinking that there must be something wrong with me. I fucken hate people who are all fucking be positive and love yourself and all that shit. It really pisses me off. It makes me feel like there's something wrong with me. I don't know what else to say. I wish I could make people see why this is so fucking important to me.
