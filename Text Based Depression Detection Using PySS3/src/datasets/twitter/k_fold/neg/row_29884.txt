I never thought I would say this. My suicide date is set.It will be on July 22 2017.

I'm allright. I have a pretty good life. This choice isn't born out of suffering or pain. It isn't born out of emotions but out of a conscious and rational choice. It is a decision that will stick.

Relieved is the best word I can use to describe how I feel. This madness is at last going to end. Nothing can hurt me anymore, because my death is planned. Nothing can go wrong. If I get fired, why care? If I get cancer, why care? It's liberating not to have anxiety, fear and those things.

The only thing that is left to decide is the way I'm going to put an end to this. But I still have a lot of time to figure that out and to prepare so that nothing goes wrong.
