I'm so alone I'm desperate for a depression groupBut because of Covid they are only doing them online, if they do them at all. It's hard enough to walk into a room of strangers but to do it online? I don't think so. Plus, I have a roommate and that would be awkward. I'm desperate for a depression group. I'm desperate to feel even a little better, where I'm not thinking about suicide 24/7.
