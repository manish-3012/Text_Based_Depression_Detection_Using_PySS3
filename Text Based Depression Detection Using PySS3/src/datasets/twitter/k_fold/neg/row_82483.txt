I am considering getting diagnosis, but I will be rejecting therapy.Folks in the comments, calm down, let me have this first:

I had been having a very long time being suicidal and cannot stop my violent reaction to things that comes out of the blue/cancelled plans by punching walls, cutting myself (formerly) and biting my arms. The bites are getting more and more frequent and violent,until yesterday I finally strucked a bite on the front of my left wrist which left violet dots of my sharp teeth, clearly visible. 

I finally knew I can't really hold anymore longer until I would rip a chunk of meat out of my arms. 

So I, with a withering hope for therapy (services here are wack and they call us teenage freaks for acting like that for "fame") am finally searching up for private institutions for diagnosis. By myself because my parents rejected my idea of being mentally ill.  

But if the results come back positive of a mental illness, I will be rejecting therapy for the time being. 
Reasons? 

**1.** I will be taking my university entrance exam the following year. I cannot really spare time grinding for studies and doing therapy at the same time. I know I can only have 4 hours 44 minutes a day to sleep (I followed a sleep formula) and the rest is for eating, drawing for uni portfolio (and possibly commissions) and studying as majority. 

**2.**Finance. I do have a studying fund raised by my grandmother and my mother but it's being drained out little by little by my father who is giving out loans to his relatives. When the loans will be paid, I am not sure and I don't guarantee or believe it will ever be paid back on time. At this point I can't really care less about family business, but for my own survival only, as my mother had already been sucked the hell out of her being every essence of strength and youth because of this marriage and her passion for the profession. 

**3.** I wanted to give self-therapy a try. If they are putting me into CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) then *back to point 2* costly. I had done my own part of research on my own symptoms and theraupic exercises, thing is to keep uo with it...ðŸ¤”

So, that's it folks, any better suggestions?
