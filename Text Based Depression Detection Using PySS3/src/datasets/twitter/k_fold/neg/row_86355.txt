Some people are just meant to sufferWhy even live? For a while now I haven't been able to enjoy anything. I can't enjoy anything anymore. I can't enjoy playing video games or even watching my favorite show anymore. I've done nothing but cry, sleep, panic about my future, and point a gun at my head everyday for a while now. This is the "precious" life that people tell me to keep living? Really??? 

There's nothing precious, valuable, or important about my life. If I die then absolutely nothing will change in this world. The only people that are significant are ones that left a mark in history. People that did great things. I can't do things like that, especially since my past has already ruined my future. I'm just a person sitting at home doing absolutely nothing. You can't take someone that's great and influential like Albert Einstein and say me and him are just as important. No. It doesn't work like that. Human beings need to stop deluding themselves into thinking they're important when they're not. 

I'm just a nobody that will never know what happiness looks like.
