My only reason for having not done so was that of practicality. That's not enough any more.In the times where I really felt there was no point, that it was the best and only thing to do just to make everything stop, practicality was the last line of defence against my head. Or to be more specific; I couldn't think about how I could do it without someone having to find the body. The idea of my parents, or the closest things I have to friends, having to find me dead by whatever way I chose and having to deal with that...it was enough, for the most part, to stop the less sincere thoughts of attempts. 

But now...that seems a terribly stupid reason not to. Everything else has gone to hell, so why would it matter that someone would have to find it? There's ways that can be avoided, anyway. After all, the first few times my reason was 'I couldn't do that to the people I care about', but I got rid of that notion pretty fast. It's very easy to do unforgiveable things to people, if you're trying to lessen the blow. All kinds of things to be said or done, and I wouldn't even need to do many as there's so few people who talk to me anymore. 

Unemployed, ugly as hell, no prospects or directions, nor will to find either. No will at all. Feels like I haven't had a real conversation with anyone in months, and I don't even want to have one any more. I've lost my ability to put on *that* mask and be able to just grin and bear it and seem normal to all of he outside world that'd notice. It's too much to lie and pretend everything's okay. It's never been okay. I just can't any more. So why should practicality even be an issue? Wouldn't even be my problem, cause if all went well, I wouldn't even live to hear tell of it.
