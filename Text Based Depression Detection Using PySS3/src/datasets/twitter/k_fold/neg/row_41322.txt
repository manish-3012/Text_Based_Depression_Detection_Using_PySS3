I should have been only bones by nowBut here Iâ€™m still sucking air and being miserable all the time. After my last serious attempt 3 years ago I couldnâ€™t do another because of survival instinct. After that I became more self destructive to make my life more miserable so I could beat my survival instinct.

I need to man up and end this existence. If 6 years old can do it then why canâ€™t I? I need to stop overthinking and just do it.
