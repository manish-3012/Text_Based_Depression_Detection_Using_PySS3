My coworkers are talking about how I'm a snob over IM right next to me at work and I just want to dieI know I have anxiety and depression and probably PTSD and maybe Asperger's (I have no fucking idea) because I just can't function

I'm not normal. I'm uncomfortable to be around. I can't be genuine. I am unable to open up and be vulnerable and make a connection with anyone. I can't communicate. I'm too anxious and depressed.

I've been trying sooooooo fucking hard over the past two years and I'm just ready to give up. 

I'm just crying in my car on lunch and just want to go walk into the intersection and end everything. The only things that make me happy are my partner and cats but if I only get to spend an hour or two a day with them then what's the point?
