When your words bite you in the ass.I am 22, and I have been depressed for the last 12 years. I was diagnosed at 10 by a pediatric doctor. I have only in the last year or so started to see a therapist/psychaitrist, but I always thought I would just live with depression and be functional, maybe with low energy and a constant melancholy but you know, functional. For the most part I am, I work 5 days a week and I have an apartment I share with my boyfriend and two beautiful and wonderful cats that are my whole life. I have my own car and we pay our bills without help from anyone else. 

The last two or three years have been pretty rough. I had a terrible breakup, my father passed away unexpectedly, and I was almost homeless a few different times. I finally got a stable job last August and haven't had as many life issues as before, except I fucking. HATE. my job. It is really the worst aspect of my life, and has driven me into a constant manic depressive state. I'm miserable, I don't do anything but sleep and go to work. I fucking hate myself and my life. Nothing I have tried has worked. Medicine, exercise, even "self medicating" with booze and weed doesn't work (least not for long). I always said I would never hurt or kill myself because it's so permanent and I'm a fundamentally indecisive person but I've never been this close before. I can't afford to quit and look for something else, and I hardly have to motivation or energy to apply to something else. The job market is hard here. I don't know where else to go or who to talk to, I'm never taken seriously. Sorry for the long post. But I really need someone to talk to or some way to vent.
