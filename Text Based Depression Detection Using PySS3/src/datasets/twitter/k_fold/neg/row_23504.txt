Anyone who can talk to me?Hi I really need people I can talk to right now.. I am not okay atm.. I'm in pain and my mom's bf basically hit me and strangled me. My life is honestly pretty shit overall and I try to keep going everyday, but today was just a bit too much.. I called the police and they were here.. but in the end I am just still left alone.. because there's not much I can do, but file charges.. I feel so alone in life tbh.. I don't know where to go anymore.
