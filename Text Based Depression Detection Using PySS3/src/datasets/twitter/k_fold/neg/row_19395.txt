how do you leave a letter, for maybe people in the internet?i wonder how id organize letters, photos and things.  
i want to die. not feeling sad, angry, resentful, just decided.

i am clear headed.

i know it is selfish to leave and to be remembered. a simple "i love you" would do for them, but i want to compile things thats inspired me of them and how it was good that they made me hopeful throughout.

maybe console them that theyve ever been the just right of people ive met

open for serious ideas. thank you.
