another failureAnother day at a job I hate. A job I feel shame for even considering let alone having it be my only option. Someone I have feelings for came in and saw me there in uniform and it just ruined me... I tried joking playing it off but I knew how I felt. People there see me at the bottom of society, they throw things at me, insult me, talk down me. But, them seeing me there really hit me. I drank and tried hanging myself. And failed again. This is my third suicide attempt. I looked in the mirror and have the marks on my neck but no results. I just want this to end. I wish I could start my life over knowing what I know now. I wish my brain wasn't malfunctioning and self-destructive. I don't even wish to be happy, just even. A normal level of emotions. I'm tired of the daily thoughts of ending it all...
