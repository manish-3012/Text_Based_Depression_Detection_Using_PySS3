Yesterday I legitimately considered suicide for the first time in years and I don't know whyI've struggled with depression my whole life but, through therapy and medication, have been largely okay for the last five years. Before that I thought about suicide constantly. Since then i've thought about it here and there, but not seriously.


Yesterday I was driving home to my incredible family who makes me very happy. I have a good job, hobbies, etc. I'm truly typically happy overall. But yesterday... I thought about rolling my car off the highway. I know that everyone gets those intrusive thoughts once in a while like "hey I could do this and what would happen." This wasn't that. This was a twenty minute internal battle not to do it. A serious struggle. 


I don't know why. It came out of nowhere. No reasons for it. I just don't know why.


I kept looking for the best place to do it. I was in the middle of three lanes and looking for the perfect spot to get some air and roll. I found it. I found it and I started to turn the fucking wheel. Heading toward the embankment, ready to fucking yank the wheel to the right and end it all, I came to my senses and pulled over, swerving back as I did.


And now I'm okay. In one way, at least. In that I don't want to kill myself. But I am fucking freaked out. I have no idea where it came from or why. I'm scared now. What if it happens again? I shook all night and didn't talk. My fiancee asked what was up and I just couldn't tell her. 


For the first time in years, I am terrified of myself.
