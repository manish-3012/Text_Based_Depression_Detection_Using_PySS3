I don't want to kill myself, I just want the unbearable pain to endI've never had anyone my whole fucking life. My father died not long ago and I don't have any family.

I'm 19 and I don't give a shit about success, wealth, any of that bullshit. I just want a woman that I can love and loves me too. Why does love hurt so fucking bad? Why does it feel like my own stomach has cut itself open? Why do I feel unbearable physical pain right now just because I'm in love and I want her for the rest of my life? All those heartbreaks I've been through already despite my young age. All those girls who have given me pain I cannot describe. What do I have to do so it won't end fucked up again?
