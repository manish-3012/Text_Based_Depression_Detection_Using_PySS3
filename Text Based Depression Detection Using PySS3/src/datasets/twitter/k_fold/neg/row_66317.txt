please try and keep it togetherthis afternoon i will be attending the funeral of my brother who sadly completed suicide two weeks ago. outwardly he was a warm, kind, compassionate man - while he had his struggles (who doesnâ€™t!) and perhaps unhealthy methods of self medicating, he was showing signs of coming out of a particularly long bout of depression. 

i donâ€™t tell you this to make you sad, or to get sympathy - just to say that you will never know how your death with affect others. 

i loved mik a lot, i liked him a lot, iâ€™m really, really, really fucking sad. 

please try really hard to keep it together. 
it is shit now, but it wonâ€™t be shit forever.
