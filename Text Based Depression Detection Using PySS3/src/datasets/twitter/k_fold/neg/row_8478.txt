I don't know why I'm posting here.I don't know why I am typing this out. Maybe this is just another cry for help or maybe it's easier to talk to strangers. I taught myself to tie a noose today. My father hung himself, so maybe "like father like son" is accurate here. I could do it at work easily. Theyd find me at the end of my shift, I'd have 4 hours to cash out my chips. It would be easy...

I've been sure it's some sort of depression or something since my youth, but i can't afford help. I can't fix myself. I have been working on trying to make myself better. Cutting back drinking. Losing weight. It isn't working. And I find myself spending more and more time each day regretting my existence. I feel like a burden. 

I'm 26 and nothing to show for it. Like, literally nothing. The job I worked hard for for over six years decided I wasn't worth the promotion. I don't even drive (my mother was an alcoholic that never had a license and father took his life when I was young. No way to learn.) 

I don't know what I'll do at work today. My guess is my job and nothing more. I'll talk myself down again and just exist in mental misery. Maybe just posting this here will exercise that demon for the time being and I'll be able to press on another day.
