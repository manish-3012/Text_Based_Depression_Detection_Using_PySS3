I tried to jump of a roof yesterdayYesterday was a bad day, so I hurt myself but that didn't help so I drank. The drinking gave me the courage I needed to climb on my roof. I sat there for about an hour. The moment I wanted to jump one of my friends called me. I it weren't for her I wouldn't e typing this right now.
I know I'm a selfish, egoistic person for wanting to end my life but I just feel like everything would be easier for my parents, my sister, my friends if I just was normal.
It would be better if I was never born
