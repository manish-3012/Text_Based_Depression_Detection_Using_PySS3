Attempted last night (and failed)For what it's worth, this is not my first attempt in the last half a year and I've always woken up drowsy for a day or too but fine. 

I was on Lexapro on and off for almost a decade for depression until I developed a debilitating anxiety disorder and had to switch. I have currently been on Paxil for almost three months, titration up and now I have been on 50mg CR daily. 

While the anxiety has receded I am still managing it with Xanax XR. The new dose of Paxil makes me sedated in the morning (I take it at night) but then when it wears off I am struck with anxiety and very strong suicidal thoughts. 

I feel like I have exhausted all options, when I emailed my pdoc he asked me to stay on the Paxil as it could just be "side effects". I can't even make see him until the end of June as he will be on holiday. 

Previously my husband and I considered hospitalisation but the state mental health care in my country sucks, private hospitals are way too expensive, and I don't know if they can help me at all, considering I am not "unstable". 

I can no longer bring myself to do simple things like shower or leave the house, and my weight has plummeted. There are no stressors in my life since I quit my job two weeks ago. I just feel at the end of my rope right now.
