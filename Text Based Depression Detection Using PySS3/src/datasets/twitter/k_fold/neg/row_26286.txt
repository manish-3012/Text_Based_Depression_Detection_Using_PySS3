I got inducted into CAMH, AMA.Some weeks ago, I decided to send some goodbye e-mails to a few close friends. What I forgot to consider was that one of them read her e-mail frequently. She informed the police, who then found me that same day. Iâ€™d like to share what Iâ€™ve seen and learned from experiences dealing with the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. What happened afterwards will be the subject of a separate, future post on another subreddit.

&amp;nbsp;

Some highlights:


-	After asking about my feelings, the responding officers provided a friendly escort to CAMHâ€™s Emergency Department (ED).

-	The processing of cases is summarized as: admission (verify OHIP, paperwork, questions) &gt; triage (short assessment interview) &gt; waiting room &gt; beds &gt; ED discharge or transfer

-	What they say about a lack of funding for mental health programs is certainly true. This is reflected in long wait times, overworked staff, and not enough resources (e.g. beds).

-	If you are able to decide what to wear and carry, leave out potentially self-harming items (e.g. belts, shoelaces) and bring a book.

-	The food is healthy but a little bland, school lunch quality. Dietary requests (e.g. vegan, kosher) need to be made in advance.

-	Cellphones are not allowed once you get past the waiting room.

-	Staff psychiatrists are present during regular business hours. In addition to evaluating patients, they also have the authority to hold and release them.

-	Follow-up care after discharge consists of the bridging clinic, which has connections to counselling, medication (can obtain a compassionate discount), and a social worker.

-	There seems to be two main types of patients: those who talk and move too much, and those who donâ€™t.

-	Never underestimate what some time to think away from any distractions can do for you.
