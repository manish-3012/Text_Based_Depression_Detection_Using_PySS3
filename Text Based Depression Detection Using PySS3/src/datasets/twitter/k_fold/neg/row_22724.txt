Developing suicidal thoughtsHi all,

A couple of months ago I developed a thought that I can commit suicide after 10 years or so, and I feel that the thought gives me some 'relief'. 

I have some suffering and deprivation in my life: hypersensitive,  anxiety disorder, no feeling in my sexual organ (but still a libido), hyperacusis, very low self-esteem. My intensely loved father died this year at 43. I always had some difficulties with enjoying, surrendering oneself to the present moment. 

So life can feel like a heavy burden, and the thought that I can step out of it makes it feel lighter. I'm just so scared of all the time that lies ahead? Maybe it gets worse and 'unsafer' with more responsibilities etc. (I'm 22 with Asperger's)

Thanks for the opportunity of sharing this
