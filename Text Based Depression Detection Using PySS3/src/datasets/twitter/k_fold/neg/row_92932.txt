How much do I have to tolerate?I just recently turned 20(f). People told me it's still pretty young for me to have problems.

Ever since I was young, I've never experienced love from family/peers. I've been bullied endlessly and had no proper friends on my school days. Constant abuse from my family, my grandma (the only person I'm close with) passed away. I don't have a mom and my dad mentally and at some bad days, physically abuse me. The people I considered as friends left me for other friends. I've been raped as a child and I've been sexually active, giving my body to guys who want it because that's what I deserve. I've stabbed myself one time but it didnt kill me. I jumped out of the roof one time, nothing. 

I've only been to one good relationship and I got pregnant. The country I live in is pretty strict about pregnancy before marriage and I'll be behind bars and deported once anyone finds out. I didn't eat, sleep, and overdosed multiple times on panadol/adol in hopes of not spending on expensive and illegal abortion pills. I miscarried. 

I feel empty and lost. I wanted to keep the child because I needed a constant kind of love for myself, even if my future is in the line. The only person that loved me left because of the pregnancy. 

I have no one. I felt love for a moment and for once, I truly felt happy. I lost it. I was attached to him and I love him until now. I can't bring myself to hate anyone, despite what they've done. 

Why can't I hate everyone instead? Why is it that all that hate I have is just directed at myself? I know I didnt do anything wrong but... I would rather hate myself than everyone.

I'm losing a part of myself day by day and I'm scared that one time, I'll hate myself so much that I'll just get it over with and rid myself of this world.

What do I do? I want to kill myself. Nobody loves me cuz I'm not worth anything. I want to kill myself. What should I do?
