If you knew that you would get better eventually, but it would take a decade at the least, would you stay?Four years ago I made a promise to myself that I would get better. Every single day was a battle and I did get better in many ways, although the process was excruciating and uncomfortable.

But it might as well be compared to having scratched the surface. The underlying and lingering problems built over the course of my entire life is just too much.

It feels like building a pyramid by hand while watching others construct shiny modern buildings with advanced tools. There's no end in sight and no guarantee that my construction is sound or that the building will ever be completed. Four years is a long time but it feels like a speck in the grand scheme of things.

Anyone else have this problem? How are you dealing with it?
