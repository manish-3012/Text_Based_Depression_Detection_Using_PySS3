I'm failing at everything.For a while, I've realized that suicide is probably the best option for me. But I'm paralyzed by the fear of failing. I don't think I've ever been successful in my life, and failing would probably mean my family would find out. They've made fun of my self harm before and didn't do anything when I told them I was feeling suicidal two years ago. If I failed, I'm afraid of just making them angry. I feel like I'm already such an inconvenience to the people I love, I'm so afraid of making them feel like they have to worry about me. I stress them out so much by being depressed and I don't want to make them feel like they need to stress even more. I've debated all sorts of methods, but I'm afraid of being an inconvenience, even in death, like I don't want anyone to find me, I don't want to make a mess either. But there's no way of killing yourself that doesn't involve either of those. So I guess I'll always be too afraid to do it on purpose. Right now, I'm just hoping one day soon I'll self harm bad enough to do it on accident. I'm scared of my future, too. Especially because I'll never be able to do something I love for a living. I'm not good enough at art to get into a school for that. People my age are capable of so much more than me, they create work with so much meaning and depth and skill, and I just hate everything I create. I'll never be successful, and if I can't do anything with art for a living, I have no idea what the fuck to do. I don't love or enjoy anything as much as art. And everyone my age is getting their lives together and being excited for the future, and I find it so discouraging. People my age, dealing with depression too, are still able to handle their lives, and it makes me feel like I don't deserve the happiness I wish I could have. So it makes sense to me that I should just leave everyone already.

Sorry if I sound like a whiny kid. I don't know where to turn to with these feelings and thoughts, though.
