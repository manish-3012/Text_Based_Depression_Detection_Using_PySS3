Life is PointlessWhy is life so pointless. Nothing matters? Why should I keep working in my useless underpayed job, why should I get home from work to spent the rest of my day playing video games to cope with the fact I don't have friends. Why should I keep drinking to fill the void after my gf left me. There is no reason why I shouldn't end it right here, right now. I've lost everybody I care about. It's just a big ol void
I just can't continue like this
I just feel :( all the time

So many questions, and no answers
