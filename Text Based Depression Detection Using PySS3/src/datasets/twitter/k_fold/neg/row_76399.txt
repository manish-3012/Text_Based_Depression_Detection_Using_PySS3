I want to live but suicide feels like my only optionI don't want to go into details because its really hard to talk about, but the situation thats happening is completely unfixable right now, and I honestly can't handle it anymore. Does anyone else feel like this? They really really don't want to kill themselves but feel they can't continue living because of their quality of life? I have no one to talk to right now because no one is understanding of me and my situation.
