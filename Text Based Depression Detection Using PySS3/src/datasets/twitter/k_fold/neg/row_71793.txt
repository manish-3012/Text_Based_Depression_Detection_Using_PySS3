i don't know if i can waitmy boyfriend left me a week ago. i'm completely dead inside. he was my fucking everything. he was my future. i don't have anything now. i want to get help and i'm trying but i don't know if i can wait long enough for the therapist to schedule me in. everyday hurts more than the last. i lost my only friend. i don't want to be here anymore. there's no point. i can't eat, i can't sleep. all i do is wake up, cry and go to work like a zombie. it hurts.
