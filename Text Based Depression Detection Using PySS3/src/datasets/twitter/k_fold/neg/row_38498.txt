Sick of people and sick of hate and sick of everythingYou know people I'm sick of everything. I think I am just gonna kill myself. The world seems to be a very cruel place to me and I feel like it's getting worse. I feel like everyone is against each other and hates each other. I can't tolerate people anymore. I'm sick of people on here and I'm sick of people in real life. I don't think anyone is really helpful. I'm really angry and just sick of it. People are evil. I feel like people are actually evil and don't give one little fuck. I live next to a fucking highway but that's not the only way to kill myself. I also have a knife.
