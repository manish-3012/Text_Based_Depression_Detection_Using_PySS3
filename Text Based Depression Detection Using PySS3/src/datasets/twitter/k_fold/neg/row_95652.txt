I ruined my life and everything fucking hurts right now.I cheated on my wife. Ruined her life. Had a kid with her and I feel like Iâ€™m gonna ruin the kidâ€™s life. My wife is sick now and doctors donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with her, and I feel like this is cosmic karma coming back at me. I have a few guns - a 12ga and a .357. Those are the ways Iâ€™m thinking of right now. Either that or hanging myself. Afraid of repercussions of my suicide. Will my wife harm herself or our baby? What will my family do? I just want to be selfish right now but I canâ€™t.
