Dark Cloud of LoudHi everyone. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I get no joy from life anymore. The other day I asked my boyfriend if he would allow me to kill myself because Iâ€™m suffering and in pain but he wouldnâ€™t agree to the plan. I donâ€™t understand. We donâ€™t let animals continue living in pain. We donâ€™t even let some people continue living in physical pain. So why do we just leave people in mental and emotional pain to get on with it? Some of us donâ€™t want to â€œkeep going.â€ Some of us see no light at the end of the tunnel. I am 23 years old and I have very severe anxiety that mainly revolves around my health. I worry that I have every illness that ever existed. I also worry that anything j do is going to kill me, for example, playing Animal Crossing. I canâ€™t place paths in that game because if I do my head says Iâ€™ll die. I know it makes no sense. I have depression. PTSD. I recently found out that I suffered emotional and physical abuse as a child which has lead to me ending my â€œrelationshipâ€ with my mother. I now have no members of a family left because they have all been involved in that abuse. I also went on to experience abuse in romantic relationships and am currently being investigated for a personality disorder. I havenâ€™t been able to go to college or university. I donâ€™t even know what it is I want to do with my life. My head constantly feels loud. If itâ€™s not the health anxiety talking it is the voices of various other people in my head who have other interests and ideas. I canâ€™t see what they look like I can only hear them and they all sound like one big mess, talking over each other. Sometimes I canâ€™t even sleep because they are telling me their ideas so loudly and I feel motivated to carry them out. They convince me that I have the skills to do things that I have never even done. I feel like I need to learn to do anything, that I just know how to do it, and then I get disappointed when I realise I canâ€™t. Sometimes Iâ€™m convinced that I am a famous singer or that I wrote songs on the radio. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me but itâ€™s too loud and too confusing. I also donâ€™t deserve love. I finally found someone who was willing to stick around but Iâ€™ve been horrible to him. I have episodes of intense anger and impulse. It feels as though a black cloud comes over me and I have no control over what I say or do. The other day that happened and I threw a bag off my boyfriend and today I have pushed him and called him some horrible names. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Life brings me no joy. There isnâ€™t any argument for why I deserve and should be here.
