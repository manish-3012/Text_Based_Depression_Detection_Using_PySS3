Not depressed but suicidal.I'm not even depressed at the moment I'm just in an insane amount of pain due to chronic health conditions. I don't know if I'll ever feel ok and able to enjoy life, so the idea of suicide just seems logical. I'm not going to act on it soon, but I know I will be battling this shit my whole life and the bad outweighs the good. I don't have a set time when I'm going to do this, but I wish people could understand that I'm in more pain than it's worth living with. These conditions have caused my to never reach my full potential and the battle will continue on through the years. It's frustrating that no matter what I do my friends and family will never be ok with me checking out but I just want some peace. I've been in constant pain for 8 months now and there's no light at the end of the tunnel. I wrote a suicide note explaining this and I hope that will give my friends and family some solace but I know when the inevitable happens it will tear them apart.
