Homelessness hopelessness ?I was forced to leave the love of my life yesterday. I knew over a month ago that I would be dead soon. This solidifies that feeling. 

For those of you still in the planning stages, what all are you doing to make sure your passing is as easy as it can be for your loved ones? I have so many loose ends to tie up. I've already began selling things and the final sale will be the property I inherited from my father passing away last year.
