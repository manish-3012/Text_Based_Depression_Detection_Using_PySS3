i have a list on imdb called "reasons not to die now" it has all all the movies and tv shows i wanna watch......so if it's up to me the guys from warner brothers gave me 2 more years to live. This was actualy a very sadistic way to look at what my reasons to remain in "here", but sadly still true. 
i never wanted to kill myself i dont wanna cause disturbance to only people in this world that actually care for me, i don't want people in general to start coming up with reasons to why i harmed myself, and most importantly after the crises i always get toughts that i dont want to be death. i just wish i can go back in time a strangle myself with the umbilical cord
