I AM GOING TO DO IT!I canâ€™t live life any more. I made one mistake 2
Years ago and my husband has made me feel guilty for it every day since. Iâ€™m going to kill myself because I have tried every single day to make up for it and he will never ever forgive me and just wants more and more from me and me not being able to cope with it mentally means Iâ€™m protecting the person who he thinks Iâ€™m having a relationship with. I donâ€™t even leave the fucking house so how am I meant to be having a fucking affair. I canâ€™t even breathe correctly so Iâ€™m going to end it and stop breathing.
