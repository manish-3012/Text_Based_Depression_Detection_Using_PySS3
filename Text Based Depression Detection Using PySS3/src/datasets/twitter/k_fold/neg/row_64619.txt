Why shouldn't I kill myself considering it actually does solve all my problem?I wont get into the specifics as to why but I have been thinking about suicide a lot lately. I am trying to weigh the pros and cons of it. It really does pretty much solve all my problems and worries.  This pain may or may not be temporary but it hurts a lot nonetheless. The one big negative is the mark it leaves on the people close to you. The other is the fact that I wont get to enjoy the small pleasures of my life and also there is a very small chance that life may turn out good at some point. If some day I feel my pain is big enough and unbearable enough overcome all these factors, what is so bad about suicide?
