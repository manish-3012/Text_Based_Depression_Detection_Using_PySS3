My friend is suicidal and is committing suicide Sunday.My friend keeps joking about suicide, and I took it as jokes. But he keeps getting more and more serious. We are skyping as I type this and he is talking about how life doesn't matter, and how he's gonna wake up at midnight this sunday and chug a bunch of pills and die. He said how we stopped caring and thinks no one will care. He has friends, he just doesn't care anymore. I have no idea what to do, I've tried to talk to him and he just says no one cares, whatever who cares. He is not bullied or abused or anything, but he just doesn't care and he wants to commit suicide. I've tried having heart to heart conversations with him but he just deflects it and says how he doesn't see a future in himself etc etc. What do I do I'm freaking out because I don't want him to kill himself. He said thanks for trying but you don't have to anymore. What the fuck do I do. I see him tomorrow in AP world and PE. I'm scared, I don't know if hes taking a joke too far or hes actually killing him self. Help.
