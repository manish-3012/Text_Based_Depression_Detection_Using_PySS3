WHY DO YOU HATE MEI understand that i fucked up, we both acknowledged that and said it "wasnt really anyone's fault" i appreciated that a lot considering it was really my fault. so i moved on and accept that what happened happened. but jesis christ you won't even talk to me. you arent even sleeping next to me anymore. and then the next day you pretend like none of it happened. what the fuck am i supposed to do with that? I'm so fucking sick of this cycle. here I am, sleeping over at YOUR PLACE and you're all the way on the other side of the couch. are we still even dating? are you trying to stick a fucking dagger in me because i hurt you? i know i hurt you and im sorry i did but you said you forgave me so i forgave myself. but here we are. on opposite ends of the couch. and i just want to die. i could leave right now, crash my car into a fucking tree or something. i could jump off a nearby bridge. and god do i want to, but if i do i just want to UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD. You say you don't want to break up, we're seeing a movie together tomorrow, we're going to see a concert in May, so what the fuck? why are we on opposite ends of the couch? i asked you what was wrong and you just kept saying you didnt want to talk about it. fuck it honestly, i cant play this fucking game anymore. i dont care who you are right now, i cant live without who you were.
