I've suddenly realised I have no other option, I'm getting my affairs in order now. The end should come later today.I have failed. A piece of coursework for my university is due in Wednesday and there is so much to do and so little time in which to do it I will absolutely fail it. 

I haven't been attending much as of recently, my heads imploded, I'm isolated here and I've become a disgusting degenerate. Drinking and drinking and smoking and staying in bed because I'm too terrified to face the reality that is the outside world. 

I nearly killed myself in January because I was on the brink of failing, however, I managed to get the exams delayed due to genuine reasons. Car crash and eviction. This time, what excuse do I have? It's my own fault. I have to pass everything to pass. So I've failed this. I will have to set my plan in action.

My whole meaning in life is my future career, my dream. If I fail this I will be resigned to my shitty hometown working in a dead end job miserable, a burden to my family and probably end up killing myself anyway. At least this way it'll be done far away from everyone. 

This and my messy head that never stops being messy and my body and my mind and everything. No. No more. It ends here. I'm 20 years old and I've been insane on and off since 14, it's just getting worse as I get older, the pills don't seem to be helping. But they'll help me today. I plan to gather all medication I have in my room, painkillers and my sleeping pills, add that in with a large amount of vodka and put a plastic bag over my head just as I start passing out. 

This is it. 

I'm sorry. I'm sorry I failed you all.
