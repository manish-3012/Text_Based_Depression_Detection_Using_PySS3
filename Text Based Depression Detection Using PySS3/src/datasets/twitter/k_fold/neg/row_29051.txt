I would rather die than make a decisionHi Reddit.
I'm 22-year old female student and I don't know I should be writing here. I'm really anxious about posting anything online. But whatever.  
It was always like this. Me waiting for things to end, dissociating, living in my head, 'sucking it up', forcing myself to study, meet someone, do anything. All my childhood, teenage years. Nobody knows the real me, everything is just me behaving the way others want me to behave so I can stay safe.   
And I don't know myself as well.  
Every day I feel I am wasting my life, having panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. I feel guilt, shame, fear and anger, over and over again. And powerlessness. I hate the degree I've chosen to study but I don't trust my feelings. The idea of droping out is so scary I would rather die. But I know that I am just wasting my life, living behing glass wall, pretending, lying and forcing myself to do every move, so I am trapped. Every decision is bad, there is no solution. I know that for some people this can be stupid, but for me it is real and I think I am done. I would rather die than make a decision.  
I don't know if that makes any sense, I just feel like I don't want to bother anyone, I would like to just disappear. It's like being on your birthday party feeling really tired. You just want to go home but you know that the moment it happens everybody else is going to be sad and the party will be ruined. That is not about them but they cannot understand. So you stay and wait, and make happy face but deep down hating everybody that they force you to stay just for them to feel good.  
I'm sorry if that makes no sense. I don't know why I am posting this, I regret it already. I don't know what I want to hear from you. I already know, there is no hope.
