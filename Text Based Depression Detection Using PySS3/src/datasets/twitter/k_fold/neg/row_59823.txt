I do not deserve anything.I'm pathetic. I'm all alone. Everything and everyone is against me. My family cannot be called so anymore. I'll just cry myself to sleep and hope I drown in my tears. I have no motivation to live on anymore, I'm just a burden for everyone around me. I've already made mistakes which cannot be reversed. No one to console me. No one to open up to. I cannot think straight anymore, my existence is a burden.
