27 years old, want to die.I've had intrusive suicidal thoughts since I was 12, when I first wished a bullet would come through the wall and release me from existence. I've had lots of therapy over years and with psychiatrists and an intensive outpatient group. I've been up and down. It feels like I know what life has to offer.

I don't want it. I had my best months earlier this year honestly. But that to me was simply fortunate circumstances. I've had numerous "realizations" where I feel flooded with what seems like an epiphany that will never fade about Oneness, interconnectedness, the good nature of humanity, etc. I've read enough inspirational self-development shit, from the Dalai Lama to PUA to Dale Carnegie. The truth is that I always come back to this suicidal state. And stay in it for months. The fact that my previous revelations never stick is to me enough evidence that I am this person who wants to die.

I'm lonely and I always have been. I've always been a loner without a social circle. I've always wanted but never had a completely unconditional love. And I always realize that no one but myself can actually do that, yet I am tired of or just too lazy to put in so much effort. It doesn't feel like a normal life should be this hard, overwhelming, and consistently disappointing. If I'm vulnerable with people they usually get bad vibes and keep a distance. I am so awkward and reek of desperation or artificiality in any conversation. I'm a very sensitive person, always have been, and I've accepted that I'm too sensitive for this life and I'd rather just die.
