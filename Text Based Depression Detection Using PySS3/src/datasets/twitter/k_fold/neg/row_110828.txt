One week left hoorayIâ€™ve never had a single person who really cared about me and Iâ€™m done. 20 years is plenty enough for me to see that things arenâ€™t going to change. This last year was the year I tried the hardest and Iâ€™ve never been more miserable. So Iâ€™m renting a hotel room the day after my birthday, getting wasted alone, and hanging myself.

Hope you all get the help you need. I couldnâ€™t.
