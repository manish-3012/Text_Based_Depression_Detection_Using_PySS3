I been cleaning my room from all these posts and its not helpingI feel a little more comfortable in my own room but I am still so alone and I have nothing to look forward to in life. I lucid dream at night and that's the most exciting thing that happens to me. Most of the time they're nightmares I dreamt last night I was a police officer and ended up holding a girl's arm together that was sliced down the vein not across. Maybe something subliminal to me? I just don't want my mom to have another child die. I just wanna disappear
