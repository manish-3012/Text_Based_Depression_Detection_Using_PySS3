I need help but dont have a way to get it.I was thinking of why i want to kill myself. The true shit storm of being the lowesr and sack of sadness in my family. I had a dream/vision. I was going over how i would say bye to everyone, then i got to saying bye to my fdad and i broke out crying. I dont want to die but there is no other way to get better. People say suicide is a permant fix to a temporary problem. But in most cases the damage has been done and suicide is a fix for a permanent problem.
