He's moved onWith a 17 year old girl. A minor. Who works with me. I've poured my heart out to this man and he cheats on me with a child, not only that but a child who's mother is tied into my family. I have to see her every day... My heart is so completely broken.. I can't do this anymore... I just wanted someone to love and he ruined my life... I aborted a pregnancy and this is the thanks I get. I'm so hurt.. I can't do this anymore... It's hard to breathe...
