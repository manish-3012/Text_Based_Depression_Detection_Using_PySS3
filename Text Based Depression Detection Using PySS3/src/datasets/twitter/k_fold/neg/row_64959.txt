I remember when I was about to. and years later I'm still breathingi was going to put a end on new years eve and a girl gave me hope, now we live together and have a little baby, some times i still hopped i was dead but not for the same reasons, now it's just a "funny thought".  
All this to say that you just have to accept it and let live be the way it is, look only for what makes you happy, forget the other, YOU come first, i can't deal with drama, people are dramatic with stupid things and they forget that their are people like us with a real problem. 

So, cry, cry everything, scream if you want, you come first, try to adapt and try to be away from things that expand your sadness :)
