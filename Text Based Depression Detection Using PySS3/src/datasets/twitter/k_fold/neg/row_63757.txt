Freak on the sideWhy was I brought to this place in the first place. What good have I been. I'm not worthy of life. I'm a dustbin that needs to be emptied and dumped. Good riddance to me. I have brought zero value to anybody's life. I'm hanging on in vain. 

Someone told me to let go of the past and to move on and to just get over it. How do I do that when it won't let ME go. It's got a strangle hold on me and no matter how much I try to shake it off, it sticks.  

And I can't even make this choice easily because there are people who won't understand. How do I get away so that I can just do this!

Who do I think I am to just give up. But not giving up just means I linger on like a parasite. 

Which one is fickin worse?! Giving up or remaining a parasite? 

I can hear them ridiculing and deriding me with contempt right now, and it's ringing in my head.
