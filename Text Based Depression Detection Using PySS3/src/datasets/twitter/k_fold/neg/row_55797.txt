nothing but the rainI don't feel like myself anymore. This room doesn't feel like mine, this body doesn't feel like me. I feel like life is just passing me by, and I'm just watching, not crying, not sad, just watching, passively.

There are days when I don't want to get out of bed, but at the same time I don't deserve to just lay around and do nothing. I want to do something. What's the point tho?

Nothing feels real anymore. There's no point to this post. Not feeling particularly suicidal. Just numb, bummed.. vacant.

I want to believe things get better, that if I try it won't be for nothing. That it is just a bad day, not a bad life. It always feels like one tho. 

My birthday is soon, least excited I've ever been. What have I accomplished another year on this earth? Nothing, and at best the bare minimum. 

Fuck, I wish I didn't exist.
