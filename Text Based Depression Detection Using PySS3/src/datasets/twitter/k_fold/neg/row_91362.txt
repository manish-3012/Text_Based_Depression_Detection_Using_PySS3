What can be worse than this?When I was younger, I was told that if I killed myself, I would go to hell and be tortured by the devil for the rest of the eternity. I used to believe it, but now I'm too tired to keep on fighting.
To me, living is the worst way of torture I have ever experienced. How could hell, if it exists, be worse than the pain I'm carrying every single day over my shoulders?
I don't know if I will go to heaven or hell when I'm gone, but at this point, I don't care about anything or anyone anymore. I just want to die.
