I think my only real friend (an online one) killed herself.She always talked about how hard things were for her and how she was suicidal in the past. I was there for here but I haven't heard from her for around two months now. We communicated through kik and now when I try to message her something comes up saying that her phone's been deactivated for a while so I shouldn't expect an answer.
