It got better?Things still aren't all rainbows and sunshine. Still have very dark moments. But a year ago I was ready to give up completely. Life wasn't worth living. Thought about my death every day. Had plans. Was swallowed by the depression. But now things are honestly ok. I'm not suicidal anymore. It's a weird feeling. After wanting to end it all for over a year, it's gone. I don't want to die. Some days I worry I'll fall back down that hole. That this happiness I have is fleeting and won't last. For now I'm alive.
