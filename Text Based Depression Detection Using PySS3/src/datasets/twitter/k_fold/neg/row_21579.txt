I want to use suicide as a means of getting my father to listenNow, here's the context:

My father was cheating with my mother by talking with a lot of girls on messenger. Aunt found out, told my mother, i dug deeper and found some other things as well. Happened 2 months ago, parents still have huge fights everyday. Now, back then, i loved my father. He's a very hard worker, working from 10 am up to 1-2 am with no breaks. And he still found time to spend with us on weekends. 

But after we found out, he changed. Bad. He began being cold, ruthless. I already blamed myself for all those fights (since i was the one who introduced my father to messenger), but he threw even more shit at me. Started shouting at me. Everything i did was wrong. Restricted me from the internet and going out with friends. I have to hide my phone every night for fear that he will take it.

Before the fights, i was depressed but now i'm depressed to the point of contemplating suicide. I can't bear this anymore. He won't listen when i plead, he won't listen when i scream, he won't listen when i reason, maybe suicide is the only way to show him the effects he has produced on me.
