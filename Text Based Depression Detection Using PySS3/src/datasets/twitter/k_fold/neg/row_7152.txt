I feel like Iâ€™m at a dead end and the only way out is to take my own life.Iâ€™m an 18 y/o college freshman who has no clue what to do his life.  I go to an expensive out of state school that Iâ€™m not happy at, so I always feel like I stress my dad out financially. I wanted to be a doctor like him, but Iâ€™m awful at math so I always feel like I let him down. I feel like a burden to everyone in my family. At this point, I feel like Iâ€™ve hit a dead end. Thereâ€™s no career that will make enough money for me to be happy that doesnâ€™t require math. I just want all of this to be over. I canâ€™t go to bed in pain anymore. I donâ€™t want to feel depressed and anxious everyday. I donâ€™t want to be a burden to my parents anymore. I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I want to kill myself, but I keep hoping that Iâ€™ll find the perfect job after searching the same thing over and over again. That hope is dwindling everyday now.
