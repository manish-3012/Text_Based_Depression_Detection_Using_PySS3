Iâ€™m Drowning and have no oneIâ€™m just drowning in pain, trauma, dark secrets and agony and i canâ€™t take it anymore. I have no one i can trust/tell these things to. i wish i had a good friend who just gets me, iâ€™ve never had one of those. iâ€™m done living, done trying. iâ€™ve been trying for so long now but there is no end in sight. i just wish i was never born.
