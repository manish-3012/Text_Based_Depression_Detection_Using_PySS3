Reaching out wasn't worth the time.When you beg for help but they're frustrated the help they give isn't an automatic fix. I'm sorry.

When you let people know things aren't right, you need advice, but you get into trouble for letting people in on your life. I'm sorry.

When your anxiety is too much for phone calls, so prevention hotlines are out the window. I'm sorry.

When you think you've gotten through to someone, but they just say they're now struggling too, so now you have to help them. I'm sorry.

Most of all, not being able to get professional help, because certain people twist that, you try your best but getting help makes you mentally unreliable, A bad mother, flawed. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I can't fix myself, but I tell you what, I won't be sorry when I leave.
