Man, I donâ€™t know what to anymore with my life.24F. Working in a $24k income job. Going through a long overdue divorce (been separated for 3 years) 17k in credit card debt. High payments on car. ($600)

Everyone I work with hates me. Hate as in, no one talks to me due to the fact that  I donâ€™t have a degree (I work in a hospital). So it makes me feel like Iâ€™m worthless. I have no value.

I was not able to get one due to my ex husband who was enlisted bouncing us from state to state and he convinced me that he would take care of me (my mistake). 

I have no friends no one to fall back on too except my boyfriend whoâ€™s in Ireland. But even then, I canâ€™t even go be with him due to Work Visa Restrictions. My skill set (administration) is on the â€œineligibleâ€ job list for a work visa. Yeah we can get married when the divorce is over but even at that I still canâ€™t go be with him. He doesnâ€™t make enough income to sponsor me to stay with him (you have to apply for your spouse to stay as well marriage doesnâ€™t rule as a permit to stay)

I tried applying to colleges in Ireland but i was rejected because of my high-school GED score is a 2.7. And I have only one semester of college done.

I just feel so alone and worthless and stupid. Like I have absolutely nothing to contribute to anyone. On my days home i just sleep the day away. And take more sleep aid when I wake up. So itâ€™s like at this point... whatâ€™s the point of carrying on? Iâ€™m not happy. Iâ€™ll probably never find happiness. Suicides been on my mind for a couple of months. Iâ€™m this close to crossing that line.
