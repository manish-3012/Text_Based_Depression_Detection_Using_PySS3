It's finally going to happenDecided sometime last week? But yeah in 2ish days, I should be dead.

I'm gonna go to work today, go on one last drug bender tomorrow, all day long, then go out to the woods on Friday, and shoot myself in the head with a gun. 

I'm not going to tell anyone this time. No last goodbye texts full of apologies and love. No warning. I want this time to be my own. They'll eventually find me. 

Not sure why I'm even posting this here. Guess I just wanted someone to know, and not be able to stop me.
