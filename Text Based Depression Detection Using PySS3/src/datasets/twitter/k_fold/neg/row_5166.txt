TiredIâ€™ve been trying so hard to work on myself and nothing ever changes. I donâ€™t want to hurt myself ever again or feel pain or hurt others, I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I am so tired.

I am taking calming breaths. Iâ€™m not panicking, I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m having â€œan episode,â€ but I donâ€™t enjoy life and I wish I could voluntarily end mine without chance of pain or failure.
