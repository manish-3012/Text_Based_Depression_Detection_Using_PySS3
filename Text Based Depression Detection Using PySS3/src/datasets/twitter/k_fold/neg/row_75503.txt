I'm fucking killing myselfI was probably never happy my whole Life, my brother and my sister are so much better than me, i wasn't even meant to be Born, as my parents said I was "an unexpected surprise". Well, being alone all my life. Have a few good friends, a few girlfriends, a best girl friend I was literally obsessed with and loved so much. Now I'm realizing I might be gay and found It in the worst possible way: with obsessive thinking. I have sexual thoughts all the fucking day about any fucking person there is, nothing ever stops, I'm sad, depressed on antidepressants and relaxers and got random people in my fucking head all the time. Plus It's people i don't give a fuck about. My anxiety is low, I spoke on the phone with my grandma before and She said "why don't You come see me?" In my mind I replied "I would come in your ass." What's worse is that in the past I sexually fantasized about her and I think I'm gross. I talk to people and i'm like "i'll suck your D" or "I'll bang you hard" and I'm utterly disgusted by myself. Even when hearing about people passing away, my mind would do the same. I'm convinced I don't deserve Life at this point, my sexual thoughts are uncontrollable, I thought I was Just going nuts and conditioned myself. Sex everywhere in my head, with anyone. I Wish I never went out the night all this shit started. Got triggered terribly. And I was fucking happy for once after many years of numbness, sadness. If my friends knew they would cast me away. My parents know and think I'm just crazy. Fuck being gay, fuck being a pedo, fuck being straight, fuck being me. How could possibly think that a guy is good looking lead to all this shit? Of course I had to have this. Like "oh You Happy? Well have this shit. Bye"
I hate myself for this. I hate all of this.   So goodfuckingbye world, better Dead than necropedogayrapist!
