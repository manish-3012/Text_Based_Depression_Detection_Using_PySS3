Is an overdose of Tyneol likely or unlikely to work?Iâ€™m so confused because somethings I read say itâ€™s likely to cause liver damage and three days and others say itâ€™s not worth it because youâ€™re likely to survive....the only available method I have right not is overdosing on it and some bottles of my antidepressants/anxiety meds and OTC sleeping pills. I really wanna try (not my first time overdosing) but if Iâ€™d just experience pain followed by a hospital stay and possible psychward admission, I donâ€™t want to because I know thatâ€™s not what I want because Iâ€™ll just still be here with my current problems, just more added onto them. 

I just canâ€™t stop feeling this way, and I havenâ€™t stopped feeling this way for awhile. I know that my lifeâ€™s gonna end in suicide, likely much sooner than later. Iâ€™d like to jump off of a suicide bridge when I turn 18. I wish I could now but the only bridges near me are highway bridges thatâ€™ll likely just result in very severe injury if I fail that. And I canâ€™t get too far away from home (I donâ€™t drive, and my parents will call the police once they realize Iâ€™m missing lmao).
