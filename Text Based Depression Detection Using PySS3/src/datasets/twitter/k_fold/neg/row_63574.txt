Iâ€™m about to commit suicide and nobody can talk me out of itHi. Iâ€™m a 21 year old female and my parents tricked me into going back into their home country for â€œvacationâ€ because they found out I have a boyfriend and donâ€™t agree with the way I live. We were supposed to stay for 3 weeks but now itâ€™s almost been 4 months. I should add thatâ€™s itâ€™s a third world country too with terrorist groups murdering citizens on a daily basis. Being woken up by a bombing is normal here. And on top of that I have no freedom here. I canâ€™t dress the way I want to and canâ€™t leave the house. Every single day Iâ€™m stuck in my room without nothing to do but my phone or books and itâ€™s depressing. I also am suffering from endless health problem and being neglected. And if thatâ€™s not enough I havenâ€™t paid any of my bills in months, meaning Iâ€™m probably in a lot of trouble and that stresses me out to my deepest core. I feel like vomiting. I also went through so much abuse here. One time I got beat up to a point in which I genuinely thought I would die. Another time I was tied up and attached to some medical device that gave me shocks. Whenever I speak up my mother threatens me to get me locked up in a facility in which I would be teached about religion and how to be a good wife. Oh and she also threatens me to get me married off. 

I feel like I was robbed off of my life, my freedom and human rights. The mental pain is so severe it causes me to have literal heartache. I have no one to really talk to about this too. I canâ€™t take any of this any longer. This is a shitshow and I donâ€™t want to be part of it anymore. I have no hopes for things to get better anytime soon. Right now I genuinely believe that death would be the best solution.
