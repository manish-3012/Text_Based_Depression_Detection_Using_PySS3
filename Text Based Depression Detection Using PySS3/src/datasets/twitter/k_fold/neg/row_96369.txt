This sucks but I don't want to be alive anymore. Here's why. I don't really want to be alive. What is the point. I grew up my whole life being abused and now I pay for it everyday of my life. I met the love of my life my first boyfriend when I was 23 and he turned out to be abusive and Hurt me. I'm alone how with little drive and I suffer from health problems from the abuse. I feel so empty inside. It had been 2 years this April. And I have not been able to move on. The abusive asshole got married in April last year exactly one year after we ended it. I met someone else and we dated for 6 months and it didn't work out. I don't think I will ever feel that way as I  did about that guy ever again. I don't think I'll ever meet someone else that I could feel that way about ever. And it was so easy for him. This sucks. Please excuse me I wrote this on my iPhone. At least I still graduated university. But that is all I have.
