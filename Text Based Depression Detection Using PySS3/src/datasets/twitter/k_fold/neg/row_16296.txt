Im feeling a year chronic depressed.Already a year I feel nothing but hatred and sadness within fueling my thoughts with  negativity. Ive no hope in that ill ever trust people again or feel safe, loved or healed. Feel happy. I never was a person to cry, but this year I feel like im constantly holding back and could cry every day if wanted on command. I feel fucked up in my head, with a desire to destroy and vanish. Like all the greatness I once was is gone. Ive felt fucked up often but only now it became so chronic and undeniable that I feel the need for someone to fix me before I make shit decisions but a professional would be too expensive right now and I cant put up a real person with my shit. Im always about 'keep evolving', which often leads to me going on through my days denying my own insanity. But I dont know what to do. I feel constantly as an outcast with my thoughts and impossible to fit in. Im either in a foggy fucked up negative spiral inside my head or ive a short outburst in happiness for a hour that drains all my energy. ðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž
