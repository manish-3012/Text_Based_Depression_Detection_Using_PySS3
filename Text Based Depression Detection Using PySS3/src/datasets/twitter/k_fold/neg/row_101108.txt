Driven to Insanity please helpHi guys. Ive been depressed for about 4 years after years of bullying in middle school im now finishing my first year of highschool and surprisingly its been better. The funny part is I havent. Even with new friends and minimal bullying i still find myself feeling lost and depressed almost every single day. I feel lonelier than i did before and im not sure what to do. None of my family knows im depressed and i dont want to tell them as they are very strict and have seen suicide in there families. I also cant talk to my friends about it as none of them want to hear me sob all day. With no where else to go i feel like im losing my sanity. Ive become more sadistic laughing at death and even mocking it in my life at times and i am always lacking sympathy. I have never been this way and im starting to worry the depression is starting to take its toll on me. Is this what i have become a cold depressed human being? Is there still hope for me? I would really appreciate any responses if anyone cares
