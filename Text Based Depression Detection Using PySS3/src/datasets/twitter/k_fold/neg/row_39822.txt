Its sad knowing how to kill yourselfI talk about the different ways to do it or the best ways to make it more likely, but having done the research, having lived through it, having genuinely been suicidal 10 or so times in my life, probably half of which was part of my own doing because i wanted to be suicidal (but for one reason or another didnt follow through or picked a bad option) it really fucks with your head knowing how easy you could drag yourself back into the place. You try to be a bit healthier or happy, but you still dance with the devil, not all the way but you get a bit toxic here and there, and then it hits you "i know how to take this all the way" and the regret sinks in :(
