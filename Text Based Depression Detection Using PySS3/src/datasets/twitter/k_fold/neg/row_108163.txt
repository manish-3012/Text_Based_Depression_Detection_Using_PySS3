Everything is getting better in my life, yet I still want it to end.I have a job interview for a job that pays $17 starting wage, I'm slowly building self confidence. Sadly started cutting. Slowly getting friends that care. Had blood tests, got medicine, and have been writing poems to deal with my depression. But yet I still have the urge to end it. I don't know why, but it's not bugging me and I'm calmed by it actually. I've devised my foolproof method but hopefully I don't use it, but there's still not anything to keep me from it. I still feel like I have nothing.
