I wont be graduating this year. What is it all for.Im stuck. forever. There is no end in sight for me. I feel bad for troubling you all with my problems and take time of day away from u all. But I need a human to talk to. I have never felt this helpless and weird ever. I dont know where else to go. Maybe Im not thinking straight. idk. please talk me out of this, this feeling isnt right.
