Is life absurd to everyone?I am a 45-year-old man, a father of one child. I am not suicidal. I have dealt with deep depression for most of my life (30+ years), and I have definitely thought from time to time that leaving this planet would make the most sense for me. But I have never attempted to kill myself or even made a plan.

Here's my question: Does life seem as absurd to everyone else as it does to me? The people around me at work seem perfectly happy to wake up, work, generate cash, go home, sleep, and do the whole thing over the next day. For me, it is absolutely ridiculous. Am I really on this planet only as a cash cow? Am I here to work myself silly and feel grateful when I get a day off here or there?

Is life really meant to be nasty, brutish, and short--and absurd? 

I will appreciate any and all responses to this question that has haunted me for a long time. Thanks.

**Edit**: Thank you for the responses so far. I genuinely appreciate it. To answer one question, I finally found antidepressants in 1995. I have been on them ever since, and they have definitely helped. However, sometimes the depression is able to break through even the veil of medication, when it takes me over for a while.
