I failed in lifeI'm an orphan. I've been on my own since I was 16. I I tried to do everything right but I still failed. I I l no job, family or friends. I canâ€™t find a job. My live life is shit. Iâ€™m canâ€™t afford meds or therapy at this point. Iâ€™m really trying to find a job in my field but I may have to do retail. I feel so ashamed. It like everyone else is doing okay and has some sort of support system except for me. Iâ€™m ugly and black, I have no friends and I canâ€™t even find a job. Iâ€™m so sick of feeling this way. Is this all to life? Iâ€™ve felt this way almost every day for the last 23 years. Is this it for me? Iâ€™m never genuinely been happy a day in my fucking life. I was abused as a kid (house of horrors), adopted and my parents died and my brother died. Why am I still here? Why am I still here?
