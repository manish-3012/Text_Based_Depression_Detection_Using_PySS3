take the advice and do it?well. there goes this, ill put so what of a background: 

i know i have a good life, my parents are still together. we have a nice house. and such like as, but i still have d**ression and an*iety. a few years ago someone made a hate account on instagram that was specifically about me and then two years ago i got a massive traumatic brain injury which both exasperated all of my mental issues that i got from genetics and just who i am. 

a few days ago me and this guy got into an argument because i was trying to get him to listen to my idea about this lab. he wouldnt listen and i said â€œstop being a douche and just LISTEN to what im trying to do pleaseâ€ and he got mad at me again , i know i shouldnt have called him that. - then someone else in our group said they were going to the bathroom and then the guy goes â€œbring back the knife so i can s**t my wr**tâ€ and i (i know i shouldnt have again....) said â€œno, give it to me so i can s**t my thr**t bc its fasterâ€ and then the guy goes â€œk*ll yourself, it would solve all the problemsâ€ and i just was shocked and didnt say anything , but then throughout the rest of the class he just kept saying how i should do it and it would make things better for everyone else. 

i cant help but feel like he is right.... would it just be better (like ive always thought) if i just stopped living and being here.  i understand i was in the wrong and shouldnt have called him a douche or pushed it with my comeback comment, but he said several times that i should and now im just in a slum again and i dont know what to do because im leaning towards what he said a lot. but i cant do it to my parents but i want to so bad.
