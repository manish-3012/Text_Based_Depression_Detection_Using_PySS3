To whom it may concern, my sweetest friends.I remember a time and remember it well 

We were so young back then it was so hard to tell

Times so simple, who'd have thought,
 
solutions never delivered even though sought 

I'll never fit in more do I try, never show you a tear 

Only cry when I hide 

I feel it calling, knows me too well 

Cant be long now but is it heaven or hell
