I want to fucking kill myselfI feel fucking awful. Emotionally drained. It's my own fault, though. I said a bunch of really nasty, vile shit to and about a bunch of people on this very website last night. I need to stop. Enough is enough. I am a total piece of shit who needs to die. I need to repent in order to become a better person. I know I have it in me to do so. I was doing so well to becoming better, and then I relapsed and had an episode. I need to become stronger. Kinder. More of a man. To stop being so lazy and to get my shit together.
