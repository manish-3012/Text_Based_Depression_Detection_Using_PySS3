Keeping my chef knife next to meI don't think I want to die, but I know I don't have a good life ahead of me. I don't know if it's my medication finally calming me down, but I feel less restless and depressed than usual. But I've gotten my work knives out of my bag, and I'm keeping one next to me. It just felt like something I should do. I held it up to my wrist and then chest at one point just out of morbid curiosity, but that was it. 

I'd like to live at least until the end of the year, when I get some board games I just backed from kickstarter, and I don't want to cause my mother all that grief because she's been so good to me, but yeah.

I feel like getting a friend over after they finish work would be the right thing to do, but I don't want to bother them.
