I hate myselfI'm fat, I'm ugly as sin, I hate how stupid I am. I can't learn anything. I'm stuck at a job where I get treated badly and no one else will hire me.

I've tried losing weight but nothing seems to work. Diet and excercise just seem to have me gain weight.

Any time I say something like "the sky is blue" I have five people telling me why I'm wrong.

I've been thinking of ending it lately. If anything it's to quell my anger and hopefully not harm someone down the line.
