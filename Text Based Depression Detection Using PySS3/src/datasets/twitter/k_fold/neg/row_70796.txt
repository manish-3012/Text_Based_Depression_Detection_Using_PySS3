Small downstairs and depressedI am a 49 year old black man who's not like were all perceived to be downstairs, in other words, I have a small penis. Don't get me wrong, my ex girlfriend never complained, and I've had many good sexual situations but the last relationship I had, she told me flat out she preferred big ones and a lot of times ED would kick in but I think that was due to my self consciousness but thank god for cialis. But I always felt that she'd be thinking of one of her past lovers while we were in the moment. Right now I'm not in a relationship but every time I look down at my little penis, I get sad and it's coming to a point where I say I'd rather be dead. If anyone out there could relate to this, please help please. I'm really bummed out because of this.
