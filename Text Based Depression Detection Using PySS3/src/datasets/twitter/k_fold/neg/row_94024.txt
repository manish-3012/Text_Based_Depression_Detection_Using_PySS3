What is the most responsible way to kill yourself in NYC?I live in the big city and donâ€™t want to be a burden when I go. What form of suicide and what location will cause the least amount of damage (mentally and physically) to my neighbors and surroundings? I would leave the city, but Iâ€™m out of money. Thanks in advance.
