Killing myself tomorrow.I'm boxing up my belongings tomorrow and checking out. I'm tired of trying to be accepted into this shit show. I've been cast out my whole life and there's no reason to keep going. Few people will give a shit, someone will try to say anything nice about me and move forward in their far more adventurous, comfortable lives. They probably deserve it, or feel love, or don't know what it's like for people to treat you like you're not human.  

People who commit suicide are dead long before taking their own lives. Being isolated and excluded is the worst sentence people can put on you, but it's what most people do to feel better about themselves. I'm fucked up. I'm sorry, and I won't be in your way anymore.  

EDIT: I'm still here. I'm leaving town for awhile, don't know how, but I'll figure it out.
