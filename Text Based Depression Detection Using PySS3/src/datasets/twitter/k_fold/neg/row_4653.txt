Either tonight or tomorrow nightI keep having visions of myself jumping off a bridge. I used to never be suicidal or have these kinds of thoughts, but my mind has won.

I don't want to deal with my life anymore. Sounds weak and pathetic, but if I'm gone, my mom will be happier. I don't care to live. If I run away, or move out, I'm "just like the other fucked up members of my family."

Things with my mom just get worse day by day. I want to do it tonight but it's my friend's birthday, and I'm obligated to go because I bailed so many times on her. 

How is it possible to feel nothing but everything all at once?
