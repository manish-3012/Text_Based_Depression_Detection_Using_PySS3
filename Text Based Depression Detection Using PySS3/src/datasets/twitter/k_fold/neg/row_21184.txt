I summed it up in one of my poemsHi there,

I'm a full-time songwriter and recently I've turned to poetry to stay creative and essentially to vent through another medium. I've been very down this year and in one of my recent poems I tried to put into words how I feel. If you'd like this poem deciphering I'd be happy to explain any unclear elements. I'm not sure if this post fits into this subreddit's guidelines but I thought I'd share it as it is a means of coping.

When the daylight swallows me whole  
And my heart wonâ€™t beat anymore  
Then the night time will call me a monster  
As my safety netâ€™s full of change  
  
While the white noise bleeds my defences  
And my failures are set in stone  
Yeah, the bluebird will fade in an instant  
And my father, I wonâ€™t be long  
  
If I slip to the edge of my tether  
And my mind wonâ€™t let me in  
Grab my cheap thrills, deep-seated yet distant  
From my pocket full of shame  
  
Call the locals, my true love and hold her  
And though I wish I could have stayed  
Fleeting lifetimes have meanings Iâ€™m sure of  
But my father, I donâ€™t belong  
I wonâ€™t be long
