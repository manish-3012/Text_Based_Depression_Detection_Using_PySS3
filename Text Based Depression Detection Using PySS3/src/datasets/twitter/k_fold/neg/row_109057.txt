Too much of a coward for text/crisis help lines so here i amSo yeah idk when its a good time to try the help lines. Here we go

Idk what im doing anymore. I want to quit/kms. Ive had suicidal thoughts since i was 14 and my family thinks everything is fine. But everyday is the same thing. I dont see why i shouldve lived this long (19 yo now). The voices tell me that im worthless and i just cant take it anymore. 

I just keep thinking things might get better. But i miss my baby, my black cat named Bibi, so much. He was my only reason to live and hes gone. I honestly think ineed to have an emotional support cat or something but i dont have the space for a cat anymore. I miss him so much but i cant take the loss of another pet. 

I keep losing sight of my life. Whats the point? A family that didnt want you or at least dont show how much they need you. I can barely talk to people so i dont have many friends. I just cant do it.
