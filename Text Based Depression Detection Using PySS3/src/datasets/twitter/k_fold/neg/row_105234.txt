Worried about my friend! Please helpHi everybody... I don't know where else to turn to, here's my story.

Meet Sam. Sam was born a bit premature... he comes with a nice variety of mental instabilities. I don't know the exact name of his condition, but he wears a medical bracelet that says 'cognitively delayed.' He is currently 16 years old and his increasing problem with depression has got me very worried about him.

From what I understand, Sam gets bad crushes, where he constantly obsesses about a girl. Obviously this kind of behavior freaks out whatever girl he is into at the time and they stay as far away from him as possible. This has led Sam into developing a very low self-esteem of himself.

Sam suffered abuse when he was a child from his alcoholic father, which leads to even more problems. He is also a compulsive masturbator and I think he fantasizes about these girl crushes while he does his deed, and the resulting hormone releases are being associated with her which results in him obsessing even more..

It has been on and off the last few years, but about a month ago he fell for a girl that he sees everyday. When I last talked to him, he says he literally cannot make himself stop thinking and obsessing about her, something that resembles OCD symptoms. 

He also gets dreams about her at night, and he constantly talks about this delusion that they were meant for each other. He has slowly gotten more and more depressed, and he admitted to me that he was having suicidal thoughts. His parents think it's just some phase that he'll grow out of, but I think it's much more serious than that. 

Me and a few friends talk to him everyday and try to talk him out of it, but there seems to be no improvement, and the fact that he see's this girl everyday doesn't help either. Can anyone please help me help him, I don't where else to turn to.
