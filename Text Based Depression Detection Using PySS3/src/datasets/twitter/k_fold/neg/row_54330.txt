it's not that I want to kill myself exactly. I just want to be listened toI came out as a trans man via letter to my parents last night and they just. ignored it. they haven't said anything 2 me about it. I had a panic attack at my friend's house and my parents didn't even say anything to me. like I poured my heart out in that letter and they dont have the decency to say anything

and its like, I dont want to kill myself. I cant leave my dog. he'd never know where I went. but some part of me wants to intentionally fail an attempt just to make them notice me. I feel like they've never cared about anything I've said and I feel like if I were to not-die but barely they'd finally see that im here and im serious and they need to fucking pay attention to me and listen to me

im just so tired. ive been building myself the courage to do this for five years and when I finally do they just fucking ignore me
