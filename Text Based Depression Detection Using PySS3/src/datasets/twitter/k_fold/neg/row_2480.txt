Kind of want to jumpI feel really lonely and like a failure. I can't get over somebody I can't be with anymore and it's taking a toll on me. I'm on my apartment building's seventh floor. I know I could survive that but I'm really tired of feeling this way. I took the screen out of the window but am still afraid to do it.
