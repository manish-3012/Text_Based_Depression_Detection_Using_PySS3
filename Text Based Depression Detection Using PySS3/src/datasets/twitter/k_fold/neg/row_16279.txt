I donâ€™t know how to go on anymoreDepression has been a continuing issue in my life compounded by the fact Iâ€™ve spent most of my life alone, I was an only child with a single mother working two jobs. Dealing with suicidal thoughts was a normalcy in my life but as of late itâ€™s all I think about. I canâ€™t take the pain anymore and all I think about how I can get rid of it all. 

About a year ago I met a wonderful individual who was compassionate, caring, and everything I wanted in a partner. We both left horrible relationships but herâ€™s was still fresh. We gave it a chance and everything seemed perfect but then everything ended abruptly about a week ago and Iâ€™ve felt dead inside since. I was ready to start a life, we were talking about getting home, opening a business, and getting a dog, and for once I felt like met the perfect person and I was extremely happy, but now all I wish for is death. I feel dead inside. 

Iâ€™m 32 years old and know I have much more of my life ahead of me but I just canâ€™t find a will to live anymore. The thought killing myself felt greedy and unfair to people in my life but lately itâ€™s all I want. I want all the hurting to stop. 

I donâ€™t know what posting here will do but I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest because I donâ€™t have anyone else I can tell this to.
