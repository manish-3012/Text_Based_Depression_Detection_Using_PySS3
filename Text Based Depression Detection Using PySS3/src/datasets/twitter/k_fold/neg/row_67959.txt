Iâ€™m sorryHow could I give all us this up
Reminds me just how much Iâ€™m fucked 
In the long run and in my head
Feels as though Iâ€™d be better off dead 

For myself and for everyone 
One less liar under the sun
I never knew how far Iâ€™d come 
Letâ€™s make one less liar under the sun 

Heart beat starts to slow down 
A very mellow yet clear sound 
A ticking sound inside my brain 
Letâ€™s count the seconds to the end
