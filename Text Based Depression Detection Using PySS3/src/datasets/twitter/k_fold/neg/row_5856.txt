DoneI don't think I can keep doing it anymore. I have no interest in anything or desire to do anything. I feel like I constant burden to my friends and like they feel like I am being overdramatic and seeking attention when I say I can't keep going much longer. Then again, I know they will hate me if I go through with it, but at this point the pain is too much and I think I am done for good.
