I'm just an empty shell.In two days I turn 21 years old. I'm still Facebook friends with all the people I knew in high school. They're all starting promising careers, or finishing up prestigious degrees, or starting families. I've got nothing. I work part time for minimum wage at a grocery store. I was rejected from all the major universities in my state. I have failed every community college class I've ever tried taking. I still live with my parents. I have never had my first kiss. The only friends I have are people I have never met outside of the internet.

I'm not smart, I'm not creative, I'm not charismatic. I have no personality or opinions. I have no hobbies or interests. I have no dreams or aspirations.

Every morning I wake up disappointed that I'm still alive. I spend the entire day looking forward to going back to sleep. Being conscious is a burden. I'm so exhausted. My life isn't hard, but I'm just so tired. Why can't I just sleep forever? I know that nothing's ever going to change by itself, but I don't have the energy to do anything about it.

I just want this nightmare to be over.
