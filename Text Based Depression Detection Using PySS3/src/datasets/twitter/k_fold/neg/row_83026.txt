I don't want to be alive.I feel like I'm just barely keeping up, failing task after task. I put too much pressure on myself. I tried to kill myself last year, and I could bring myself to do it. I saw that post on top/alltime that asked someone to list all of the things they did in the past year. I can't think of anything out of the ordinary. I feel like anyone could be living the exact same life as me and even I wouldn't notice. I don't think I want to stay in the same place and I definitely don't want to get older.

I can't even kill myself.
