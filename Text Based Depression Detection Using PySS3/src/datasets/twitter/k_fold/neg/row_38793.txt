"You're just not worth it."Words I've heard a lot... I don't know why this time around it's wrecking my world the way that it is. I've had it said to me in different contexts, but this one was from a non-profit I interviewed with (GREAT!! interview!) and they said since I'm not technically certified and don't have a degree in anything, I am not worth moving forward with.

I have been with my office 10 years, and have busted my ass and been loyal all that time... until I got demoted this spring. It was my sign to do something better with my life (IE I have wasted a decade of loyalty and hard work on a place that has thrown me away). But alas, bipolar bitches like me work 10x harder at everything just to be at everyone else's "normal" and the return on that is minimal, at best.

It's clear that THIS is it. THIS is as good as it will ever be- basic receptionist, no relationships to speak of, and no reality of happiness or even contentment. 

I'm down the rabbit hole yet again, and I just don't have the energy to keep digging myself out.
