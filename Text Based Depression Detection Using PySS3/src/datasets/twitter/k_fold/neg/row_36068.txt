I want to attempt suicide to at least feel somethingI want to attempt suicide because I'm miserable. If I live then that's fine but If I do that's also fine. Maybe someone will care then. I want to show people that I'm in pain. That I'm in danger. I feel like no one takes me seriously. Like no one knows how much pain I'm in. Nobody understands. I want to make them know. I need to show them. Then people will care. Then they'll see. Maybe I'll feel something. I've been miserable for years. I want to kill myself everyday, every hour. But i've never been able to attempt before because I'm too weak and pathetic and I feel like I'm lying to myself. At the end of this week I'm going to try and wether I live or die I'm doing it.
