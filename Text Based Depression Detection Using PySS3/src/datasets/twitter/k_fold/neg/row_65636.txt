Been strugging for months of emptiness. Everything that supported me is breaking down. First time ever, I genuinely think about suicide.Hi to everyone who reads this. 

For the first time ever, I have legitimate thoughts about suicide. My life feels empty, goalless and just screwed up in general. 

It started last year when I just didn't want to come home anymore. My mother specifically was being absolutely awful to me. We had a fight every single time I would be there to the extend that the only way for me to cool things was to run away from home. I started seeing my GP and the psychologist after that, and things have bettered a little bit but home doesn't feel like home anymore. I still wasn't there most of the time. 

Somewhere around that time I started to deal with a burnout. School (Uni) absolutely killed me and all the friend I had made in the first year had disappeared because they stopped. I speak them occasionally, but they live far away. I do not enjoy school anymore. I stopped doing classes because I felt like I needed time to empty my mind. I was so stressed. 

My girlfriend was depressed and was suicidal at that time. I was there for her and had to remove a rope from her room once. It wasn't easy for me, gave me a lot to worry about. 

I somewhere about 5 months ago I saw my GP about my depressed feelings, high stress level and the feeling that a lot of things that seemed to be obvious/common sense to others, weren't to me. Last week I finally had my intake for psychological help for possible ADD and depression. 

Last Saturday my gf and I broke up. Well, she did. And as more time continues, the more I realise that everything I was still doing in my life: working on my car, going to school, searching for internships, was in the end for her. What I mean by that is that I didn't feel like I went to school for myself; I went to school for the fact that it could land me a good job, pay some money which we could use to eventually find a place for us together in a few years time. I didn't work on my car because I find it to be such a nice thing to do; I did it because she liked the car a lot and I wanted to be able to drive her around in it. We bought that car 'together'. I bought it financially, but the decision for this car specifically, was a joint decision. I went to work because I wanted to save up money for the holiday we had planned together. 

In the quotes the story about my gf and the breakup:

&gt;I wish I could have told you the things going on in my head in all honesty much earlier. I wish I wasn't procrastinating your very obvious hints. I just couldn't do it financially at the time because of the holiday we planned. And I hate the fact I never sat down with you to just tell you that. I have dodged the conversation forever because of reasons I don't even know anymore. I have promised you to do everything you ever proposed to do, but I couldn't ever do that. My money is limited. But I never told you that. I always just nodded and said yes and proceeded to not act on it. And that finally gave you the feeling that I wasn't respecting your wishes anymore.  
&gt;  
&gt;If I could go back in time and change one thing, if I could go back 10 months or so, I would've slapped myself in the face and told me to just tell her what the implications of that holiday would mean to me. 10 Months of financial stress in my head about how I am going to save up for that holiday. 10 Months of not acting on your hints and wishes, because I just failed to open up about it to you.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I still don't understand why you broke up. I get that you can't wait forever for me to finally take you to the places you've wished for for months to go. I completely get that. And I hate myself for the fact that I haven't. Because it very truthfully is the thing I would love to do the most; go out and dance with you. Hell you were the one who got me into dancing in the first place.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the other things you've said just don't make sense. You were acting just fine last week. We were even investing in "us", we had a perfect time when we got home. I can't remember a week you have said "I love you" as much as last week. I don't understand how you said this thing has been stuck in your head for the last two months. I cannot understand how, if that really is true, you could feel, or at least make it seem like you did last week.  
&gt;  
&gt;I know I've been having a rough time lately. Getting diagnosed with concentration problems, therapy taking forever to take me in, school being a major stress factor in my life, my car... Everything was killing all the energy I have. But we both knew that that would only take two more weeks. School's out for the summer now, I had my intake, and I finally am finding the time to do what I had been planning on doing since forever. If you could only see me now and see how much the fact that school's done and I'm finally being able to pick up on everything I've had to stall forever is changing me, I'm sure you would've never made that decision. I'm really a changed person in the few days time, I still can't believe it myself. I've started going to the gym, been doing some new recipes in the kitchen, I've finally started to finish up the projects that have been sitting in my room since literal years... For the first time in I think about a year time, I have peace in my head. But next to that peace is a void. A void that used to be filled with loving feelings and thoughts about you. A void that used to be filled with the idea of getting home to you. A void that used to be filled by the thought of, even when I'm having a shit day, I will lay in bed next to you tonight and then I'll be safe, warm and loved. Something I've always realised to be very valuable, but never this valuable. I miss the calls around 8PM. I realise how bad I feel I never valued that and that I never called you instead.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm still in denial. All the things you mentioned during the breakup sounded so fixable. And I know I've had the chance forever to fix them and I hate that I didn't. I wish I would've taken you out so much earlier. I hate that my mind was stuffed with stressful thoughts and I wish I had the mental space to think about fun stuff to do. All the initiatives had to come from your side, and I realise that very well.  
&gt;  
&gt;I still can't believe the way we met. That was magical. It was out of this world. I liked you back in high school, never had contact there and hadn't seen you in years, and all of a sudden there's you. At university. Starting out next year.  
&gt;  
&gt;I still got some stuff at yours that I have to pick up in two weeks. I'm scared. I'm in denial, I still can't move on. I still have the idea that you just had to cut the dirt away from your life like you do when you feel bad, that this decision was decided on very short-term and that if I show enough dedication everything will still turn out OK. But I guess it won't. You surprised me with how confident you were when you told me that I have been a great boyfriend for the last 18 months but that you cannot wait for better anymore. It feels so sour knowing that we both knew that everything was going to get much less stressful in two weeks, when school stops and everything. I can tell already how much that would've turned the tables if you had only had the patience. I wanted to go on the defensive, but something inside me told me that it was useless and I would only degrade myself if I did. So I didn't. Now I'm sitting here, thinking that maybe I should have even though you said it was definitive. I feel like I'm just living towards our meeting in two weeks with high hopes everything will turn out fine, I feel more nervous than lovesick. And that scares me to the thought that maybe the real downfall still has to come.  
&gt;  
&gt;People tell me it's stupid to think that I won't find a new love, but you hardly realise how special you were to me. You were a high-school dream come true. And maybe I can fall in love again. It will take some time. But meeting someone the way we did is never going to happen ever again.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm going to be honest; I want you back. I've had some time to think about it, I've had time to cry, I've had time to evaluate, and taking everything in consideration, our relationship definitely wasn't the easiest. I feel like I had to change a lot, maybe more than you had to. It feels sour that I was there for you when you were down, but now that I need you for a bit you disappear. But I also know deep down we have the same wishes for the future. And until the very last day, we could have endless talks in bed until you fell asleep, and I could just snuggle to you until I fell asleep too; feeling warm, loved, and at home in your vicinity. The love was still there; it's just that the frustrations for you got too much.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, I wish I could've been more open to you. I wish I could've told you the honest, open and, actually, easy truth. I know you and I know you would understand. I know you would be there for me and find solutions together like we always have. I am so thankful for the emotional labor you have done and how much you have bettered me as a person. You gave me self-confidence back with your endless compliments on how I look. You made a man out of the boy I used to be. I miss you lief, I miss you a lot.

Finally, when everything felt to finally get a little more on the upside, she leaves me. School's running to an end now and a lot of stress is falling off my shoulders. I feel empty and useless inside; I can't do anything for myself. I don't have a home anymore, she was my home. I can't be at my parents' and I can't be on my dorm; I will feel either stressed or lonely and not at home at both. The last pillar I had solid ground on is now too collapsed. 

I have no future in my life. I don't enjoy my study anymore, regardless of the fact that I got this far already. I am scared of my internship. I have no hobbies or anything that could keep me engaged for longer than 20 minutes. It feels more like sitting out my time than it feels like living. I do not have a dead wish specifically, but I sure as hell don't want to live life like this. 

I need help. I feel like I'm falling further and further as days go by. I can't deal with this situation anymore. 

I always had the idea that I would only be able to ever kill myself with a bullet. Luckily I live in a country where that is not as easy to get your hands on something like that. Lately however, other options have gotten into my head and those are a lot easier to bring to practice. 

The summer holiday is only two days away now and all the fun things I had planned are now gone. I have nothing. My holiday is empty, and I will probably fill it with work that won't make me happy either. I want her back. I miss her so much. I don't know how much longer I can deal with this anymore. It's getting harder by the day. Every day again I get faced with how I fail to meet my own goals, how I fail to get out of bed early and get to do stuff. How I fail to get stuff done. I can't do this anymore. It has siphoned all the energy out of me and I want to end it.
