I abandonThere we go. There it is. Thereâ€™s the end.

I canâ€™t do this anymore. Even the mere thought of getting through this makes it feel like iâ€™m being stabbed.

Iâ€™m just posting here for there to be some type of trace of my existence. I donâ€™t want your help. I just want someone, even if itâ€™s complete strangers, to remember me.

The following is useless. Feel free to stop reading. I just wanted my story to be somewhere other than my grave.




I was born in Russia, in 2004, and my parents moved to Canada back when I was five years old. Iâ€™ve been â€˜livingâ€™ here since. My mother is 40. My dad is 62.

When I arrived, I never really made friends. As an introvert whoâ€™s only excuse is social anxiety, I was put away in a corner until someone decided to come make fun of me for my accent. Thatâ€™s all I really remember from my childhood.

My only marked memories are those of when my dad left. He returned to Russia bi-monthly, for work, and left me and my mother at home.

I remember getting thrown outside in a winterstorm at midnight because I couldnâ€™t do my homework properly.

I remember trying to call my dad, crying, and my mother hitting me over the head with the phone until it broke and I couldnâ€™t call anyone anymore.

I remember being pushed out of the car in the middle of the highway because I was complaining of a headache.

I learnt at 9 that this wasnâ€™t normal, but then I also learnt that my mother was an alcoholic at that age. So I took that as an excuse and let her continue. My dad still didnâ€™t know.

I remember, a couple days later, how they divorced. They had a fight. As in, my mother punched my father. I called the police sobbing and the told me to leave with her.

In the next years, there were a lot of court cases, mostly discussing parental guardianship because none of my parents really wanted it. They ended up agreeing on sharing. One week at my dadâ€™s, one week at my motherâ€™s.

The first months were okay, at least, in my mind they were. We had planned a trip to France to go visit my new stepfather. He was nice, I guess. He had two children, one of which was my age, and we got along pretty well. My dad stayed in Canada.

So we stayed over a week more than what we were supposed to.

And another. 

And two months later, I started asking when weâ€™d go back, only to get the answer that â€˜â€™we werenâ€™t coming back to that shithole. Ever.â€™â€™

So, I panicked, had another fight with my mother, and finally managed to call my dad who had to come pick me up â€˜in extremisâ€™ so that I could continue going to school.

My mother came back, eventually. She told me she had broken up with the new guy and blamed it on me leaving.

She didnâ€™t have a stable income at this point, so she couldnâ€™t afford our apartment anymore. We moved to another, smaller, dustier place.

She found another boyfriend, enventually. He also had two kids. The daughter was just a year older than me, but only seemed interested in getting me to smoke. The son was autistic and spent most of his time at his mumâ€™s. That was in 2017.

My relationship with my dad had been going well, he didnâ€™t hit me, he didnâ€™t call me a piece of shit. I called him crying alot, when I was fighting with my mother. He never cared that much, though.

My mother moved again in 2018, to a big city. I had grown up in the countryside, so I was pretty scared. I never went out and whenever I had to take the bus home, Iâ€™d have my emergency contacts open and Iâ€™d clutch my keys really tight, ready for defense. It was stressful.

My school was about an hour away, and my mother complained a lot about it. So, she asked me to change schools. I accepted, even though that meant that it was now two hours away from my dad. I was good at school, as in, really good.
I donâ€™t know why I changed.

That year, 2018, was the worst. My mother attempted suicide in August and blamed it on me when she got out of the hospital. Three of my grandparents passed away in a month. I changed schools and had to start all over again.

So, thatâ€™s when I started cutting. 

At first it wasnâ€™t much, just a scratch with a compass, a little slice with a kitchen knife. Then I found sharpener blades and I cut into my arteries three times over the course of a month. I couldnâ€™t walk, my thighs hurt that much. I cut in class and got expelled.

My dad knew. He didnâ€™t do anything.
My mother only called me a bitch for it.
My new stepfather agreed with my mother.
My only friend was doing the same thing as I was.

I was diagnosed with major depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder that year. My parents still insisted on school before treatment, so they fed me meds instead of food and sent me to a new school. It didnâ€™t work and I changed school again.

Finally, after a fight with both my parents, I moved to my dadâ€™s in a permanent way. Social workers got involved and forced me to see my mother even after all sheâ€™d put me through. I still refuse today, but I put up with it because fuck my opinion, right?

And guess what? After I changed schools for the third time in a year, I started doing okay. The pills made me drowsy and everyone at school referred to me as Â´â€™that one weird bitchâ€™â€™, but Iâ€™d been through worse! It was fine. Social workers told me if I didnâ€™t stop cutting, theyâ€™d put me in hospital, so I stopped in a day. It didnâ€™t help. I felt like I was going insane. But I toughed through it.

Weâ€™re now in 2019. 

I have two wonderful friends. One who Iâ€™ve known since my birth and who Iâ€™ve only started talking to recently. And the other, whoâ€™ill call Exo, I met online, only to learn after five years that we only lived a minute away from each other and were the same age.

And I like her. Sheâ€™s adorable. If she liked me back, Iâ€™d date her. But she doesnâ€™t. Itâ€™s not her fault. Sheâ€™s great.

Iâ€™m horrible in school now.

I canâ€™t bear to even move when I come home. But I also have to take extra classes, and they give minimum 4 hours of homework a day. I donâ€™t have time for anything else. Iâ€™m slowly but surely failing.

And now, today, this morning, my dad told me that we were moving to Belgium next year.

So Iâ€™d lose everything. Exo, my friend, all the effort Iâ€™ve made to intergrate into my new school, the home I grew up in, my whole life.

I canâ€™t bear through that. I told him.

He doesnâ€™t care.



Goodbye. This isnâ€™t anyoneâ€™s fault. This isnâ€™t my dadâ€™s, my friendâ€™s, my schoolâ€™s, not even my motherâ€™s. Itâ€™s my fault I have depression. Itâ€™s my fault Iâ€™m so fucked up and I canâ€™t hold back tears for a minute and my life is bullshit and Iâ€™m so young so I donâ€™t have the right to complain and Iâ€™m failing school anf everything is breaking and-

Just.. Goodbye.
