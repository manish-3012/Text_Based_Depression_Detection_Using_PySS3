Tired of being hideous. How to deal with it so I don't attempt suicide again?I'm really ugly. Everyone says so. My coworkers said that I make our group unattractive, so I shouldn't go out with them. When my brother called me handsome in front of his neighbor the neighbor said, "Don't let him lie to you like that. A good personality can overcome the way you look." My ex always turned off the lights and couldn't get physically aroused with me. There's plenty of stories. I just want to establish that this isn't in my head.
I can't even stand the look of myself in the mirror. I always told myself I'd fix my acne before I started balding so I could be confident when shaving my head. Now I'm balding, my acne is still moderately bad, and the scarring on my chest makes me look like a leper. It covers my entire chest. Nothing helps with the scarring. Nothing helps with the acne. Nothing helps with the balding. 
I've already tried to end all of this, but I was just locked up in a mental hospital for a week. I was about to attempt again, but I just can't do it. Why can't I at least be decent looking? Why does my acne have to be so bad that it's painful to look at?
I lost all hope this past month because my best friend is so handsome. Men and women constantly flirt with him and he easily gets into romantic relationships. I have nothing. No personality or money to compensate for my bad looks. I'm just a boring, depressed loser. 
I'm trying to hold off on the suicide because I don't want my family discovering my body so close to Christmas. But I don't know if I can survive the holidays and I honestly don't think I'll see the new year. I feel like I can't talk to anyone in person because I'm so fragile right now that if they agree that I'm ugly to my face I'll probably try to suicide immediately. How do I feel better? How can I stop wanting to die? How can I look at my reflection without having an anxiety attack?
