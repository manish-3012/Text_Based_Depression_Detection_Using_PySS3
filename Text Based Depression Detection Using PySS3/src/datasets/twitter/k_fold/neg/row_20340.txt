I didn't ask to be bornAnd now my existence causes more stress and burden to the entire population. I don't know why I'm here. I have no goals or any reason for wanting to live. My parents created me for their stupid expectation of appearing normal to society and didn't realize they'd have to raise me as well so now I'm floundering in an ocean of uncertainties. I was never raised with the hopes of achieving goals, and my parents one goal for me was to finish highschool. I did that, and now I don't know what to do with my life. I didn't even think I'd still be alive at 23 but here I am. Now I have to find a way to live a life I didn't ask for and find a way to make this life liveable when I don't even want to live.
