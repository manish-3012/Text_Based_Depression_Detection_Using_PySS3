ending my life tomorrowthanks to everyone who has offered me messages of support on this website over the last couple of months after having my heart shattered. It has gotten this bad and I am ending my suffering tomorrow evening. There is no light at the end of this tunnel, and especially after this year, I see that there's no way out of this depression for me. 

Goodbye everyone.
