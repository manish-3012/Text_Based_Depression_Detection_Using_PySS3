Now that's 2020s here, I'm paralyzed.All I want to do, all I can do, all that I'm capable of right now is crying, watching shameless, and attempting to resist the urge to self harm. No one's taking me seriously but I'm seriously scared. I don't want to die but it's like I'm in a scary movie where the person trying to kill me is also me.
