Tonight I cut myself...Which isn't the first time... but tonight was the first time I barely felt anything... in the past, I would prick myself with sewing pins, give myself little scratches but rarely did much damage because I didn't like the pain... today I just cut... several times. I usually do it because of a panic attack but I was not having one, a bit of anxiety sure, but not a panic attack. I just got up, grabbed a knife from the kitchen and started pressing it to my arm... I didn't want the cuts to show so I pulled my pajama pants down and started slicing my thigh. No big gashes but there was blood. I wiped it off, pulled my pants back up, washed the knife and went back to watching Netflix. But now I can't get it thru my mind that it's not just going to get worse. 
I have suicidal thoughts almost every day but don't plan on killing myself... but I'm scared one day I will want to. Sometimes all I can think about is the painkillers in my purse. It's a bottle of 100 and I've only taken a few for headaches or my tendinitis. There's easily still 90 pills in there and all I can think about is how many would I need to take? To OD? To pass out? To die?

...sometimes I wish I could take a bunch of pills just so that someone could find me and I'd be forced to get help... I'm not at that point yet............ but I'm getting close.
I don't care if anyone has anything to say to me. I just wanted to get this off my chest


.....the cuts are starting to burn now
