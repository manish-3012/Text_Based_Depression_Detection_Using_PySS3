Who am I?I feel like with every passing day, I'm closer to killing myself. I recognize the issues I have. The subjective / objective values they both hold to me, but I feel I want to die the more time I experience.

I've had a bad childhood. Worse than some and better than others, but still, from a young age, I've felt sad, and that I don't have much of a future myself. I feel that that is a huge reason I joined the Marines - is because I wanted to die, but I didn't want to die for nothing. Marines was cool, did cool shit with cool people. But i didn't die, got close but never did. My friends did, so I took on guilt for that. 

Afterwards, I felt like absolutely nothing. Collected unemployment for a year and took easy college courses. Felt empty inside, but made progress in school so had something to hold onto. 

Skip forwards 5 years or so - I'm respected in my occupation, and am part of a SWAT team and take a huge amount of pride in knowing I protect people... but once again, I feel the only reason I care about this is because I hope to die. I have suicidal idealization  (or whatever word im looking for) where i die protecting someone. I long for it. I feel I long for it because I'm too scared to kill myself. I want to do it, but at the same time I dont.

I play games. I push other individuals to see if they will fight me. I make promises to myself (if i get caught drinking and driving, Ill do it - latest iteration of my games), I seek circumstances so I can feel something - fear, pain, self deprecation - anything.

I feel like I am only deserving of negativity. Praise that I receive from work or in my personal life I feel is disingenuous and fake. I don't deserve any of it. Ive almost had other people killed. I'm fake as fuck. I walk around with a smile and tell other people it will get better when I have no faith at all in my words. I want to die, but I am scared.

I hold guilt close to my heart. I know I don't deserve it, but... I cling on to it. I destroy relationships because I feel like I dont deserve any of the positives. I feel I am at my best when I am angry. So I hold close to the things that cause me anger. Abuse, death, depression. I love it. It pushes me in my career and in the gym. 

So many people have told me they respect me and are jealous of me and my abilities. They don't see the price I've paid to be where I am. I've gotten to where I am and respected as a savage because I wan't to die. I don't care about what happens to me - have nothing clinging me to life - so I jump into situations with reckless abandon...

And lately I feel closer and closer to edge. I make riskier decisions and bets with myself. "Im going to get fucked up with the homies... They dont worry about me because Im always good. Motherfucker, doesnt matter what stands in front of me, Im fucking good and I'll face it with a smile. This is what we asked for, small price to pay to be great." But I feel like I am fake as fuck./ I bet I am the most scared person on my team. I am starting to feel like a liability. I feel like I am going to get other people killed because I just don't care. I don't care about myself, I am dirt. I more dirt than the people I confront on the daily, Everyone around me has more to worry about, Why am i the why I am.

I seclude myself, I distance myself from the people I know have a genuine interest in me. I cling to the people who dont give a shit about me. I want to die, I want to fucking die, but at the same time I dont.

I want to be great, but I feel like an anchor is attached to me. An anchor of failure. Things that have little to do with me I feel like is myself....

I dont know, I'm drunk like usual. Im a functional addict. I've made it home another night. I've lost my bet again. I never win. I want to die. But I dont. With every passing dissapoint and failure, I feel less reason to hold on. 

I'm Drunk, I know I need help, but I can't ask for it... So here I am. I've always connected to people I know I'll never meet more so than those around me.
