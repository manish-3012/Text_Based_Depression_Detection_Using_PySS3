sorry for wasting your time in advanceidk what it is about me, but i just feel so utterly useless. iâ€™m stuck in a house that i feel like iâ€™m going to be shot dead if i donâ€™t sweep the fucking floors correctly, and i feel like i canâ€™t do anything right. everyone who â€˜knowsâ€™ me thinks that iâ€™m set up for the rest of my life but they donâ€™t know what i go through every day. iâ€™m one of three children of a divorced family, with the oldest being my big sister, whoâ€™s already left me and my younger sister behind because she couldnâ€™t stand the pressure of this house. sheâ€™s 20 now and i really wish that i could run away. iâ€™ve tried to before, but my mother and my stepfather have found out and shut me down and ridiculed and beaten my willpower to the ground and into the core of the fucking earth. itâ€™s summer now and iâ€™m planning on going away on my brithday, august 20. aka right around when school starts. iâ€™ve already been really close to failing my sophomore year classes before and iâ€™ve sure felt the pain of doing that because of course my mom thinks iâ€™m the one good child of the three bc now she absolutely hates the oldest who ran away, and the younger who canâ€™t do anything to save her skin, so i end up covering for her about 95% of the time. what tops it all off is the fact that my one sliver, my only real chance of survival was that my dad, who is my everything and i love him to death, is moving to arizona in order to get a better job. i live in illinois and if you donâ€™t know geography, itâ€™s a pretty far drive. iâ€™ve been crying myself to sleep since heâ€™s told me so thatâ€™s always fun. canâ€™t wait to see what the next  month and a half are like until i go. thanks for reading and sorry for any format issues.
