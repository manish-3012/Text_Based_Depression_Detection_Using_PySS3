The pressure is building againItâ€™s so hard to explain. I suffer from such a myriad of issues from being deaf to having bipolar disorder, everything in my life is a stressor even if I like doing these things. Work. My wife. Feeding my cat. Everything makes me overwhelmed, confused, I feel like Iâ€™m actually insane- like Iâ€™m swimming in my own head and I can scream but nothing will come out. This problem Iâ€™m having is when the pressure builds. When Iâ€™m overwhelmed this pressure in my body builds up, starting in my limbs until it reaches my core... then it gets bigger and bigger until I feel like Iâ€™m going to pop. At that moment I feel like I could cry, scream and throw a tantrum. Iâ€™m 22. When it gets bad enough I want to commit suicide just to get any relief- it feels so awful. All I want is to understand this feeling- Iâ€™m feeling it now and Iâ€™ve called 3 different crisis/suicide lines tonight and Iâ€™m just feeling guilty for staying at my office at work. I just need some relief. I donâ€™t want to die but this feels like my only solution..... sorry for the bad formatting or whatever Iâ€™m on my phone.
