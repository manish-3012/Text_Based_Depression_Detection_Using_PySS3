How to convince myself to live and get help?So, I was very suicidal earlier this week and I wound up telling my friend about it. That of course had consequences (to be fair, I had planned out exactly how I'd die and planned it to look like an accident). Well, I've been lying to everyone else about feeling better, and I lied to her about feeling better. Now that I'm alone again, I'm remembering exactly the reasons as to why I wanted and needed to die. The demon that has weighed me down for years is whispering at me again, telling me how evil I am, how pointless all of this is, it's pointing to my escape route, a noose, and a young man, to be hung from the neck until dead. I don't want to do it, though. I want to live, I want to get help, if not myself then for her. I just don't know how. What can I do?
