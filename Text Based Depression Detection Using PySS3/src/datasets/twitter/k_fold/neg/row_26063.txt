Jumping off the pier.I have come to terms with suicide. I am going to jump off the pier. I am going to get drunk and jump. The water is cold, so I will likely die of hypothermia. Maybe a heart attack + the Co2. The death will be faster than jumping into warm water. I am going to lie down and listen to my favorite songs.
 â€œOh but dreams have a knack of just not coming true. And time is against me now.â€ 
I canâ€™t wait.
