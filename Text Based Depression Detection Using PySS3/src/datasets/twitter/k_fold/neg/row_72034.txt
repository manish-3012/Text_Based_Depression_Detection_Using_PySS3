Really starting to scare myselfHow can I talk to my psychologist about my suicidal thoughts without being put on watch? 

It just seems like such a casual thought now. 

My place is a disaster and I keep telling myself I don't want to be found in such a mess. So.... my place is a non stop shit show.

I keep telling myself I will make sure I find new homes for my pets before hand, but won't ever actually try to find them a new home. 

There isn't much holding me back right now and it literally comes into my head as a solution to every small problem I have.
