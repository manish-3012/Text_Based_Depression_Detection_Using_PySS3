I have so much social anxiety I can't workAdd to that depression and almost complete isolation and I just can't stop thinking about ending it. It feels so necessary now as very soon I won't have any means of support to even have basic necessities.
So I woke up this morning feeling a little bit of peace that these are my final weeks ever having to worry about anything. At least I gave myself enough time to see I won't be missing out on anything good in life.
