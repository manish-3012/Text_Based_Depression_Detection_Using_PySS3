I just feel tiredHey this is most likely going to be a bit of a weird post because I donâ€™t fully understand what Iâ€™m feeling either right now. For about 3 years now I have been suicidal I have tried to take my life once before but couldnâ€™t go through with it, that was about a year ago. Since then Iâ€™ve gotten a bit better and connected with tons of people I consider friends but doing this has like just made me tired, done like everything I thought I could do has been done now. I donâ€™t honestly have any goals in my life and all I can think about is suicide again, my life has had many problems and I donâ€™t feel comfortable going public with them as I donâ€™t want someone I know finding this. As many people have said in this sub I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I feel as if Iâ€™ve lost myself to who I want to be but Iâ€™m not the person I want to be, so Iâ€™ve just lost who I used to be, I miss my old self but I like my new faker self. Any other thing is that a few of the people I have become friends with are also depressed so I help them out if they are sad or upset and they know I am as well but not once in my life have I had someone ask whether Iâ€™m ok like Iâ€™m nothing but a tool  for there use. One way i put my life is a side character in someone elseâ€™s life, it makes me shake with sadness when I think about this it makes me just mad and upset but then I fall to sleep crying about this and when I wake up i just feel tired. I donâ€™t know what to do just Iâ€™m lost, tired and not sure what to do other then just running away then killing myself so no one I know gets hurt.
Iâ€™m sorry this post probably makes no sense and no one will read but I just donâ€™t know where else to go or get help at.
