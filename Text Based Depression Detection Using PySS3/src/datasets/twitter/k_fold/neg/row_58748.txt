I think im slowly getting readybeen passively suicidal for like 10 or 15 years. I'm almost 30 now. But it used to be like a last resort and a thing i didnt want to do. i used to see signs in life that my time wasnt up and i was still meant for something more. Used to think all the suffering would make me stronger and lead to something. I was such an idiot. This is all life is. I already experienced the best times. And at this point there is less and less keeping me here every day. It becomes more and more a logical choice than an emotional one. The way i talk to my friends now is different. the way i think and act is different. I used to threaten and shit cuz im pathetic and want attention but obviously after years no one cares or listens anymore. Then i used to want to do it just to spite everyone. But these days i find myself not caring at all. I dont think I would even bother telling anyone before I did it. I literally don't care about the attention or getting better anymore. I already quit therapy and medication. I already decided to give up. I already stopped going to school. Ive already had a plan in place for many many years now. I also used to think about giving all my stuff away to my friends and things like that. Now i couldnt care less what happens after i'm gone. It used to seem like some far off dream but now it seems firmly grounded in reality and it's waiting for me right around the next corner.
