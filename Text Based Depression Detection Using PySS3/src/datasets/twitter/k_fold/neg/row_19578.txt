Leave? Or leave the world?I am no good for anyone in my life I mess up everything I try. I have been thinking of suiside for a while but I'm scared I think maybe I should shoulder a backpack and become one of the faceless nameless homeless. I am so tired of hurting and in the process hurting those who care about me but will never understand any of the things I feel or how I manage to mess olup everything. I just don't know what's best. I am worth alot more dead that alive that's my problem.
