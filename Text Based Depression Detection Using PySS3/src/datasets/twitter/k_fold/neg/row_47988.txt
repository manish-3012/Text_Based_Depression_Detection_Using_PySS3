I'll never get anywhere in lifeI'll never have the courage to put myself out there. I'll never have the discipline needed to get out of poverty. I don't want to keep working towards a better future. I just want to lay down and give up on life. I don't want to keep doing this bullshit. I don't want to keep working like a fucking dog and going to fucking school. The only reward I will ever get from suffering through having to be alive is death.
