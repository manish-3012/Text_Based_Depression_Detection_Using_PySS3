Please. Help, I've been submitting this for the last week, no responses...just religious and spammers.Hey All,

It's really hard to find an individual, or even a medical professional who is more than just a recent grad who dials 911 at anyone expressing anything slightly less than farting rainbows and kittens.  


I've gone though 3 psychiatrists and undergone a large number of invasive tests...and the results are in. I'm not chemically depressed...I'm officially logically depressed. I've also been with 5 different therapists over the last 5 years who all...sadly tossed up their hands not knowing where to go. (The last one suggested I take out personal ads in the paper to try and make friends :/ )


That is, I've got an odd I.Q. and means of reasoning. (It has served me wonders in the engineering world and music!) Problem is, ever since middle school 'distraction' has been the goal of avoiding depression. 


And after quitting college, going to a trade school, becoming a professor of the class I took, then going onto working the floor in a global steel renewable energy company, to becoming their senior welding engineer of that same company all in less than 2 years, only to quit when I was being asked to partake in fraudulent activities...I'm back in middle school. 


Distraction is the game.


I'm curious if there are any therapists or psychologists who can rationally work through things instead of the usual 'I'm here to help you solve the issue.'....I'm looking for those few pragmatic individuals who don't find answers in just locking someone up. (I promise, I volunteered to be in 'da looney bin' for several months, and all that was really said was, 'His participation in group discussion made the doctors uncomfortable because his reasonings, while popularly taboo, weren't unreasonable. I.E. The question of 'Is suicide ever an option?' 'Always...if you're being ran over by a steamroller...toes first, relief if sooner sought that proving hope for unaltered resolution exists.') That and they couldn't understand how a competent pianist would volunteer to participate.


Anyways, kinda stuck in a rut. No, I'm not foolish enough to take my own life. Sheesh, I know there's still 'hope' as I'm still trying. Issue is, I keep adding in different scenarios...and the results are still...bubkis. (And it's not as simple as 'well we all die anyways so what's the point') I promise it's much more well constructed than that.


So, if you or anyone else know of someone or somewhere that has a proactive and NON-KNEE JERK reaction to people wanting to discuss depression without limitation (including the planning of self termination), please let me know.


Suicide Hotlines are meant for those that are scared and terrified and need help. That's stellar for them, and I always wish them well. Same with all the 'dial up' and 'here to comfort' phone services.

Thank you for your help!

Edit: Yes, physical exercise is a great idea! I've only owned a motor vehicle for 3 years now, and prior I walked, biked, and hiked everywhere. Even did a marathon a year ago! But I've been sitting stagnant for the last half a year as futility sets in. Even with all the jogging training, and similar. It was just me...at the 'race', just me at the finish line...and just my brain on the long drive home. 

EDIT: On of the maddening ideas is doing what many were asked to in primary school, "Draw a picture of who you want to be in the future." Instead, paint how you die. And I envision, if I am still sitting here in 10 years with no change, how much I'd loath myself for not taking action today. I'm a proactive individual and seeing problems down the road usually inspired action today. As you can imagine that proactive plan isn't the best when it comes to self termination. Problem is, I see myself as alone, in the same chair I've been sitting for years. It doesn't matter the job or similar, I regret the time wasted...but I know it wasn't, it was spent agonizing over change...change that I can't create, change that is dependent on the actions of others. And being alone...as I have been is not a point I want to meet.

That's how it goes day to day, night to night:

"Where do I want to be?"
"With others."
"Am I there?"
"No."
"Did we try something different today?"
"Yes, we stopped in the library and tried to talk to people...how rude ha."
"Will it change if the same thing is tried?"
"No, that's insanity."

Imagine doing this every single day...for over a decade. Maddening.

So...question to you, If you knew that on the day you died, nothing had changed from today aside from bills, politics, the weather, and your physical age/health, what made the passage of time noticeable?

I was 16, scrubbing toilets at college, was quite content with that. And while walking to work at 4a.m. one morning, I had a bit of euphoria. I liked where I lived, I enjoyed the people I saw while working, I liked being able to walk through the woods, and row on the shores of Lake Superior...and I'd be content to live this day again with no change. That in that moment, i could see myself 40 year later in the same routine, and it was acceptable.

In that moment, I found peace and thought, 'If I died, today or 40 years from now doing this, it would be the same as dying now.' 

I should have taken than and done myself in then...it's been down hill ever since! ha.


**EDIT:** For the first time in my life, I had a dream where I found myself, after having failed miserable in front of others to cook something properly, that I found myself banding my fists on the wooden kitchen flood,dropped to my knees SHOUTING!!!! "I JUST WANT TO DIE! I JUST WANT TO DIE!" What a way to wake up. Thank you subconscious for the non-subtle imagery.

**"Io fei gibetto a me de le mie case."** In middle school, after making a belt in a leather working class (part of the boyscout camp I taught at), I stamped this into the back of it. I always enjoyed how words written hundreds of years ago still ring true on a personal level (Granted...I didn't sell a friend out for a few coins)...still the same.
