I'm going to hang myself.I'm going to hang myself on 05/30/12 or 05/31/12.  I am graduating with a useless BA in Biology.  I don't think that I'll get into medical school.  I have no real friends, no money, and all my aspirations have been shut down.  There's no point in wasting everyone's time and money.  I'm just saying goodbye to everyone.  Goodbye. 

Follow up: nothing said can help.  I think I might jump from the bell tower during instead.  I really don't want to end everything now, but I've been deserted by the people around me, and there's nothing I can do to change the situation, besides becoming a millionaire.
