I wrote a poem instead of a letterItâ€™s tine for me to say my goodbyes so Iâ€™m doing it this way and Iâ€™m sorry to all those who may hurt because of it.

Good bye to all my dearest friends
My life is almost to its end
Please donâ€™t cry and please donâ€™t mourn 
You stuck around, you helped for sure
But Iâ€™m done and Iâ€™m sorry
This pain I canâ€™t carry
So tell me that youâ€™ll be okay
I need to know youâ€™ll be okay
The time is ticking, ten minutes more
Before the pills kick in and Iâ€™m gone for sure
Just know that I never wanted to hurt you
I never wanted to cause you harm
So Iâ€™m sorry for lying when
I told you I was fine
But scars and burns last forever
And my pain wonâ€™t stop for ever and ever
So goodbye 
And Iâ€™m sorry
I love you all dearly 
Goodbye.
