Idk what this is I just need to vent(f16-uk)Well I've been feeling extremely down and worrying over my upcoming mocks and just school in general and I just feel like it's so pointless I can't do work as well as I used to I don't know what six. Form to go to hell if can I even get in. There nothing that I necessarily aspire to be and how society is formed I won't be able to be happy. I'm just tired I feel like I shouldn't have been in this world to begin with. 

I haven't eaten since the day before yesterday and my mum has seen to give up on me so I have too. I just heard her saying how I'm lazy and indicisive and she tired if telling me what to do so good luck to me and then compared me to a pensioner. I already know that what she said is true but it hurts more when you hear it out loud.

At this point I've realise how much of a burden I've become on my friends and family even though that's what I was trying to avoid by not wasting money and she also gets annoyed at me easily so it just better if I'm not there. Because talking about my suicidalness is triggering for my friends I can't say anything so I feel alone. I'm just so tired why am I the selfish one if I don't want to be here it would be better. Well itd be better if I was someone else but that's impossible. I'm so tired can I not just sleep forever. I started searching up xanax pill but it seem I need a prescription so done with everything.

Thx for reading it all it's a bit of a mess I rarely express my feelings so doing so is a bit difficult stay safe peeps
