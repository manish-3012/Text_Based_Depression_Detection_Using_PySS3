Suicide Maybe?Perhaps I'm being a little melodramatic, perhaps no one cares, but I feel I should get it out there anyways. 

 After weeks of stress, I am struggling with thoughts of suicide. I'm 17 and should have been going to university in the fall, but I just received my report card and I fall 0.1% below the (relatively high) minimum entrance requirements. Not only when my parents find out will they be absolutely livid, I could very well end up being thrown out into the street. This also eliminates most job prospects for me and a future.

On top of that, I have a limited social life and with out education to fall back on too, there really isn't anything left in my life. 

I really don't know what to do. I don't really want to kill myself but at the same time I don't think I have any other options.
