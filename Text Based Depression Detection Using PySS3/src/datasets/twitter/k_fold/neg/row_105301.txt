Am I the the only one?I have an anxiety disorder. What ever I do, does not matter where I am, my brain is always telling me I suck. Tells me that I'm nothing. I try to concentrate in my classes, but all I can think about is everything I've done wrong and how stupid I have been. I can not turn it off. Is killing me inside. Is gotten to the point where maybe a nice bullet will end the suffering of so much blame and anguish. My friends are transferring to schools and I am stuck. The succeed more and more while I fail. I am of a low income, live in a small place with my parents with no privacy. Everyone I know has it all. All I have is myself, and he wants to take the easy way out. I'm jobless, loveless, and have a bad body and face. I just want to end it all. Someone feels the same?
