Giving myself the weekend to think it overI think Iâ€™ve finally reached the breaking point. Iâ€™m currently in my last year of grad school to become a PA. My program director is pulling me from my clinical site due to circumstances outside my control and using my performance evaluation thus far to determine my grade. Unfortunately itâ€™s not going to be sufficient to pass which means Iâ€™m going to get kicked out of the program. Nearly $100k down the drain with nothing to show for it. Iâ€™ve dealt with mental health issues all my life and I thought that going back to get my degree would provide me some purpose. Iâ€™ve already made the exit bag and bought the nitrogen. I wouldâ€™ve shot myself already but Iâ€™m too chickenshit to go through go out Ã  la Kurt Cobain. Iâ€™ll get the final word on my status on Monday but idk if I can even wait till then.
