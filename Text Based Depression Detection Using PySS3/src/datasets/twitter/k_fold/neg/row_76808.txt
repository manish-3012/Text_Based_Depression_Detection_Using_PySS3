Donâ€™t know if this is the right place to post it but here.So Iâ€™ve been depressed for a long time now. At times it feels so goddamn hopeless. Iâ€™ve heavily considered suicide and a few months ago I made the choice I was going to take my life in June. Knowing that Iâ€™ll be dead soon is one of the only things that keeps me going, if Iâ€™m being honest. But at the same time I keep doubting myself.. like one part of me keeps telling me, â€œno one would notice your dead.â€ But then thereâ€™s times where Iâ€™ll be talking to a friend and sheâ€™ll say something like, â€œI really care for you, ya know?â€ And it makes me reconsider everything. I donâ€™t like to think about it because itâ€™ll probably convince me not to commit suicide, but I also really want to die.
