I have attempted suicideIf anyone needs support or just someone to talk to you can always message me. I had tried overdosing in several different types of pain killers at once. My parents found me the next morning and a day later I was admitted into an inpatient psychological unit in Seattle Children's Hospitaln while there I made some of the most amazing friends to be honest. After being gone from school it was hard getting back into the grove if things and a year later really had stuff straightened out. So even if you only attempt unsuccessfully, take it as your second chance at life and live it the best you possibly can! If you ever need help dint be scared to talk to me.
