How fortunate for those Reddit deems worthy of lifeMy friend left a notebook of logins amongst her things. At first I was so grateful to see she tried to reach out and there was a place for her to talk. Then I realised it's all about the 'karma currency' on this site. 

What a shame - if only she seemed worthier of the kinds of comments that reap karma, if only someone felt that talking to her might gain them internet points, we wouldn't be trying to arrange a funeral today.  An expense none of us can afford but I hope it goes ahead because a little boy deserves the chance to say goodbye to his mum in a way that doesn't make it look like she didn't matter much in this world. She mattered a whole hell of a lot to us. From what we can piece together, she felt like she didn't exist or matter to other people. This place reinforced it right when it mattered most. I can't lay blame - you guys are strangers and didn't make her do what she did. We who knew and loved her should have been there for her...it just wasn't us she chose to speak to. Please help people here when you can.
