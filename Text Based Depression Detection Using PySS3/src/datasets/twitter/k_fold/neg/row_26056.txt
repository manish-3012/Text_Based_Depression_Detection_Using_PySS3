What are some good quick fixes for depression? (Directed more towards fellow depressed redditors)I know this is bound to be controversial but some nights just seem *SOOO* MUCH WORSE than the others. Tonight was almost unbearable. Is there anything I can take that will make me feel better for just a few hours?

Ive tried alcohol (or liquid happiness as I like to call it) but I feel way more depressed once the buzz wears off so I stay away from it.

How harmful is Nyquil? I would just take enough to get me to bed early or something.
