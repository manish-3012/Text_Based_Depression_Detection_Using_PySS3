No safety net, no help.I'm out of a job and without insurance now. Can't afford my meds or to see a doctor. Am having to go cold turkey on one because I can't afford it out of pocket. I need to go to therapy- I want to seek help. But I've been waiting months for Medicaid to approve me, but they are so backed up they told me it could be more than 90 days at least before my application is even read. I went to the free clinic, they said there is a 4-6 week waiting list to see a doctor if I'm approved, and months-long waiting list for a psychiatrist with no guarantee. I've been told the only way to get seen and prescribed without insurance or payment is to go to a county hospital and say I'm suicidal. They'd commit me, and I'm so terrified of that happening I'd rather die. 

What's the point? If I could find a gun I'd like to kill myself in/ in front of a government building. Maybe that would at least send a message about the state of our healthcare system and help put policies into place to help other people in the future. In America, only the rich deserve quality health care, those who can barely afford it are driven into poverty by medical bills, and all the rest with mental illness without access become homeless and die on the streets. I'm already not eating and feel like I'm slowly dying, my death might as well mean something, might as well bring attention to what really happens.
