I can't find a way outI have lost hope of everything in my life: myself, the future, family, loved ones, my country, and the world.

Everyday I wake up to this suffocating feeling of despair and hopelessness. From the moment I wake up, the only thing I look forward to is going to bed again, just to be away from the people so that I can suffer and cry freely.

I cannot stand living in this house, this country, and this world anymore. I keep finding myself contemplating about suicide. I have been searching ways, but all of them either seem painful or can be risky for other people (like gas). I do not know what to do. I've tried numbing my pain with alcohol a few times. Those were the only times when I felt less shitty than usual, when I was not myself. Since I cannot live in a constant state of drunkenness, I have been thinking about suicide. I think I need help but I don't know who to talk to. I wonder if there is anybody out here that can relate to what I feel.
