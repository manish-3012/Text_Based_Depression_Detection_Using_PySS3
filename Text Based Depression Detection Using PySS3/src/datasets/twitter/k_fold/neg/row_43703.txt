M27 married looking for good way outHi,

First of all: I am male, 27 and have had a decent life.

I am pretty sure that most people want my life. Steady job, nice wife, awesome pets and good income. I am just not happy with anything. I feel like I am human garbage. I can't stop thinking that everybody would be better off without me.

Now my wife wants to move to Canada and the reason why she is staying is that I can't afford it. I'm blocking her. I don't want that.

My pets need more movement but I'm too depressed to do that. I'm making them unhappy.

My father has a restaurant. I'm a trained chef. He needs my help. I can't work in that atmosphere anymore because I have no social connections and a tendency to drink too much. Alcoholism runs in the family.

I feel disappointment from everywhere I go. I gained a good bit of weight because I just don't want to do anything anymore.

I'm looking for a good way to go whilst donating my organs under German law. Constructive ideas wanted. None of this flimsy "you'll be fine bullshit"

Throwaway account.

Thanks
