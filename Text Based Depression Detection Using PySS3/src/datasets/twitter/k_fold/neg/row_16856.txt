i can't see the point anymorei'll be ending my life next week. i still have 7 days to say goodbye to everyone and do good deeds even if i know i'll go to hell for what I will do. I'm just tired and I can't seem to find a purpose in my life. College is stressing me out and I don't have friends anymore since my former friends left me and spread some rumors about me, i can't go to my university anymore.  Everyone there secretly judges me, even my professors. 

My family seems to make me feel i'm a burden, and i think im also a hindrance in my girlfriend's goals and dreams. Maybe if I'll do this, their life would be so much easier. People can carry on without me. 

I'm tired of my life. I can't even express how I feel without anyone worrying or even judge me. I'm dying.. i got 7 days to live.
