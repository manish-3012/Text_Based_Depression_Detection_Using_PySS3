Just a question about counsellingI've been before. I don't think it really helped as much as the medication did, so I didn't continue after the depression abated. Well now it's back, really suddenly, with pretty severe suicidal thoughts, worse than they'd ever been. My question is, what kind of action is a counsellor supposed to take when you tell them you've been thinking about suicide? Not saying like, "I'm planning on killing myself tomorrow," but still thinking about it pretty seriously.

I don't want a lecture on why I should seek help either way, just an idea of what would happen if I do.

Thanks.
