I don't see a reason to live.I don't see a reason to keep living. It seems like every day things around the world get worse, and I don't have anyone or anything that'd be sad if I died. The world doesn't need me, I don't enjoy the world and most likely never will. I really feel like death is the best way to go onwards.
