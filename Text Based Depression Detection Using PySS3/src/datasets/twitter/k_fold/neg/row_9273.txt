Today I really wanted to kill myselfI have been in med school for 10 years (thatâ€™s right, TEN). I just canâ€™t graduate because of bureaucracies. Iâ€™ve been trying for more than one year but apparently everything I try just doesnâ€™t work. Today I had everything ready for a meeting with the school board that would solve my problems but I got a call and they said that they wouldnâ€™t accept my pledge at all. Now my only choice is 
sue the university. All my hopes fell apart instantly, I threw up at the street and considered killing myself in a cheep hotel or jumping out of a building. All my friends are very successful, traveling the world and moving out. I am the only one who is still a student. I canâ€™t handle the pressure of everyone asking me everyday why I didnâ€™t graduate. My family is going through a financial crisis and it reminds me that if I was already a doctor I could help somehow. I feel like I am a burden to everyone. A complete fail. I cry myself to sleep every single night. As soon as I wake up the very first thought in my head is that I wish I was dead. I just donâ€™t want to live anymore.
