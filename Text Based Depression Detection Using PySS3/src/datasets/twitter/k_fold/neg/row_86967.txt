Getting tired of the cycle of failureI'm so, so exhausted by trying to make things better.

First off: not at immediate risk. I do have help, grudgingly given though it may be.

Multiple attempts at reinventing myself always end the same way, with me realizing I can't fit in no matter how I contort myself.

Familial responsibility keeps me tethered to this painful life.

I know it will get better. I also know it will get worse after that. I don't know how many more times I can do this.
