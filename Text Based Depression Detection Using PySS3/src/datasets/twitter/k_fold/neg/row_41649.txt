Not Waving But DrowningA few months ago I took a LOT of Xanax and got blackout drunk at a bar. Apparently I told the bartender I wanted to kill myself, which I still do. I was admitted in the ER and after 2 days I was forced to go to a detox center.
    I was released, obviously, but now I get a bill for $7,000 and I've been harassed nonstop even though I have full coverage health insurance.
    I guess my insurance company doesn't want to pay because I've been to the ER more than once for being suicidal. Well, fuck the ER, I'm going to succeed this time.
    I have a syringe completely full of oxymorphone, and I am really fucking ready to die. I appreciate anyone who took a minute to read this.
