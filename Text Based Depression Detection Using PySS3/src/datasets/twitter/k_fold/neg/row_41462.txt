I shouldnt feel this wayi feel utterly awful, hopeless and dont know how im gonna get out of this. i get these spirals of negative thoughts that get worse and worse and lead to the worst feelings ever. ive tried a crisis textline but for some reason they were insistent i wanted to kill myself and kept asking me questions about it which really did not help. I shouldnt feel this way honestly. I have one of the best mums you could have, i have a few good friends, one i consider a brother. I live in a nice house, i have nice things. Why does it have to be this way?
