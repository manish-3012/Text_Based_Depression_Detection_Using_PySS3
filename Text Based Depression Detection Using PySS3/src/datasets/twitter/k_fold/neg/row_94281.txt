it was going to be this midnight.yesterday, i was supposed to hold my pets, have them beside me and cuddle and show them love before i say goodbye to them. i was supposed to write my letters yesterday, to my family. the people who really love me, the friends who really love me, people who are not selfish and dont suck the life out of me. i was so close to betraying all of that. all of their hopes for me, they believe in me. but yesterday, maybe the pill was sent from angel. my father knew i was in very bad pain. i took that medicine, and for once i had a restful sleep. he is really hurt, yesterday and the day before when he seen me, he seen something that he himself seen before. he told me it wasnt worth it. he was like i am now, im hideous and grotesque, no skills. he was like that before, except he had drive. he didnt want to be weak anymore, he wanted to be in control, not let someone play with his emotions. he became strong, went to university to learn how to speak without mumbling and stuttering, he found confidence. he said that people will always hurt you, but when you meet the few that dont its worth it. hes alone now, hes older and doesnt want to find anyone anymore. i slept all day yesterday from the pill, just woke up at 8 this morning. i looked at her picture as soon as i woke up. i cried and smoked a cigarette. cried like a mad man, stuffing pillows and blankets in my face screaming. bashing my face several times to take the emotional pain away. i had another smoke, and here i am. i began to really think. is death really worth it over this girl? this girl who never game me support? this girl who would compare me and make me feel bad and talk about her super ex? i would have never betrayed her like him. i wouldnt have slept with several other people. i wouldnt have made her trust me then betray her like he did. but she loves him. not me. she thinks hes the best person, not a friend not a lover. then what is he? i have been hurting for half a year over someone who loved someone else. someone who pretended to love me, she knew i had no confidence, i was hideous. she made me feel like a was "special" that my trust problems, i didnt need to worry around her, that i could tell her anything and she would always be there... so i lowered my walls for her. she always cancelled plans. she left me waiting for her after work, when we were together. i waited 6 hours for her to get off. she called me, heard i was a little upset. and said oh im sorry, im going to call my ex. he doesnt get many chances to call, so goodbye. i lay there and cried myself to sleep. i let her walk all over me. i was the only one who sacrificed time. she thought opening her legs was good enough. that sex meant she could keep me there and treat me like shit. i didnt care about the sex, i wanted her support and love like she used to give. she told me she wasnt drifting apart but it felt like it. i gave her many options after the breakup to leave me the way she did yesterday. but no, she kept making fake promises, this weekend we were going to call. but it was a week before we messaged, i was worried wondering where she was. she came back saying sorry this sorry that. i was like okay, well i hope it gets better. hour later, JADE JADE I DONT WANT YOU TO MESSAGE ME ANYMORE

once i seen those words i went livid. i screamed into my pillow. i smashed my face repeatedly and gave myself a snotty black eye. all of that time for nothing. no good bye. just go away. called me jade jade like she did when she loved me. just to throw me away. after all these months. of fake promises. lies.  all of this suffering. while she was out there talking to other people. pretending like she was busy. she wasnt busy. i gave her so many chances to not hurt me. but she wanted me to suffer, i think she was really waiting for my birthday that is coming up in a few weeks to throw me away.

i was going to kill myself over someone who never loved me. someone who never cared. i was going to betray my friends and my family, over this? this selfish pig? she can go back to him, be used, broken trust and repeat. but she will find another "friend" who will be a lonely ugly guy. she will make them trust her, she will trick them into loving her. she wants people who have no on to fill her empty soul. people who will actually care for her and give her time. something to fill her empty black soul until her ex decides to fuck her again. then she can play mind games, make the useless fools feel like she doesnt love them, but she will say otherwise. they will continue to worry and ask why? she wont respond and say you make me feel sad and guilty :\( im going now have a nice night thinking about this. while she goes and talks to one of her lads that use her as a fuck toy. she will come back, and act like nothing happened. like youre hurt didnt happen.

this was the girl i would have killed myself over. a person who only cares about them self. she isnt lonely, dont be fooled. she has an endless supply of exes she keeps waiting in line to send nudes too. keep them hooked.

im not going to kill myself tonight. im not going to die like a cowardly spineless cuck. to hell with that barren bitch. today i live. today i will show my family im stronger than that, that i have back bone. i will be like my father, i will become stronger. i know i can. its in me. theres a fire that burns in my gut and im not going to let this time wasting scum put it out.

to those few people who gave me some support during the day and last night. you will always be a friend of mine. i wont ever forget you guys. i was so alone, you will never in your lifetime know how thankful i am.
