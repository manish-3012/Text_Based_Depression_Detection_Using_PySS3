Im going to shoot myself today.I have terminal cancer. I have had a relationship for 7.5 years that's been shit because of decisions by the both of us. I love the person who left me yesterday but i fear there is no reconciliation to be made. They truly feel nothing for me. I'd like to find homes for my pets but if not by the end of today i fully intend to take my life by shooting myself in the bathtub with the door locked, leaving plenty of food for my pets and this as a flag for someone to finally see. My financial situation is a disaster, I can't afford to live, my depression is at a peak from losing a job i finally had, at the brink of mental collapse i decided to play a game by myself which i knew would upset my fiancee but he found out and i lied about having played it and that was that. He left and i am alone and i would rather die on my own terms than of cancer or starvation homeless and alone.   


Not sure why im posting this besides to have someone see it if they choose to look through this username and hopefully feed my pets.   


Sorry i fucked up so much Ash wish i was better. Can't deal with the pain so i hope this is quick. I love you always.
