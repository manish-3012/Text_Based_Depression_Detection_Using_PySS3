I survived18M. I didnâ€™t get very far. My mom got to me before I did anything irreversible. I listened to my best friend sob uncontrollably on the phone for 20 minutes and that was really hard to hear. My friend, the normally stoic bastion of dry humor, broke down. My ex came over and I still donâ€™t know how I feel about that days later. Itâ€™s nice to know I have people that care about me, but I feel bad because I canâ€™t help but feel as if my situation that drove me to attempt in the first place hasnâ€™t changed. 

Iâ€™m safe and Iâ€™m not going to attempt again. I just feel different - not like myself. People look at me differently now and I donâ€™t really like that. I donâ€™t like feeling weak or fragile. Toxic masculinity I guess. Any words of wisdom from fellow survivors?
