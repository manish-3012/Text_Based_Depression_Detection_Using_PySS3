It's the little thingsIn psychology I learnt about daily hassles, daily trivial inconveniences that are said to cause a great deal of stress when added together. Honestly thinking about it, I can see how they could cause more stress than life events. 
It's usually the fairly small trivial things that make me think "Oh God, not this bullshit again" Like being late, having to see the GP, a mock driving test. It all makes me live my will to live slightly but I do mean literally.

It's probably the worst when I sit back and realise I'm not happy. All my "happiness" is mostly being distracted or having high hopes for the future.
