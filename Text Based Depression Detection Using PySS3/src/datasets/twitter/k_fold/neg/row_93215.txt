[F 15] Wanting to kill myself because I don't want to do my homework.I have literally come to the point where I am so unstable in my life that I think about hanging myself because I have a lot of homework to do/make up. I skipped school for a week and a half due to a mental breakdown and still haven't caught up three weeks later. Today I fucking flipped out and poured all of my Diet Coke in the interior of my mom's car because I can't control myself anymore. I'm stuck in bed all day or I'm out in the "real world" wanting to die because my OCD, anxiety, and depression are consuming me.

I have already concluded that I am going to die by suicide. Not yet, but when I'm old and already on the brink of death.

I just need help.

I don't really know why I'm posting on here. Sorry.
