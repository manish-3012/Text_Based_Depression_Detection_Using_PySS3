Feeling like i will never escape thisI hate how my days feel like now, im a 21 years old student and im doing very bad at uni. Now with the virus and short online webcam learning... i dont think i will finish this semester.

I dont know if i will be able to find a good paying job (good paying means being able to live in my own place ) without a higher education. I live with my parents and in my country people leave their parents home when they are about 30 years old. So without university education there is no chance i will move out anytime soon.

Every day is the same,  last time i attempted suicide i felt like something might change but no... same shit ... and i know now that after i fail school it will be even worse than it is now.

And i just lost my very good job... father got me a very good part time job at a company he has high position in. But every time i did something "wrong" like coming home drunk once in a year he always brings up that i have this job only because of him.  And for the past days i been feeling like utter shit so i bought a nice bottle of wine for myself. He saw that and fight broke out about me being an alcoholic... having one bottle of wine. He told me that as long as i work in this company i cant spend money on alcohol or entertainment. I told him that he is insane and told him that im quitting. I should not have that job anyway and there are more skilled people who will do that job better.

Right now i feel the same like i felt 2 years ago when i attempted suicide, i can see no way out of this stage of my life... only a downward spiral. Im fascinated with death, with afterlife (or the lack of it)... to experience nothing and remain in nothing. This month i had 2 dreams about dying and they were very strong.

And with all this bullshit happening now in my life i feel like something is telling me that i should go. That once i die it will be revealed to me that i should have done it much sooner.

Im afraid that instincts and fear will prevent me again from taking my life like it they did 2 years ago (when the only thing i managed was to bloody my favorite shirt)

I think many people would see me as a worthless spoiled kid, so if im truly that, wouldnt it be best for me to leave ? My brain is probably damaged from whole life spent in panic attacks and trauma so i know for sure i will never lead a normal life.

Main things that keep me from ending it right now are fear and love for my mother... i dont want to hurt her, thats the thing that keeps me from it the most. Especially now that grandmother attempted suicide few months ago.

But i just keep feeling that suicide is the goal and the supposed ending to my life.. that its the right decision that i will one day make. I feel like the day is coming closer.

&amp;#x200B;

Im in pain almost every single day and i dont think this will change... is death really something that i should do everything in my power to avoid ?  What if death is something that if i knew it i would not waste a second before killing myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I really cant describe with words the pain im in now and i just keep thinking that if i did it right now i would no longer feel any pain. And if i keep on living i will only prolong the ending that will one day come anyway.
