Why bother continuing therapy.Close to 12 am on a Sunday night and here I am drowning my misery in beer and chicken fingers. Contemplating everything that may have lead me here. I want to turn off my brain and shut down the voices. I don't want to take pills anymore. I am moving cities soon and my psychiatrist is giving me a three months supply of meds. No referral or even a point to where I am suppose to go for help. I'm researching my new city but it looks bleak; months long waiting lists just for intakes. I give up. I can't do it again and be treated like a piece of garbage that is just in the way. I reached out before and nothing has really changed in those three years . Just waiting on lists and having a new concution of meds to try each visit. My pills make me physically ill, I have lost so much weight because I can't eat from the nausea. Doc just shrugs and tells me to drink ginger ale. It doesn't help. Nothing helps. Going to feel like such a failure tomorrow for drinking again but I just don't care anymore. I want to die so bad. I am sick of being a piece of human scum.
