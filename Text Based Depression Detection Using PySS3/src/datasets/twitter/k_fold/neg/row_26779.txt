What's wrong if I make a conscious decision to bit want to live anymore?I just don't understand why it's so bad to want to die, why would I want to continue being this person living this life powerless to change it? I know who I am and what I am but now all I know is this hopelessness and I don't want to feel anything like this anymore. I don't want to keep living.
