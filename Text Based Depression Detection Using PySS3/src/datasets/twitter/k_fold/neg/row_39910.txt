It will be worse (tip/rant)Hi, it's me again, 13 depression, anxiety and more. I mentioned yesterday that I tried to kill myself. Number one regret of my life, not because i could of died but the grief and the way how things were after. I feel like a completely different person In the way people treat me. I should be happy that people are treating me better but for me have to try and kill me self to make them love me makes me want to throw myself of a roof. My mum was never really there for for me and all of a sudden she is just there for me. 8 don't know if I'm being ungrateful but I shouldn't of had to come to this, not for anyone but here I am. Is could go back in time I wouldn't take any tablets and I would of just hung myself instead. If any of you are considering suicide don't tak ibuprofen because it won't kill, it will fuck up your liver + kidneys, and it won't work so you will have to live you life with extra misery. I'm undergoing therapy and if you are worrying about suicidal thoughts ibuprofen is not the answer.
