I feel badThis probably isnt the best place to post this but oh well im gonna do it anyway. My mind feels like its being completely pulled apart. Ive been having a manic episode for the past few days but these past two hours have been a complete mess of shit. I dont really know whats happening. Constantly jumping from feeling complete and utter hopelessness with an intense desire to commit suicide to feeling like i can do literally everything ive ever wanted all at once. I cant focus on anything and my mind is fucking running a million miles per minute. Its taken me almost an hour just to write this down. Ive been off my meds for a while now I just cant bring myself to actually take them so now i get to enjoy what me being a fucking idiot has brought upon me. Im really scared and alone I dont know what to do its so late and I cant call anyone. I already stabbed my arm kinda deep and it was bleeding a lot but its sort of calmed down now. Now it just really really hurts. Does anyone just want to talk to me about literally anything at all please. I really dont want to be alone right now I just wanna talk to someone while I try to fuckin ground myself or something.
