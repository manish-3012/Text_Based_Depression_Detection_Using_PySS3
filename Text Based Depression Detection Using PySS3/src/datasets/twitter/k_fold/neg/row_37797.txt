I'm running out of reasons to stay alivethese past few years I'm only making it out because of my mom and grandfather, this year my grandfather died, a little while after that I received a puppy that I raised and help me recover from his death but last September my dog also died just after I thought I already get over it. My friends are there but they can't help me and now I'm also losing my grip on my mother. I feel lesser and lesser everyday. I'm losing every will to do anything and I also started cutting and overdosing pills while having an empty stomach, I can barely sleep that's why it's even harder to escape it now. I'm really trying to focus on other things but it's not helping me anymore. There's no way in hell I'm gonna make it.
