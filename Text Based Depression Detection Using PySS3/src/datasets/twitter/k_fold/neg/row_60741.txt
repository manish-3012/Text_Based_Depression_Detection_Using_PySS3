I've gone insane. Poisonous hatred coursing through my veins. Suicidal, homicidal, yelling, muttering and cursing to myself. Smashing glasses. Utterly alone. No one to turn to.I also think I'm smarter than you.  So you probably can't help. Except with knowledge of netsec. I want to be anonymous. To post this, I had to set Noscript to allow Reddit and Redditmedia.com. I'm using TOR. Does that mean I just made myself vulnerable? I explored [Freenet](http://freenetproject.org/)--but discovered you need friends to establish a secure network, and I have none. I'm too fucking alienated to even be a hacker.
