Autistic, anxious, agoraphobic, friendless and unemployedI'm now in my early 30s and have gotten nowhere in life. I spend every day locked in my room in my parents' home because I'm too anxious to go outside. Even planning out a day at home is difficult because I can't keep track of things or work up the motivation to do them. Any friends I had stopped talking to me five years ago so I speak a few sentences a day to my family, sometimes nothing at all. I am lonely and isolated and there's no hope for me. I don't have the money to get therapy and I've tried a *lot* of antidepressants (not to mention drugs) to try and fix this. Nothing has worked. I will always be someone people don't want around, someone who's always getting things wrong or doing some stupid shit 8-year-olds do effortlessly. I am a fucking waste of space. I contribute nothing. And no, I'm not good with computers, math, or any of the shit that might make me useful or employable. "Oh, you write well enough, get a job doing that." Yeah, I've tried. It doesn't pan out when you have nothing on your resume and when the samples you have to show are sub-par. Let's not even get into how much people can't stand me when they have to work with me in an office.

Neurotypical people have some possibility of change but I was born defective. My mom actually planned to abort me but was convinced to keep me by her doctor. I am a mistake. I have nothing going for me. I'll be living like a parasite, leeching off my aging parents until they die and I have nowhere to go. I want so badly to change, to be different, but I'll be a stupid autistic piece of shit until I die. So why wait? Only because I'm afraid my stupid ass will fuck up suicide and be worse off. I am fucking worthless. I wish someone would kill me and get it over with.
