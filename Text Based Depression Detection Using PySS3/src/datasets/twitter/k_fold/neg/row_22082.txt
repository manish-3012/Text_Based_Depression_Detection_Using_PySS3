The only thing stopping me from ending it is selflessness for the people it would hurtEverybody hates me, Iâ€™m socially awkward and fed up of anxiety and depression. I would probably ruin peopleâ€™s lives more if I killed myself than if I burdened them with my existence. So Iâ€™m just going to keep suffering.
