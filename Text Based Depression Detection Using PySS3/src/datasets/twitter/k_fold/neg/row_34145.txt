I'm tired of feeling nothingI'm tired of feeling nothing. For two years I have felt nothing, except for a few times. I feel completely useless. I'm socially inept. The only people I do feel close around I feel would be rather fine without me, because of this I have shot down and ruined what could have been good friendships and great relationships. I'm one person out of 200+ billion and feel like I'm just another addition to the overpopulation. I'm agnostic, I mean, why would god use a wasteful soul on me instead of one that would actually try harder and wouldn't take every chance he gets to shoot himself down. I think way too much. I just feel useless and unneeded on this planet. Why would I stay?

I doubt I'll commit suicide, but this has been on my mind for the longest time.
