A goodbye video?So I've ordered my choice of drugs to OD on from the dark web and and am now just waiting. Will be a benzo and alcohol overdose, up on a quiet hill that overlooks some nice fields, around 7am just as the sun's coming up. Hopefully it should be nice.

I wanted to ask, has anyone decided to leave a video instead of a note? I feel like a video has more substance and I think it'll convey emotions a bit better than some words on paper. I have some things I need to say to a few people and I think a video would do the job better.

Is anyone else thinking of doing the same thing?
