Is there a way I can find out if my internet friend is alive besides direct messaging?Title is basically all. I can't message them, because they stopped talking. Their last message said "I'm sorry everyone.." and that day and the day before they seemed to intend to kill themselves (left a suicide message, saying they want to die, etc.) They live in a completely different country than me, but I do know what country they live in, their full name, and what they look like (well, the latest picture I have is from a few months ago, but it still includes their face). Is there anyway that I can find out if they're still okay? I'm very worried
