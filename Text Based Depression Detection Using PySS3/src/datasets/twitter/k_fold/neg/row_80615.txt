[33F] Post Break-Up. Considering suicide if I knew how.My boyfriend broke up with me almost 2 months ago. I have a long post about this if you check my history but to summarize there were a lot of external circumstances that contributed to me acting a certain way where I wasn't moving the relationship forward and he was. We were fighting a lot, took a break where I discovered what I was doing and how I should be acting to build a future with him. In this time he discovered he doesn't feel the same way anymore and broke it off. I thought we could work through this after I figured things out but it was too late. I've been devastated. I was hoping we'd get back together but he hasn't replied to any of my texts. I also found out he might be seeing someone already but he might not be. It's just a girl he added on Facebook who we both know but who I know is single.

I've been really depressed and have been contemplating how I'm an idiot and the meaning of my life. Also my friends seem to be tired of my behaviour and depression as it's already been "a long time" in their eyes. Most of my friends are married with a family so they have their own life. In fact one person said I should go out and find new single friends. . . at 33. Yeah, that's super easy. . .

This morning I woke up around 4 am and thought that maybe suicide is an option. There are other good things in my life but I just don't feel like living. I can't get past this and now I'm thinking that if I could figure out how to kill myself, maybe I should do it. The thought came to me, I went back to sleep and now that I'm awake again I'm thinking that it's a feasible idea.
