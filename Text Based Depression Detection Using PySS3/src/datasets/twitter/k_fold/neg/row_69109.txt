Tired of living, but dont want to kill myself.I just feel so tired of it all.  The idea of dropping dead or dying in my sleep r whatever does not sound like  bad thing to me, but I dont want to kill myself either or at least I dont think I want to.  Stupid thing is I dont even know why I feel this way.  MY job sucks, yes, but I have my own house, a dog, a wife, and a 1 year old.  So i cant even think of a reason I should feel this way, but I do.  Not even sure if I should be posting to this sub
