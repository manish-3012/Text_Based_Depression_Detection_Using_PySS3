What is point of living such a mundane life? I'm over it.Seriously?! I'm 36 years old and crying in my bed on Christmas.

Just, wants the point? I work a 9 to 5 to come home till I have to work the next day. Is this is all it is?

I'm laying here with knife in hand wondering if the temporary pain of cutting myself will be so much shorter than this worthless life of mine will be.

Like, how deep do you have to cut yourself? Is it a matter of depth or width as far as the cut goes?

Thanks for your time. Hopefully your answers will yield more results than my life thus far.
