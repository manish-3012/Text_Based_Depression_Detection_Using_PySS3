Coming home from Cali today. Going to kill myself when I get homeWaited and waited and waited. Friends booked me a flight to fly me down to Cali as a last ditch effort and it failed miserably. I was made with a wire loose and thatâ€™s the same way Iâ€™ll go out. Boarding the plane at 5:55 and landing at 10:30 after that, Iâ€™m out. Itâ€™s been cool.
