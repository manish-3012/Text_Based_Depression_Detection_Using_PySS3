Has anyone else considered making it look like an accident?I don't really give a shit about my own life anymore, I accepted long ago that I've had my last good time. But my parents.. fuck. I think the pain for them would be much worse if they knew I commited suicide. So I thought about making it look like an accident, like a car crash or something like that. But when I came up with that idea, I realized I still care about my self, at least a bit. I don't want people to think I randomly died as the happy and confident person I was 5 years ago. I want them to know that some people feel so fucking shitty that 'nothing' is an amazing fucking state compared to life. Sure, some will probably think I'm a selfish douche, but deep inside they know it takes a lot for someone to kill themselves. Most people would suck all the dicks in the world, eat shit and murder others to prevent death. While I would do all that to turn back time and let my parents have a different child. I hate existing. Talking to others, even professionals doesn't help shit so I'm only after discussing the topic.. It's not that I'm condoning it or trying to give people ideas, but I would love to know if anyone else thinks like me.
