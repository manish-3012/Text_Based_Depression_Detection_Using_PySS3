SuggestionsI feel like I'm at the end of the road, nothing feels more perfect than to end it. I have absolutely 0 friends and I'm not interested in making any because I'm too awkward. My gf cheated on me and wants nothing to do with me anymore. I have no real push to do anything or eat, only listen to music. I need a way that'll make it look like an accident. I feel like the single most insignificant human this earth has birthed.
