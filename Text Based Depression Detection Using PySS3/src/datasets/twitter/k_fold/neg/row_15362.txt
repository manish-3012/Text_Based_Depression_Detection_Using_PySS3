Getting out before the collapseToday on Reddit I realized there is no hope this is going to get better. I was depressed before this happened and the isolation has taken its toll. The way people have turned against each other (thanks to media influence) makes it worse.

Now, with the food system starting to collapse, a whole lot of people are still fine with the quarantine.   

The way people treat each other on the other subs is how people really are beneath the masks they wear at work. The good doesn't outweigh the bad any more.

Whether someone believes in God or not -- the Bible certainly nailed human nature 100 percent correctly.

I'm heading out to the woods. (People say if I do go out I'm killing others.)  I'll be sure to wear a mask.
