Life isnt mineIts like my life isnt mine anymore. I have already died on the inside years ago and i just live for other people now. Im a huge disappointment and complete and utter failure and i feel extreme guilt because everyone has to put up with me each and every day but some of these people i just dont want to leave. I care too much about them, mainly **her** ,  but if i died its not like she'd care anyway so that'll make it slightly easier when the time comes to do the deed. I didnt give this life my best shot, because its not worth it anyway and it was wasted anyway. Have one failed attempt, noone found out, dont need another.
