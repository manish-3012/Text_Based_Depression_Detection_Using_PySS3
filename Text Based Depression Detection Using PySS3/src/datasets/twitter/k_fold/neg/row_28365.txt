Tired of living, Scared of dyingI keep thinking about how this might be the last holiday with my parents (who are in their early 70s). Whether it's due to Covid or their heavy chain smoking, I feel like it's only a matter of time before I lose them. And I don't want to see a world without them. The only two people who really love me unconditionally could be gone before I know it. I have trouble sleeping at night because I keep thinking about how if they die tomorrow, I wouldnt even be able to say with certainty what their favourite movie is, what their first job was in life, what their favourite memory is, etc. Basically I feel like there's like only a few years left of life hanging over their heads. And even tho I try and document things about them so I could remember, I never feel like there's enough time with them. There's not enough time with them and it's soooooo hard to see them because of covid. The lockdown measures are strict from where we live. I'll be going back home after the holidays because of work.

I can't help but feel like it's only a matter of time before I fuck up and disappoint my friends and boyfriend. And nobody other than my parents can tolerate hearing sadness for more than a single conversation; It's like an illness to them, and it drives people away. So who the heck can I lean on when my parents do eventually pass? Nobody would want to stomach the burden of supporting me through that heartbreak. I'd be all alone without my parents.

I can't think of anyone else besides my parents who would stay with me on my deathbed if there ever comes a time when that happens. I feel so sad and lonely. Tired of living, scared of dying.
