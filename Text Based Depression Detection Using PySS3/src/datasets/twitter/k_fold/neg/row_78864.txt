Society: " you aren't entitled to anything, you have to scrap and suffer just to eeek out a meager living" also society: "how dare you decide you don't like life! Sucide is wrongSociety is just so hypocritical.  You can't tell people sucide is wrong and try to force them to stay alive, while expecting them to just accept how crappy life is. 

What if someone doesn't want to do that? Life isn't worth the effort and the struggle to everyone.  

What the hell do I have to gain by working crappy jobs and jerking off for another 20 years before I get cancer and die?

I don't want to do it
