I have no purpose.I cannot keep putting people I love through this. Hearing how bad my life is, making them annoyed with me for how I feel. I am useless. I need to devise a plan for this to be over. Personal issues have put me in substantial debt. I have no money, no motivation to continue a degree, a child who I don't feel even loves me. I have a boyfriend, but I can never do anything right. I let him down a screw up something that made me happy for the first time in years. I work so hard for my life to fall apart at the seams. Every. Single. Time. Now that I have nothing, I'll have nothing to say goodbye to. No one to miss me, nothing to leave behind besides some furniture and clothes. But my pain will be gone, and it's worth it to not hear how annoying I am, listen to people call me a victim, feel like a worthless person for having a child at 22, and letting everyone down always. I've hated my life since I was 17. And every day it gets worse. Therefore, I have concluded that I have no purpose. Or at least no positive purpose. Goodbye.
