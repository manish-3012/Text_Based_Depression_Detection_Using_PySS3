I can't deal with it anymore
There is nothing wrong. I have great friends, go to a good school, get decent grades, my parents are awesome, my home life is awesome, I have a dog who loves me.

Yet I am sick of it.
I am so sick of it all.
I am sick of being unable to help my friends when they are sad because I can't even help myself and I would feel hypocritical to tell someone something I can't even do myself.
I am sick of feeling guilty because I am sad because I have no reason to be sad. I feel guilty for being sick, guilty for this, guilty for that, guilty for everything.
My depression is slowly eating me up, stealing every joy I had in life, making me unable to love, to feel, to exist, I hate it.
In addition to that my anxiety has started again, buying groceries makes me anxious to the point of not eating or drinking for days, just so someone else buys stuff.

I feel like my life has ended already and the only thing that didn't get the memo is my body.
I want to end it.
I am just waiting for my exams to be over so in case I fuck even killing myself up I don't have to go back to school.
But I don't want to hurt anyone.
I know my problems are nothing compared to other people on this board. I even feel guilty writing this but I feel like you guys are the only ones I can tell.

I don't know how to deal with it any longer.
