Feeling WorthlessIâ€™ll always be a weird tranny not the woman I know I am.

Iâ€™m in a loveless relationship with my boyfriend for financial security while I finish school.

Iâ€™m old af 25.

My high and lows are to much for me to handle most days.

Iâ€™m afraid of starting over because Iâ€™ve been burned by too many people including family. My trauma runs deep.

My body is forever fucked with stretch marks from when I used to fat, I lost 140lbs.

Also Iâ€™m too fucking tall 6â€™1 kill me now.

Even if I finish school and become a hair stylist my self doubt will forever prevent me from succeeding. 

Xanny and alcohol are the only things that make anything tolerable. 

Fuck literally everything, I desperately hope our spirit lives on because Iâ€™m ready to move on.
