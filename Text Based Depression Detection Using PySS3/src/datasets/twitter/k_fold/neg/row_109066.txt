my therapist is abandoning me and now I want to kill myself2 days ago we had a session and I told her about my suicide ideation and then some hours later she texted my mom to tell her I was in danger. My mom doesn't understand mental illness so she freaked out and started screaming things like killing herself with me and killing our dogs too. It was a nightmare...
in that text my therapist told my mom she won't see me anymore and that she would just help us to get help in the public health services. But I did an internship in these services and I know a lot of people who can't pay for a mental health treatment and have to use the public system. And they all said what I already knew: it's not worth it, they won't give me the help I need and there's a big chance that I'll get even worse.

After all that my mom was screaming with me I had a panic attack and started swearing and saying a lot of bad things to my therapist and I regret it a lot because later she told me I was attacking her and making her feel bad. That wasn't my intention, I was just feeling really bad and ended up doing things I didn't want to.

But I don't want another therapist, I like her a lot and I was getting so comfortable with her... Now I feel like I'm being punished for being sick, I'm being punished for being too honest with her about my feelings.

now she doesn't answer my texts and I just want to die. I don't have energy to look to another therapist and I don't even want to do it. I want her...

I called her today. I heard her voice but then I felt bad and hung up. She didn't know who was calling so she probably deleted my number already. She moved on...

I want to die. My mom said that if I killed myself she would kill herself too and kill our dogs. I feel guilty for that and I love my mom and our dogs but I'm too depressed to care about anything 

(that was a really long text, sorry. And thanks if you read it all, I just don't know what to do anymore)
