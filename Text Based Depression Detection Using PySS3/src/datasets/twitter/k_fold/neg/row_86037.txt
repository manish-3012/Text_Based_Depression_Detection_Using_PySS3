Not going to do anything, just thinking about some issues...Hello, Redittors.I was here today wondering some issues I use to think about when I'm alone (almost all the time).So I'm typing them here as long as I remember them, they are questions, so it won't be too much of a boredom.

So, those questions are the following: 

* What does it feel like when you have anyone out there who loves you, to whom you are the most important thing? 

* What does it feel like when you have sex?

* What does it feel like when you are involved and fully integrated into a group of people?

* What does it feel like when you have classmates who care about you and who you really get along with?

* What does it feel like when you see anyone out there sat down alone without talking to anybody?

* What does it feel like when someone liked you for the first time and you seemed important at least to that SO?
