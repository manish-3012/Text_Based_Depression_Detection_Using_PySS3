Is it weird to hate people for trying to help me?I've got a lot suicidal thoughts past few weeks... I've told few close friends, they are actively trying to help me, but everytime I have serious talk with them, I just find meself more and more pissed off... I cut my arm quite a lot, but not because I want to kill meself like that (I am quite tempted to jump under a driving car and stuff like this...), but because the pain helps me to feel at ease. They just keep telling me the same things and think that that will help me, but it just deepens my depressions...
What should I do?
