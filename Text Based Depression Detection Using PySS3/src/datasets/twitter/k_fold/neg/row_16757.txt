Turned 21 yesterday. Wish I hadn't.Using a throwaway because I'm paranoid someone will be able to link my account back to me and throw me in a hospital again. 

I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was 10 years old and things have been exceptionally bad lately. I have no friends. I have no hobbies. I don't talk to anybody. I can't trust people. I used to want to do medical research and make the world better for people. Now, I have so little faith in humanity and so little passion or drive that I don't know what the hell I've been working towards and I just want to give up.

Yesterday was my 21st birthday. Growing up I never thought I'd make it past 16. I have no idea why the hell I'm still around. Part of me wants to try and go to therapy, but I know it's hopeless. I've just been delaying the inevitable for years. If I had killed myself when I was still a teenager I would've avoided so much loss and heartache. I'm so hurt and tired all the time and I want it to stop. I live alone so it'd be so easy to just take a kitchen knife and get it over with. The only reason I haven't is the fear of being sent back to a mental hospital if I fail. 

I want help so bad but I'm so hopeless and so scared.
