I want to end it.I do not want anyone or anything. That is the worse part. Suffering is one thing or not having is one thing, but when you just do not care anymore it's another thing. Sex or even threesomes are just so boring now.You know you get to a point where maybe you just want to put a period at the end of whatever this is. It seems to me life just isn't for everyone. Look the way I see it, life is like a movie. If I have sat through over half of it and it has sucked so far, chances are it's not going to get great at the very end and make it all worth it. No one should blame you for walking out early. Suicide being the cowards way out is such nonsense.  If it were the cowards way out everyone would be doing it. How many brave people do you really know ?
