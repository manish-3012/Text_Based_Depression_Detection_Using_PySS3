Hi guys. Just looking to chatI made a silly mistake in my life which will change it forever. I had just gotten it on track after battling with depression. Socially anxiety and suicidal thoughts for the last 13 years. I am of pretty sound mind as the consequences will not come into effect for a few months.  
But I know my past and I know where things will likely head so I would like to make a sort of bond with someone now and we can look out for each other. In the events that we do head that way.
