I'm exhaustedIt's so tiring living every day, I just want to die but I'm so scared of pain and aftermath due to failure.

I've attempted before and ended up in hospital and it was the worst experience of my life, family and friends joked (I use humor to cope) and said oh I bet you'll never try that again but they're wrong, it's like I strive even harder to be more successful

Failing my suicide has been like failing a test I'm searching everything and basically studying suicide methods and trying to find the ideal one for me

TLDR; failing suicide feels like I've failed an exam, I strive harder to die next time
