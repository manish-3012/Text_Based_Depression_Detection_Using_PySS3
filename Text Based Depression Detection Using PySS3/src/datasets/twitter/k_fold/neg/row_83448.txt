I'm losing itI feel like the longer I stay on this godforsaken planet, the more things I find wrong with everything. I normally don't let news and world events and crap get to me but they're starting to. I don't know, I have no motivation for anything. I tried killing myself a few nights ago but it didn't work. I really wish it had so that I wouldn't be bothering people anymore. Especially the people reading this. I'm sorry for wasting your time.
