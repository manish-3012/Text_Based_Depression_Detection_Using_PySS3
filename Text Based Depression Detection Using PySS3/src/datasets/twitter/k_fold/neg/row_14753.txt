Swd Class project is reallyI'm so sorry to my partners, who don't realize that I've given up on this class (I've given up in all of my classes) but was too afraid to withdraw. 

Now I'm in this zoom call with no idea what to do since we were only given three days to work on this large project, on day two out of three day and we have to essentially finish it, and they are working on the project while I'm muted trying to not hyperventilate. 

Cut myself bc I'm an idiot who wants to hurt I guess. I thought I would have killed myself before this project started but here I am fucking it up.


An hour later, I unmuted, and partner 1 had to help me correctly import our project into my IDE. I'm being dead weight while both of them are figuring out what to do. Partner one is especially bring patient while I am slow and partner 2 is confused but providing something to the team.

Now partner 1 gave me a much easier assignment bc I think they can tell I'm distressed. 

I want this to be over and wished I never signed up for the team project and just failed peacefully. Now I'm dragging two students who are actually trying this semester. 
 
I'm going to get back to work, thank you to anyone who reads this. Might edit with an update.
