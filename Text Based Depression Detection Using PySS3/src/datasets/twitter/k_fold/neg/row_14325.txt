I've found a true way outAll the times I've attempted suicide over the years I've usually used "regrettable" methods, ones that I could get out if that last minute regret hits. Strangling myself, hanging myself, overdosing, suffocation... There were a few times I didn't do those kind of methods, yet I survived I guess.

But then I watched something...and for some reason a specific non-regrettable method crossed my mind. I'm not sure I can say what it is due to sub rules, but And I haven't been able to get it out of my head since that day. For once it was actually terrifying to think about, there is no room for second-thoughts, you're dead a second later. I want to chase that thought.

Sometime soon I'll finally just do it, and I won't have to worry about second thoughts or mistakes, because by the time I realize it I'll be dead. I'm glad I finally found a way out, and this time I won't mess up.
