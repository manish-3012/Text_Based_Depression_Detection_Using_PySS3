I failed.My mom suggested she regretted raising me. I attempted to suffocate myself and failed. My best friend died in February and I made a promise to him and one other that I wouldn't go but here I am. I broke their promise. I failed as a person. I failed at ending my failure. I failed at everything. I want to die but I even fail at that.
