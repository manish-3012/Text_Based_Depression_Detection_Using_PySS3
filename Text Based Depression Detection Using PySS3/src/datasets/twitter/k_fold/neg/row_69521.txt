a girl i kind of knew killed herself, all i can feel is jealousyi met her once or twice at a party, people i know knows her a lot better than i do, she part of a different circle. 

i feel effected by her death and iâ€™m sorry for her family but iâ€™m mostly just triggered by it. i just keep thinking i could have been her if i had the balls.

everyone, even people that never knew her at saying how sorry they are, and iâ€™m jealous that she got out. she got away and did what iâ€™ve wanted to do for so long.

i feel like a terrible person for thinking this as itâ€™s so sad - she was only 17 and iâ€™m just jealous. ugh
