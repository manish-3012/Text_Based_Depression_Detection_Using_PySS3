Im abandonedIt feels like my closest friend has been so distant for over a month now. I tried so hard to be a good friend. I knew I couldn't keep venting at them, so I've been finding another way to cope. It was working. Things were getting better, I was feeling better. And now I'm here, because I feel so alone. They just don't seem interested in me anymore... I swallowed some things out of frustration, but it probably won't do anything. I can't do this alone, and that's exactly where I am right now. I feel like I'm on my way out.
