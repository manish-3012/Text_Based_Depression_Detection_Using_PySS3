What's the point?My life is pretty okay i guess. I'm just stressed out all the time. I'm never happy. I don't like anything that I do. I don't want to study, I don't want to work, I don't want to do anything. It would just be easier to die instead of dealing with all this crap.

What's the point? I've tried talking to people about this before, and they all act like I should want to live. They act like my life is somehow important or it means anything.

I'm sure if I died, some people would be very sad. That's true of anyone. But after a few weeks/months/years, nobody would care any more. Sure it woulds still be sad, but nobody is torn up anymore.

I don't think there's any point in life. I'm not religious so I guess that's part of it. But I don't see humans or any living thing as special -- we're no different than a pile of rocks. I see life as just another feature of the universe. Just like stars and oceans and mountains and rocks are all "things" in this universe, so too are people. We're just "things" made of atoms like everything else. So it doesn't make a single bit of difference if I died. So what's the point of feeling like shit all the time?
