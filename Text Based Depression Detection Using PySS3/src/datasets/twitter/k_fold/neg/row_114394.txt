I don't know what to sayFirst time reddit poster here a little background on me. I have tried to commit suicide twice before(hanging and alcohol) and I am currently on Fluoxetine. 

I just wanted to run a few ideas by you guys/girls. Why do we keep fighting? For every good day we have there is always alittle part of our brains that wonders when suicide will start to make sense again.

One thing that has always stuck with me, after each failed attempt. Why I am biologically unable to feel happiness and why do I fight so hard to feel something I was never met to feel. Why not just give in?

Secondly why is it so hard to do ? I mean finally committing the act. Your brain basically cannot feel happiness anymore but it still clings to life for some strange reason. I always found that interesting.
