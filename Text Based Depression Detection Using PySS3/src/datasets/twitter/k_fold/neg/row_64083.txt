Can you please help this person? his reddit id is PM_me_your_buildsFrom this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4d7izd/giving_away_pc/ . This person wants to get rid of their pc, and then commit suicide. his account was created minutes ago, and i think that means he wants to do it quick. he has also posted on hardware swap, and has said in one of his posts on that he is under 18, so i think this is puberty related suicide thoughts. Thank you.
