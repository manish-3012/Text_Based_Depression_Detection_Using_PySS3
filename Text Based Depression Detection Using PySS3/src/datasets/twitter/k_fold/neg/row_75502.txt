i am confusedi dont understand why im this way. i shouldnt want to kill myself, i have everything. being the first of my generation in my family ive always been loved. at school i do great, getting top scores all across the board. i have so many friend groups that are all different and great. i even have a few girls that like me (its a shame i dont want a relationship).

everything in my life is going well. but i still feel pain. despite the vast number of friends and family i have i feel all alone. despite all the love i receive i feel uncared for. despite all of my great scores i feel like a faliure.

i dont get it. i just want the pain to stop. every day i think about killing myself but i can never follow through when im right there.

i know seeing someone would help but idk who. i cant go to the doctors because my parents would know and i dont want to tell my school because it'll get out.
