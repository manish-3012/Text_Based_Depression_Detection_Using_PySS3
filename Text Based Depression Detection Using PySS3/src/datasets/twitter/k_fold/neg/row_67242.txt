It doesn't make any sense to meI have received 3 job rejections today, in the middle of a date, who at the end also rejected me. I have been rejected from every job interview I've had since August 2019. I am watching my life savings evaporate in front of my eyes, as well as my major source of identity (career). The more I think about it, the more I wonder why I am even bothering? I am basically a mass of cells and DNA that justs exists because of randomization and because my parents decided they wanted to create a human. Now I am forced to live this life that I dont want to live where I am expected to work 40-60 hrs a week doing menial tasks to make someone else rich. I cant partake in the activities that feed my soul because you need money to do so and Ive been unemployed for 10 months. I dont want to live this life. I dont want kids. A partner is neither here nor there. Why should I feel guilty about ending an existence that I didn't even ask for just because other people will feel bad? I should feel unfulfilled my whole life just so others feel better? The more I think about it the more enraged I get. Anyways, rant over. Thank you for listening.
