i'm basically out of moneyi don't even know where to start. i'm 20 and i've had 4 jobs my whole life. all of which i've quit on the spot by not showing up because suicide was interfering way too much with my life and thought i needed a break or a better job. well i quit my recent job almost 2 weeks ago and i'm running out of money. i get paid today for working 2 days so it's gonna be like 100 bucks maybe, and i have like 160 in my bank as of now, but my car payment is also today which is 160 dollars. my phone bill is next week and that's 50 bucks. i live at my moms and pay 200 bucks a month and the beginning of each month and i clearly won't have enough, plus i just got car insurance on my car and that's in the hundreds. like i'm out of money idk what to do. my mom keeps asking me if i've been applying to jobs but i like refuse to work because i just can't stand it and i know i'm going to kill myself eventually so why not do it soon. idk i'm just not meant for this world and i'm at a loss for words right now. i have my suicide planned out within the next week so idk hopefully i pull through with it because i'm tired of having to worry about what i'm going to do and people bugging me about being a piece of shit who just sits in his room all day.
