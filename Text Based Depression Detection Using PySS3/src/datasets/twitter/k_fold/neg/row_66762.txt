Fuck thinking about other peopleWhy should I care about how other people react to my death when they never cared about me? The only reason suicide is taboo is because society doesn't want to lose resources. What makes a noble's suicide honorable but a peasant's suicide weak? When I die, I hope it's during most peoples' lunch break so I can land in the middle of a crowded street and remind everyone there the circumstances we exist in.
