I just want my internet back.I really dont have the energy to keep explaining this. Long story short, had a melt down, almost killed myself. spent time in mental facility, bankrupcy, looming eviction once they give the go ahead. Lost my job 8 weeks ago but when I tried for unemployment I found someone had stolen my identity. It still isnt fixed. I have no food, no income, no gas, no internet. I have severe full spectrum adhd with executive disfunction. Which makes dealing with all this even harder for me than most. I'm basically always in an adrenaline rush. I also have depression which us made worse by this situation. All I wanted to do is take a break before I started to rebuild my life and now I cant even do that. Before anyone try's to help me with advice just stop. I've already talked to everyone I could including a congressman, and the governors office. The fraud department is dragging their feet. My therapist needs a therapist due to all this bullshit. This post was originally meant for /r/assistance but for some reason I cant post there. When I'm not distracted those thought and urgues to just fucking end it set it.
