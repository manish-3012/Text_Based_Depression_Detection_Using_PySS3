The last time I was at the brink of committing suicide, I thought of my girlfriend who I could never hurt. I thought of being in her arms. She cheated on me, has broken up with me and less than a week later is in the bed of another guy. Sheâ€™s seeing him again tonight. I canâ€™t bear itI just want this endless relentless pain to fuck end.
