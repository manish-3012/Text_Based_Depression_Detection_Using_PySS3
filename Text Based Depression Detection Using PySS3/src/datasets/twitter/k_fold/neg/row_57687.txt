I canâ€™t do this anymore.Iâ€™m 16 years old. I wake up at 6 am. I get ready for school and leave at 7 am. I go to school until 2:50 pm. At 3 pm I go to my job until 6. I come home at 6:30 and do homework until 1-2 am. i have straight câ€™s in all my classes. i sleep for a few hours and do it again. I spend my saturdayâ€™s doing more homework and working my second job. iâ€™m burnt out. there is no more enjoyment in life. it is too late to drop or switch classes. my mom just got laid off so i cannot shorten my hours. my dad stopped paying child support a few years ago. i approached my mom about working less before she lost her job and she told me i had to keep working because it was good for me. i was depressed before this heavy workload but now i want to kill myself. i donâ€™t go to therapy anymore because of something that happened. my friends donâ€™t donâ€™t invite me to hang out anymore. when i invite them they say theyâ€™re busy but they post on social media them hanging out together without me. i want to lay down in my bed and sleep and not go to school or work. i am so tired i donâ€™t wanna live anymore. i tried my hardest &amp; nothing worked out.
