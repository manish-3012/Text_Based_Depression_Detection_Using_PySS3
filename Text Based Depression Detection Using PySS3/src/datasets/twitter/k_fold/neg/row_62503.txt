does mixing alcohol with OTC sleeping pills make death more likely?I know that itâ€™s really hard (ie; almost impossible) to overdose on over-the-counter sleeping pills alone, but what about when combined with alcohol? Does that make your chance of death a lot higher? Or is it still pretty ineffective?
