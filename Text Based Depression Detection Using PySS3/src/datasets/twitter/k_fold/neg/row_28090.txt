I want to run away from meI hate the fact that I canâ€™t reach my expectations
I hate that I donâ€™t have any talents or passions.


Iâ€™m not a genius or a prodigy or a successful entrepeneur. Since Iâ€™ve not already become world famous or gotten a nobel prize, I will never become truly successful.


If I left today the world will move on tomorrow with no traces of me because I donâ€™t have any impact; Iâ€™m simply a ghost patiently waiting for the afterlife to swallow me whole. Most people say that young people (16 yos) like me have only started our lives, and that Â«life will only get  harder from hereÂ» so we shouldnâ€™t complain. I know. I know. Thatâ€™s why I want to run away from myself; I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about adult life. If I canâ€™t handle how things have been, I obviously  wouldnâ€™t survive adulthood. Itâ€™s not like I would do anything with my life as an adult. In fact, I donâ€™t think everyoneâ€™s suited for becoming an adult. Some are left behind. You just donâ€™t see them around because they donâ€™t make it.



For some reason I can see that most people have something they excel at, but I have searched within myself and returned empty-handed. 


Â«Life is a big lottery game where only the winners are visibleÂ». Well if Iâ€™m such a winner, why am I stuck in this terrible form paired with such a hideous mind? Youâ€™d think that with so many variables I couldâ€™ve easily been born with a gift or two in my palms. Thatâ€™s sadly not how it works. How unlucky did I have to be to be born like this, especially with a mind that doesnâ€™t appreciate anything? I hate myself. I want to punish myself for being like this. I hate it with a burning passion (hah). I hate it.


I hate that out of all of the people in this world
I had to be me.
