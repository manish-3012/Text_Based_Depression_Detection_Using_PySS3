Hanging myself this morningI cant take it anymore. Everywhere i go i feel like i dont belong. This anxiety has been following me around since i was 6 years old and the moment i open up to my parents about it they look at my like im a nut case. Im 21 now i have had enough of sitting around and watching everyone else enjoy life while i sit in the corner fantasizing about killing myself. Therapy has done nothing. My parents think im a failure and a nut job. I dont even know why im on this earth. I have considered killing myself since i was 8 and now i have finally had enouft of being treated like a sub human born with this painful disease. People day to rationalize my reason for life but i have been doing that foe years and things have only gotten worse. My life is a living hell hopefully on the other side god takes pitty on me. I just cant do this anymore.
