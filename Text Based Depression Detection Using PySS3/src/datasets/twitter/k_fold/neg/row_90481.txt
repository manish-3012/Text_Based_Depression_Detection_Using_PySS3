My brother was alone, and he killed himself. He hadn't had a girlfriend in five years and was severly depressed. This is my story.It's a strange thing mourning someone who is still alive. And a stranger thing mourning someone who is dead. I sit in a fancy new condo, typing on a fancy new keyboard. It's a beautiful day outside, a rare fall day so common in stories and so rare in real life. I guess I shoud start this story off at the beginning, the morning of the defining moment of my life.

I had broken up with my girlfriend Summer. We dated and were in love for about seven months, the month of June was very hard for us. We were both unemployed, and I was getting severly depressed. I was her only friend, and I was tired of being attached at the hip. I took it out on her, and I was not kind. She ended up being unfaithful to me, I was not suprised. We did not speak for a week. I was working at a bar near her house, and missed her terribly every night. Crying on my way home, the whole nine yards. 

I called her after five days of silence, and she picked up the phone. We spoke of how great things were in the past, and I ended up sleeping at her apartment that night. And the next four nights. I started missing my dog, and on Sunday September 3rd we both slept at my house. The fifth night sleeping together in a row. 

I woke up to the sound of my brother coming home. He hated Summer, so I got up and closed my door. I just wanted to avoid him bitching at me for "taking her back" or having her over. Because she did basically cheat on me. I love her and am a creature of lust, I have no other excuse. 

I went back to sleep after shutting my door, and everything was peaceful. I breifly woke up to the sound of something heavy falling. I assumed it was my dog knocking something over, and I did not get up to check. That is the biggest regret of my 25 years on this earth. I went back to sleep, woke up at noon to Summer pressed up against me. We made love and layed in bed, everything was right in the world and I was happy. 

I finally got up to satify Summer's insisting she was thirsty and needed a glass of water. I got up and walked into the hallway. I saw something on the floor, red and sticky. My dog mishka had an infection in her paw the week before, and I immedietly thought she was bleeding again. I yelled her name, then the realization of what it was hit me like a lightning bolt. I turned to my left and screamed my brothers name. 

I turned the doorknob, but could not open the door. Something heavy was blocking it. I put my shoulder into it and finally got it open. I already knew what happened in my heart. I was scared to open that door, the most terrifying moment I can recall. I couldn't get it open, something was blocking it. Laying infront of it. I looked down and saw my brothers legs and his shoes. I shoved him to the side with the door and got my head into it. I looked to my left and I saw him lying there. In the corner, his left arm curled up, his mouth open in an O of suprise. His eyes were open and I knew he was dead. I screamed for Summer to call 911 and left the room. She didnt respond. 

I callewd 911 and told them I think my brother killed himself. From the way he was twisted up, I thought it might be an overdose. I went outside to smoke a cigarette and put my dog away, she hates strangers. I went back inside and went back to his room, once again shoving his legs out of the way. I looked down at my brothers corpse and couldn't believe it. I felt no pain, I felt nothing. This husk of a body belonged to my oldest friend. I don't know life without David, he was 2 years my senior. Where did he go when he left his body behind? I noticed the bullet hole in the door and went back into the living room.

When I walked back my door was open and a police officer was in my home. With a gun drawn. He asked me where the body was and I told him. I sat on the couch, I felt nothing. I recall Summer sitting next to me, I'm not sure what we said to each other. I had no tears for my brother, I had no empathy, I had no heart. I was not a person that morning, I was a robot. I wore a mask for the police officers suspicious looks, one of horror and sadness. But I felt nothing.

I vaguely recall them questioning us, asking if there was anything they needed to know. Davids room looked like a crime scene, it was so trashed. I informed them that was just how he lived, and Summer backed me up. I was so worried and focused on the ectasy I bought the night before, and was sitting in a cigarette pack on my sink. I was terrified the police would find it and put me in jail. I am 25 years old and have served close to sixteen months incarerated. I turned 21 in isolation, celebrating my coming of age with a coughdrop and a shackled shower. I did not want to go back. It was only later on that I realized that were questining me to ask if my brothers suicide was actually a murder.

I left them in my bedroom and went into the kitchen, lighting up a cigarette and pacing. A police officer shadowed me, and then asked me where my mother lived and how I wanted to inform her. I looked at them and suddenly I was terribly human. I was no longer a robot wearing a mask. I was Nathan Christopher DeMott, and I had woken up to find my brothers body. I screamed at the officer "What do I do?" He told me he could drive over to tell my mother, and I agreed. I was a human again, and the world was a terrible place. My oldest friend was dead by his own hand, and I knew I had to tell my father. 

Summer was sitting on the couch, talking to the police officer that was watching her. Young and goodlooking, she was flirting. I looked at the older officer and asked if my brother was dead. He looked me in the eyes and noded his head. I was grateful for that. Summer kepe talking to the other one, telling him where she worked and how she liked it. Whatever, I always knew what it was. I walked onto my backporch and dialed my fathers phone number. David and him hadnt spoken in close to five years. I wont get into specifics, but he was not a good father. He picked up the phone and asked me what was up. I told him his oldest son had killed himself. He was at work, and told me he would be there as soon as he could. My mother called me, and told me how sorry she was. Over and over, she was so terribly sorry. She had immedietly shouldered my brothers suicide, adding that to the cross she carried. Her most important job was to protect her children, and she had failed. I heard it in her voice. I hung up the phone, put out my cigarette and collapsed. Sobs close to seizures siezed me. My heart was being stabbed by a butcher knife, and I was defenseless. I cried until I dry heaved, and finally went back inside. I sat on the couch, becoming a robot again. People talked around me, Summer talked to me. Speaking in a foreign language of I'm sorrys and do you need a priest. I understood their words and sylabbus but their setences did not make since to me. I looked at my hands and waited. I waited for my mother to come to my house, and make everything alright, like she always had. 

When her car pulled up I walked onto nthe porch. The police had already told her David was dead. She couldn't seem to make it past the porch, vehemetly denying that she had failed her son. She collapsed, screaming  "Thats my son, he was my son" over and over again. I silently reprimanded her for being so dramatic infront of strangers. My DeMott upringing coming to the forfront to judge a woman confronted with her sons suicide. What a great family we are. 

My world was loud, people in my home talking. Faces I knew but couldnt recognize. I was in a daze, as if I had just woken up. Everyone was looking at me while they spoke, but I could not understand what theyre words were.
