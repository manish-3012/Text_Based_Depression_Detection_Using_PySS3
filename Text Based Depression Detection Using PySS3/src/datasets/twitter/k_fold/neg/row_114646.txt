I feel depressed again and I don't know what to do.Friday is here again and it makes me realizse I'm lonely af and have nothing to do but go on the wifi all day. I cant get out of this cycle and I just keep on getting depressed from it. I hate being lonely i cant cope. I feel like drinking is the only solution to let it go. What other choice do I have? Be isolated with my thoughts?
