My last confession... everything that I should admitted to myself years agoIâ€™m a dork. 
Iâ€™m lazy. 
Iâ€™m arrogant. 
Iâ€™m a petty thief. 
I smoke when Iâ€™m broke. 
Iâ€™m too trusting.
Iâ€™m too childish.
Iâ€™m spineless.
Iâ€™m ugly by my own hands. I could be handsome with constant maintenance, but Iâ€™m too lazy.
Iâ€™m prideful.
Iâ€™m a fool.
Iâ€™m smart enough to be creative, but too stupid to turn it into profit.
I donâ€™t speak up when I need help.
I have wasted resources and creditability.
Iâ€™m so stupid, I canâ€™t even decide if I truly believe in a deity or religion.
I canâ€™t commit to anything.
I never took my ADHD seriously and know am a less developed human.
I took out thousands and student loans and have the nerve to be picky with the few job opportunities I come across.
I donâ€™t take advantage of the help Iâ€™m offered because I feel that theyâ€™ll realize Iâ€™m a waste of energy and time.
Iâ€™ve disappointed everyone who truly loved me.
I wonâ€™t even apologize for my actions, because I know that Iâ€™ll never grow out of myself.
