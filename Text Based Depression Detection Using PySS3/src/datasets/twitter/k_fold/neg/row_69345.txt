Talking is beyond impossibleNo matter what I do, this depression feels more and more like a cage. The bars are wide enough to just *barely* squeeze through, but I still can't move. I can't bring myself to.

I know why I feel like this, but I still can't breathe. I don't know how to talk about it. No words come out. Only thoughts. If I told my friends, would they comfort me? Or would I become a burden to them? How do I even mention it? It's so heavy to begin with. 

It feels like I'm starved for attention, but at the same time I don't want it. It terrifies me. I'm scared of it. 

Of the reactions. Of maybe overwhelming the people I love with the mess I'm in. Of maybe causing them to dread every ping they get from me. 

I don't know where to even *begin* on what to expect if I brought myself to actually talk. I wouldn't know how to react if someone else confided in me about their own problems.
