every time i wake up i crave the gravei donâ€™t want to wake up. when i try to escape reality and get some sleep, sleep paralysis and nightmares wonâ€™t leave me alone. meds donâ€™t work. sometimes i just donâ€™t want this anymore but i canâ€™t bear to leave my only loved one alone in this world. i hope things get better for all of us.
