Pop goes the weaselIn the last four months I don't recognize the decrepit person in the mirror anymore.  I've lost my girl, my job, and I've most likely damaged my ability to ever finish my bachelor's degree - so this most likely means I've dropped out of school.

After my ex broke up with me, I've slowly descended into a person I don't recognize.  In truth, the person I don't recognize reared their head just before my ex broke up with me; she probably saw it too.  Regardless, I haven't been able to function properly since.  It's not to say the break up drove me to the cliff I'm on now, rather it was a detour to where I knew I'd eventually end up.  After she dropped me off on her detour through my life, I find myself looking over where I knew I'd always end up.  However, It'd be a lie to say it didn't underpin my self destructive behavior.

I bought a gun a couple weeks ago with the intention of shooting for recreation, but boy what a bold lie that turned out to be.  In any case, I don't imagine I'll be around much longer.
