My friends mum is preventing him from getting helpI really don't know what to do. My friend is in a constant loop if edging closer and closer to suicide. He has called hotlines, talked with school councillors, literally been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and possibly bipolar but his mum is in denial. He has begged her to take him to get help. He has been hospitalised for attempted suicide. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. The adults in my life seem to not fully understand the situation. My other friend has reportedly stayed up all night on multiple occasions to try and help. Is there some way I can help?
