66 daysHalloween is my deadline, I'm not sure why I picked that. It seemed far enough away to give myself time to fix things but close enough to not be forgotten. 

I had something perfect and I ruined it because I wasn't good enough for him. I hope I can make myself good enough. I would do anything for this man. I dreamed of a future with him and he seemed excited about it too. He told me he's never met a girl like me before.

 I am scared to die but ready to do it if things don't work out. I would rather have an eternity of nothing, or Hell, or whatever comes after death than continue living in this world knowing I can't have him. This is my first boyfriend, my first breakup, and it will be my last breakup no matter what. 

I lost 30 pounds since we broke up a month ago. I don't do anything except exercise and work and lie in bed and sob and think of him and think of how good it will feel to have him want me back. 

I don't know what I want from this sub. Do you think theres a chance he will take me back? Do you think he will forget about me? What is a method of suicide that will leave my body looking like I'm just sleeping? I don't want to hurt whoever finds me more than I know it will. I don't want anyone to have to scrape me off of a wall. 

This is just rambling and venting. If anyone has any advice for any of the questions I asked I would appreciate them a lot. 

Thank you
