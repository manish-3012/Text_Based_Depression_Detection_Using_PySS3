Suicide in the gaming communityIdk why Iâ€™m writing this but all the recent deaths in the gaming community just hits me so hard. I was pretty suicidal like 2 years ago and still think about it from time to time. And then these people that I look up to and that hold my passion are just gone because they just canâ€™t handle it all anymore. I keep thinking that while Iâ€™m doing my daily activities theyâ€™re just gone forever. Thanks for listening to my tiny rant. This problem needs to be addressed before many more decide that itâ€™s not worth it anymore. Rest In Peace all
