Being in a relationship.I attempted and was put in a hospital. Now I'm too scared to kill myself because I need to succeed next time. I get worse everyday so it's only a matter of time. One of the reasons I feel terrible is being in my relationship. I feel selfish. How do people date when they're suicidal and not feel selfish? I've had guys get to the point of "I love you" and I end it. But I don't want to play with their hearts. But I can't be without someone because I'm even worse off.
