I am done.That's it guys, I'm doing it soon. I'm finally ending it all. I don't even want to go to therapy or see my psychiatrist, I just want to die. I don't want to get better and live.
My birthday was the 1st of December, and that night I felt "this is the year I'll die". I just felt it in my heart. 
There's only one thing I want to do before killing myself and it's seeing the person I love the most. 
I'll leave her tons of letters I've been writing. 
I don't know if she cares that much about me, I hope she does. I really hope she does.
I know that there is no afterlife. Everything just ceases to exist. And I'm super ok with that. 
Thanks for reading.

Julian.
