When Will It End?I am so tired of waking up and feeling so empty and lonely. Some days I just wonder what I did to deserve this life. I pray for God to come and take me everyday. 

I canâ€™t even see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore, just more loneliness and pain. Just more days spent crying in bed, holding sheets to my mouth to muffle the sounds of pure agony and sadness.

Iâ€™m sick of being in pain. I hope for happiness, but wonder if I even deserve a happy ending anymore.

I find myself often searching for the purpose that God put me on this earth for. I love to make others feel happy and cared for because I would hate for anyone else to feel the way I do every single day.

I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do this.
