I fantasize about dying all the timeI think the only reason i haven't gone through with killing myself is because i know it would hurt my family.

But i fantasize about being killed. Getting murdered or dying in some kind of accident. For some reason it feels like if i died in any way other than suicide, it wouldn't affect my family the same.

I don't have any money but if i did I might do enough drugs to make it seem like an accidental overdose. I can't fuckin stand myself. I'm depressed and anxious all the time. I'm unemployed and my body is breaking down. I'm fighting addiction and i can never sleep. I'm a pathetic loser in every sense of the word.

I really hope something tragic happens to me.
