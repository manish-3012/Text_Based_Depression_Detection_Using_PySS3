Just can't do it anymore...Last year around this time I found my wife was having a string of affairs, which led to a divorce. A month later I lost my job due to being distracted and now nobody will hire me. A few months later my most loyal companion, my dog passed away suddenly from cancer and I watched her take her last breath. 

Bills are piling up, every holiday being alone just feels even shittier, I don't even want to be around for Christmas this year, Thanksgiving was rough enough. I don't want to spend it alone, not even sure if I'll make it till then anyway. I'm at rock bottom and I see no light at the end of the tunnel, just more darkness that awaits me. I tried to be a good person, but seems it's not enough in this life anymore, I'm just tired...
