It's 1 amAs the title  says, it's currently 1 am, and I'm laying awake in my bed with suicidal thoughts. I've been talking with my friends in a gc about some misc topics or whatever, but I can't bring myself to worry them with this.
I don't even know what I'm meant to write here, so I guess I'll write out why I'm feeling suicidal:
I've won the genetic lottery of ending up being trans with crippling gender dysphoria. Currently I'm just unable to find a position where I can sleep in because feeling the touch my own body makes me cry. 

I know that I will be able to transition eventually, I'm only 16 after all, but it is just so far away, the wait feels like hell. I'm also terribly lonely, not in terms of friends, but a romantic partner. It's another thing that isn't even on the horizon for me. Not even entirely because I'm trans, no one would settle for me even if I weren't.
