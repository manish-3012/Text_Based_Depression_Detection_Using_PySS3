Why is suicide so hard if what comes after doesn't matter?As someone that contemplates their life on a daily basis and is living in one big existential crisis, I can't figure out why I would care about how my family would feel if I commited suicide. If there is nothing after, then why does it matter? It's not like I'll see them suffer without me. It won't matter. My brain would be dead and feelings of regret wouldn't exist.

Mom, Dad, I'm sorry that the day will come that you both have to live the rest of your life thinking about me.
