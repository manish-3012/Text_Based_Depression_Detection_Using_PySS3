I held a gun to my headLast week my girlfriend left me. I made a horrible mistake and hurt her. She left the house and stayed with her brother while she needed time to think. A few days ago I sat on my bed after breaking down and grabbed my pistol. I pressed it against my head as hard as I could for a minute and didnâ€™t feel anything. Maybe it was because it wasnâ€™t loaded? So I cocked it and held it there again with my finger on the trigger. Still, I felt nothing. No emotions or sadness. I wasnâ€™t even afraid either. I always imagined this scenario but I imagined it quite different. I expected to be terrified; to burst out into tears with my hand trembling. For whatever reason, this wasnâ€™t how it went. What I felt was comfort. It felt like this made sense and I was finally ready to go. It just felt right to be in this position. I could have easily pulled the trigger there and been done with it. Instead, I waited to see if I had a chance to get the love of my life back. While she was away, she told me things such as â€œIâ€™m not giving up on youâ€ and â€œI love youâ€. I really thought we were going to make it through this. Today, she ended it for good and moved all of her belongings out of my house while I was at work. All I can think about is how comfortable that gun felt against my head. I think Iâ€™m ready. I think itâ€™s my time. I tired of being alone and being a fuck up. I am ready.
