Think Iâ€™m readyI think Iâ€™m finally ready to just get it over with. Iâ€™ve wanted to for so long but never had the means to go about it. I think this is the week. Maybe even tonight. I have no reason to stay anymore. I tried to help but never could do enough.  Itâ€™s a weird feeling now that I can do it. Iâ€™m the calmest Iâ€™ve been in a year. But overall Iâ€™m feel worse.
