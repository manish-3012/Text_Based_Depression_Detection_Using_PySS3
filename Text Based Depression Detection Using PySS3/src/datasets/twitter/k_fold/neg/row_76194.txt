I was doing so goodThis is a throwaway,  btw. 

On Christmas Day I received wonderful news. I wonâ€™t bore you with the whole story but I finally get to change schools.

I was ecstatic for a solid two weeks. Before that, I was highly suicidal, depressed and barely took care of myself. Barely talked to anyone. I had written notes and had seriously planned killing myself multiple times. Told my family I needed a psych ward, was denied it: I was planning on doing it on the 30th. Needless to say it came in at the right time.

I donâ€™t know what happened. I just sunk back into my hole. Iâ€™m ashamed. Everyone thought I would be ok. I thought I would be ok. But now, it looks like a great option.  It just happened so fast. I donâ€™t know why I allowed myself to get this bad again. Its like its the only thing I know and the only thing I should know. Is this all there is? I cant imagine myself at my new school anymore. I donâ€™t want to talk about it to anyone I know. Its embarrassing. Cant I be satisfied?
Everythingâ€™s numb again.

Iâ€™m starting to think I might have bipolar disorder. Iâ€™m acting erratic and Iâ€™m scaring myself. I wonder if I just wasnâ€™t meant to be here at all.
