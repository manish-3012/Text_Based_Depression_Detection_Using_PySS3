A cry for help. Please talk me through this. I cant take itI didnt want to post here but I'm doing really badly. I dont want to be alone right through this. I'm too scared of what I'll do.

I need someone to talk to me because my relationship just ended and a bunch of stuff happened to make it worse. I'll explain it to you, just message me if you're serious about it
