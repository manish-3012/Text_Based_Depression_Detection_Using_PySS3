There's no solution.I can wait years and years while suffering every day in my own personal hell, for a future that's proven itself to only get worse. Or I can kill myself and never have any chance of happiness again. And waiting out the first idea, for some magic thing to happen that makes me enjoy living, just makes the second idea more and more appealing over time.

All I do is procrastinate, self harm, or watch videos of people killing themselves to calm myself down. I don't even want help anymore. I thought the psych ward would be the solution because it's the biggest cry for help possible. I was wrong. Now i am really out of options.
