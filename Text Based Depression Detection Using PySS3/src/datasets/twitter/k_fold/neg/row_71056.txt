I really want to help.I really want to help everyone of you, show you that people care - that we are nice. 
Maybe I won't change anything in anyone's circumstances but I'm willing to try. 

I used to feel useless - my family was poor to the point that I wanted to die because maybe they would be better with one less mouth to feed. 
I developed OCD and anxiety, I had constant fear of burglaries to the point that I didn't feel safe in my own home. When I was young, I used to have mental breakdowns when my family tried to make me go out because I was ugly, I was fat and I was a monster. 

Domestic violence was a big thing in my house - I still shake, sweat and I can feel my heart drop whenever I hear loud banging from another room. 

However, there was no one to help me. No one for me to talk to and I had to deal with all of it alone. 

I don't want this for any of you guys. 

I wish I could physically help. I hope in your world there's someone for you to talk to because I know how it feels to have no one. 

Pretending to be okay doesn't work, so I really want to help.
