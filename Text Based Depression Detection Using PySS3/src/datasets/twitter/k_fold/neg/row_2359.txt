My first and hopefully last post in here...I'm going through a bad break-up. I was definitely not perfect throughout the relationship, So I'm not only blaming her, but when we were ending it, she would call me over to fuck, because she was horny. Then she changed her mind and ignored me for weeks and she's not threating to throw out all my things. Material items means nothing to me, but part of what she's throwing out is my deceased Father's things that were sent to me when he died last year. His notebooks and pictures and many other things. I've asked for them a few weeks ago, but she was ignoring me, but now she wants it out. I really don't know how to deal with this. I feel like if I kill myself, she would feel terrible, but I also have people I don't want to leave behind. I know this is only reddit, but Anything could help at this point.
