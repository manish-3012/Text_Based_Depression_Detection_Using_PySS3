Fuck this...I never imagined Iâ€™d end up here under these circumstances. I always imagined that things would end up more poetic than this. All I know is that no one ever cared for me and if they did theyâ€™re dead or never existed. Fuck this existence. I just wish Iâ€™d never been born to experience such immense pain. I hope I can work up the courage by tomorrow. Thanks for nothing.
