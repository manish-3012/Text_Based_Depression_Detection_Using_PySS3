It feels inevitableEvery road looks like it leads to suicide nowadays. I've tried tgerapy, meds, everything I can to get better but I still just sink deeper. Like I'm an untreatable case. And I think there's a part of me now that's accepting it. That no matter what I do, my premature death is the only way this is gonna end. I come a bit closer each day, and I know it's only a matter of time. My desire for an end is gonna outweigh my guilt over how much it'll hurt the people I care about sooner or later. I know it's selfish. But I'll stop caring about it eventually
