Don't want to die, but also don't want to liveI'm desperate. Don't know what to do anymore. 
I planned on ending my life tomorrow but chickened out and changed it to Friday. I feel like I'll end up posting that too. 
I tell myself that maybe I should keep going on, to be strong. But then I remember all the bullshit life comes with and it makes me want to die. Even when things were great, at times I still had this feeling, not sure how to explain I just didn't want to exist. 
So there isn't hope for everyone.
