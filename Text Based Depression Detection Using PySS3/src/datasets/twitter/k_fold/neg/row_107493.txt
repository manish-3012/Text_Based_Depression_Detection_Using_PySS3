I hate this feelingI donâ€™t know if I can do it anymore. Iâ€™m living a lie with my family. I do not love my wife of 8 years like she does me, I never have. My one true love is my high school sweetheart. Her name is Chesney and she has always been my other half. When our relationship ended I was okay with it at the time. After she started dating her current husband a few months later, thatâ€™s when I knew that I had lost her forever. Even though I was dating my wife at this time, I still felt that it was the end on that. Over the next several years I made decisions that should have been thought through first. These include joining the Army to get away from my life and buying materialistic things and putting myself in debt to fill a void. I avoided Chesney everywhere I went for the past 8 years because I new that I couldnâ€™t handle speaking to her. Right before my father passed away from alcoholism last year, I started speaking to her again. It was like God knew that I needed it. But just as quick as it started, it ended. My wife found out and gave me an ultimatum. She said be with her and get out or stay. I chose to stay because of my kids. Itâ€™s not fair for anyone that needs my presence to be happy. After all of these years though, Chesney has still been in love with me but itâ€™s like we canâ€™t act on it. I have never physically cheated on my wife but I can say that I have mentally cheated on her. I know that after time, the decision that I make would work itself out. I just canâ€™t get my self to make it. My wife is a wonderful person that deserves every bit of happiness that she can get. I just canâ€™t give it to her. I am currently deployed to Africa and I told her last week that I have to talk to Chesney in order to get through the day. I just canâ€™t live like this anymore.
