Ocean Suicide vs SDCCI want to swim until I can't ...  I am fine with becoming a part of an ecosystem.  That makes me more useful than I've been the last decade of my life.  I don't know how I'll get there. My abuser is extremely, intensely controlling.  

I have a 4day badge to SDCC &amp; you have no idea how badly I wish I could be there instead of painfully submitting to death. I kept planning, pretending something would work out.  Things just kept getting worse for me.

I can't stand to live through another thing I was supposed to do but never did; I am finished being at the mercy of someone else's severe mental illness.  I am never getting out of this situation.  There is no help &amp; that leaves no hope.

It sounds so trivial, "dumbass kills themself because they can't go to comic Con." That isn't it, though, it's that I haven't used a real toilet in weeks.  I haven't had a shower in months. He won't even let me earn $5 to eat.

This is more, "victim of horrific abuse collapses under the crushing weight of another hopeful escape being yanked out of reach." "Victim chooses to walk off of the field instead of playing another forced inning with her abuser."

So, I was crying before but, y'all, my eyes are dry now &amp; not even a lump in my throat.  I had a really good time sometimes &amp; I will be eternally thankful for those experiences.  There isn't a way out of this except to die.  I accept that now.

Peace to each of you.
