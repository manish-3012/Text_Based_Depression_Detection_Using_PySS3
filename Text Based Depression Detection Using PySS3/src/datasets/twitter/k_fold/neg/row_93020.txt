nobody cares im being abused and im tiredmy dad was diagnosed with metastasized cancer this month, my aunt died of brain cancer under a year ago, and my cat who i loved more than anything was killed at 2 years old by a coyote 2 years ago. all of this is just fodder for my ex friend turned abuser and nobody even cares. ive been abused multiple times by people who were supposed to be my friends for half my life, and every single time i got blamed for it and i still do. i feel like i just exist for people to walk all over me and for bad things to happen to me. i'm tired and i can't do it anymore. all i want is for someone to give a shit
