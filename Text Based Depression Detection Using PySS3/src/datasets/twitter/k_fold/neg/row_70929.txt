i'm tired of my acne scars and discolored facefor almost a year now, i have become more and more sensitive about how my skin looks and i can't find a way to get rid of my acne scars and the discoloration on my face in general. it's all i think about and find myself doing everything at the last second because i can't get my mind off how terrible i look. i'm tired of doing research about how to clear my skin. i'm tired of hearing "advice" from ignorant people  that never experienced what i have. i'm tired of the constant anxiety i have whenever i'm around people. i'm tired of being paranoid whenever i am in a room with bright lights because you can see how awful mu skin looks. i'm tired of wishing the whole world was blind so i could have just an ounce of confidence. i'm tired of looking at younger pictures of myself, reminding me of a time where i was happy and had nice skin. i'm tired of thinking about college and my future because i dont want to live anymore. i'm tired of crying every day and the fear of looking in the mirror. i'm tired of seeing my life fall apart and completely lose motivation for anything.
