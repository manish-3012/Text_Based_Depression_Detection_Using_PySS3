Im too numbIm at a strange place in life at 18, where everything just feels pointless. We're all going to die anyways, right? So therefore we should live it up to the best... is what i was told. The thing is now that given my current situation, living it to the best requires an extreme amount of work and effort, one which probably exceeds my lifetime. The joy from living to my fullest potential doesnt outway the amount of pain and effort to reach it. After realizing this, my world just went colorless. Everything black and white. So now im at a crossroad where i can either go through hell and back for a little taste of heaven? Fuck no, not worth it at all. The other option is to rest peacefully, forever, without effort or pain. It just feels logical that i should just rest.
