Friend in needA lot of depressing shit has happened in my life over the last few months but I (20 M) was pretty twisted before then.
I guess I am here because even though it's pretty pathetic I want a friend. I wouldn't want to talk all the time, that might get exhausting but the people I know in the outside world either expect something or cant empathise. 
So yeah. Respond if u feel a similar way about whatever challenges you are facing.
