Everything hurts and Iâ€™ve disappointed EveryoneI have a lot of pain because my ankle and left leg are all messed up. Iâ€™ve been depressed on and off for ten years and eat to deal with it so I am morbidly obese and that makes it worse. I havenâ€™t been able to work and I finally got a job but itâ€™s so painful because itâ€™s standing and walking a lot. I come home hurting so bad and my ankle so swollen.

I told my grandma I want to quit and find a desk job but she will be disappointed in me, she says I can do it I havenâ€™t really tried hard enough or waited long enough.

Everything hurts. Physically it hurts and mentally and emotionally it hurts. I wake up in pain and go to sleep in pain and no one believes how badly I hurt. 

Iâ€™ve been crying a lot the past couple hours. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a year. Iâ€™ve written a few notes but I rip them up and throw them away. I think I want to drive hours away and end it all far away 

Itâ€™s too much pain to carry. I got myself here and I feel like I need to destroy what Iâ€™ve caused
