Why are people constantly getting in our way the moment we ask for help to die?Society is slowly accepting the fact that some people want to leave this aids inducing shithole called life, but still it isn't fast enough.
Keep in mind that I'm not talking about teenagers having some identity crisis or some other gay shit like that. I'm talking about people completely assfucked by the world around them, or in crippling pain, addicted to heavy drugs to ease the burn and left alone to rot. Why can't we have a painless, easy to go suicide available like in Switzerland? I'm gonna have to blow my head off or jump under a train because of this retarded way the people act with us.
It's not that easy to die. The human body is a bitch to kill and a lot of the "safe" way to die available on the net are most of the time trolls, or can end up really ugly in a matter of minutes.

So the only option I have to go is to get completely shitfaced with alcohol and heroin and then to add some extreme, die hard action movie Kurt Cobain kind of move like jumping from a building or something. Thanks m8, that's lovely. 
With some luck someone will record it so all the people on WikiLeaks can have a good wank.

This text isn't to talk about me btw. I have my problems and I'll deal with it, I'm not looking for help to change my mind. Also, sorry for the broken engrish. I just wanna know why you guys seems to enjoy projecting your own opinion about life into others people face when they're just asking for a way to pull the trigger. If it's not a 15y/o kid trying to start a drama maybe you should respect his decision?
