I'm so tired.I am acting like multiple functional human beings with important responsibilities while I am totally fucked in the head. I am exhausted. How am I even managing this? I don't know. Once again I'm out of medicine. Everything is like that image of the dog in the house on fire being all chill. I'm so tired. I wish to disappear.
