I'm going to a funeral tomorrow.Found out the other day that my friend committed suicide and it's been bugging me a lot.

I hadn't seen him in a long time. We were friends in high school when his mom killed herself. He found her. I knew it fucked him up. He went from being this bright, innocent, cheerful person to someone who just got slapped in the face with death and the reality of it all.

I remember all the pills and our friends trying to intervene and how he got better. When you get older, people do their own thing and you drift apart. I knew he was working at a hardware close by and saw him there and we had a really uncomfortable meeting when I went to go buy some spray paint.

I didn't have him on facebook. He sent me a friend request but he had some weird stupid name and I never accepted it and I feel bad about that now, like if I had accepted it, we could have talked and I could have helped.

I don't want to go to a fucking funeral. I want my friend back. I want to go laugh at dragonflies again and tell him it's ok and that people care about him.

I'm sorry the devils got you T.
