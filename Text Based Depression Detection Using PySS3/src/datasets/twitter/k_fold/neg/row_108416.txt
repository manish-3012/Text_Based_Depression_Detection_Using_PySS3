Thinking about how I want to kill myself but don't have the motivation to clean upI want to die, I really do, but I have no motivation to turn on my computer and erase everything. I don't have the motivation to sort my things. I have to clean everything up completely, every time I want to kill myself. But I can't find the motivation right now. Instead I am sitting with my blanket over my head to avoid everything. My ex best friend was my everything. Why do I mess up? I just want everything to be over. I miss him so much. I can't even talk to him or else he'll get worried. I miss him. I'm so tired. I'm dizzy when I sit up. I have no appetite for anything. I have no friends. I am a loser. My family hates me. My birthday's coming up in December and I'll have no one. I'm so sad.
