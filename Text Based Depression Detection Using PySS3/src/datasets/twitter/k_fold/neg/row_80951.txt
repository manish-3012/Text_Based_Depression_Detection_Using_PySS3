all i want is for somebody to hug me and tell me everything's gonna be okayi don't want to say why, but i'm on the fence about whether or not i'm going to run away and kill myself. i have been for a few days and it's getting worse.

i can't cope with anything going on around me right now and i feel like my head's going to explode. i can't cope with this tough love, tell it how it is, attitude people have. it's not the only reason why i'm suicidal but right now it's all i can think about.

i know i'm just being a wimp and i know i can't expect people to care about me or change for me, like how other people have said, but i'm just so tired and exhausted. it makes me feel so fucking weak and alone, which in turn makes me feel really scared and hopeless.

i was raised by people with that attitude, so i should be used to it, but i'm not. i'm really not. i can't stop crying, my chest hurts, my arms and legs hurt from where i've been hurting myself, i don't know what to do.

it's not even the tough love stuff that's a problem for me anymore. sometimes i just want to tell people that i'm upset and talk about stuff for a while without people trying to "correct" me or object to things while i'm talking.

i should ask for help and go to hospital but i can't anymore. i'm too much of a crybaby to deal with everybody's way of thinking and i can't help it. i've tried, but i can't.
