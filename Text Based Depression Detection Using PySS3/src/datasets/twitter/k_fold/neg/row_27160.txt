I don't necessarily want to die, but I feel like I should tryLike...dying is a possible solution, right? It really would solve all my problems. That, and I wouldn't have to live with the pain of getting older and not being where I want to be in my life.

I don't know if I actually have the strength to overcome my problems. I'm so drained by my horrible OCD, and in order to do anything I have to face my OCD. I don't know if I'm just being lazy.

Anyway, I've tried to hang myself. Or, I've at least put a ligature around my neck and leaned into it. I get this immense head pressure and then get freaked out. I don't know if I have the courage to die, either.
