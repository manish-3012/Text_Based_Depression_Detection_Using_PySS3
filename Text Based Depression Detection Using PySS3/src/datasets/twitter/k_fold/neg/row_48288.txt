I wish i didnt constantly wanna fucking die!I hate that im like this! My friend doesn't text: "He hates you." My step mom doesn't pick me up: "Everybodys slowly forgetting about you" I get a bad grade: "Youre a fucking idiot!"  why am i like this?? Everything that i do every day leaves me want to kill myself and i dont understand!!  Why cant i just be a normal girl?? Why does Everything hurt? Im done... I cant handle this anymore... My heart is hurting to the point where it would be better off not beating. And nobody gives a shit.
