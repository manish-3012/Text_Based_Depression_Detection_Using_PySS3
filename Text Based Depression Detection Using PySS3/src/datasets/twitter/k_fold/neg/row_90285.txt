Things just keep getting worse.My grandmother died August 2nd. My cat died August 5th. The only reason that Iâ€™m still alive is to go to an event in December that could very well be cancelled. My grades are plummeting and Iâ€™m afraid that my parents wonâ€™t let me go to the event. Everything makes me upset. My only escape from living is the internet. Iâ€™m afraid that my grandfather will kill himself. Every breath is one that I wish I hadnâ€™t taken. Every time I eat, i eat for comfort. Iâ€™ve gained a lot of weight. I thought that a girl liked me but in reality it was a joke.  I have never been in a relationship and all I want is to feel that love. Every second of my life is painful. I spent all of my money on two birds that fucking hate me but love my mom. All of my family is against me. My friends donâ€™t want to talk to me. I hate my being.
