My best friend tried to kill herself and I donâ€™t know how to feel.I donâ€™t know how to feel. All I know is that Iâ€™m really worried and I want her to be okay. I know what itâ€™s like to have suicidal thoughts and have even tried it myself multiple times, but, why? I just donâ€™t understand. I feel like my shock is fading away and now I want to cry? I feel bad cause this isnâ€™t about me but I honestly kinda blame myself. Iâ€™ve known her for a really long time and weâ€™ve been through a lot of bad stuff together. Iâ€™ve never dealt with something like this. I donâ€™t know if this is normal or if Iâ€™m just been an ass, god feels are so hard to understand sometimes.
