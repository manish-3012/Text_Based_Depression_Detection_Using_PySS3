I just lost almost $3500 on stock trading, and it's very tough for a guy from a second world country to deal with.I did not know that the "stop-loss" function did not protect us during after-market hours. Yesterday, my balance was at +$350, and now it's -$1083.98.  My sister has been recently diagnosed with breast cancer and we are in debt to pay for her treatment. I wanted to make additional money because of it. I was actually getting some profit, until I was completely devastated today. I don't know how to deal with this. I don't know how to tell my father that the $3300 I had somewhere in an internet wallet are now gone. He was relying on this additional money. I don't know how to calm down.
