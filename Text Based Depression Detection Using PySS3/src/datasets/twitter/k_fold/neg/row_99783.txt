No matter what I do, the loneliness never leaves.The voice in my head that tells me how unlovable I am and always will be never goes away.

Even if I'm at college, learning what I want.

Even if I'm playing in front of a whole crowd.

Even if I'm on the best holiday in the most peaceful place.

Even if I'm just trying to do the small things.

No matter what I do, this never goes away. The darkness, the pain,

the fact that I'll never, ever be loved.

It never goes away.

I'm trapped and my gun is my only way out.
