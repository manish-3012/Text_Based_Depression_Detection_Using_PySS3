What if the human soul is finiteSorry for the rambley introspective post but i needed somewhere to get these thoughts out.

What if we have a limit to how much of each of our emotions we can take? Sadness, Joy, Shame? And if we do what if we run out?

What if we have a limit to how much love we can give? Is it possible to run out of love?

My answer is yes.

Let me start with some background. I'm a fairly nerdy guy who is a hopeless romantic. I'm pansexual I've been in 4 relationships (2 female 2 male). All 4 relationships ended with the longest being just over 1 year. That one left me broken the next people i dated was me trying to fill the void she left but i just felt numb. Currently I'm still in the closet. I was embarrassed of what people would think. But today i woke up felt nothing.

I think I've hit the limit.

I think I'm ready to die
