Been suicidal since a child, but have never managed to tell anyoneI didn't get treatment until I was 18. Its all a bit of a joke, the so-called treatment. I'm 32 now and don't get anything, they failed to 'fix' me.

Because of my severe disassociation rapidly worsening I'll be seeing a psychiatrist. When I say 'severe' I mean that I barely existed anymore starting 8 years ago and it only got worse since, its not something that can be explained because it can't otherwise be experienced.

They always ask if you are suicidal, and I say no. I try to explain to them that it is rational for me to die due to the state I'm in and that I can't experience my own life and that this state of mind is the logical response. But I'd never actually do anything.

I have a long history of childhood neglect and psychological and emotional abuse. I always had a deep seated mistrust and fear of adults. Then I became an adult and it was never treated. Telling anyone that you will hurt yourself or anyone else gives them power to breach privacy and tell anyone and have you committed. I would never hurt anyone else. But I do not consider it their right to stop me hurting myself (I never consented to being born).

And there it is, I can't trust anyone enough to tell them how serious this is. Because they can tell other people. They can put me in a psych ward where you are treated like an animal. The whole reason they can't report other crimes (eg social welfare fraud) is because you need to be able to get the help you need which involves disclosing your situation. Its the same damn thing.
