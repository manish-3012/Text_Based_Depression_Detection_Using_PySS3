I've been suicidal for a year. Nothing I do is good enough, and I get closer and closer every month.I know how I would do it. I've practiced. I know what it feels like and I'm prepared. 

I know that everyone would talk shit about me after I die. And I know my husband would be upset for a while. 

I'm just waiting until we get a few paperwork things sorted out.

It's been like this for a year. I've had the worst, hardest last 9 years. Harder than anything the average person on reddit can imagine. About as bad as the average person on suicide watch, but it's been going on for 9 years. 

I've hit an easier patch lately, but nothing i do is good enough. 

I'm going to do it. It's going to be a surprise to people. It will be a shock because people know I'm really religious actually. I don't care if something bad happens to me. 

I've had a more traumatic life than I can cope with. I'm nearly 40 and the mess of my entire life, the physical damage, the emotional damage, the likely *brain* damage that has come from all the trauma I have experienced. It's just too much.

And now i actually see that hte reason my grandmother was such a  crazy, mean, unhinged person was because she bent over backwards to make everything look perfect so my asshole psychiatrist grandfather wouldn't criticize her.

It's like I'm going to die of an inherited illness.

I love my husband, but he's too fucking insensitive and I can't repeat myself with him anymore.

I give up.

I'm not doing anymore for him. 

I have my 'tool' picked out. I know how to do it. It won't be in the house, it will maybe be in a field or something. I've practiced. It feels weird, it takes effort, that's for sure. It just seems right. 

I just can't walk anymore.
