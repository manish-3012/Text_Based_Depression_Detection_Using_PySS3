It's probably nothing, but I needed to say something.So it just turned the new year, and I guess I feel crappy. I lost a girl I had amazing feelings about and all the while I felt led on. Buying her dinner, taking her out places and then we were friends, which is fine, but then she started getting shitty with me.
other problems I've had this year involve me getting a fairly good internship at a magazine, but my dad thinks its a waste of my time and doesn't even recognize what I want to do with my life. (That being writing/editing etc etc)

I also haven't even been kissed in a year (Or anything else) and I know thats not the end of the world but I really feel jaded by people in general. I just want to feel normal and have what other people have, but I also don't feel like I can talk to anyone else. 

I had an awful shift at my fastfood job tonight as well, where everyone else invited people out for new years and then left early leaving me to clean the entire store, and not being invited out. (They wont get fired because the boss just wont fire them)
I'm just kind of done with life you know?

So I'm probably not going to kill myself, but I feel like doing it, and kind of wanted to tell someone how I felt, because I really dont have anyone in my life to approach about this.

Thank you.

Also any errors in spelling etc is due to drinking a fuck ton of whiskey.
