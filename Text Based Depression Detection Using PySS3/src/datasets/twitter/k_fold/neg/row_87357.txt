All out of hopeI have money for one month of rent.  Then I'll less than $100 in my account.  I've (voluntarily, mostly) been out of work for a year and a half.   I had been applying for a few jobs, but really can't get motivated to applying to more.  Two of the jobs I applied for I thought were pretty much a given I'd be hired - they're places that are constantly hiring, and have almost no real experience needed.  I guess the gaps in my employment history make me unemployable.  

Now I realize how screwed up I am in life.  I won't be able to get a job.  If I do, I can see the exact same thing happening as last time - I quit after 6 months, or a year... and stay unemployed for that same amount of time.  I just don't think I can live normally.  When talking with my brother, he's mentioned he sees me as living differently, doing my own thing- and was encourage me to network.  I can't do that.  I rarely socialize.  I almost never meet people.  I have no interest in doing so.  I can't network to get a job.  I can't apply to get a job.  I have no hope of getting a job now.

I don't even know what my problem is.  I know I'm almost out of money, blame myself completely, realize I could be forced to live on the streets or with my parents - giving up my pets in the process.  I still just don't put effort into applying for jobs.  I know I *should be*, but I'm not.  I don't know if it's laziness, apathy, or what.  I keep having to lie to my family to tell them I've been applying when I haven't.  Time's run out.  I don't see any options.  I just don't know what to do.
