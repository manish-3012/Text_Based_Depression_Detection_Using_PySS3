It's me, not you.(This is my third post here today sorry !!!!!!!!!!!!!) 
I guess it has to be me. Everytime I talk to my parents I get in arguments with them because they just annoy the shit out of me. Even when I say "hey you should stop being so jusgemental" which is just me not being an asshole, they mock me. We see a guy with a beard, kind of looking like a mess and they say "he doesn't look like he went to college" so I say....how the fuck would you know...and I got mocked ???? It's so backwards. My mom woke me up to drive her to get cigarettes, but when I would wake her up to ask if I could go out with friends (who would pick me up, I just needed her permission) she would ask why I woke her up....and now my dad expects me to drive over his house whenever, but he never ever drove me anywhere when I couldn't drive...I told him that too and he got so mad, he said "never talk to me again" ...you're really that dramatic you wouldn't talk to your DAUGHTER again because I talked back to you? And now i do it more often and it always ends up with me feeling shitty but I never thought I was in the wrong until I realized I must be. Why else would it be so hard for me to have normal conversations with people? I don't understand my parents at all and I wish they were just....less annoying really, I don't have patience for this. I see my dad like twice a month, I never talk to him, well he never texts me. Yeah the phone works both ways but you're the father.....and He thinks I'm making millions of dollars as a cashier or something and contantly asks me for money...where the fuck do you think I'm getting money from? And why does it take so long to pay me back? You say you're making more than the average American a year so why are you asking your teenager daughter for cash...I can't comprehend....he thinks my life revolves around money and I really don't care but he keeps talking to me about money and how I'm so strict with it...you really don't know me if that's what you think. There's something seriously wrong with him I think. I hate to say it but so many times I question him. I know my reality is a little weird but he's living in another ducking world and I'm so stressed over it. Our relationship feels almost non-existent, it's making it really easy for me to say goodbye. That's awful isn't it? 


People always say "think about how your parents will feel if you killed yourself", I just don't care anymore though, it doesn't feel like they care too much about me. My dad says he wants me to succeed and so does my mom but it's like...you're not helping me at all and I can't do this by myself. Sometimes I think it's all in my head and In there worlds everything is fine so I'm just being dramatic...so If they ever find this or my diary, here's the reality of the situation. It sounds like I'm making it your fault, but it's really my fault my life is so shitty I guess. Sorry
