thoughts and questionswhy can't i stop? why is it so difficult to change? when will i finally realised that the mistakes i make are irreversible?

why am i this dumb? why can't i just do more? why are my circumstances the way they are?

don't get me wrong. im extremely privileged, living a life which millions won't be able to live. why must i waste these resources when all i do is take and take and take and i don't even try giving back. 

the feeling of being a waste of space never goes away, i am loved, i know it, i have friends who care about me, i know it.

then why God? why am i this sad all the time? why does this feeling of guiltiness never leave me? what is my way out?

every day i go on and on and on, utterly exhausted because i have to fit into the standard of a "happy, next door girl". no one knows how broken i feel (yeah i know i sound emo). but it's true isn't it? 

years i have spent convincing myself that everything's alright. 

i plan on going far far away some day, perhaps another realm. 

maybe the someday isn't that far away. 

so welcome redditors into the diary of my last few months, i plan on telling my story to some people at least before i go.

i sincerely hope my story interests you, we are only getting started.
