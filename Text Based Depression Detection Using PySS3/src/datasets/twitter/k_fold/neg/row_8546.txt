I was conceived so give my parents citizenshipMy parents hated each other, it's no secret in the family. I'm the only child born in Usa so was able to petition for them recently.
I've served my purpose, all the while I have a growth next to my ear that gives me headaches, no insurance to get it checked. 
Had to leave a toxic relationship of 3 years recently, she keeps contacting me randomly and it stops me from moving on because i hope things will actually be different.
I can't even leave my room unless its for work or shitty food. 
I just sit in my room and cry. I'm so deep in this pit and just want to sleep my pathetic life away
