Not suicidal but repetitive suicidal thoughtsDamn it. Iâ€™m getting fucking tired. Fucking tired of these negative fucking thoughts in my fucking head. Repetitive suicidal thoughts like shit man itâ€™s so fucking stupid. Brain why the fuck are you thinking these thoughts??? 

I also quit drinking 66 days ago. Iâ€™m feeling hopeless. I feel like checking myself into the hospital just so they can give me antidepressants to help alleviate these stupid fucking negative thoughts man. I hate this feeling man. Iâ€™m tired of feeling depressed. I just want my life back again. Iâ€™m going to therapy and itâ€™s working but for some reason I feel like I am fucking stuck. I hate this feeling man. I donâ€™t want to die. Iâ€™m crying now. I just needed to vent.
