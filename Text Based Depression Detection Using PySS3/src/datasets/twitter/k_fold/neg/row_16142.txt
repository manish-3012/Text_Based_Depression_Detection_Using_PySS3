Totally content indifference - is this a common thing?I've started to seriously consider suicide as an option lately. I wanted to share my state of mind and see if anyone feels this way, because I don't read much of it on here.

On paper my life rules. I'm 28, I'm a good looking dude, my girlfriend is hot as fuck, I make bank, great family, friends, etc.

I am not sad. I am not angry. I'm totally indifferent. Bored even. And if you asked me one thing I wanted to do I wouldn't be able to tell you. I've done everything I wanted to do. I've achieved my goals. But I'm still here. Every day is exactly the same, and I wouldn't change it because I like it, but I'm over it.

Does that even make sense? It's like if you go to Disney world, and it's great. You go on everything, you see all the attractions, and now it's time to go. It's not like you suddenly don't like Disney world. You just have no desire to re ride the rides. The trip is over.

This is how I've felt for years. I've slowly stopped doing everything I've always liked to do because I've taken those things as far as I care to. And now it's like... I need to watch myself get old and die over the next 40 years? Why? I don't want to get married, and I never want kids. There's nothing left to do.

I used to think I was depressed. I tried celexa, Zoloft, wellbutrin, and another I can't remember. I've had a series of sessions with a therapist. It almost seemed like she was at a loss for what to suggest. I think most people who are depressed want change in some area of their lives. I don't. So there really wasn't anything to work towards.

Is anyone else like this?
