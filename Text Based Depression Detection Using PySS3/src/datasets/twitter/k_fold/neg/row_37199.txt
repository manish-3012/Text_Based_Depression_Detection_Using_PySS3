Death &gt; AnythingThat's what I want. Death over anything. It hurts to live.

I'm a lazy fucker, don't earn anything I have and won't be able to work for anything when I move out.

Everybody eventually leaves, the most adamant about keeping me alive ghost after a week, and those that stay refuse to continue talking to me about it.

Nothing matters, everything will die and everybody's name gets uttered for the last time. Nothing lasts, what's the point?

I could probably count about 3 decent people from the dozens horrible I know, and even then they're only decent because it helps them feel better, not because they truly care-humans are incapable.

I don't have anything going for me, I'm always outshined by someone else because I can't do shit.

Why is it so hard to kill myself? Trick question, it's easy but I'm so incompetent that it's hard for me.
