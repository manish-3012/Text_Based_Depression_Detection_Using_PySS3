I broke up with my depressed boyfriend of 7 years, I'm afraid of what he might do - what can I do?I broke up with my boyfriend, we've been together for 7 years. Our lives were taking different turns and it was obvious we didn't have compatible future plans. He has been very depressed for many years and has tried to commit suicide twice in his life. Both times before we ever met. 

I've always had his back despite him being very unloving at times. I became his support system as he has very rough ties with family. He doesn't have many friends, has trouble keeping a job, he has trouble with school and he lacks the motivation for basic things. I never blamed him for it, I blamed his depression. The few moments he had clarity, he would show me what a beautiful person he was. I did NOT leave him *because* he suffers from depression.

But we have no future together, he has other plans. My career will take me across borders while he wants to take over his friend's business. I want to have children, he doesn't. I want to travel and see the world, he wants to settle and doesn't care for other cultures. All in all, we're incompatible.

He wanted to go cold turkey, no contact. He does this when times are tough, he shuts down and pushes everyone away. He won't respond to my messages or my calls, he won't answer the door and his friends haven't seen or heard of him for a few days. I know he's alive, he's still online on social apps sometimes.

I love him but we're better off like this... but I can't handle the thought of him doing something drastic because of me. What can I do? My friends are telling me to let him go, to forget about him but they don't know him like I do. I don't want him to die.
