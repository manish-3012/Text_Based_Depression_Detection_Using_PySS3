I want to die and bring my dog with meLife sucks and I am just over it. My dog is a issue so I know it will be near impossible for someone to take him and if he ends up in a shelter it is too high stress for him. So I have to take him with me. I canâ€™t hurt him so I know I canâ€™t kill him then myself. My biggest fear is something going wrong and one of us live. I donâ€™t know what to do.
