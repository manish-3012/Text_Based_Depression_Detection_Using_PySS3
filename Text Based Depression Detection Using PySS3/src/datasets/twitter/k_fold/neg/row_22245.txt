mentally exhausted.My family, friends, and even girlfriend are making me depressed, i can't take anyone's bullshit, and i came to the point where anything brings me to the edge. I yelled at my gf and i don't even know why, i just felt anger, and then guilt. I came to disgust myself, and no one is helping, i litteraly sent a cry for help to my mom, and she got upset. my father and mother refuse to talk to me. My girlfriend only gives me pity. my bet friend is not talking to me even though i did nothing to him (his gf doesn't like me). I keep trying to make everyone happy and i'm being miserable at the end, i won't do anything to harm myself, but i wish someone would fucking stab or shoot me, i want the sweet release of death. Tired of everyone and everything... i wish i get hit by a car.
