Got some really bad news and now there's no hope. Ending everything soon.Sorry for posting again so recently. I was mutilated by a horrible surgeon who then withheld my medical records from me. He purposefully did this to harm me for spite. I only just recently was able to get them but it's already too late. This is the message I got from the nerve clinic:

As it is over 3 years following your injury, the chance for recovery is close to zero and unfortunately we are not able to assist you.

I have permanent nerve damage now. I really have no hope at all anymore. My last shred of hope was that one day I wouldn't be in pain. I can't live with this. I'm ending it. :(
