pathetic, depressed, n suicidalive attempted before and i was sooo close. now its been a long time and im absolutely miserable on a daily basis. simple tasks seem impossible. i have nightmares and panic attacks frequently. transitioning seems impossible. my mom makes me feel worse. the only thing holding me back is my boyfriend which is such a shitty reason, i know, but right now hes really the only one im actually happy with. at least if i were dead i wouldnt be bothering him with being so depressed. one of the big things that makes me so upset is my bedroom. i havent slept in it in months and my mom gets mad at me for it but she wont offer to help or even listen to why i hate it so much (i feel unsafe with the front facing windows, weirdly shaped, dont want a loft bed). it makes me feel so spoiled but its a big deal in my head. ive started selling my things online that my mom doesnt know about. i just dont know what to do. if it werent for my boyfriend id be dead and somehow that makes me feel worse.
