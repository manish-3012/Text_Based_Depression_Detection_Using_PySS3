I'm suicidal and unmotivated in lifeI dont feel like I have much of a life ahead of me. Aside from my boyfriend who's helped me significantly. If he wasnt passed out right now I'd be talking to him. I have horrible finances, and as a result cant do much. I'm not able to do much job wise right now as I have arthritis at the wonderful age of 19. Right now I'm just doing doordash as I can. I regret living because I'm in so much pain physically and mentally. We live together but I have too much pride to ask him for financial help, even though he'd help me in a heartbeat. I'm just frustrated with everything.
