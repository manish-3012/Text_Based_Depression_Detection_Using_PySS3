Its not everything just the first things that come to mind..Haha I didn't get bullied but I have been depressed since age 13, I was self harming at 13 or 14 and now I'm 16 left highschool failing every single exam, went to college once and never went back haha my parents hate me now and I feel so uncomfortable living at home I also have really bad anxiety and next to no social ques it feels as though my brain has been in a constant fog I'm smoking like 12 cigarettes a day also and I can't get a job because 1. I'm retarded 2. Even if I did I'd spend all my money on weed and no one wants to rent a flat to a 16 year old haha going to kill myself the night my parents kick me out of the house haha. Also I let down my dad since he gave me a job like twice but as I said I'm retarded and lazy or something. It's not like I wanna be lazy but  I just can't tolerate going there. My dad is so angry he will blow up at me all the time. I cried on Christmas lol. I'm not smoking weed everyday at least..
