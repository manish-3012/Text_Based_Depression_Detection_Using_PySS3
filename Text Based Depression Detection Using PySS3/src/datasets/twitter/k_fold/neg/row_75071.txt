so apparently you can be too young to want to dieAlright then, because if i've been too yougn to want to die then what's the age when i can kill myself?
OK 9 is too young because I haven't live the life like all the adults, well then, they must be right, because they're the adults
12 was still too young because "the teen years are the best" and i have to live them
16 is too oyung, well these teen years havent felt like anything very exciting at all
18 is stll apparently invalid because I dont know how rreal life is, I wonder how could it be, if it feels like anything its not like ie felt anything great for the previous years.
Now it's going to be 10 full years in no time and I havent seen things get better, but oh no, how could suicide even be on my mind because Im young

Tomorrow I have to do a presentation for the career I don't really want to study but I dont really have any other options because I dont want any of them, and I havent even prepared the presentation, i had a week and still have few time for it but I still dont feel like doing it. I hate not wanting to do things
