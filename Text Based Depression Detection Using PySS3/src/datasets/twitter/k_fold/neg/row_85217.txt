Just finished writing a scheduled goodbye e-mail letter to my friendI'm tired of this, like I genuinely have no will to live. Everyday seems to get worse and worse. They say there's light at the end of the tunnel, but what if that light turns out to be just a mirage that leads to more and endless suffering? 

I don't want to let my friends down but I have no other choice. What I'm doing is selfish but at this point i couldn't care less, I've scheduled an email letter that's supposed to be sent 3 months from now so its gonna be around Christmas. I want to send the letter to him right now and do it tonight just to get things over with. It feels like I'm slowly drifting away from everyone including myself, I keep on looking for ways to do it without feeling any pain but the best option I've seen so far is hanging myself. After all, that wire rope has been attached to the ceiling since my childhood. It was put there and nevee fixed for a reason. That's destiny.
