Grrrr STILL struggling...OKKKKKKKKKKKKKK. Sorry I am posting yet AGAIN (dammit I hate myself for that) but it is either this or cutting...so I am posting. My hands/wrists hurt like a son of a b right now and my head feels like it is full of static. I will NOT take pills, as in meds (bad bad bad experience with them in the past) and ... things with my daughter this morning were just...weird. Fuck. I feel so broken. I feel like I am lying about feeling so crappy because I can't come up with ONE reason (besides I am losing weight like mad and I am still SO fat when I look at myself) to be feeling this way! Logically, I KNOW I have the best kids...the best life besides a little debt...I can't understand. My head is swirling around and when I try to examine my true feelings, I hear "you don't really feel like this--you want the attention your cut up hands gets you...you just are acting! Give her an Academy Award!!!" That is exactly it. I felt it as I typed that.

GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH. It is going to be a LONG ass day. I need to cut SO badly. I crave the pain right now. I have visions of cutting and seeing the aftermath...but dammit. I am here. This isn't suicidal, but I am still having thoughts of taking my pills and just ending it so everyone can STOP BUGGING ME ABOUT NOT CUTTING AND STOP EXPECTING ME TO BE NORMAL.
Sigh. Thanks all. I needed to say that.
I need sunshine and happiness now. Going to look out the window at the lovely (but freaking cold) Spring day here.
