I can'tI can't go on.  
I have nothing left.  
I tried, despite knowing that the world would take everything from me.  
I'm rotting from the inside out.  
I'm the least important person to the most important person in my life.  
I'm a broken evil mess.

The only moral thing a human being can do is end their own life.  
We're all disgusting broken evil things, me more so than any other.

I can't be happy in this world.

I won't be burned again.

I won't be seeing the sunrise again.
