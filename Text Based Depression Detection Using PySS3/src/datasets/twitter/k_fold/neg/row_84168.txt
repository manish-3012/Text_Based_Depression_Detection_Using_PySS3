TiredI donâ€™t even feel like typing this honestly Iâ€™m so tired of existence. Iâ€™ve already posted here a few times but I guess itâ€™s because part of me still wants to live. I donâ€™t want to die I just canâ€™t take this anymore. At least I did one of the things I wanted to do, I got my first kiss. Too bad I ruined things and I only was a burden to her. Iâ€™m insane and itâ€™s only a matter of time until I ruin everything else. Itâ€™s inevitable. I donâ€™t wanna live to see myself ruin what I have left. Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ll end up posting here again.
