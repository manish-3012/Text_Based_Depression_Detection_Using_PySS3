Iâ€™ve just found out Iâ€™m in debt, and the only solution I can come up with is suicide.Iâ€™ve just graduated from uni, and my student overdraft of Â£1500 has suddenly become arrears and I didnâ€™t get the letters they were sending until it was too late &amp; I didnâ€™t answer their calls because I donâ€™t answer unknown numbers in case it is a scam. I phoned them today and my credit is fucked. Iâ€™m on a 12 hour a week job earning the bear minimum which just about covers rent, bills and necessities. I canâ€™t get more hours because of the shop already being overstaffed. Iâ€™m struggling to find a full time job because of fucking Covid. Iâ€™m trying other ways to make money but itâ€™s not enough. Iâ€™m depressed enough because of Covid restrictions, it pretty much feels like life is over anyway. My partner is in a substantial amount of debt because of being an idiot in the past, and is self employed so heâ€™s depressed and I canâ€™t do anything to solve it or help more with the bills now I have something else to pay for. I can only think of just killing myself because it will just solve everything. I know itâ€™s dramatic but Iâ€™m in such a difficult situation right now.
