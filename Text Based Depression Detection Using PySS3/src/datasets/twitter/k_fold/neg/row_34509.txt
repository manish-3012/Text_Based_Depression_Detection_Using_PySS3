My country is in lockdown , I've nowhere to goThere's no hope for a job within the following 2 months at least, no hope for a friendly chat with someone new as that is risky, no hope to go anywhere to drink my pain away. No hope at all, to get relief from this family I don't consider mine anymore (31 -year old male unemployed).
My parents are panicking and I fear that they too, will collapse for being around one another too long.

I didn't feel so dreadful in a long long time. On top of that, there's the fear to catch the coronavirus. I want to get relief but I cannot as there is no day to day hope. The soonest hope there is, is within 2 months.

Everything feels tight, I know I'm close to breaking down.  Please help
