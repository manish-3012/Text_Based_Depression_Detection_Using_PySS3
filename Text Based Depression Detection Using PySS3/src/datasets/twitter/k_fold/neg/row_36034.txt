Pregnant and I don't want anything anymoreI can't speak honestly to anyone I know because I'm pregnant and I'm supposed to be incredibly happy, except I'm not. I'm 28, I have a degree and I'm in a stable relationship, so in general it doesn't sound bad, but it wasn't planned and I wasn't sure about it, but my boyfriend wanted to keep the baby and at the end I decided to go through with this, I thought we would be happy.

The truth is our relationship has been rocky since day 1. When we met we both had other relationships and we cheated on them. I left my previous relationship, that wasn't bad, it was just not as exciting, for him only because the sex was better. My bf is not a bad person but he is controlling and immature, so he becomes emotionally abusive without noticing. And tbh, I started cutting myself again since we started dating, and it has gotten worse since I'm pregnant.
In addition to that, my mom has cancer stage IV and apparently she doesn't have much time left. And they made some changes in my job and now I hate it, but I can't quit or I won't get maternity leave and I really need the money.
I feel really bad because I regret all my decisions, I can feel the baby and I've seen it so I have an attachment now and I want it, but at the same time I wish I had never gotten pregnant. Everyone is so much more excited than me and my bf always blames me for it. I've told him I'm depressed and I don't want to live anymore and he just tells me not to say nonsense.
I cry everyday and I don't want to do anything, I sleep a lot because that's the only thing I enjoy anymore. I feel so lost and lonely
