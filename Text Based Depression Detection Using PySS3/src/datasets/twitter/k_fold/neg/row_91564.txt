I destroy every relationship/friendship I try to establish.I get lonely. Kind of.

But I can't trust others and I firmly believe that I don't even need them. Life goes on with my solitude, but when I have no way of distracting myself from it, it hits me like a truck.

I cannot form deep attachment to others. I have absolutely zero emotional empathy. I have no guilt for doing bad things to others - only superficial regret. I don't care about other people anymore. 

My life is boring and nothing brightens it up anymore. I just distract myself over and over again until I get so drunk I fly off the handle and break down in tears. 

I destroy every relationship I build. I have no real friends. I avoid talking to people face-to-face like a plague because I feel how superficial I act in front of them and it pains me; but that's not a thing I can fix. I cannot act the way I want to. It's like I space out when I talk to others. 

I guess I just want for people to believe everything is okay until I get absolutely hammered on the roof of a 14floor building and jump off with no fear or regret.  :)
