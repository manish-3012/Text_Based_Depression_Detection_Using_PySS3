Just don't tell me life gets better because my life got 1000x worse than beforeI want a way out. And my exams are nearing. I have a ton of other problems. I tried to hang myself but the rope gave in and I just passed out. I am thinking of overdosing on paracetamol. I don't know how much is needed. Of course, I don't wanna present with a liver transplant. I can stay in my room for a week at the maximum. I just wanna know how many pills I must ingest. Please tell me. Don't tell me life gets better again and shit because it won't get better for me.
