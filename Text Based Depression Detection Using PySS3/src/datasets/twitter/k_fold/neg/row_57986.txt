I've been lonely for over 10 years.I was thirteen was when I first caught on to just how alone I am. When my only friend from the previous year moved to a different town, I realized that I didn't have anybody to sit with for lunch. So I sat at my own cafeteria table and ate alone. Kids would go on to make fun of me, usually about my weirdness, my weight, and my raggedy clothes. My family was poor, partly because my mom had cancer and had lots of bills to pay.

My mom would sometimes ask if I had friends. After a while it got embarrassing, so I made up a group of friends and told her all sorts of stories about them. I invented a group of friends that were misfits, just like the kind of friends she always said she had in middle school. My mom loved my stories. It was one of the only things that she seemed to love about me. She was very emotionally abusive, and would eventually pull me out of highschool, solidifying my isolation. She would lie and say that I was being homeschooled, but not keep track of any of my work or submit it. I don't know how long she would have gone on with the charade since she died about four months later.

It's been ten years now and I find myself still fantasizing about imaginary friends. I imagine fashionable, feminine friends to have drinks with; intelligent, bookish friends to discuss school with; and caring, loving friends who invite me over when I need a hug. I sometimes convince myself that these people exist, and I go out and try to meet them. But no matter who I meet, I feel some sort of wedge between us. And I end up not making any friends. And I always feel lonely. Always. I frequently spent entire weeks barely leaving my apartment.

I'm just so tired. I've attempted suicide three times, but the last two times I was drunk and screwed it up. I want to be sober when I die, but I get so scared. It's irrational because I want this, I really do. I just want the strength.
