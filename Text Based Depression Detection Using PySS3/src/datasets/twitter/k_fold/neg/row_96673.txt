I'm just tired of all this shit...Since i was five shit started happening. After i was born my mom moved all the way from nice, crisp, polite, warm-heated colorado, all the way to cold, humid, ghetto, dirty south florida. I've grown up seperated from my family. I've only lived with my mom and sister (and dad up untill i was five). My father was always a heavy drinker. He would come home late and piss my mom off. One day she had enough and kicked him out. It wasn't till i was eight that i figured out he wasnt fucking coming back. Since then i've only seen him ten times and last christmas and my last birthday he didnt call like he usually does. I wish i actually knew him as a father. He's just another asshole in this shit caked world. My mother is verbally and physically abusive. More verbal than physical. My sister couldnt be more of a bitch. everyone always puts me down. Mostly them two. My mom always tells me that i'm just like my dad. good for nothing low life. That i'll never amount to anything. Fuck her. I have a lot of anger, but i keep it bottled up. No one cares about what i feel or have to say. None of them understand. And it took me an entire month to figure out that i was completely alone. All i had was me. I cant keep a girlfriend, and the one i have now doesnt fucking understand either. I live in constant fear that i will end up like my dad. He haunts me 24/7. This causes me to struggle with things. I am a D student and always get into trouble, i do bad things, fight, talk back, tell teachers/cops off. even friends. I've came close to killing myself. I pussied out because i was scared of what happens after death. But i often wish that i would have done it what i had the chance. I hate this world we live in. People = shit. people tirelessly try to get to the top. They step on people to get there. It makes me fucking sick. I = shit. i wont ever do anything to change anything. For me or for others. I try my hardest to do good. I volenteer. Help people when i can. BUt i'm always never appreciated. And i'm sure as hell nothing would change if i were gone. I've helped many people with their suicide problems.... But i cant help myself. I want death so bad. I think of it was a nice, cold, drop of sugar water after a long, dehydrated, hot walk through a wasteland. Help me reddit... You're my only hope.
