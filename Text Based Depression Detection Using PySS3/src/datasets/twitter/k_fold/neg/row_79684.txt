I'm Tired.As per the title, I'm tired. I'm so. Fucking. Tired. I'm tired of being the black sheep of my family. I'm the family fuck up. Their worst mistake. I wonder why they haven't put me out. I piss everyone off, I'm a horrible fucking person. Everything I touch just goes to shit.

My parents are always telling me to stop being a problem, but the thing is, I don't know how. And being cooped up in the house with them all the time because of this fuckstick virus is not helping. 

My birthday is next week. I'm planning to end it by then.
