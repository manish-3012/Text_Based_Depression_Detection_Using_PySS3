I cant talk to someoneIâ€™ve been creeping closer and closer to the day where I inevitably off myself. People online, and here, are constantly saying to talk to someone. But as I found out, I have no one to talk to. 

Everyone in my life either doesnâ€™t care or shuts me down. My therapist didnâ€™t give a shit about finding out what is actually wrong with me. My dad, brother, and best friend, when I tell them that I need help or that somethingâ€™s wrong with me, tell me â€œyouâ€™re fineâ€. I feel like I am crying out for help but no one is listening. 

Iâ€™m sure that, if I successfully manage to kill myself, everyone will be so shocked and say â€œShe never seemed like she was depressed!â€
