Need helpFirst off, I don't think I'd actually be able to go through with suicide.  That being said, I've been very depressed recently.  I fantasize about killing myself pretty much everyday.  These feelings have been getting stronger and stronger since around November.  I don't really have anyone I can talk to about this.  Is this something I should be worried about?  What can I do to make this stop?
