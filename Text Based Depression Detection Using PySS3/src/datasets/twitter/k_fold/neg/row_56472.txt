Every time I socialize I feel drained and depressedWhen I start to talk to someone itâ€™s like all my dopamine is just suddenly sapped out from my body. My voice gets froggy, I talk less, and then start judging myself harshly. I honestly just want some friends and to be myself. I donâ€™t even have that simple privilege, I just wander around the house all day. I canâ€™t take it anymore I need to stop this and end it all
