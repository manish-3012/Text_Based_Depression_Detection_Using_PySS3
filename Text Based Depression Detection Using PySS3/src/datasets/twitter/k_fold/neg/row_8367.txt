Any one else alone on NYE?This is the first time in my life I have no NYE plans. Itâ€™s making me feel really sad. I took some Xanax so I could just fall asleep and get the night over with but it doesnâ€™t seem to be working. Iâ€™m tempted to make a drink but Iâ€™m worried about mixing. 

I can hear people outside my building having fun and itâ€™s making me incredibly lonely. Every year I think, Next year it will be different. It never is.
