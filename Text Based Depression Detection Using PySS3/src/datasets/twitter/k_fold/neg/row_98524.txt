I had a brush with death and it made me want it even moreRecently I got into a car accident when someone else fell asleep at the wheel. It totaled my car and I was knocked out. When I woke up I was so confused. It made me think that death seems so easy... I would have never known if I didnâ€™t wake up. I have a lot of issues on my life, grief and schizophrenia. I just canâ€™t do this anymore.
