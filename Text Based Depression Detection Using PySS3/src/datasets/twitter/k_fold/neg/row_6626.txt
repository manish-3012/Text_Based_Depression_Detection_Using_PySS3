TrappedI was discharged from hospital today from rare medical disorder and now I am looking for a shelter so if anyone knows any shelters in the central midwest it would help me to know. I do not have children. She won't stop screaming at me every reason she hates me. She won't quit saying if I talk she is going to call the police. If anyone can help me please help me. I am going to post this in suicide too. I want to find someone to tell me what she can do to me. She leaked my tire and drained my car battery while i was in hospital.  Thank you.
