My birthdayEveryone forgot. Im drinkinh tonight because im in a group chat for a class I'm in and every time there's a birthday they make a separate group chat with out tbe birthday person in it. So that they can talk about surprise gifts or cake or balloons. But om my birthday? I turned 21 too! I got nothing. I brought brownies to my own birthday to class (college) and people still forgot. I drank alone. Today is someone elses birthday and I don't want to be a bother but they got cake and ice cream nad surprise balloons! So I'm drinking alone again. What's wrong with me? I'd like a cupcake maybe. No one other than my parents has been for my birthday since I was 10. I'd like a balloon. Maybe a candle too but maybe thays too much. I'd like nother beer though.
