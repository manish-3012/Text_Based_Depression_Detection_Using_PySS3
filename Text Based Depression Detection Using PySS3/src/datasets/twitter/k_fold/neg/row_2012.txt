I'm so tired of everything I feel so aloneabout a month ago my boyfriend broke up with me when I found out he had started cheating on me. and now every one has been treating me differently like the only reason they liked me is because I was with him and I still cant move on even though its pretty clear that he can and I just feel like my life is on pause. and everyone is so disappointed in me because ive let my life fall apart while I wallow in self pity over a guy who didn't even love me .
