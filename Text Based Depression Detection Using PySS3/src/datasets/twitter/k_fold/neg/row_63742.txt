living is too stressful i just want to be able to get up and be happyfor 2 months now ive basically been bedridden without a desire to live. its hard to get up and collect things from my own desk which is 2 feet away and the only thing that gets me up in the morning for school is my absolute fear of being expelled - which im scared might happen anyways if i keep underperforming due to my fucking lack of everything. my head just hurts and i dont want to kill myself but i dont know if i have any other options. i would call a suicide hotline but i honestly dont have the energy to pick up my phone. i dont want to live like this. i want to be happy and make others around me happy but im absolute scum and im not able to do that. i just want to be like other people who can sit down and study and be good at what they do and be happy while thhey do it. i have one person who brings me fulfilment in life but they're getting tired of me and dont want to be with me anymore if i keep up this bullshit of a life im living
