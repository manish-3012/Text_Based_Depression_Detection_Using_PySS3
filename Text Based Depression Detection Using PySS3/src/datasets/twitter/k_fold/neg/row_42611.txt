I feel like I keep spiraling and I can't stopHey everyone,
This is a huge rant but I need to say it somewhere.
I'm a 22 F that's been dealing with depression for the past 3 years at least (that's when I was clinically diagnosed). I used to take medication but I stopped 2 years ago.  I've been doing relatively fine since until the past two weeks.
All of a sudden, my depression kicks into overdrive. I cry uncontrollably 3-4 times a day, I'm distancing myself from my SO that I've been dating for almost a year and a half, and I barely find my hobby interesting anymore.  I'm constantly irritable, I find comfort in nothing, and I'm always worried/stressed.  I'm visiting my parents before I return back to school in a few weeks and at this point I just do not care.  I don't want to go back to school, I don't want to move into my first apartment, I just feel like staying in my old bedroom forever (It's like a safety blanket at this point).  I find myself just laying in my bed for hours doing nothing but scrolling mindless media sources.  
But mostly, not ten minutes goes by without me thinking up all the ways I could kill myself.  I've never felt this terrible before; the combination of depression and what I assume is an onset of anxiety.  Most of the time I wish my next breath would be my last.   I've lost my appetite and as a cruel wish for myself I see how long I can starve myself in hopes of just dying of malnutrition (I'm 80lbs as is, so it's very dangerous).  I don't know how to deal with this pain or how to calm myself down for even a few hours. It's constant, it's exhausting, and I just do not want to deal with it anymore.
