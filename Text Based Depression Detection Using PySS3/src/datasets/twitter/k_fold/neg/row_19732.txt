Aaahhhhhhfor as long as i can remember theres always an urge or thoughts of killing myself or dying etc..

I attempted to kill myself in 2017. 
I was in a mental hospital for a week, not bad. 

And the feeling hasn't left since 2017 either... it's stronger. Im in therapy, taking meds and well now unemployed because of my mental state. 

Okay long story short. 
I have plans, multiple. 
I have access to a lot of the things I need to do such things. 
I keep thinking about it but because of the holidays i put it off.. thought it would be a dick move to off myself before Christmas. Then there were birthdays etc.. 

I keep thinking about it.. and everytime I think "tonights the night" and then I'm either scared or like ehh I'll wait. I'm not sure what to do. Not sure if im just being a little bitch. I know suicide souldnt be the answer... however why should i have to stay here for everyone else?
Ive wanted to leave for a long time. 
But I don't know what happens after and that terrifies me more. 
Okay ramble done.
