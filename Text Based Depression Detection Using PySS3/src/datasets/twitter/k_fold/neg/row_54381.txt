itâ€™s so hard not to cut.i canâ€™t bc my sisters wedding is in two weeks and my cuts can take two months to heal, and the dress im wearing (i have to wear it bc iâ€™m a bridesmaid) is sleeveless. iâ€™d cut my waist but then i have swimsuits and summer and crap. maybe my legs? well again w the bathing suit thing. 

idk what to do. it hurts so bad and i want to cut more than anything j to take the pain away. i hate being alive and i hate having to do this.
