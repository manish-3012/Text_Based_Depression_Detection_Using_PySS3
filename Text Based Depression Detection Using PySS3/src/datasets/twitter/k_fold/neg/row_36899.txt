I overdosed yesterdayIt wasn't enough and I couldn't force myself to swallow more, I'm such a failure... My husband knew but he didn't care, I feel so alone and stupid. I just hope this will fuck up my liver enough that either I'll die soon or next time it'll just be too fucked up to deal with another overdose. I still feel nauseous and achy 30 something hours later so fingers crossed I guess?
