Iâ€™m tired of living
I donâ€™t want to do anymore days. Iâ€™m tired of people telling me to hold on for just a few more days, a few more weeks or a few more seconds. Every single day feels like a month, every second feels like an hour and it just hurts so bad. 

I feel like from the moment I wake up I have someone whispering in my ear and stabbing me in the back. Im just so tired of the pain 

Nobody cares about me
Nobody wants me around 
Nobody would notice if I was gone 

Please can I just be at peace
