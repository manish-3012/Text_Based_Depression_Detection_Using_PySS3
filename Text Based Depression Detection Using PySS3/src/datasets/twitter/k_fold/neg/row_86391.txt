I need a reason to go on. I wrote this in preparation for...for when it happens...Suicide Note:
I just want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I have an illness that just wreaks havoc on my mind and I'm too weak to keep going on. A lot of people brush it off as if I'm only seeking attention, they think I'm over exaggerating the symptoms. But this is real. I wake up every day wanting to die. I brainstorm different ways of doing it, asking myself if today is the day I finally stop hesitating. I need help but all anyone tells me is there's no one to help and to do it myself. But I can't help myself so I'm asking for help from others, what's so wrong about that? What if for once, just once, I need help? I guess it's too late though. If you're reading this then I must have finally stopped hesitating. I'm sorry I've done this but I can't go on hating myself every single day. Every thought is about my failures; and every day that goes by the list gets longer. Everytime something goes wrong my brains response is to tell myself if I was dead this wouldn't have happened. And it's right. If I was dead so many problems would vanish. I'd stop holding people back, I'd stop disappointing my parents, I'd be gone and unable to do anything more to ruin the lives of those around me. My entire existence is problematic. But...not anymore. I'll apologize a third time. But I did what I had to. I can't go on like this anymore and I did what's best for everyone. I love you.
