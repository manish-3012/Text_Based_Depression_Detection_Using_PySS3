Rapist Approached me at StoreI (17F) was Christmas shopping with my little brother, and I was approached by the man who raped me. He said â€œHi kittenâ€ and he called me his kitten when he raped me. In front of my little brother he said this. And then left. My little brother didnâ€™t think anything of it but Iâ€™m mortified and ashamed and I canâ€™t get his voice out of my head. I canâ€™t breathe and my chest hurts. I donâ€™t know how to get that voice out, i cut myself to try to focus on anything else, I know thatâ€™s bad but I donâ€™t have any other techniques, I want to cut deeper I want to die Iâ€™m so mortified Iâ€™m so ashamed I just want to die I donâ€™t want to hear his voice anymore
