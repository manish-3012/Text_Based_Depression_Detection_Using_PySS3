How could I ever escape.I'm 16 I dropped out of school grade 11 and haven't been outside in 9 months.
I have severe trust issues, I have no real clothes, no friends, no transportation, I'm stuck living with my parents and I HATE them both.
I think about killing them every day. 
I don't know how to escape from this place.
Yesterday I lost my will to live. I have nothing left but dreams. I don't believe you can bounce back from this. I can't stay here anymore. My parents want me gone, they can barely afford to feed me.
