This does not helpI've stayed alone until recently.

Mom came home from Germany to stay together because I self harm and  tried to kill myself. 


Today we go to my psychotherapist, but I wish I could go alone to tell her how unhappy this whole situation makes me.

I thought I got over it, but really, I want to do it again. This time she'll push me towards it and I know I'll succeed. First time I tried, I knew I'd change my mind, but now I see why I needed more time. I'm done.
