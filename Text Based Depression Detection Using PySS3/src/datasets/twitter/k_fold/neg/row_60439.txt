Where should I take my brother?My brother is suicidal.  I have the option to go to a very very good facility, but it is two hours away.  I don't know anything about the one in town (population of 60k) or its quality, but it is 10 minutes away.  Should I take the chance to go two hours?  He seems fine to take the drive.
