I can't keep doing this, I have nothing and I don't know what to do. I'm overwhelmed.I'm not good enough for the school or major I'm in. I have no money. I haven't been able to find a job. I'm hideous and fat and I can't do anything right...there isn't a single thing I like about myself. I feel like a burden to everyone around me. Being alive is too painful...I'm not strong enough. I can't do this.
