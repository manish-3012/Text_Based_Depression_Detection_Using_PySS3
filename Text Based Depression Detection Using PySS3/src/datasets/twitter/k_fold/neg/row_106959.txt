there's nothing worth going on forthis is gonna sound so fucking pathetic lmao. basically I'm 16, I'm probably trans but hey who gives a shit anymore. I'm a loser. I have no friends irl, I have quite a few online friends I've even met up with some, but they'll just forget me so that doesn't matter. there is literally nothing worth living for. I have really bad anxiety disorder and keep having panic attacks and anxiety attacks. there is nothing worth going on for
