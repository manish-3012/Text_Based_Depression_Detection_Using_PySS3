I'm worried about my friend and i just don't know what to sayMy friend is borderline suicidal after hid grandfather died and his sister committed suicide. he believes it his fault that shes gone and i don't really know what to tell him. the problem is he lives 3000 miles away and i only know him cause we play WOW together.

he is saying he just doesn't know what hes going to do and I've told him to please call me before he does anything. hes finishing at work right now and is with a co worker right now. i really don't have a way of getting anyone who lives near him or know him to help. please help
