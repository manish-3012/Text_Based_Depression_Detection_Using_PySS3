The world, The people around me. All of them would be better off without me.I have a bad past, lots of things. None of them should really matter, people have come through much worse just fine but I didn't come out of it okay. I'm toxic to those stupid enough to keep loving me, they all love me and give me support that most my age would die for. 

I'm still stuck in my past though, and i'm not sure I can ever leave it. I'll never be who they say they see. 

It's all right though, this way at least my mother will never know that her children were incestual abominations so there's that.

This way my past can stay there

This way I can finally stop hurting people; After one final last time.

A part of me doesn't want to though; promises that i'll get better, 

It's a lie though. If I was going to get better I would've done so in the many years i've kept living.

I hurt those I love and cause misery but I don't know anymore.

They don't deserve the pain of having to deal with me.

I never deserved her love.

I don't deserve to live.
