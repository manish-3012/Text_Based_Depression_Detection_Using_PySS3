Almost goneFriday  I couldn't see or feel any reason n to continue. I couldn't stop crying and was hiding from my kids. At one point I was looking for a bottle of pills sobbing and my younger saw me. She started crying hugged me and said she did not want me to be sick. I felt nothing. I said what I know I'm supposed to say - mommy will be fine. I'm just a little sick but tomorrow it will all be fine. - my other daughter arrived and so did my husband. They all cried and I felt even worse for what I was doing. We all slept together. 
I hate myself for not being able to cope and pretend it's all fine. I hate that I'm ruining their childhood and my husbands life. I really want better for them
