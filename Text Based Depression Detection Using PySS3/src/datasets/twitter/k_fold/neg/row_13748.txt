I feel like a terrible person.For months Iâ€™ve had this feeling of numbness and hidden pain, even when Iâ€™m on drugs or alcohol, stuffing my face with food, and around a good environment. Makes me go insane to the point of wanting to end it all. But then I think about all the people with situations millions of times worse than mine. My life is actually pretty good, so I canâ€™t help but think Iâ€™m the problem. That I donâ€™t deserve to go on because so many are suffering Iâ€™m sitting here feeling down about nothing. I understand it might be a mental disease, not related to my environment, but that makes me feel even more justified to take my mistake of a life away. I havenâ€™t told anyone this in ages...I thought pushing everything deep down would help but itâ€™s only building and Iâ€™m beginning to burst at the seems.
