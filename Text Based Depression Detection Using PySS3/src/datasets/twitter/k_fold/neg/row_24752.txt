Nobody takes me seriouslyMy friends know me as a bubbly and ambitious person. A lot of my ambition comes from wanting to escape my current life. I say things like, "I really want to live in NYC," which makes it sound like I don't want to die and I have big dreams. But a lot of it is just me daydreaming and knowing things won't happen, so I want to kill myself anyways. 

My mom has a slew of mental issues including anxiety and depression. But I guess the depression doesn't stop her from physically and verbally abusing me. Yet, when I say something about my ADHD or anxiety, she screams and yells about how I'm making it up and that I don't have it. Is it too much to ask for my mental issues to be recognized. 

And to all the people who say "but think about the people in your life who would be sad if you left", fuck you. Because maybe if they had been that close to me or helped me, I would care about them that way. Thanks for labeling me as a selfish prick for wanting to kill myself. 

I'm supposed to start college this fall. For the past 17 years I lived for the day that I would wake up without having to see my mom. But I'll be long gone.
