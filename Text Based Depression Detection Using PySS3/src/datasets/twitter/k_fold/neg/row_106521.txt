Seasonal depressionMan, that seasonal depression meeting my regular depression is at a high tonight. I wish things were able to go back to before... when I had my family together. It just sucks so much. My therapist is on vacation until after the new year. I just donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to stay strong this year.
