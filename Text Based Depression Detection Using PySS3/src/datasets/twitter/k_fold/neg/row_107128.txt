Tonight I feel in so much pain, I am obsessing mentallyI feel that I have had enough I am searching for cliffs on the Internet so I can drive off. This is not healthy where my mind set is at. I am praying and trying everything it's getting to powerful and to much,I'm sick of talking and sick of living. Is there any way to get out of your own head with out using drugs or killing your self. I live God and need God I don't want to give up
