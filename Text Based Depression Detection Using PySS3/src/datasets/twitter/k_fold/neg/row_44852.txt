I emacipated myself from a schizofrenic father and an alcoholc mother (ctd in dsc)Here's me: I cut myself loose of my parents by getting social security. As of now I've studied CS and dropped out. Got engaged to a wondeful woman who left me for a better life. Got canned from my job as a java developer. Got beat up by a a bunch of cops and spent the night in detention getting beat up. Living in my band studio. Went freelence-developer and got canned. Now I just feel like lighting some charcoal and going to sleep. I know I have an intellect that could contribute to the bettering of the world, but it's become obvious that my contributions aren't welcome. I just want to say goodbye before I go and tell everyone to hold on to your ambition.
