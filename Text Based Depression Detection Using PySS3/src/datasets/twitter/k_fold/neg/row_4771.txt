I just don't know, is this normal?Hi, I have depersonalization disorder that makes me feel like I'm not even there at certain places: this happened to me while at school i'm a junior in high school, who feels like this disorder makes me prompt to commit suicide since I don't have the feeling i'm there, it's just weird it's like i'm dead.
