I just want to disappearI just want to disappear. Left with no trace of existence, the world would go along like it is, just without me ever in it, no one will miss me, no one will be effected, I just don't want to be here anymore. Nothing interests me, nothing to look forward to, nothing inspires me anymore, I don't feel like doing anything, I'm just consuming resources and would be better off gone. 

I know I love my wife, daughter, family, friends. But I just don't really feel it anymore. I don't feel anything, just watching it all happen in front of me, gradually most objects in my life is not based on any of my contribution other than money, my wife buys all the kids cloths and toys, deals with the school stuff, it's not that I don't want to help, I just want to have the least amount of things dependant on me other than money. But I know that's unrealistic, but maybe I can make everyone hate me first? That seems like too much work and I'm too nice to do that. Ugh.....

This I wish there was a button I could press and poof, no trace.
