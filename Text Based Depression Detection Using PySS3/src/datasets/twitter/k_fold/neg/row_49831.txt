tired of myself. i want to end it.I want this to end. Iâ€™m tired of the self loathing. Iâ€™m tired of feeling inadequate in every way. Iâ€™m tired of feeling empty. Iâ€™m tired of feeling insignificant to everyone. 

I think I have bpd. I'm very prone to become overly attached to people, and it makes me ashamed. Iâ€™m tired of always longing and aching in my soul for someone who doesnâ€™t want me, who could never want the authentic me. Thereâ€™s no logical reason for me to be this attached to other human beings. It's crazy. Â  Â Â 

Other people arenâ€™t like this. Iâ€™m tired of not being good enough. I'm tired of being unattractive, incapable of creative or original thoughts, unmotivated, useless.

This bout of depression and grieving someone who didn't want me has consumed me and taken away everything that made me a person. My appetite is gone because I don't think I deserve to eat. What little motivation I had is gone. Anything that previously sparked feelings of joy, contentment, or curiosity within me only makes me feel apathy now. Iâ€™m an empty shell with nothing to offer. I thought finding a new job might help but I have little doubt I'm competent enough to keep one. I feel inherently broken and I feel like there's no help for me. I know I'm going to die anyway, so it would make sense to just hold out for a few decades, but I'm angry and my emotions are too intense. I don't want to put up with my fucking self anymore.
