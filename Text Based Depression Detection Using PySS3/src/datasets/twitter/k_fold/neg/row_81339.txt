Ok, people who managed to unfuck yourself: how?I'm literally have no idea where to start. Male, 28. I drink daily to blackout. Smoke pack a day. Overeat, so overweight. 2 energy drinks per day just to get some shit done at work. Never go anywhere, just sit my ass down and play stupid video games in my free time. No friends. Have a GF, we see each other probably  once a week (well, at least something). I have money to spend 1-2 years not working, but last time 6 month pause in work fucking destroyed me (emotionally). I feel like I have no fucking purpose in my life, and "there is no purpose, just enjoy life" method sucks because I'm not fucking enjoying it. So I slowly but steady losing my shit. Tried therapy, 3 times, 3 doctors, 3 suicide attempts (I managed to fuck up even there), so I don't want to repeat it, at least in current state of things. So, folks, where do I fucking start to unfuck all this shit? Advice would be appreciated
