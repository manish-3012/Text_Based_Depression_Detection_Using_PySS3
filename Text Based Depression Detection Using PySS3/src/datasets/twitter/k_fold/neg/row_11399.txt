Iâ€™m lost again and I want to end itSo when I first started highschool it was the first year my parents had divorced and I was forced to move to a new school I began to feel destroyed hopeless and shattered but at the time I didnâ€™t have the knowledge to put these emotions into words so I started to miss a lot of school because I dreaded heading to a school everyday and for some reason my school had a policy taht if you miss more than 18 days of school they took your credits did not matter if you were passing they were taken from you and I was passing all my classes and they took my credits the second year begins and I find out they held me back for this and I had a even bigger depression but once again I did not know this feeling of just nothingness and pure sorrow so I then again failed the year due to not showing up but I did pass my classes my parents noticed and allowed me to move back to my hometown as the year began I met this girl and this girl she was my everything she made feel again she allowed me to feel like I mattered again come to find out she confesses it was a game to her and that all of it was a joke and nothing will ever happen this triggered a big depression and I started to have severe anxiety I then proceeded to cut off all my friends and family I quit playing soccer and started smoking heavy amounts of weed at this point it was my third year in 9th grade and I couldnâ€™t help but to feel less than the rest I was angry with myself and I hated myself I began to skip school everyday just to smoke so taht I can keep myself calm school was a mental torture so once the year I finished I decided I will drop out because school was breaking me to much I was never bullied or anything but I was always filled with anxiety and I couldnâ€™t manage to stay in the rooms for 40 minutes without freaking out so I dropped out I began to try and start my life but everything Iâ€™ve attameted to do Iâ€™m always restricted by my age because Iâ€™m not 18 all my ambitions everything is held back because of my age Iâ€™m only 5 months from marking my 18th birthday but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll make it it I feel as if Iâ€™ll kill my self itâ€™s been three years that Iâ€™ve felt nothing or just pure sorrow I have no friends left I developed crazy anger issues and Iâ€™ve locked myself in my room I began to smoke thc oil at heave rates and also weed I made a entire year high with out missing a day after the year I had said I would quit but I didint and I continued my lungs got fucked up and they hurt all the time now Iâ€™m 17 Iâ€™ve lost everything even tho I had nothing but Iâ€™ve lost my remorse my emotions my feeling of enjoyment itâ€™s all gone I attempted to work a job it was a 11 hour work day and my anxiety and depression woudl kill me when I got home I would cry and just cut myself to try and head to sleep I eventually quit and I couldnâ€™t take it anymore now Iâ€™m here a failure in everyoneâ€™s eyes and Iâ€™m what every parents fears their son will become and I feel guilty for parents they donâ€™t deserve to have such a cunt of a son my idol was recently killed the only one who understood me now Iâ€™m alone I want to take my life but Iâ€™m to much of a fucking pussy to do it all Iâ€™ve ever wanted was for someone to hug me
