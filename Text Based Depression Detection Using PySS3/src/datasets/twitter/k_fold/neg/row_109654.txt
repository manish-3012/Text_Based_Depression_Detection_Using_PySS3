Back where I was a year ago, cant keep doing this.Was in the psychiatric floor at the hospital a year ago for a bit less than 2 weeks, my second time there. I felt like it dod me some good and I came out feeling like I coukd handle life, I got a job at Tim Hortons that lasted for something like 4 months but like with every job I've ever had my boredom and depression come back, I dont have much fulfillment in my own life and remaining at 100%  at work gets harder and harder until I just dont show up, it always goes like this, my job history is terrible, I dont know why anyone would hire me.

Ive been staying in a house that my mom owned by myself gor the past year, had a horrible relationship with a subsewuent employer, a man who owned a plumbing business, he would threaten not to pay me, send me on jobs claiming I had been with the conpany for years ecen though I had no experience whatsoever, he let me use a work van since I didnt have a vehicle bur also made me pay for work related gas, and we routinely drove 4 or more hours a day, he made constant fat comments, slapped my belly, called me names, threatened to fire me and said a mpnkey2 could do my job among many other instances, one more being the several times I showed up to his hpusw fpr work to have to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours off the clock. I ended up quitting thst and havent found something else, my mom is downright sociopathic but I'll tall about that more if people want to, she constantly makes things up, says family members she wont name are talking about me, telling her she should cut off contact with me, she and her new husbamd call me a manipulator, and Im just finding it hard get back on my feet, I need to reeaply for medicare, Im gping to be homeless soon, theres all this stuff coming down on me, phone bill to be paid, I just want to kill mtself, If anyone wants to talk I'd appreciate it.
