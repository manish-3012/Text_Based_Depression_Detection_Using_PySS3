Suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problemHey guys,
I came across this reddit and wanted to share this sentence with you. I once heard it in a movie I think and it always summed up everything about suicide for me.
Fortunately I never had suicidal thoughts, but maybe this simple statement can help anyone with those thoughts a little bit.
