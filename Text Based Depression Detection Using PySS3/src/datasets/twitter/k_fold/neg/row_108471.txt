I feel like such a burden going to the hospital because while i'm there for being suicidal, most others are there because they are fighting to keep living.I think that is why I always get treated like shit by hospital staff. They deal with the critical everyday and I have a feeling most of the doctors have a certain dislike for those who are suicidal(Even though they have no right to, because they have no idea what we are going through). 

I have yet to meet a doctor who actually cared what I was going through. They seem to just put everything down to depression and prescribe meds. Its fucked up. I'm starting to think there is no actual help out there, especially in Canada.
