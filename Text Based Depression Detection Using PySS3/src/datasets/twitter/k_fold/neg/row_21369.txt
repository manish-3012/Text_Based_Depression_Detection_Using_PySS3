Making my preparations...So I've decided I'm done. Nothing brings me any happiness, outside of a few minutes at best, everything else is just cold indifference, and abject misery to me. I've discussed suicide since right about when I got out of diapers, and it's only gotten worse with the years. 

I'm much better at hiding it now, nobody suspects a thing. My entire life, basically, has been emotional torture. My friend group has imploded, I lost the girl I loved because of my demons, and thinking of her just digs me deeper. There really is no cure for this, not a shocker when I discovered suicide runs in the family.

So, I've devised a little plan. I've saved up about 3K from living at an existential minimum (about one meal a day), to give to my little sister, as a headstart for her. I'll "slip" off the massive bridge by my town in the dead of night, when the waves flow outwards. If luck is on my side, my body'll be swept up in the ocean, and won't be found, at least for a while.

I'm thinking of writing up a letter, addressed to my family, friends and that girl. I feel oddly relieved, thinking that maybe my hell will end soon. I never expected to make it past 15, so I'm pushing way overdue here. I'd wish I could donate my brain to science or something, but that would mean my folks finding me, or some method that I could pussy out from. 

So yeah... I had a good 3 years spread across, the rest were shit covered with a plastered on smile.
