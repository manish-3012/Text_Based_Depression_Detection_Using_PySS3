Hi, I'm writing this for advice anyone might have for me.I've been depressed probably from the ages of 12+ I'm now 27 and have just come out of a 2 and half year relationship. Luckily I've opened up to friends around me regarding my mental health and they've been determined to make sure I seek help which I have done. I'm seeing a Â£70 an hour psychiatrist and have been taking citalopram for the past month. Just to get a few things straight when I was in my teens I didn't really understand the term "depression" or that it was something I'd consider myself being. I just felt how generally low but I thought that was puberty and this is how most people feel. Since coming out of this relationship i feel like it's brought back my old self and I can now see it as it was before(depression). The medication I've been taking isn't working. I've been given beta blockers (propranolol) which I've been advised will help. I just feel like since I've been on this medication it's made me feel worse, my mum is a pharmacist and has told me that citalopram can be known to take months to start working. I don't feel like I've got months left in me before I start making irrational decisions. I've been self medicating etizolam as a means to stop negative thoughts and on multiple occasions considered taking all of them. I'm not really too sure what I'm expecting as a reply to this post I guess I just don't really know where else to turn to at this point in time and I feel like opening up to anonymous strangers on the internet is a lot easier.
