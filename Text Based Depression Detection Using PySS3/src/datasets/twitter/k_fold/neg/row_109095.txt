UnimportantUnimportant for everyone
No one loves me
No one will notice
If they do, they'll forget me about two days after the funeral
Everyone is preferable over me
I am the worst of the worst
Ugly, stupid, a burden, not funny, shy, insecure, ridiculously invisible, I am a nothing
Everything about me is hateable
Everything about me is bad
I got nothing good
I am useless, a failure
I am a bit nothing
There's no hope, no love for someone like me
Doomed to die alone, feeling like maybe I deserve all of this
Because I am utterly unimportant
Yet another gravestone to add to the graveyard
And nothing else
