I had a doctors appointment Monday.Little update for those of you that care, I went to the appointment. I talked to the nurse and she told me that I shouldâ€™ve seen a therapist years ago, and I explained to her why I never did. At first she wasnâ€™t going to prescribe me meds because she thought therapy was my best bet, but I made it very clear to her that I did not want to go. I was nearly in tears which I think is why she told me sheâ€™d give me a 20 day supply of the lowest dose possible, as long as I promised to come back and see her in two weeks/talk to a therapist. She told me she wouldnâ€™t refill my prescription if I didnâ€™t do both of those things, so I agreed. As much as I donâ€™t want to talk to someone about my problems, I called a therapist and theyâ€™re supposed to call me back within the first two weeks of September. I also set up another doctors appointment for the 3rd of September. Iâ€™m taking the meds. I want to live, itâ€™s just a matter of taking initiative at this point which is what Iâ€™m trying to do.
