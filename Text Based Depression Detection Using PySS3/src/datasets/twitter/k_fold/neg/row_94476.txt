it will never get betteri'm a mess and always will be one. i never learn from my mistakes. no matter how hard i try, everything will revert to the status quo. i feel like i'm in a slippery pit. family is better of without me, and i have no friends. suicide seems like the better option even if i'm going to hell, since i'm going to hell anyways.
