Why shouldn't I?I don't think my life is going to get better. It's been getting worse for the better half of 10 years, and I honestly don't think I can take much more of this. I think about just ending it every day, I have a few half-formed plans in my head, but nothing more, no note or anything. But it gets harder every day to stop myself...
