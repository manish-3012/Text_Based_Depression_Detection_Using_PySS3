I should just do itItâ€™s like the thought suicide just hangs over my head and lingers even when Iâ€™m having a relatively â€œgood dayâ€ like today. I got out of bed before noon, showered, ate two meals, and even exercised which is a stark difference to the past few weeks. But now that Iâ€™m in bed I canâ€™t stop thinking I should just hang myself or overdose or jump off a bridge. 

I feel like Iâ€™ve ruined my life and itâ€™s call coming to an end. I lost my scholarships and financial aid due to my shitty grades so I canâ€™t return to school until I pay for this semester but Iâ€™m unemployed. I feel like a giant loser because Iâ€™ve been trying desperately to find a job, but itâ€™s just been auto-rejection e-mails. With the coronavirus, my family needs my financial support so Iâ€™ve been draining my measly savings but Iâ€™m running out soon. 

Besides those issues, Iâ€™ve just been depressed for years and trying to deal with BPD and anxiety as well but I donâ€™t have insurance so I have no access to therapy or medication. I started the process of therapy and trying to get medication through my school but at this point Iâ€™ve basically flunked out. 

Iâ€™ve been trying to hard to take everything a day at a time but I feel an overwhelming loneliness on top of everything. Everyday I just feel like nobody loves or cares about me and despite having a few friends, they canâ€™t spend every moment talking to me so Iâ€™m basically alone everyday just going through the motions. And Iâ€™m just not close with my family, particularly my mom who abused me when I was younger and the rest have always scapegoated me and treated me like a servant. I feel numb all day like Iâ€™m on auto-pilot then I get in bed and I think â€Is this really my life?â€ 

It feels like Iâ€™ve been set up to fail in life no matter how hard I try and itâ€™ll make no difference to anyone if I just die. My family can move on because they were never happy with me around and my friends probably wouldnâ€™t even know and just move on. Itâ€™ll just be a sad memory occasionally but theyâ€™ll move on. 

My life really is completely worthless and everyday I spend alive is wasting space and resources. Even with my issues with money and school and mental health, Iâ€™d feel better if I knew I had people behind me rooting for you. People who told me they loved me and cared if something happened to me. But Iâ€™m just not important to anyone and it wonâ€™t matter once Iâ€™m dead.
