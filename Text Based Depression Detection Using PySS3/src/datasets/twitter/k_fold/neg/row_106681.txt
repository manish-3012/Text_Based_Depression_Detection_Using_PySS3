Iâ€™m so much happier now that Iâ€™ve planned the day I end it allNext week. Iâ€™m getting all my things in order, but Iâ€™m finally going to do it. Itâ€™s crazy that I seem actually more relieved, knowing this is my last week on this shithole. I just keep fucking everything up and I can tell which direction my life is going to and I donâ€™t want to end up there. Iâ€™d rather end it now then end it later when Iâ€™ve fucked even more things up. I donâ€™t want to grow old and reflect on my mistakes, I just need to end it now. I know itâ€™ll be hard for others but in the long run I know theyâ€™ll forget about me and move on. Itâ€™s honestly a relief I wonâ€™t cost any more money for my family anymore...
