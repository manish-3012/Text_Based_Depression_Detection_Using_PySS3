I'm having a good day.Not been out just watched a few videos. My delivery from Tescos arrived and I made pumpkin soup and had some Garlic bread. I even laughed at a scene from airplane. So to paraphrase worf:"perhaps today is a good day to die".
I have my suicide kit ready and I am just plucking up courage to use it, so let's hope today is the day.
