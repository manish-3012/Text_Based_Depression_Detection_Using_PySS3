On being usedSo when somebidy uses you for your body and you get nothing in return what does that mean. he's done w my so my purpose is gone. You're worthless meat? Why would someone take advantage of me so many times If I didn't deserve it. Idont wanna live like this anymore, I feel like I am going to end up trafficked or dead soon. I just want to feel safe
