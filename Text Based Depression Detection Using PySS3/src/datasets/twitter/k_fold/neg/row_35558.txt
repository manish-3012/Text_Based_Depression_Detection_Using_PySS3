Thinking about suicide calms me.My mind is racing all the time. I have social anxiety disorder and depression. I have a fear that my past will be used against me, or that Iâ€™ll have to pay for anything bad Iâ€™ve ever done. I used to have dreams about helping others as a psychologist, but I am so broken that I donâ€™t think I can do it. My antidepressants donâ€™t work, and therapy doesnâ€™t help with my issues. But when I think of suicide, even just the possibility that I donâ€™t HAVE to live in this world, I feel an overwhelming calm go throughout my body. The only thing that keeps me staying here is that I donâ€™t want to hurt my parents. If I wasnâ€™t an only child Iâ€™m not totally sure but I think Iâ€™d actually go through with it. Iâ€™m just happy to have the choice. Iâ€™m wondering if anyone else feels this way?
