I can't even keep Internet friends.I'm depressed, anxious and have severe PTSD. 

I made a friend over the holiday, turns out he just wanted to bang me. 

I'm in a super shitty relationship where my partner mentally and emotionally abuses me from half a country away.

I just wanted some friends to talk to. I just wanted to not be alone. 

I can't even do that. 

I hope this bottle of pills does the trick.

Goodbye.
