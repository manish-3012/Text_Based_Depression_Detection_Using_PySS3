What can a psychiatrist do, If I tell them my true intentions, I will kill my self. I already made peace with what will happen.I just want to know if they have the right to restrain me or some shit, I am just tired. And they broke me, they kept stretching, and well... congratz you stretched too much fuckers. I am done. I just need to make sure, what will happen if I let my doc know about this. Maybe she will prescribe me even more "anti-depressive" drugs. Yeah ,thanks very much bitch, thank you for providing me with OD material. Fuck this society, fuck this body, fuck this life. Can they stop me from committing suicide? This is inhuman. This is basically torture. I just want out of this fucking misery. This is hell.
