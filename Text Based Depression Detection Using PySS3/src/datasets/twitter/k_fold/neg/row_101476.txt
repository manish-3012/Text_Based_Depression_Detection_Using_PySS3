I want to get better but I don't want to go to therapyI'm a high school senior, been suicidal and depressed for like six years now. I'm fucking terrified of graduation and college and all of that and I've been planning to kill myself before I turn 18 since I was a freshman. I'm 17 now, and I guess I realized I have two options: either I tell someone how I feel or I die. The thing is I know I don't really want to die, that I'm just scared and don't know what else to do, and I have a family and friends who would be devastated if I did it. So more and more I've been trying to figure out how to talk about this, but the problem is I don't know what I want from a conversation like that. If I tell my mom and she suggested something like therapy, I wouldn't want it. I don't want to talk to a stranger about things I've never said out loud before and I don't think that if they offered me advice I'd really listen to it. But what else is there? I know you can take medication like antidepressants or whatever but I don't know if my situation calls for it. I also feel like maybe I'm just suddenly trying to reach out because it would help me avoid doing grown up things for a little while longer, like I would be doing it for the wrong reasons, not to really get better but just to put the rest of my life on hold.
