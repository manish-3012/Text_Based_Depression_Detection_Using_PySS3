Im ready to go but im afraid of dying.My mind and body are ready to leave this world but I am afraid of dying. What if after you die, it will just be you in darkness. You would just be watching yourself walk in pitch black realizing the world out here is so much more vibrant and colourful and although you feel lonely atleast you are able to other people so youre not really alone. I think I am scared that I think I would leave behind all this misery and regrets but in the end they will stay with me even in death. Im afraid I will be completely alone in darkness and all I have with me are all these thoughts running forever. The thought of death and afterlife actually scare me.
