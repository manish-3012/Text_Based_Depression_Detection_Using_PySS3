I'm a shade of what I could've beenHey all guess I just want to say that I think I'm gonna check out of life. I've fucked up every single opportunity I've been ever given, and I've had a lot of them. I've lived a pretty privelaged life and never had to really struggle with food or housing, and went to private school, did decently but just fucked everything up when I tried going to college. I never got to live up to my potential despite all the gifts I've been given, and screwed everyone else in the process. I guess that's it. My advice for everyone is don't play safe and keep taking risks. I always tried to do what was the safe thing and it fucked me over. Thanks all, sorry I couldn't contribute to human progress.
