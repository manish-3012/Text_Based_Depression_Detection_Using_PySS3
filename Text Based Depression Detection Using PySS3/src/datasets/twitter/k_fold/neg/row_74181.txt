My homelessness is like a chronic illness.Gonna be homeless AGAIN. This time I didn't expect it to happen for the fifth count, so I have a bunch of stuff. No money for storage and no friends to help me move if I did. Thinking of selling it all and just ending my shit. I'm not built for this paycheck to paycheck lifestyle and breaking the cycle of poverty just seems impossible. I don't wanna leave my bed cause it's going to be a long time till I have one again.
