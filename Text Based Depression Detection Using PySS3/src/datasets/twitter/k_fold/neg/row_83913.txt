My heart is so broken, my chest physically hurts.I just get closer and closer every day to ending everything. The only reason I havenâ€™t yet is because I worry about my children. My mother is a fucking crazy person (like, legit psych patient), but there is no one else I would trust to take care of my kids. Their dads are not invested in the ability to thrive. I take care of everything from school, to after school care, to doctors appointments, clothes, food, etc. I know my mom would pick up and take care of my kids, but sheâ€™s so labile and emotionally/mentally abusive I canâ€™t imagine putting my kids through what my reading was like. 
Iâ€™m just so hopeless. In a dead end job(s). Donâ€™t have time for school or to better myself. My oldest son is autistic so a lot of my energy goes to his special needs. I donâ€™t sleep anymore, and I binge eat or donâ€™t eat for days. 
I just came back from a two week vacation (without the kids or family), and that was the happiest Iâ€™ve been in years. I stayed in bed all day and slept, read, or did puzzles. I went on a hike once, but was mostly to myself. No schedule, no responsibilities. I came home and my mother had trashed my house. She didnâ€™t take care of my animals or plants (most of the plants were dead and my house was covered in urine and feces). 
I hate everything about my life. Iâ€™ve been trying to figure out how Iâ€™m going to word to my live-in bf that I need a break. I hate my mother. I hate my job. 
But I can not describe how much I love my children. 
A very close boyfriend/best friend killed himself 3 years ago, and I will not forget how much I hurt, and how I still hurt years later. I donâ€™t want to put my kids through that. But, I canâ€™t stand this pain anymore. I see a therapist, and I take meds, but I feel like a shell. A hollow shell. A hopeless, listless, emotionless shell. 
At what point is it more fair to completely remove myself from my kids life than traumatize and scar them with how absent I am?
