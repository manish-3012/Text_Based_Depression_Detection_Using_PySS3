It's back againI think I'm just overly sensitive but seeing people annoyed with me feels like they'd rather me be dead (which I acknowledge isn't true) but I'm in a really shitty mood now. I guess it triggers something in me. I FEEL like people don't want me around but I know that's not true. But I feel pretty worthless. Maybe my organs are worth something. Wish I could donate myself to science alive lol
