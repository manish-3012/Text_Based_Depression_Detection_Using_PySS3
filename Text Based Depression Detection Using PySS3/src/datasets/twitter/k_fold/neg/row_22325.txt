Best way to commit suicideAfter much research I determined that suicide by gun is the best method.  I'm not going into why I'm going to do it, only childhood/continuing Trauma, medical condition is the cause.  I've seen videos of failed suicide attempts with people with blasted faces and I don't want that.  They say to angle the gun (a 1911) 15 degrees so you will be aiming between the brain and spinal cord.  It would be kinda hard to shoot from behind.  That would cause instant death.  Or the heart.  Please advise.
