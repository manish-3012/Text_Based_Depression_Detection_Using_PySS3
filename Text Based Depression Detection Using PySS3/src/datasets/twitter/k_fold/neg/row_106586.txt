Suicidal thoughts as a coping mechanismI feel like I've used the thought of suicide as a coping mechanism for so long that it's become an obsession.  It's the only future I can picture for myself.  I used to tell myself that I didnt have suicidal INTENTIONS, just the thoughts, just the desires.

I feel like there's a big part of me that I just turned off one day.  My family would support me through anything. I know that.  I could never do something so awful to them.  But I still want it so badly. Constantly, I am thinking about it. I just dont want to be here anymore.

Why is it so hard to trust people? I just dont expect them to say the right thing.  It feels like talking to the people I'm close to would make it worse.  I don't feel like therapy is an option. I know there's something wrong with me and I just dont understand. I know I've caused all my own problems, I know it's something wrong with my head, but I dont feel like I can get past it.
