I spoke to my addiction counsellor.She said that my abusive household circumstances wont let me heal unless they change. I cannot change my carer's as of right now - even if I wanted to, Covid restrictions won't let me.

I told her about relapsing and she didn't seem to think any less of me.

It seems as though even substance abuse isn't capable of making me feel better (temporarily).

She said she'd speak to my psychiatrist about getting me on mood stabilizers, however I'm not very persuaded this will change things. I'll do what they ask of me.

And my rehab center is supposed to get back to me this week. Even knowing that, I see little hope for the future. Just empty now. 

I won't harm myself today, or any time soon. I'm too afraid - I think I just sorta stopped caring about whether I live or die.
