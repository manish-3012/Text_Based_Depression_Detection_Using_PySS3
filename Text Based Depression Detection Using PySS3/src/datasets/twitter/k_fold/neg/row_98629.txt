I often cut myself. But of sanity not sadnessI often cut myself to see how much pain i can go through. By most peoples standards I have a good life. I have had to go to the hospital multiple times due to loss of blood. I have tried to stop. But much like smoking I have become addicted. I literally cannot stop. What should I do?
