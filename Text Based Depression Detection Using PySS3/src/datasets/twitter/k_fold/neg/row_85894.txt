I honestly am so lost and want end things.I feel so many emotions right now and that it is extremely overwhelming for me. I am so alone with no friends or family in the town that I now live in. I was dumped about 3 months ago and I have been working hard at developing a good self esteem since the relationship was so emotionally and at times physically abusive, that it completely killed any self love in me. I feel like I am not worth it for anyone. That things would be better off if I was gone. I don't know what to do with myself. I am currently at work and the thought of going to my apartment scares me because a part of me wants to end things and another part of me wants to keep going forward. I've been giving it my all to be strong and keep moving forward but I just feel so tired of always having to be "strong". I give up. I feel like I have lost at life.
