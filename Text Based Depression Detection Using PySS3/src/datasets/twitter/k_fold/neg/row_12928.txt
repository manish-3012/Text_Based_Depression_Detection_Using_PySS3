Letâ€™s stop discussing why we shouldnâ€™t kill ourselves, rather we should start focusing on the pain that causes the want to end everything in the first place.â€œIt gets better.â€ â€œTrust me, it wonâ€™t always be this way.â€ â€œItâ€™s only temporary, donâ€™t give a permanent solution to a temporary problem!!â€ â€œThink about how your familyâ€™s gonna feel?â€

No. Fuck you. Iâ€™m sick of hearing this over, and over, and over, and OVER again. I know youâ€™re trying to help, I get that. Iâ€™m not denying that. Iâ€™m not trying to be rude, or objective or just... an ass. Iâ€™m sorry. But we as a society (and Iâ€™m saying this Un ironically) really need to begin focusing on WHAT causes these root feelings of distress, of anxiety, of suicidal tendencies in the first place, so that we can AVOID having to constantly tell other suicidal individuals; â€œit gets better.â€

It shouldnâ€™t have to get better.
