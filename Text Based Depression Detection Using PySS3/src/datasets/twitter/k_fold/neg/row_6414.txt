Mediocre things to cry aboutThings have been going smoothly for a couple of weeks.  I've been doing a lot, playing football, working out, reading books (currently dune) and I'm just still lost as I am before. I still am suicidal. I still am losing ground to this weird stuff in my head. I'm gonna lose, I know that. Why can't I be content with what I have? I have everything I need. I just dunno anymore. I just dunno. What am I supposed to do? 




I mean, there's no point in me living. Why should I?
