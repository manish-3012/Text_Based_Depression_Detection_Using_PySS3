What is the point?Thatâ€™s it really. I donâ€™t get it. Whatâ€™s the point in living? We struggle and compete through life and for what? What do we get at the end of it all, the same as everyone else, nothing. So why bother? I am a single mom to 3 children, one being only 12weeks old and I have realised that there is just no point to life.
