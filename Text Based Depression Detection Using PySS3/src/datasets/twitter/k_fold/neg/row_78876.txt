I'm bored.I was a little unsure about posting to here or posting to r/depression. I'm not in immediate risk of suicide, but I've attempted it before and really am thinking that I'll plan another attempt in the near future.

I'm bored with life. I don't like any aspect of my life. There is nothing that can keep my attention and nothing that gives me pleasure. Well, there is one thing, a person. But he's either been busy lately or has been avoiding me. Either way, I have hardly been able to talk to him at all lately. I'm just sitting around, waiting for him. I don't want anything else. I'm bored waiting.

My boyfriend and I broke up last Friday (that isn't the person I'm waiting for). All of my friends and roommates know that we broke up, they all should know that it's been hard on me. I've spent a lot of my time in my room, but not all. None of them have asked how I'm doing. No one else has, either.

Well, I'm not doing very well right now. I don't want anything. I want nothing. Death can offer that to me. I'm thinking sometime in November, that would give a lot of time for something to change. But I'm so bored right now, I'm not sure I can wait that long unless at least a little bit changes soon.

I've had a plan for quite a while in case I ever felt suicidal again. It involves a full bathtub, some alcohol, and around 4000mg of Seroquel (I thought I had more saved but can't find it right now). I can't say I'm completely confident it would work, but I really think it would. I should either die from overdose (unlikely) or die from drowning (seems likely). That's what I hope, anyway.
