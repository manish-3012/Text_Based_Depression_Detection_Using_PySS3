I just want to go to sleep and never wake up againI don't know where to post, but I think I need to find help somewhere. Today is my 19th birthday and the only thing I'm reminded of is how much of a failure I am. I'm a freshmen in college and I'm living at home with my parents and I feel like a huge failure. I have no one to blame but myself for failing in school and fucking up all the time. I feel like I'm living a lie and my parents are wasting their money trying to put me through school. I smoke weed and waste all my money on it, I want to stop but I'm afraid my friends won't think I'm cool unless I'm a "stoner". I have issues with binge eating disorder and mood swings. I feel like I'm amazing and motivated some weeks and other weeks like today I want to die and shut the world out. I'm tired of everything. I don't want to live anymore because I don't deserve to be alive. I'm to scared to kill myself, because I don't want to hurt my family. But I know one of these days I'm not going to care anymore and finally do it.
