I'm Done TryingI have worked too hard for no end result.

I went to school nonstop for my degrees only to have jobs nowhere near my desired field and have the humiliating event of being laid off twice in two years happen to me. I feel like I'm the biggest disappointment, to my parents, my family and most of all, myself.

The friends I've had don't really worry too much about me. It's why I stay quiet, because nobody cares. What's the point? They got me out here, got me to bleed my hard earned money dry and when I had nothing to offer, they threw me out like trash. Meanwhile, the other friends I'm with now would rather be just the two of them, versus having me along. I'm tired of being set aside and forgotten. I'm tired of being told that I matter, when in reality, that was never the case. I moved here for something better than the life I had before, only to find out it's even worse here. I work at a temporary job now that I can't stand, crying every day because I don't even know if I'll have a job at the end of the day. I don't think I'll make it to my next birthday, much less Christmas or next year. All I want is to feel like I matter, to not have to worry about where my next paycheck is coming from and for someone to genuinely be kind and want me around. I've already tried a few times since moving to California and it always crosses my mind to just finish it. 

I don't have anything to live for anymore.
