Can someone give me some advice?I'm 17 year old boy, I was born with massive malformations on both my legs, my first surgery happened when i was 6 weeks old and they haven't stopped ever since. My whole life has been just pain and suffering. If i think about everything that happened to me so far i lash out crying and wanting it all to stop. I had a doctor who did "experiments" on children made me wear a Lizarov aparattus for 3 years that aparently only ruined my left knee (is charged with malpractice, but he's got such powerful lawyers he won't even see a jail cell) , alot of other surgeries that aparently were just failures, from all the surgeries i had so far i have almost no skin on my legs, just scar tissue. When the weather changes i feel as tho my legs are being torn apart. I can not stand the pain, the mental suffering, the medical dissapointment anymore. Please give me some advice. I can not go on much more.
