I'm already deadIt's a long story, but the short version is:

I have no job. I have no friends. At all. I only speak with my sister. I am mentally ill, my disorder is life-long, I've had it since childhood. I am 20 now. I am not getting better. I'm a burden.

I don't go out. I don't study. I have no future. I have no dreams. Mostly I feel nothing at all. When I do feel, there is guilt, grief, and the loneliness that crashes my chest like a heavy stone. Literally. I cannot breathe.

There is a woman I loved. She abused me. Then she apologised. Then I abused her. Then she left. I miss her as one misses a limb or a dead family member.

I've tried therapy, meds, talking, working, travelling, drinking. Nothing helps.

I'm tired. I want to sleep. Forever. I don't want to kill myself - the act of killing is too much work. I just want to lie down and never get back up.
