He was dead when i came home. I already wanted to kill myself before but now i feel terrible.I left my rabbits for two days, with lots of food and water, as ive done before, but this time Rigby wasnt moving when i got home. He just had his first birthday.  He was my perfect little boy and i loved him and bonded with him and he trusted me so much. I know it must be my fault. I cant handle this right noe. Iâ€™m two months behind in school, i dont know how to catch up. Iâ€™m cutting again. Smoking, too. Iâ€™m tired of sleeping on my boyfriends parents couch because my house is too stressful. Iâ€™m tired of not being able to get myself up all day. Of my boyfriend being so inconsiderate about rigby. I just took 6 prescription strength ibuprofen and some expired xanax but i have to drive. I have to go get my dog because my boyfriend canâ€™t even help me for one shitty, miserable, weekend. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m not making sense i just. I dont want to be anywhere. I dont think Iâ€™ll be happy anywhere. I cant catch up.
