After 3 years of this shit, why am I still going?I've been suicidal on and off for a few years now, and I really don't get why I'm going through my life as if everything is normal. As if I care at all about the degree I'm studying for, as if I have any motivation to keep working, as if society isn't going to collapse in 20 years anyway.

I mean, I know things don't get any better than this. Maybe I get a job that pays a little better than the shit service job I have now, maybe I pay off my student loans, but fundamentally I'm going to be stuck in the same rut I am now. So why am I still going to work instead of getting drunk and driving my car into a wall? I guess I just haven't worked up the nerves yet. But I will, sooner or later.
