How long exactly?I feel like the craziest thing Iâ€™ve done in a long time is paying someone hundreds of dollars to sit in a room with me and tell me how Iâ€™m unhappy because Iâ€™m unhappy. Compared to therapy suicide seems rational. Iâ€™m already aware that Iâ€™m the problem. I know my thinking patterns are unhealthy, but Iâ€™m far to exhausted to fight them any further than I already do.

They ask what I think about when Iâ€™m depressed like I have any thought larger than how a 9mm feels in my skull or how much I would choke if I slit my own throat. 

The one thing we seem to agree on so far is that Iâ€™m going to be depressed the rest of my life. We just seem to have different ideas about how long exactly thatâ€™s going to be.  This isnâ€™t a manageable condition, not by definition but because Iâ€™m not willing to manage anymore.
