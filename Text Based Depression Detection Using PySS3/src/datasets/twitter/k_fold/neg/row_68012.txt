Crisis told me they have to â€œwrap up this conversationâ€Screw the crisis text line. I texted in about wanting to kill myself. It took them forever to respond to my messages. We barely talked; the conversation was me waiting and waiting for them to reply. They sent me a bunch of bull crap â€œ99 coping skillsâ€ links. While I was telling them how I wanted to kill myself, they told me they have to â€œwrap up this conversation.â€ I texted in about how alone and suicidal I am. They wrapped up the conversation without even talking to me. 

Now I feel one thousand times more alone.
