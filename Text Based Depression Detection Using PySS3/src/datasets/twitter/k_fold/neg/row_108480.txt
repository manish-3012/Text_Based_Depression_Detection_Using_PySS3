Today is the dayI ready to kill myself. I found someone to take care of my cats. I have a plan that I'm 99% sure will work. I don't want to live anymore. I'm all alone. No one cares about me. I just want to die. No one will even notice when I'm gone. All ppl do is use me anyway. No one actually truly cares about me and no one ever will. I'm a loser.
