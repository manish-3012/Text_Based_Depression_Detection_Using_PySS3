I feel exhausted, I just want to die in my sleep.I'm tired of waking up everyday. I don't see myself getting a happy life in future. I don't even see myself having a future. I think I'm ending my life soon.. for real. I used to fail every time because there was one person that kept me on going on. But now that person doesn't love me anymore and I just kept getting rejected everyday. What's the point of sticking when that person doesn't want to be with me anymore? How many more rejects do I have to accept? Nobody cares about me and I hate myself but I deserve to rest right? I want to stop existing and be in peace...
