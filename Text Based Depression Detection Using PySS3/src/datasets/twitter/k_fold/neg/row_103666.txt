DON'T GIVE UPFor the past 12 months, I have been wrestling with severe depression and PTSD - two oppressive and monstrous illnesses that consumed my every waking moment. I wanted desperately to die but was too afraid of what might happen upon committing such an act. I didn't want to commit suicide as much as I wanted to just "stop existing", if that makes sense, but the company that I kept made those thoughts and feelings worse and worse until I'd find myself sobbing for hours, contemplating suicide and wondering why I was cursed with being alive at all. 

Things were tough, to say the very least. Every living moment felt like agony, and I'd often sleep for many hours of the day to avoid being awake, when I knew I'd surely just sit in anguish and sorrow. My dreams became my escape, and it felt as though not a single soul on the Earth could help or understand me. Being in very emotionally abusive and manipulative relationships made things all the more difficult as well. 

Recently, though, I've been starting to feel better. Hope has finally begun blossoming in my heart again - something that hasn't happened for years now. I've been more confident in myself and have been trying new things, purely out of enjoyment and challenge. Just a month ago, if you told me that I'd be where I am now, I wouldn't have believed you. I would've insisted that I was destined for crippling depression and unimaginable mental anguish. I would've come up with every reason in the book to prove you wrong. I'd even make excuses for why things would surely never improve. 

But I made it here. I walked through Hell, several times, and made it back relatively unscathed, and God damnit, if my pessimistic, abused, unmotivated ass can do this, so can you. You're insanely strong just by reading this right now, by being ALIVE right now! Even though you can deny it all you want, I promise you that you are capable of pushing through these arduous and desolate times in your life because this is not all that life has to offer! This is not the end of your story, and no matter how hopeless you may feel, you can't deny the fact that you haven't experienced all of life's ups and downs yet; how will you ever truly know if it gets better if you never allow yourself to get there? 

Seek professional help, and I don't just mean "go to therapy" because not everyone benefits from it, although most do. Tell a psychiatrist or a doctor about your feelings and symptoms, and start on medications, if you haven't already! If you have, then talk to your medical professional about a stronger or different dosage! There are people who can and will help you through this, but you have to take that big first step of reaching out! Push yourself outside of your comfort zone because your life is not over; it's just merely beginning. â¤ï¸

Things do and will get better, despite how clichÃ© and stupid that shit sounds. Life is not meant to be a constant low; it shifts unpredictably, and nothing remains permanent for very long. You may feel as though the universe seems to hate you, and it may seem as though everything is futile and meaningless, but I know that neither of those things are the case. You have a purpose to fulfill in this world, and it's not to become another tragic statistic in a rapidly growing anual suicide chart. You are more valuable than a fucking number, more valuable than a fucking word, more valuable than any precious gem or glittering jewel. You are a human person that has beautiful traits and qualities: some of you are blessed with artistic talents, knowing your way perfectly around a brush or a pencil; some of you are gifted with logical and technical minds that put the mathematicians of yesterday's world to shame; some of you are comedic and outspoken, having a way with words that rival even the most infamous of authors; some of you are driven by justice with an unquenchable thirst for the end to corruptness; some of you are musicians with hands and voices that can perform every note as perfectly as your body breathes oxygen; some of you find pleasure in hard labor, working your muscles while serving the masses; some of you feel compelled to help others, to be a willing servant to those who need it most; some of you still haven't even gotten to a point in your life where you know exactly where you belong, and that's perfectly ok! It's ok to not know what your purpose is yet because the point is that you HAVE one. You have a purpose, whether you're aware of it or not, and once you discover your passions and your joys, you'll have an easier time answering that age-old question of "What's the point?" You'll know the point, but these things take time, and you'll never know the answer if you don't allow yourself to get there first. 

Depression fucking sucks, and feeling suicidal is the worst pain, in my opinion, that you can ever feel because you've reached your lowest mental state possible, but sorrow is not all that life has to offer. You will not be depressed forever because when have you ever heard of a storm that never stopped (on Earth)? When has the sun ever failed to rise up again after a long night? You will improve, if you seek the proper help and take the right steps towards the future, and, fuck, you will fall down again, and you'll certainly lose your way, but no matter how many times you stumble on your journey, no matter how many times you lose your footing or have to backtrack or can't decide which turn to take, you can ALWAYS be found again. You can ALWAYS find a way to keep moving forward because despite what your depressive thoughts want you to believe, there is still hope for you. There is still a chance for you, and I know for certain that you CAN get through this, even if it takes years. You have not seen all that life has to offer, my friend, and I can promise you that. Give life a chance, and give yourself the benefit of the doubt because you might just discover something that alters your viewpoint on life, and yourself, entirely, for the better. 

If anyone can do this, it's you. 
You are you, and that's a beautiful thing to be.
