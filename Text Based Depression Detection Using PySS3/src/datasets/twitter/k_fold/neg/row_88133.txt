BPD, I need to dieIn my home state, people with terminal illness are allotted the chance to end their lives peacefully. With dignity and humanity. 

I am miserable unless Iâ€™m running or sleeping. I cannot be close to anyone. I ruin every relationship Iâ€™ve ever had. I am isolated and lonely. Therapy isnâ€™t helping. In the past, mediation hasnâ€™t either. I am racked with shame about myself. I am losing hope. Why shouldnâ€™t I?
