Probably firstworldproblems, but...I haven't been sleeping very well lately. I feel like I ran away from my past in my hometown, rather than deal with problems I have. I've graduated college and now I'm back for a while.
Between a string (and I'm talking like, ten) serious partners and soured friendships and family relationships I feel like I am having trouble being back in my hometown.
Each relationship ended in disaster. Each partner thought that I was the girl they would marry, and each time I would dump them/flea/act like a dick so they would dump me first. 
Friendships soured because I tend to be somewhat opinionated on personal matters and think before I act. 
My family thinks I am an abusive monster who is temperamental and unapologetic. The truth is, I used to be a lot angrier in my teenage years, but since then have calmed down and gained perspective. 

Despite the fact that I feel I have changed, nobody here seems to see me that way. I have always been proud of who I am, but when all of these accusations pile on I have a hard time coping. 

I cut myself again, and haven't done so for ten years. Even though I am with a new partner, I ended up confessing feelings for someone else. I really feel like i am slipping away, and I don't know how much more I can take.
