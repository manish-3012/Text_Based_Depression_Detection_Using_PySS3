Just one winYou ever feel like you just need that one win yo pull you out of a spiral. 

I have been struggling so much much with my depression lately and I feel like if I just get the one win I'll be alright
 
Its that feeling of everything is going against you, like you're moving against the grain and it's just moving to fast where you reach out, but can't grab it? And at some moments you feel like yes I feel like me again, man it's so good to be out of that funk and then bam! Like reality juat brought you back to where you are, but you keep telling yourself if I can juat get that one God damn win I'll be alright?

Here's to everyone fighting for that one win just so tommorow will be better. Keep fighting YOUR battles, no one knows what trigger can set you off, but hold out a little bit longer maybe your win is right around the corner and you just can't see it yet.
