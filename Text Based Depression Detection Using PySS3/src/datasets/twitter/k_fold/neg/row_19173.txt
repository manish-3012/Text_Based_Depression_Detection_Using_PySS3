[Serious] What got you through your darkest day and/or a seemingly unfixable problem?What helped you to get through a problem or a dark day that appears that there is no other solution? For months now, I have been tortured by mistakes of my past; I can't think of a way out without losing everything I have built for myself in the past decade. So many days, I just feel like, I've had enough of this, I just want to get through today and then the next day; but I also just wish tomorrow never comes.
