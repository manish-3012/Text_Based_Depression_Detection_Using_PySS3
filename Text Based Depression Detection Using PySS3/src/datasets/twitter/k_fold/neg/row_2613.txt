Reaching outI'm a 26 yo male, Catholic, recently laid off from Army Corps of Engineers, 1st gen college grad. I had to move back in with mom until I find another job. Younger brother also recently moved in after an issue with heroin (sold car for drugs) and is starting outpatient rehab this week. Mom is also on the fringes of drug use (mostly MJ), and enables the younger brother.

After layoff, I had to move out of my rental house and going practically bankrupt. Constant fighting at parents' house, makes me feel like my years as troubled teen when I'm almost 27. I started going to casinos because the energy on the floor makes me happy, but starting to develop compulsive gambling issues. I have no health insurance and had to self-medicate with expired antibiotics for strep throat. depression is overwhelming, started to hallucinate earlier.

I don't remember who I am or what I wanted to do with my life. I don't want to die, but living is painful right now and I lose strength to fight as time passes.
