Usually Iâ€™m sad, now Iâ€™m just angry.Iâ€™ve spent years contemplating this night, how Iâ€™d do it, when and where. Never thought Iâ€™d end up like this though. Iâ€™ve finally pushed everyone away, made every last person in my life hate me and toss me aside. Iâ€™ve had a general dislike of people for years but now that Iâ€™ve been isolated a while I simply canâ€™t stand them. To hear opinions and stories and have to feign interest in everything they say. Itâ€™s exhausting. Couple that with the fact my life is going nowhere and my lack of interest in doing anything, itâ€™s slowly made life intolerable. My only savior my entire life has been drugs. One plant has provided me more entertainment and pleasure than all of humanity combined. Unfortunately my supply has come to an end and as I donâ€™t wish to live another moment of sober agony, Iâ€™ll finish myself off when I finish my stash off. If you know me, fuck you. And for those thatâ€™ll act heartbroken just knock the shit off and throw me in a hole. You didnâ€™t care enough when I was alive so donâ€™t start now. Iâ€™m Glad I got the chance to burn out rather than fade away. It really is better this way.âœŒðŸ»
