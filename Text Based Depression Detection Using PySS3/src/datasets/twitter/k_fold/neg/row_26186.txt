Funny how people who are supposed to be close to you can be so oblivious.I don't expect anyone to respond to this, but I have no one I can speak to and I just need to say some things. I am so tired of being a disappointment. Every person I am close to in my life is disappointed in me. I try to fix it and even my best effort makes no difference. I used to have so much potential and it's been wasted because of stupid mistakes I've made and stupid positions I've put myself in. The last thing I did that I'm proud of happened the better part of a decade ago. I'm going nowhere and I can't achieve any of my goals because I wallow around and don't contribute anything to anyone's life. Me being here helps absolutely no one. Everyone in my family is always telling me how worried they are. I think they'd be much more worried if they knew I've been fantasizing about dangling on a rope for the past few months.
