It will happen eventuallyI have had suicidal thoughts since middle school and haven't really found a way out of this mindset.  Suicide is always a lingering thought that I cannot push out of my head.  It is like I can see into the abyss with my waking eyes and I can't stop staring.  I feel I am losing it sometimes.  I am frightened what I will do later in life.  Does anyone have these kind of thoughts?  How do you cope?
