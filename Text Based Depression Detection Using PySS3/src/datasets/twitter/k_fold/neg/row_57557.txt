The world is sooo beautifulOh, God, I wish I could have written more. I wish I could have read more! I wish, oh man, I really wish I could have been nicer. But wishing only goes so far. It's time for me to go. Can't keep burdening people with painful relationship after relationship. Or draining money. Or draining air from this world... 

But I'm ok.

Everything is ok... Final breaths here I come.
