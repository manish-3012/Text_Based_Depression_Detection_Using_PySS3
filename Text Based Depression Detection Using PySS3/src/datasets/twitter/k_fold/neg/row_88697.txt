Really contemplating suicide right nowTheres really no point in me being alive, I've been having breakdown after breakdown after breakdown and nothing is working 

I've been suicidal for pretty much close to 20 years straight, almost my whole life 

I'm fucking done, I'm sick of it. I've been on drugs, I've gone to therapy session after therapy session I've been in wards 

Ive done everything, I just need it to stop

I cant do this, I've tried reaching out for help but it doesnt work and it doesnt matter
