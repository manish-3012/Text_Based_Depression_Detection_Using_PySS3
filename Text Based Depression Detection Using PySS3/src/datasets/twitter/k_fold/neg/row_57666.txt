2020Iâ€™m not going to be alive in 2020. I know how Iâ€™m going to accomplish this, and roughly when and where. I hope I do it correctly.

I like myself. Iâ€™m smart and creative and empathetic and physically fit and not unattractive. But the world doesnâ€™t like me. And the pain of betrayals, heartbreak, and loneliness has taken its toll. One too many blindsides in 2019. There is just too much cruelty and callousness for me to endure.

I havenâ€™t heard from friends in weeks, because Iâ€™m more a mascot to them. Iâ€™m the guy who throws parties, not the guy you get a beer with or check up on in time of need. I donâ€™t have a large family, and other than my mom, their support has ceased, too.

The only advice Iâ€™ve received is to get a doctor and try to take my mind off things. But the pain is too great this time.

Conveniently, Iâ€™m at the most disattached point Iâ€™ve ever been. I sold my house, so Iâ€™m sitting on a boatload of money. Iâ€™m living with family, so I have no lease to break. Iâ€™m working another dead end job, so my efforts there donâ€™t really matter. All my projects have fallen apart, so there are no loose ends to tie up.

Iâ€™ve been asking for a miracle. I have really low standards for my definition of a miracle. But neither prayer nor spirituality has brought me that miracle, so I think weâ€™re living in a world where miracles donâ€™t happen.

And I canâ€™t endure that world another month.
