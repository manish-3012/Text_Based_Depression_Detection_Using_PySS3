I want to cut again..I've been trying to keep myself from hurting myself recently. I had a break down after losing my best friend and did a small amount of harm. It's getting worse every day. Does anyone have any ideas of how to stop myself. I dont want to hurt my close friend because he would be upset if he found out how bad this is getting.
