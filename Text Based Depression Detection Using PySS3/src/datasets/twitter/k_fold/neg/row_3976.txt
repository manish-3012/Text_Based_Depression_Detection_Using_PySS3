I can't stop thinkingI don't need help nearly as much as everyone else on here does. I'm not depressed but I can't stop this image of me putting a a knife in my head. It won't go away literally every night when I'm alone it comes back. It makes sense to me so much. I've posted ab this before if u need more context. I feel like I'm ab to make an involuntary move very soon.
