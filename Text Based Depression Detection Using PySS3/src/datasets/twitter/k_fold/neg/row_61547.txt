Why not?Honestly why not? Everything Iâ€™ve done up to this point has been a failure through my own fault. Sure there are people that care about me but theyâ€™re gonna die one day too. And theyâ€™ll get over it before that anyway. We all die, even the most well traveled happiest person in the world rots in the ground eventually. And all the people that person meets and influences dies eventually. I imagine itâ€™s like falling asleep and not having to wake up, wouldnâ€™t that be nice?
