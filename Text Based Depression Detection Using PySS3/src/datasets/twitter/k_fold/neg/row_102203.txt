I just can't stand itI feel like life is just constant suffering.

For the past 2 years I've been struggling with a lot anxiety, which I think has caused me to have chronic migraine. I worry so much about things other people don't really seem to care about. I don't understand how things other people see as so insignificant can be causing me so much pain.

I want to be more productive but I just can't motivate myself to do anything when nothing I do seems to matter and when I know things will only get worse.

I don't want to die, I want to live and be at peace but I know that's impossible. My head and body hurts 24/7 because of something that is happening in my head. I don't want to live if my life is going to be like this.
