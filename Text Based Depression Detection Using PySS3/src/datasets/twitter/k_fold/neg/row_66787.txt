I donâ€™t want to die, but I think I shouldIâ€™m in a huge (HUGE) amount of debt, nowhere to run, and hurting my loved ones who keep covering up my shit. Itâ€™s all my fault, my selfishness and my broken values. I want things to get better, but I canâ€™t see how. I trapped myself and the only way out is dying. I donâ€™t want to, but maybe I have to. Maybe itâ€™s the only way to stop this cycle. I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Iâ€™m just so fucking sorry
