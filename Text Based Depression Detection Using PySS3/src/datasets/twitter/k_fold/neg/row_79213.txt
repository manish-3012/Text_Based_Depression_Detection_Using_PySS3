Someday SoonI've been fighting off the urge to kill myself since I was thirteen.  And I'm tired.  I'm so tired.  Every day I can't fight as hard as the day before.  And the only reason I keep barely managing to hold on is because I've been taught it's selfish to commit suicide.  Well, I'm exhausted.  I'm tired of fighting the voices in my head telling me I'm not good enough.  That I'm always going to be alone.  That I'm always going to be stupid.  I'm never going to be feminine enough for anyone.  I won't ever be able to travel. I'm never going to be anything enough.  I'm fat. I'm ugly.  I'll never amount to anything at work.  I'll never measure up to my brother.  I'm tired of dragging on my existence and suffering through every day to make everyone else happy.  Why do they get to be selfish and I don't? It's not fair.  Just let me go.  And I'm so close. I can already see it.  And every time I plan it out and think about it, I feel at peace.  So much peace.  Everything goes quiet and my mind is still.  When I think of not fighting it, I feel so relieved.  I just need to pick a day.  A day soon.  Maybe next month.  I had it planned for the end of last month, but someone changed plans that made me have to postpone it.  But some day soon I will be at peace.
