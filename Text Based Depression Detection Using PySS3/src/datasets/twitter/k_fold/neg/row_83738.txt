My ex is in a relationship with her supposed â€œrapistâ€, Iâ€™m broken and I donâ€™t know what to do.While I was in a relationship with her, she told me that she had been raped by her cousin, I was an idiot and I decided to approach him, he confessed to it so I bashed the living fuck out of him. 
Iâ€™m not sure why we ended, after 4 years of being together she just suddenly wanted it to end. Itâ€™s been around 4 months and today I found out that sheâ€™s in a relationship with him. I trusted her with all my heart, and she did this to me.
Iâ€™m not sure how to feel right now, I know Iâ€™m broken but I just feel so normal, I canâ€™t fucking explain it, Itâ€™s a feeling that Iâ€™ve never experienced before, and I donâ€™t like one bit of it.
Iâ€™m sorry if this didnâ€™t make sense, Iâ€™m walking right now and I have no fucking idea where Iâ€™m Going
