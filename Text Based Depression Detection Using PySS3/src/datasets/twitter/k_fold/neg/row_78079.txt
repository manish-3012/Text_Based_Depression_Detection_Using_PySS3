Iâ€™m dyingMy mental health has been taking over my life in the past few months. I feel like iâ€™m trapped in my own mind. Nobody knows about it except my mom but she thinks iâ€™m being over dramatic.  she told me today that â€œiâ€™m doing this to myself stop actingâ€ i was really hurt and got depressed after that and having suicidal thoughts. i donâ€™t know how long i can take it i hate that no one understands me not even family i donâ€™t deserve to live like this nobody does. i live in a toxic family environment iâ€™m pretty sure my parents caused my mental illness. lately iâ€™ve been feeling thinking to kill myself just to fuck their lives up just like they did to mine. selfish and dumb but iâ€™m very hopeless.
