what do I do now?so I was already at my limit of life I can take but then I went over to my best friends house. some things happened and we ended up kissing but she called me a loser for not wanting to fuck her. I'm a victim of sexual abuse so it hit so fucking hard. I cant do it anymore. I'm going to die tomorrow without a friend in the world who knows how I really feel. I'm so lonely. the worst part if that I've been crying to her every night about how I feel like I've reached the end of my life. shes got to be tired of keeping me alive by now right? anyways I've ruined everything for everyone I know in the last month. one more failure and I'll fucking break I cant do it anymore. my words are so shallow. no one will remember me. so goodbye, I'm ending it tomorrow. I've already given up but i guess I'm posting here because as much as i say I'm over it i still desperately want to cling to life. I cant handle the complexitys and hardships of waking up one more time
