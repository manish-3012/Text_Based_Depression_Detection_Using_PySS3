More than 2 months in at college, there is NOT one single day without having suicidal thoughtsOf course some days are less depressing than others. Some days start depressing then end hopeful. Some days are vice-versa. 


- I miss my old friends and they are slowly slipping away from my life.


- I am still having trouble connecting on a deeper level with my college friends and still come off as socially-awkward &amp; anxious. 


- I am struggling with my grades and just getting by.


- My passion is dying.


- I feel like I've become a burden and a bother to everyone around me.


- I'm tired of being in the closet and have decided to be agnostic/atheist while going back-and-forth with religion thanks to the fear of "going to hell" &amp; the conservative Christian environment around me even among my college classmates. I was supposed to come out to the only group of friends I feel 100% safe with, but it didn't happen because we're all too busy and far away from each other. 


- The suicide notes are halfway ready, but I fear I won't actually go through with it. Because even though I'm unstable enough to want to give up, I'm stable enough to still be afraid of dying or going to hell or making my friends/family sad.
