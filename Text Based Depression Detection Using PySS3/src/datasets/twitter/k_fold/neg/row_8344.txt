In three weeks I will do itI will do it on a thursday because my father and sister will be out of the house then. Going to drive to the shops, buy the things I need, instead of going to work. Come home, prepare everything and that's it. The thoughts of hurting my mom are recurring constantly these days, but I can't help it. I am sorry.
