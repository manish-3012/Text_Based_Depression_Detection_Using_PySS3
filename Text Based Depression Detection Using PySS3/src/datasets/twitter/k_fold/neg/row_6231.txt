Is it immoral to end your own sufferingI agree with the overall concepts of contractualism and the idea that we live not just for ourselves but for others. This has kept me from killing myself for the past 5-6 years. However, if I no longer want to live isnâ€™t that my issue and shouldnâ€™t others owe it to me to allow me to do it? I have saved up enough money to ensure my death is not a hardship for anyone and they will be able to financially survive after Iâ€™m gone. Let me know your thoughts.
