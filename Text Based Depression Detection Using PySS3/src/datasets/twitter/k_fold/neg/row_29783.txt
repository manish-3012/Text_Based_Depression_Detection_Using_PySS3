I'm to scared to kill myselfI'm 14 now and i dont know what to do, i havetred to kill myself when i was 12 and failed but as i got older i realised that i dont know what it's like after death and it scares me i dont know what to do i feel like aworthless failure and other people actually have real problems whereas im just some kid who thinks he is sad. I use to have lots of freinds but have drifted with all of them and also my family just becaus i feel as if i will fail them and i dont even think that i will live to see 20.
