This is it, this is the endI know what everybody is going to say, that it gets easier, that I'm not alone in my pain, but really I am. I've been living this shitty life for 19 years and what have I accomplished, apart from surprisingly graduating from highschool. But really there was no point, my grades were so bad there was no chance for me to get into university. I've worked a few shitty jobs this year and have hated it. This last job that I'm at I could almost see a future waiting for me in it, but now I've apparently done something wrong and I will most likely lose it when my job tomorrow. It's as though the universe is just torturing me, giving me glimpses of hope and then shoving it in my face laughing at me. That's what most people do though, I'm the laughing stock of wherever I go, because I'm fat, ugly, and completely useless and gullible. I will do or believe pretty much whatever anybody tells me because I'm an idiot. Not to mention all the shit I put up with from people always bringing me down and bullying me. From my first day of school to now, 14 out of 19 years of my I've been bullied and stepped on. The reason why I let people do it? Because I'm nice. That's all I hear from people, that I'm nice and generous so people take that for granted. I've contemplated suicide since I was 14, the last 5 years I've always thought it might be better next year, but deep down I knew it wouldn't be, I don't know why I keep trying, I really don't. This is probably going to be the last thing I ever write or say to anyone, today is the day that I'm going to end it all, the only thing I need to decide is how. There are a lot of meds in our cabinet, that probably sounds like the best way to do it.
