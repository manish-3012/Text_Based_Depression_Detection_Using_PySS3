Tonight's the night I guessEdit: Some context would be good, I'm 17 and going nowhere. I've tried a lot to pick myself up but i can'tâ€¦ i was happy, I thought it was over and I could start fresh but apparently not, I'm posting this on a throwaway but I'm going to say a few things anyway. I have a great family and great friends, if by any chance you of you reading this know me, I love you and I'm sorry. If my girlfriend is reading this it's clear that you don't feel the same way. When I get home, hopefully I can end this. Goodbye
