I hurt myself constantly by watching romantic moviesMy desire for love is so fucking intense that at literally any point in my life, I'm right at the edge of crying, but I mostly can't. So I watch romantic movies where the guy and the girl always talk about love and loving each other and this and that and as someone who will never ever be loved no matter what I do or dont do, its the only window I have to peek into what it feels like. I've never been loved and I never will, and I know that watching these movies only messes me up and makes me want to die more, but I just need to feel something, even if its just unbearable sadness loaded on top of the loneliness. I used to spend endless days crying about how I wont be loved, but now I've run out of energy for that.

Thankfully, I fulfilled one of my last wishes not long ago, and I have a gun, so I should finally be escaping this hell soon. I hope its soon. Please pray its soon.
