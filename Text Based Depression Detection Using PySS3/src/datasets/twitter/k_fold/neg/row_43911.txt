My wife has taken everythingMy wife, who I love, has destroyed me.  I canâ€™t even function anymore.  She didnâ€™t do it out of malice.  Our house is a wreck. She is a hoarder. Itâ€™s taken over the house. Iâ€™ve begged her to get help but she thinks she can handle it herself.  Not only does it make my house  awful it has wrecked us financially. Iâ€™ve lived with this stress for a decade. Itâ€™s eaten me away. I canâ€™t function right any more. Iâ€™m tired of it I want it to end. The only thing thatâ€™s keeping me going is the kids.  But itâ€™s so hard. Iâ€™m tired. She canâ€™t fix a problem she doesnâ€™t see.
