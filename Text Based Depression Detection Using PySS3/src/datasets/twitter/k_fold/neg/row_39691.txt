Sinking lower every day.I basically don't want to be alive anymore. every moment is so wretched and painful I can hardly bear it. I live at home with my psycho religious parents and have to always tip toe around them. I am very psychologically and emotionally weak, I can't move out because I'm afraid that my life will get even worse if I leave. Plus they said they would never speak to me again and act as if I never existed. 

I hate my existence and I'm always worrying. I've been in therapy for 8 years and have been on several medications, none of which have helped. I'm sick of suffering just so others can be okay. I can't even get away from it in my sleep because I have nightmares every night. I'm not allowed to be who I am or live my life because of my parents and it's killing me. My friends say not to kill myself for their sake, but it's selfish of them to say that when they don't know my suffering. I'm trudging along every day going deeper and deeper in to depression and anxiety. My body is in so much pain.
