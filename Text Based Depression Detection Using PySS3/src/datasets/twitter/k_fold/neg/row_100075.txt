Do you ever feel like youâ€™ve missed your chance? That your opportunity to die passed and now youâ€™re stuck living in a fucked up torturous existence?Itâ€™s a lot.
I had a chance last summer, a few chances before. I vomited things up. The bleeding wasnâ€™t fast enough, my subconscious was too strong, I didnâ€™t know how to turn the safety off the gun.
I feel like I had an opportunity, and I didnâ€™t take it because I couldnâ€™t figure it out and now Iâ€™m stuck.
My life is going downhill so slowly, everything is increasing in difficulty and Iâ€™m not able to keep up with it all. I canâ€™t keep operating like this, and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

I keep finding myself wishing that nothing and nobody in the world loved me, so I wouldnâ€™t feel the need to keep existing.

Is it bad that I donâ€™t want to die? Iâ€™m just....so tired of it, and it seems the easiest thing to do now.
