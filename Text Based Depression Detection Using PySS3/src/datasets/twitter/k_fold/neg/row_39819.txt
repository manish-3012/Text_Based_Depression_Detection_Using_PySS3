Possible helpful thoughts to the community here.Well Iâ€™ve had my own bout with a suicide attempt trying to OD.. Of course it failed and Iâ€™m still here. The attempt made me throw up green stomach acid for 24 hours + and it raised my liver enzymes from 40 to 1100 or so..

I know how some of you feel so trapped in a dark place with no escape... I also wonâ€™t be one of those people saying itâ€™ll be better if you donâ€™t because I know how hard it is...

Just remember itâ€™s â€œthe darkest just before dawnâ€..

I still have thoughts of suicide but after that attempt I have a better appreciation for life.

A couple helpful thoughts that help me overcome this problem is...

1: Write all of your feelings in a journal before you act on anything.. This will help get your emotions out so they arenâ€™t all bottled up inside waiting to explode.

2: Seek help, here or a therapist. Iâ€™m seeing one right now and itâ€™s really helpful. And yes, itâ€™s normally doctor patient confidentiality..

3: See your family doctor and tell them that you are depressed. One medication that helped me, even better than Xanax is â€œEscitalopramâ€.

4: Heck, you see it here... If you see someone in a similar situation try and help them or talk with them. Perhaps you can both help each other.

I just hope that everyone going through these dark times will reconsider suicide.

Best wishes and prayers sent to all!!! And a special thanks to all of those here trying to help!!

Damn it, Iâ€™m getting teary eyed writing this..
