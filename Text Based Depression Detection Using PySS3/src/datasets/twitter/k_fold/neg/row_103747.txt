My life doesn't feel worth livingMy husband wants a divorce and I'm devastated.  He is the one person I chose to spend the rest of my life with,  but he doesn't think I'm worth fighting for.  That kills me.  My ENTIRE life I've been left by people that I love. I've gone through this shit from the moment I was born.  My parents didn't want me, my grandparents treated me like shit, I struggled making friends in school,  my oldest daughter's  dad's family hated me and he left me,  now this.  I just suck at life. My half brother molested me for like 3yrs and my grandparents didn't do shit and got mad at me for finally telling my high school counselor. I'm so tired of fighting. I'm so tired of trying to keep people in my life who don't want to be. I'm so tired of being hurt.  No one wants to be alone,  but I feel so alone.  I have 3 kids and I'm trying to think of them,  but it's so hard.  I just don't want to keep going through life anymore only to be hurt and thrown away by more people in the future.  I self injured last night for the first time in 9 years and for the first time EVER,  sleeping on it hasn't made me feel better.  I still feel like I want to die.
