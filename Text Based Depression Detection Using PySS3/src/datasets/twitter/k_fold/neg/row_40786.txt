I really want to dieI have the feeling like inside me that knows I want to die. I have for a long time. It's just my mother. she is so controlling and she is ruining my life. I don't want to sound like a overdramatic 15 year old girl.. But I am in grad school and I am an adult and she still feels like she can control everything I do. I don't know how to really explain how she is but yeah. I can't stop cutting myself and I don't want to upset my girlfriend by killing myself. But I really really REALLY want to. I've basically just given up on my future I honestly don't give a fuck about anything anymore.
