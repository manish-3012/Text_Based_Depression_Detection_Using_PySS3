I don't want this anymoreI don't want to feel anymore. I want to stop feeling, I want to stop being "the quiet, nice kid", I want to stop trying to seem okay, I want to stop trying my best, I want to stop being a mistake noone ever notices, I want to stop having panic attacks when I talk to people, I just want to stop.

Why should I keep trying, when I don't even want this damn life.
