If I didnâ€™t live in a state where it was so god damned hard to get a gun Iâ€™d have checked out a long time agoThe wonderful irony of it all is Iâ€™m extremely pro-gun control. But if the laws in my late were more lax, Iâ€™d 100% have bought one and finally put an end to my life, and Iâ€™ve done so little I hesitate to even call it that. Itâ€™s just a state of existing, Iâ€™m a zombie without the quench for brains. Iâ€™m hesitant to use another method seeing as a bullet to the skull is by far the most effective, and the last thing I need is a botched attempt that leaves me in the ICU straddled with an unfathomable debt or worse.

Why canâ€™t I live and be happy like so many others? Scratch that, why canâ€™t I simply live like others do? Everyone around me has things going on for them while I canâ€™t even think of a single thing that makes life worthwhile for me. Why canâ€™t I just fall asleep and never wake up again, I can honestly say that is my biggest wish for my â€œlifeâ€ right now.
