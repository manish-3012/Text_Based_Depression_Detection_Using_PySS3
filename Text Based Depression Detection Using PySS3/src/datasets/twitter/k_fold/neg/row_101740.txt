New to SW.  Saw a post in another sub where I think OP needs support from you guys.Referring to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ac932/will_it_ever_end_i_want_to_die/) post.  Hopefully the poster will crosspost themselves, but I want to make sure this gets some attention over here.  If you see a way to support this person, please do what you can.
