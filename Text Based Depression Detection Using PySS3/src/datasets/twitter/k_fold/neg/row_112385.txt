I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.Hey guys and girls Iâ€™m not sure I can do this anymore. Today has been one of the worse days in my life and there is no escape.

My entire life Iâ€™ve had obsessive thoughts that have pretty much made me a shut in I just canâ€™t seem to enjoy life and when I finally feel calm o have another obession or truth Iâ€™m just denying

When I was 15 I started questioning if I was a homosexual I guess thatâ€™s not uncommon but my entire life I had been into women (and obviously so might I add) so it came as a bit of a shock. Not at 26 after a bit of experience I have truly found out I am straight but it seems to be in the worst way.

As I said before Iâ€™ve always struggled with sexuality and about 2 months ago I was watching porn and had a thought pass though my head â€œhm I wonder if I like watching sex more than having sexâ€ and since then Iâ€™ve been in a downspiral about being a cuckold. I donâ€™t want to finally met the girl of my dreams just to watch another guy fuck her. I donâ€™t want to sleep on the couch knowing there in the other room having sex but managed to get off to a cuckolding fantasy for the first time today and I canâ€™t help thinking about just ending my life I just want to be normal. Iâ€™m not saying that the fetish isnâ€™t normal but it feels the same way that telling myself I am a homosexual it just isnâ€™t right I donâ€™t care what my mind tells me 

I canâ€™t stop drinking and crying and feeling like punching someone in the face Iâ€™m do angry I never want to leave my house again I had dreams once and I was close to accomplishing them and now I just want to get fat and die. Does any one have any advice? Iâ€™m not even sure if this is the place to post something like this but reddit ocd is all just fuck boy memes now
