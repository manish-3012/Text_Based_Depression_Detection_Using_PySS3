Let's be honestThe world is going to shit. People are angry all the time, argue 24/7, only focus on the negatives, ruin EVERYTHING for EVERYONE, etc. Etc. I know I'm kind of a hypocrite saying people only focus on the negatives, as I myself am doing that, but it's really fucking hard to ignore them. Seriously, no matter how positive I try to be, there's always something or someone there to shut me down. I'm sick of it, dude. I'm only 16 and I'm tired of the fucking world. Should I talk to a therapist??
