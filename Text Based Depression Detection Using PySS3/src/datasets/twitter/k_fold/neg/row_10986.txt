struggling to ask for helpHi,

I've been on a downward spiral for a while now, since the start of lockdown, but it has been getting worse recently. A lot worse, it's everyday now I have to really try not to kill myself. 

There is nobody I can talk to, I don't trust the local healthcare professionals at all, this is based on my experience from three years ago when I tried to kill myself. There is/was a local NP group who were better but Covid has seen them closed since March. I've tried lifeline in the past but that was worse than the local HCPs, it just feels like they have a script to work through and if your problems are not sort by following the script then tough. 

I no longer live in my home country so all my old friends are not an option and after our split my ex told a lot of lies about me. People seem so happy to believe something awful about another person just because it is juicier gossip than the boring option. 

So I don't know where to turn, it must be pretty bad if strangers on the interent are my best bet. Everyday it gets worse and I don't think i'll be able to hold it off much longer.
