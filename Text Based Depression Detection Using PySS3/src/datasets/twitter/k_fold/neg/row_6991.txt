I want to give up.Hi, so... First things first. I'm a teen in high school, Asian to be exact. 

So let me start off by saying, my father has been a fucking asshole and I can't stand it anymore. My mom is just there but he abuses her too. With all of this abuse, I'm sick of it. Everything he tells me to do is forced. I no longer enjoy playing instruments. I cannot play them my own way and I get yelled at if I do. I can't seem to escape him breaking down my mind. I feel like I'm gonna just go soon. Grades are okay, but he always pressures me to do something useless, as in my school system an A- gives a 4.0 just like an A+. I get emotionally beat for it and I'm sick. I don't have any freedom in my house. I feel like I'm being strangled and I'm constantly sad. There's almost no escapes for me.
