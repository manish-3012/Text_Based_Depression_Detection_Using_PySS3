Thinking about suicide after noticing how FUCKED UP THIS WORLD ISYes... This probably sounds silly as hell but hey I don't care..

I'm think about suicide ALOT the last couple of weeks. You probably don't know but at this moment there is an heatwave going on in the Netherlands and it's like 37 degrees Celsius where I live.

And then when I check like Twitter or the news everyone is saying that it's just weird but there is nothing going one. And what I mean with this that they think global warming is fake and just a hoax... Seriously Antarctica is fucking melting sea levels are rising and if this heatwave is going on in this country it will be the hottest month ever here. Animals are fucking dying due to global warming.... But still people think it's fake seriously these people need to let their brain checked.

And then you have the plastic soup... All those poor animals that are dying due to plastic and they can't do nothing about because we humans use so much plastic but are to lazy to throw our  shit away and now all those poor animals are suffering due to US humans... And the weird thing is that we didn't even needed plastic 70 years ago. But now it's everywhere I get so fucking mad when I see people throwing there thrash on the ground.. 

And then we have deforestation.... All those trees and again those poor INNOCENT animals that are losing there home because us HUMANS need some fucking trees... It's so sad to see all of this. So many animals are on the edge of extinction because we shoot them or kill them because we need it for something stupid. Just disgusting... 

And the worst think about it is that we citizens can't do alot. Except for eating less meat or use less plastic. For the solution we need to look politics but then we have morons like trump who don't fucking care....


And yes there are ALOT of wars everywhere around the world and innocent people get killed...

FUCK. THIS. WORLD.

Sorry if there are some grammatical errors...
