Depressed friend is gonna ruin life not by suicide but running away because of abuse from parents and self loathingHi, this is gonna be really weird, but i have a friend who has no job and money in ohio. They are being kicked out of the house because of their parents in 3 hours or so. I know this isn't exactly suicide but i don't know where I could post that people would respond and want to help. What I'm asking for is does anybody know of a homeless shelter or something close to Winchester, ohio? Also Do you know of any other resources or places that they could find help?  They are underage and can't work because of that BTW.
