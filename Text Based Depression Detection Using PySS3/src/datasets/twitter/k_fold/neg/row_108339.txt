WORTHLESS [no other /reddit cares, why should I? I welcome the night]I'm a bad person. Never did anything evil, but I really feel like I can't contribute to society. I know quantum mechanics, general relativity, political science (my major), economics (my other major), etc.

And yet I feel stupid and alone. I grew up with no family or parents. I was in foster care much of my life. therefore, I learned nothing and have no REAL adult experience. I literally have no idea what I'm doing.

I thought I'd join the army. I was a combat medic 2004 to 2005. got injured; went home. as if home exists.

I've been poor for years. at least Mr. Fiengold helped me get a MINIMAL amount of disability for my injuries sustained as a combat medic. other than that, I have nothing. I worked in politics for the Republicans, and now I don't qualify for unemployment b/c they deny whole MONTHS that I worked for them.

Two years ago I was diagnosed with a heart disease. Genetic. Progressive. I met my dad after that. I was nice, but it was hard...

Now here I am. No job, no family to help. My dad...haha. Heart disease. Government refuses my pleases for help...I owe over 200 some dollars in bills because I was in between insurance when it happened.

My only friend...my brother...moved to Florida. I I Want to die... My only friend now is my stuffed tiger who has been my friend since I was a baby.

I have tried and contimplated suicide.

Reddit, I hate to do this to you...

but

I'm crying out the only friends/community I know for help.

what can I do? Please tell me something that means I shouldn't die. b/c right now I feel Like I'm wasting your time. Being smart is one thing...I can talk all day about particle mechanics...but I can't get a job, or a good woman, and my intelligence can't find a job.

why shouldn't I just die and leave humanity in peace?

I swear this is not done in an attempt to get attention. I just want to know what I can do or if it's just not worth it.

I saw a train today. I had the chance; but something in me stopped it.
