when is the end going to comeEver since I was around the age of 5-6 believe it or not I wanted to die. I told myself that I would do it in the right time and I have nothing to loose.. But since I got older, I matured.. Its not so easy to leave everything behind.. I want the pain , sadness and dissatisfaction with life to disappear and me along with them.. But its so hard... to live with a body which wants to die and a mind constantly struggling. I own everything to my brother, mother, grandma and best friend.. They care so much about me and I feel like a failure in life, unable to do the same for them.. My brother is about to give up almost everything so I can have a better life.. He wants to invest in me and my future because my parents dont have the resources to do that... He believes in me in a way that I dont...... I am crying right now thinking of what could happen.. I am sick of letting everyone in my life down. I really dont know what to do, where would life take me. People say its easy to be young, its fucking not.
