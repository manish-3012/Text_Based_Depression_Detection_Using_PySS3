i feel like i wasted my life, and idk what to doi feel like iâ€™ve made so many mistakes in the past and i just live a life i didnâ€™t want to live. i was unmotivated and depressed for most of high school, so i didnâ€™t get accepted into any colleges, i didnâ€™t even get money from goddamn fafsa. i donâ€™t have any friends, my â€œclosestâ€ friends donâ€™t even talk to me properly anymore and thatâ€™s due to a mixture of self isolation and just drifting apart from each other. i have severe social anxiety so talking to people at work is hard, and i just feel like i canâ€™t relate to any of my coworkers. iâ€™m stuck in some shitty retail job (sadly enough i write this before my shift on black friday), but i still canâ€™t afford even community college. but i donâ€™t know what i want to do in college, wtf i want to major in and where i want to take my life. i feel like i have no help, my family thinks that because iâ€™m 18 now iâ€™m in no way obligated to receive help from any of them through any life events because i â€œneed to learn to grow upâ€.  i feel stuck. iâ€™m constantly relapsing on self harm and my eating disorder, and i just have so many emotions. i want to be pretty, i want to be liked, i want to be fucking dead. i feel like i sound crazy or like a crybaby but iâ€™m just tired, on every level possible. especially mentally. i constantly dream about what would happen if i killed myself, how i would do it and how people would probably react. i donâ€™t know if i even care that a few select people would be sad, because the overwhelming majority would forget about me soon.
