I need a reason to live..Seriously, I don't have any desire to live anymore. I just don't, I'm thinking about swallowing some pills tonight, driving to a nice quite spot and see what will happen. I don't know why I'm wasting time posting here, its never helped me in the past. I guess this is final goodbye
