Lifeâ€™s probably a Simulation So Who Cares About DeathIâ€™m mentally done and I just want out. Everyoneâ€™s gonna forget I existed. Weâ€™re probably being watched by the government. Honestly, I donâ€™t care if Iâ€™m hurting people by killing myself. I want to die because of my suffering, and Iâ€™m not gonna let anyone elseâ€™s want for me to live overpower that thought. Iâ€™m not afraid to kill myself. I want to but I donâ€™t have the guts to for Iâ€™m only a young teenager.
