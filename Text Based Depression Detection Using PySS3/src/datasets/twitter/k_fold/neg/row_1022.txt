I have the most disgusting personality out of everyoneI am a sober teetotal brit.  Drunk Brits are being sensible and having fun in pubs after more than 20 pints while the preachy teetotal subhumans are spitting in other people's faces, yelling at managers because their food wasn't healthy enough, and going on about how it's healthy to not smoke.

I am a disgusting piece or shit for not drinking, smoking or eating food that tastes GOOD.  I am a preachy fucking degenerate.  People like me cough in people's faces while telling ACTUAL HUMANS off for throwing up and getting others to hold their hair back like most sensible British people.  I don't deserve to be British. 

Being a clean eater most of the time makes me a gross asshole.  It is impossible to change my personality and to get rid of these VILE habits that make me an obnoxious dangerous asshole to other people.

If I can't change my personality to enjoy throwing up while drunk in public, smoking and eating junk food most of the time, by tomorrow, I am going to end my life.  I NEED TO be a good sensible safe person and not some disgusting freak.  People who don't drink, smoke or eat junk food are degenerates will be the main cause of the second wave of coronavirus in this country.
