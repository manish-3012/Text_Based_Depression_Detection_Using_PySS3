I wanted to tell a story, but then...then I realized what I probably would get are posts encouraging me to hold on, to keep going. And I realized that's not what I want. I want to die. I want to let go. I thought about telling a story about my life and how it's hopeless to keep going. but my story doesn't matter. what I want is to stomp out whatever spark keeps my fire going. I want to extinguish all doubts. What I want is to be gone. I have lots to drink and a rope, and tonight I'll fight again to defeat the treacherous bastard that is hope. I welcome any thoughts on this, preferably in pm form. wish me luck. (or don't). Here we go.
