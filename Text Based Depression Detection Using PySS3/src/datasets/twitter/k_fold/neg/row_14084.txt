Even I am sick of my shit at this pointI sabotage every good thing in my life. The only thing I know how to succeed at is failure.

Everyone who has ever loved me has been tortured and dragged through hot coals and broken glass until one day they finally just couldn't do it anymore. I've had the best person in the world having my back for over a decade, and I shit all over that 2 nights ago by cheating with his friend. He's already had to pick me up and dust me off after every other bullshit move I make, and here I am, trying to seal the deal and get under the skin with the worst fucking betrayal, something many relationships never recover from. 

I can feel that it was a success this time. I hate it so much. I can't even look at myself. And the person I cheated with flipped a switch and turned on me too. So now I'm not only a fucking whore, I'm a fucking whore with no one in her corner. All of our mutual friends will now be advising that he dump me. It's going to go so fucking viral. I had to pick the biggest fucking loudmouth, didn't I? As for *my* friends? Well I haven't fucking got any. A few from my last workplace that I *consistently flake on* until they've mostly given up on me too.

I'm not even the fucking victim here yet look at me whining about my life. You probably got sick of my shit after the first fucking sentence too. So fuck it. I just want to cash out. It will fucking crush him but at least it will only be *one* more way I will hurt him. He will suffer forever if I don't. He says he doesn't want to leave me. There is only one way to save him from me.
