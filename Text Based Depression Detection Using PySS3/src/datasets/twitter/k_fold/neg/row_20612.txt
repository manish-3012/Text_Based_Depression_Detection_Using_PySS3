Even after all this time, it still lingersLife isn't great overall. I don't have any in real life friends to hang out with, and likely stuck with a part time job at a grocery chain while probably looking into community College while people from my grade cohort are already starting to graduate and looking for jobs in the field of their choice.

It's not as bad as it used to be where I had severe suicidal thoughts and plans/actions, and while I suppose I'm not necessarily actively suicidal at the moment, I do often just feel like I'm just waiting for the end.

There just feels so little hope. I only feel an overwhelming sense of lonliness in my near or even far future. It's hard for me to get over my past when I had things going for me on my own terms and it was taken away from me due to unnecessary hospitalizations and very poor choices of medications given to me which exacerbated the problems I had with mental stability and suicidal thinking.

I'm just waiting everyday for it to get better one day where I'm actually content and energized in my life. But that has turn from weeks into months and now into years. I'm tired.
