I feel like I'm battling a terminal illness...My life circumstances are starting to seem better, so of course my mental illness is on the attack. I'm working full time and being a catmom and trying to get some social time in and the apartment is just getting messier and messier. I know that even if he says he won't, my boyfriend will eventually resent me for not pulling my weight around here. I hate watching him clean when I'm just so tired and overwhelmed that I can't. My depressive symptoms are kicking in full force and I feel like he would be ao much better off if I were dead. As I'm sure many of you know, suicidal thoughts can feed on themselves until they become all consuming. I'm so tired of not beig able to do everything I'm supposed to. I'm sick of moving forward and being shoved back. It's getting very hard to see the point in trying anymore. Why bother if it's just going to turn out the same way no matter what? Sometimes I feel like I'm battling a terminal illness.
