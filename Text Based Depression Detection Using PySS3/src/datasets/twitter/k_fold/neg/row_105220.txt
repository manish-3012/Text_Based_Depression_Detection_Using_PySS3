My dad encouraged me to commit suicide and my mom witnessed it and didn't say anythingI have been hospitalized for three attempts in the past ten years.

I am 28. I was in a serious accident two years ago and live with intense chronic pain. I am on a medical leave from school and moved back in with my parents so I could go to a pain clinic every two weeks to have dozens of intensely painful needles into my face, neck, TMJ, and head. The relief from them doesn't last nearly long enough to endure these needles in the first place.

I have blinding headaches, nerve damage, embarrassing problems with sweating, twitching, and dropping things from the nerve damage. My spine feels like it's on fire. I am young and after this accident, have never been able to sit or stand fully straight. People tell you to just hold your head up high - literally can't.

Every day, my parents undermine the severity of my injuries. I am legally required to be driven from the pain clinic and am discouraged from even leaving in a cab without an escort because of dangerous drops in blood pressure after the session. 

My parents make me feel like children. I have no friends or family. They tell me I should "stop complaining and drive myself," and that they complained to people at work about having to drive me, and they insisted THEIR mother would never drive them two hours to the city. I asked my mom if she mentioned to this person that the destination in the city was a pain clinic, and that the passenger was in severe pain on the way there, and in severe pain AND legally impaired on the way home and of course, she left that out. But anything to make me feel bad and make me feel like a leech and a failure of a person when I have been struggling to eat solid food or arrange my neck on a pillow to sleep at night for years. She just has to let me know that she is going behind my back telling people that I am so lazy and have these outlandish expectations of her as though I am some typical basement dweller who has had ANY choice in these circumstances.

I told them I should just fucking do it. Before this accident and this pain, I kept coming so close. I didn't even know how bad things could get, and now my eyes are open to the horrors of the world and I know it can only get worse. I want to do it. My PT says people with the same injury are struggling just as much 20 years later. My life is already over and I'm already in hell.

I told them I was going to do it and that it was always on my mind. Without doxxing myself, I live near a "suicide landmark" (destination? idk) and I was explicit about how my thoughts are so dark now that it feels like a relief knowing it is so close by.

My dad told me to just do it then because I'm always talking about it and he's tired of hearing it. He told me this before my first attempt and I ended up having my stomach pumped in the hospital. When my dad told me to kill myself again, I screamed and cried. I told my mom that he'd said that to me last time and I did it. My mom was on vacation when it happened. She told me I had probably planned that on purpose and I wasn't suicidal, I was just trying to ruin her vacation. If I wanted to die I'd be dead.

I covered my ears while I heard this and started shouting to please stop, this is escalating, please walk away, I am not responding to this. I did what my therapist told me to do. But there is only so much a person can do about living with the kind of people who think so little of boundaries that when a desperate and suffering person has to scream over you to not hear you goad them into suicide. My therapists give up. What are they supposed to do? I have no way out from under them in this pain. I am on disability and it's not enough to manage the cost of living. I can't move somewhere else because I have nobody and depending on the severity of the pain, I struggle to take care of myself. They are killing my humanity and my will to live with every day I spend with them.

These are the people that put me in the world. They don't care if I live or die. They don't care if I suffer in pain in this world, they just want me to stop annoying them. So much so they want me to kill myself so I'll go away.

I don't have friends, I don't have family. Therapy does nothing and I have been in therapy for 20 years. It's not covered in my country so I have gone into debt paying for therapy and now I am injured and not working. I accept there is nothing more I can do. I don't want help, I really just want to say goodbye and explain to someone why I'm doing this. There is no comfort in this world, and least of all, no mercy. I need to do what I need to do.
