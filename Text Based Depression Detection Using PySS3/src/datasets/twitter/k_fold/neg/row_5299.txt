I am scared of seing myselfim 16, i know it sounds like any teen, but i havent had a good life. im diagnosed with severe depression and PTSD. and to be honest i dont think ima make it.

I wake up everyday with new cuts and new wounds and when i look myself in the mirror al i see is failure. im so scared of hurting the few people in my life and everytime i do a misstake i fall apart, im scared. im scared of the way im feeling, im scared of what ive been thru and i cant even sleep anymore.

I get happy if i sleep 2 hours a night untill i pass out becouse of how little i sleep, and i know i can turn to my friends but i feel like if i tell them what i feel they will look at me diffrently.

I dont know what to do, ive tried to talk about it but i just cant, and it is eating me from the inside and soon im gonna blow and pull the trigger
