Suicide is my optionI thought a lot about it and I had very suicidal phases. I'm now at the state again that I am sure Suicide is an option for me. By experience it will get worse in some days and after that I'll be worse than ever before. Since I don't know how I can be worse and still survive I'll be ending it this time. It may sound rational but it is meant as I said it.
