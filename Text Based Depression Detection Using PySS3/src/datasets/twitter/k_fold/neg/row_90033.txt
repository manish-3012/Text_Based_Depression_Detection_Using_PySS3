How do I tell my mum I attempted suicide ?Last night I took 10-20 pumps of an asmol inhaler in one go, hoping it would send me into cardiac arrest or knock me out at the least. (Very stupid plan but I was emotional and desperate)

Obviously it didnâ€™t but Iâ€™m very shaky and just donâ€™t feel good. Itâ€™s been 9 hours and the feeling hasnâ€™t gone away.

I think I should tell my mum but I donâ€™t know how.
