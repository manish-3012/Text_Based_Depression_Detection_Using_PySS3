Can someone give me some videos to watch? Hi. I'm autistic and suicidal. I feel like I can't be around people. I've never been in a relationship where I've felt the other person really cares for me. I just spent a half hour googling different ways to off myself. I've had thoughts about doing it for awhile. I hate the constant ups and downs of life. The second I think I can get close to someone and I become attached she backs away and I crash down. I have few friends and I just hate the dating game. I don't have any stability in my life. There are two people in the world that I don't want to hurt. So I just need something to watch to help me realize that I can have good feelings. 

God; I feel so selfish for wanting to end it. More than the two aforementioned people would probably be hurt by me killing myself, but I don't care so much about them. Just the two people. I feel like one of them wont even be close to me for much longer. I wanted to let a third person into my life, but she just keeps backing away, and I feel toyed with. 

The worst part is I'm not even unattractive. I'm actually a good looking dude. There are probably people on here way worse off than I. Fuck, I just hate dating. 

I'm just transcribing my rambling thoughts into type. It's just so hard to find love. 

Any videos that would help an autistic kid be a bit more optimistic about life would be great.
