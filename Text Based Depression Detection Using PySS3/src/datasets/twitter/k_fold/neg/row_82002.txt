I think this it.My ex of 3 years ghosted me. Itâ€™s been 8 months and I havenâ€™t heard from him. 

But he has someone new. 

I hooked up with a guy who gave me herpes. 

I was raped by a former old friend a few weeks ago. 

I canâ€™t do this anymore. 
Everything just keeps getting worse. 
But I guess I deserve it.

I donâ€™t understand why he didnâ€™t love me anymore but now no one will. How could they? 

I feel disgusting. But most of the time I just feel sad and lonely and empty.

Donâ€™t have insurance anymore and canâ€™t afford to talk to anyone. 

I donâ€™t have any friends. 

I am a burden to the family I have left. 

I just want to disappear forever. I hope I do.

Just wanted someone to know I guess. 

Bye, Reddit.
