I failed.I feel like a complete and utter idiot. I was sure this was it, that it was finally going to happen this past sunday or that I'd at least go into liver failure later into the week...but I didn't. I'm still here. And apparently everyone but me knew that they dont actually kill you, I'm very upset with the internet for lying to me as well!

Mostly I'm upset with myself...how does one overdose improperly? What more do I need to do? I am so sick of being here and of people telling me how I actually want to be here when I don't. I'm tired of hearing people tell me it gets better or that my life isn't that bad. 

I DO NOT WANT TO TALK. I DO NOT WANT TO BE HERE. I HATE BEING ALIVE. Does no one else on the planet feel this way? It's hard to imagine out of almost seven billion people, that I'm the only one to feel this way. I don't want to be here anymore, and I need to find a better exit route. 

Sorry for the rant :/
