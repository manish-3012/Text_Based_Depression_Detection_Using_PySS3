It's so weird...It's been a while since I've been thinking about suicide but these two past days have been different. I kind of feel better and yesterday I even went out for a walk with "my" dog (walking has always been one of my favorite activities but I hadn't done it since September, I just didn't feel motivated to do so even if I wanted to) and watched a movie (it had been a month since I last watched one and I'm very, very fond of movies). Doing these things made me veyr happy to be honest.

Anyway, I'd been thinking for a while about offing myself after Easter break, yet I don't feel the same about it right now but there is something in my head telling me that I have to do it and that it has always been how I should go. Honestly, when I think about my future there is nothing to look forward to. I've always felt and been alone. I hate myself for being so needy and for wanting someone to care about me. I don't know why my mood has radically changed this way but these thoughts sure as hell bother me endlessly. I mean, it's like I can't shake them off and even when I feel better they are there no matter what. I'm so fucked up like yesterday I watched videos of people committing suicide and one of them made me feel so sick I almost threw up. I know they will come back, it's always been like this since 2015. Sometimes I'm amazed at how much of a coward I am, even at my lowest.     

I don't know what I'm looking but is it normal to feel this way? to think about it even when I'm fine?
