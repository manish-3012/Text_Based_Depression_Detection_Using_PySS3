It will never be like that againI'm a complete ugly inexperienced socially awkward loser. There was this girl I was friends with online (imagine that?) and after years of being friends, we had a week together. It was amazing, I had never had a girlfriend before, certainly never felt love before and never with someone who was so beautiful and fun. But she lost interest in me. I've always felt empty, depressed and suicidal (which shocked me why she would even like me in the first place). Now all I can think is about that experience, about how it's never happened before and I don't believe it'll happen again. I don't think a girl would ever like me back, especially not one like her. But it isn't even about her, I'm just a loser. I just graduated and I made the wrong choices. I don't think I can do anything. Not just for a living, nothing is worth doing.
