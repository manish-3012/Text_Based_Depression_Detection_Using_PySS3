I feel like im losing itI feel so disconnected from the people around me at work and even my with my loved ones. Ive always been shy and had a hard time opening up but its years of social isolation is taking its toll on me. I dunno man I just feel like such a failure at life. Socially, academically, and i guess financially too lol. Three years at my community college with nothing to show for it, below average grades with my gpa hovering at around 2.00.  My degree is accounting and i had intended to transfer elsewhere but i know Iâ€™ll get refused, no 4 year college will want me. Iâ€™m not involved in anything and im just not well rounded. I dont know what to do Im just treading water. Not going in any direction whatsoever. I donâ€™t have many friends and I feel so insignificant to everyone. Like they can look through me and tell what a loser i am. I guess the only thing that stops me is that I think of the  pain that it would inflict on my mom. I donâ€™t think her sweet heart could handle it and that whatâ€™s stopping me.  I mostly wanted to just vent a bit. Thank you.
