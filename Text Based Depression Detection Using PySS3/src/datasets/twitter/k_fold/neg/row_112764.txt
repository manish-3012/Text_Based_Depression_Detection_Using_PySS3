I just wanna fucking die thats itPeople say, it's your loss if you commit suicide cuz the world is a beautiful place. If the world was a beautiful place, then WHY IN THE ACTUAL FUCK ISN'T IT PEACEFUL. I constantly loathe myself everyday and I fail. My job sucks, my life sucks, my dating life is non existent, I suck at sports and I was an average student at school. I'm still wondering why do I only thing about attempting suicide but don't actually kill myself so that there will be peace once and for all.
