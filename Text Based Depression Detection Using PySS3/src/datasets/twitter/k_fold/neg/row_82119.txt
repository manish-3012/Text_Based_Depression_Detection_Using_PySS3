Coming to terms with the idea of dyingIt's been a rough year and I'm about ready to just end it. 

Everything is overwhelming me to the point where it just isnt worth it anymore. I'm a full time student and I have 2 jobs (food service and an office job) just to be getting by. Ive been having a hard time scraping enough for bills, let alone food and whatever else. 

On top of that, im about to get kicked out of college. This, in and of it self, is enough to make me want to end it. But just the fact that I racked up the debt of college to not even graduate is pathetic. The idea of not getting a degree and being stuck in shitty part time jobs the rest of my life is daunting to say the least. 

I'm not finding joy in anything anymore. All the things I used to enjoy doing aren't fun anymore. I can barley bring myself to get out of bed. 

I have people who care about me, but I also know that they'll move on eventually. My parents would be happy to see me go, we havent really been on good terms since I came out to them. My younger sister is who im most worried about hurting in this. But she too will be able to move on eventually. 

The idea of of death scared me initially, which is why suicide hadn't been a serious thought. But ive researched it more and looked at stories online and Im coming to accept it, welcome it. 
Im not scared to die, im looking forward the blacl nothingness that comes after. 

Now, im coming closer and closer to just doing it. Every time I drive home, i almost just run my car off a bridge. Or when im at school I want to just jump over the railing to a 70+ foot drop. 

The idea of suicide is just becoming increasingly temping and life is increasingly not. 

I guess this is a last ditch effort? A rant? I dont know.
