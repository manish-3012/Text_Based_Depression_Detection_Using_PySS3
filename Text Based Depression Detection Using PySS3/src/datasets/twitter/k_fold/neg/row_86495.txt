I'm just afraidI wanted to get this out and write this down because it just sounds so normal in my head that I think I'm just ready to end it all. I've even planned it out making sure I've gotten all my affairs taken care of and written to all my friends and family. Writing it all down like this now sounds...fucking terrifying. I know I need help...I'm so scared and I don't think I want nor can be alone. I know I need help...but help is taking forever. I've made an appointment with a psychiatrist, but it's fucking next week Saturday. Will I even make it by then??? Does anyone fucking care that I'm considering killing myself? I'm so afraid. I just need someone to be here with me telling me I'll be okay. Am I ok?

Thanks for reading...it felt like a marathon writing down. Short, but what the fuck, ya know.
