My dad accidentally saved my lifeI was sitting in my room, a knife on my desk and I thought of all the shit I was going through my brother being diagnosed with cancer my grades dropping and the daily insults. I thought how bad it could it be, the after life can only be better. After having blood across my desk, my dad shouted, I love you. I put the knife down and stopped, without him I wouldnâ€™t be here writing this. I want help but am scared that people would say that Iâ€™m fine or stop lying, as my brother is going through something unimaginable, and tbh at times it feels like no one cares. I feel like trash but donâ€™t want to bother anyone, what should I do?
