I hit my head and now I feel nothingI recently found out that I'm not depressed, but I'm suffering brain damage in my frontal lobe. My brain doesn't produce emotions, I just feel numb and this underwhelming nothingness. I can't sleep, been awake for 2 days now, maybe slept 6h in total for the last week. I can't eat, I don't feel hunger, even though I didn't ate in days. I can't watch movies or series, since all I see are pictures flickering on screen. Music is just noice without any meaning. I can't even enjoy sex. It's been like that for about 5 years now and I don't think I can go on any longer. Since I know it's not depression or something that eventually will go away I don't see any point at all, but I'm to much of a coward to do it.
I'm socially isolated, I have basically no friends, didn't talk to my family for month now, even though we live in the same place.  I'm incapable to hold a conversation for more than a minute, and even if I manage to give a response to my interlocutor, it doesn't matter. It just doesn't make any sense at all. Doesn't matter what, I just can't seem to get any reaction from my brain.
My thoughts are just nonsense jumping from topic to topic, can't hold a thought for more than 5 seconds. 

The worst thing is, I don't get a break from all of this. It wouldn't stop. The second I'm awake I feel like this empty shell, till the second I pass out from exhaustion

Why should I keep doing this? My life will be miserable until I drop dead.
