High School Years- My Final Shot.My last shot, my final chance to be accepted. I have no friends, no social life, and parents who I've had to abandon for the sake of trying to prove I'm deserving to be part of the popular kids. At sixteen years old, I've already lost hope, and this is my confession.

**4th Grade:** When I first felt suicidal, and I was heavily bullied by the popular guys while girls stood by and laughed prior to that. Girls compared me to kids who were mentally challenged on who'd they'd rather date, they had guys gang up on me because they made false accusations that I sexually harassed them, and most of all... I went home crying to my mother every day because I knew I had a plan, that I was going to end my life at eleven years old. 

**6th Grade:** Anxious to socialize, I remained the introverted kid in the corner of the classroom, and eating with the teachers. A group of guys came up to me and made me feel accepted... temporarily. We went over each other's houses, played video games, went out for pizza, and while they got high I listened to their stories. 

	Until one day they found out I liked a girl, a popular girl, and when they ushered me to approach her, I introduced myself and that's when they burst out laughing. The girl's friends laughed with them, then she joined the rest. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed that that's when I realized something... I'm a loser, I will never be popular, no one will accept me, no one will like me, and most of all... My frustration turned to anger... Which then eventually turned into resentment once high school began. 

**Ninth Grade** was a brutal hell. I already lacked self-esteem and hated everyone around me, but to make matters worse... While I was in the locker room guys always talked about how they just had sex for the first time, while other's are planning to do it next week. Something about the meaning of sex made me angry, the idea that a girl could choose a list of guys and have sex with the most attractive alpha of the group, even if they made other's feel inferior. 

My hatred was building up since fourth grade and I only came to acknowledge it last year, when it got so bad that when seeing a guy talk to a girl infuriated me so much I couldn't sleep for two days straight thinking about them, I even had to do homeschooling.

Now I'm in California, moved away from my parents and with my grandparents. This is supposedly a new start. To start fresh and ignore how cruelly I was treated in the past. Except I can't, every grudge I took, to even someone not holding the door for me, is filled inside of me, waiting to explode. Due to trying to be part of the popular kids I lost touch with my parents. It's unfair that I can't live such a fulfilled life that the popular guys get. It's unfair they are rich, have sex like it's nothing before 18, and always attending parties. These last two years of high school will be my last chance.
