I'm so over this bullshit life I live.I'm physically, mentally, and emotionally tired from all the bullshit I get. 

My ex boyfriend thinking I'm talking to other guys, when, even if I was, why would it fucking bother you? Reminder. Like you reminded me, we aren't together. 

The guys who ***DO*** talk to me only say things like:
 
"Hey, baby you wanna hookup?"

"I love your tits. ðŸ˜"

"You look like a slut, let's have some fun."

And so on... 

I'm ***FUCKING TIRED*** of being seen as some sort of object. Not only to men, but to WOMEN TOO???

I get lesbians that hit on me and ask me to send them nudes. Just as much as these asshole guys do. I'm so tired of it, man. I can't keep doing this shit. 

Why can't anyone just be genuine and actually want to date me? Am I really that fucking ugly? 

Do I look that fucking easy?

I just want to cry. Nobody wants anything serious with me. They just want to use me and it's getting so tiring I just can't handle it anymore. It's bad enough I want to ***COMMIT SUICIDE*** Because of how my life is going. I'm seriously just a speck in the atmosphere, floating here. 

I have no value, no importance.

*what do I do? I'm so tired of being treated like shit by literally everyone.*
