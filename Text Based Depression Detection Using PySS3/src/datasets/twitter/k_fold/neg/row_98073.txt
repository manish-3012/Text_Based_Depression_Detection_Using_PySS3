I feel like a worthless fool, and these thoughts are strange and scare me and Idk what to do.Nothing has been going right for me. for a very long time nothing has gone right for me. I can't even remember the last time I was truly happy.

I'm tired of feeling sad
I'm tired of feeling like things are going to improve, while they get worse.
my life is deteriorating all around me.

My parents are only interested in my professional advancement. no one cares about me. My little brothers should never see me like this, so every day I see them I put on a fake smile and go about my day. My friends don't think much of me anyways, my best friend knows something's wrong, but I don't have the heart to tell him what I'm about to do.

It's been 4 years since my last romantic relationship, the woman of which I was with just recently killed herself, to which I was partially to blame for not helping her. I feel so guilty and shamed that such a thing happened. That I wasn't there for her. But recently I forgave myself, turned my attention to getting new friends and perhaps a new love, just to find out that no one really cares for me. I'm so fucking alone. It's just so hard.

Sometimes while driving to work I just feel like putting myself in danger. I drive fast, really fast. sometimes shut my eyes for a second or two. Sometimes I like to think about how easy it would be, just a jerk of the steering wheel and into obliviion i go.

a part of me wants to be better, a part of me wants people to show some compassion for me. I'm not a burden on society, I help people for a living for fucks sake. why can't anyone love me? in the same way that part of me wants it to end. for my sake and for the sake of everyone else around me. the sadness of others is temporary, the one inside me has lasted my whole life. and yes, I AM a bit socially awkward, but I try! I swear I do.

I trust no one. Everyone who has ever gotten close to me has hurt me in some way. I just want a hug.

someone fucking hug me please. im crying writing this out right now. please reddit. i hate myself right now. please
