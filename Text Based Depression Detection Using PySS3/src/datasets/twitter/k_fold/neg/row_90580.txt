I just want it to be overI've thought a lot about suicide the last week or so... the only thing that's really kept me from it are my dogs and thinking how they would feel if I just disappeared from their lives. 

I'm sick of my job. I don't see myself going anywhere particular. I don't think I have anywhere to go. I don't want to tell my mom how I really feel because she's recovering from alcoholism and I don't want to make that worse. I feel like I should be hospitalized because I'm scared I'm going to severely hurt myself but I need money to live and I have to work.  

All this stems from this stupid asshole that I can't seem to stop loving. An asshole who I should hate (and I do) but who keeps dragging me in. I love him and I hate him and I just want everything to be over. I don't want to keep on going with this. This feeling of constant heartbreak and melancholy.
