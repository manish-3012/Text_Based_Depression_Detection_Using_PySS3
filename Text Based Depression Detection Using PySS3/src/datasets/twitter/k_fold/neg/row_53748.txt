Anyone feel like talking?Kind of in a bad spot right now and just feel like I need to talk to someone.

Edit: Feel a bit more comfortable here so I think im just going to post what I told writngrl here. Sorry its a relatively large wall of text and incomplete, i'll add to it later.

Well I come from a middle class background. I am a 17 year old white male (sorry if this is useless information). I suppose this all started when I was around 4-6 years old. I was (and am currently) living with my mom, dad, and step brother. I used to have showers with my brother and I believe he sexually abused me (I can't say I remember much from back then but this sticks out) Now he was mentally disabled and has swapped out that kind of crazy to being a zealous Christian. No he hasn't done anything to harm me since then other then the general brother-brother fights. When I was young I was an overweight kid and had the confidence the coincides with being fat. Now I am of average build but still have the same self confidence issues. When I was growing up my brother was a general problem child, so a good once every two weeks I'd have to deal with loud raging arguments between both him and my father. This continued for years and at some point my mom had a mental breakdown and tried slitting her own wrists. She recovered for awhile and had another breakdown about 3 years later. She has been fine for the past two or three years. Between breakdowns I had to stop my step brother from slitting his own throat or other means of suicide.
