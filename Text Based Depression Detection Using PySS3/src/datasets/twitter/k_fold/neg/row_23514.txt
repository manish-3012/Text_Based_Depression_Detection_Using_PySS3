I feel like I have nothing left. I keep on going... but for nothingI miss when I was in high school and I didn't have to work so god damn hard to have friends. I miss when every interaction I had didn't remind me of how different I am. I miss when I didn't want to die all the time. I miss when I actually knew how my therapist could help me and didn't say nothing in our sessions because there are no words that can cure a broken spirit. I miss when I was in love and I felt like I had someone to live for- someone who made my heart flutter and inspired poetry. I miss when I didn't feel like there was no way to reconcile myself to God. I miss when I didn't detest my body so much that it hurt to breath. I miss when sleep was a bodily function and not a coping mechanism and when my dreams weren't always nightmares. I miss when I didn't feel like I don't matter even though everyone tells me I do. I miss when I didn't write long, cryptic vents to people saying I want to die only to tell them I'm fine two seconds later. I miss when I didn't ruin every relationship I ever had because I hate myself so much I want to be alone. I wish I wasn't so alone. I wish there wasn't a person inside my head trying to fucking kill me every waking second. I miss when I thought medication helped. I miss eating without hating myself for it. I miss my best friend. I miss her. I miss my life before depression.
