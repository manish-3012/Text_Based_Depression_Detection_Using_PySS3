This morning I was king of the world, now I'm the king of shitHello SuicideWatch,

I'm a 26 year old male. I'm a computer programmer by trade, but over the past 6 months have experienced a deterioration in my wrists due to god knows what. I went to a doctor who ran a test that let me know it's not carpal tunnel, but refuses to see me again until I can pay the $1100 I owe him. Because I'm unable to work, I'm being laid off this Friday.

I also suffer from bipolar manic depression. I was medicated many years ago, but haven't been on anything besides marijuana for a while. Lately, because of everything happening, my mood swings have become more and more drastic. This morning I felt like the most powerful man in the world (manic stage) but tonight I feel worthless. I've studied computers my whole life (wrote my first program at 4) and it feels like everything I've worked for is out of my reach.

I'm losing the pointless health insurance I had, and my doctor won't write a letter stating I'm unable to work. I'm married and the thought of not being able to provide for my wife just depresses me more.

To top it all off, all the friends and family I've supported through their troubles (depression, drug addiction, etc) are nowhere to be found, or telling me to "look on the bright side". I feel very little support.

I need help. Specifically medical help that I don't know how I'll ever get. I haven't wanted to kill myself in a long time but I can feel that creeping feeling coming back. I'm not sure why I'm posting this, but there's nobody else who will listen to my diatribe.

Please don't tell me it will get better, or that I'll never know what tomorrow brings. Blind optimism in the future is pointless. If there are resources out there to help people in my position then I'd love to hear them. If you're going to reply just to say "Pick your head up, it will definitely get better" please go try to help somebody else. It's not going to help me and it may change their mind.

Oh, and I'm out of my herbal medication at the moment too. I'm pretty sure it's at least mildly related.
