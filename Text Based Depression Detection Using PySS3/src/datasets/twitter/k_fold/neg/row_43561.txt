Just mostly need to talk. I'm having a hard time holding on.The last year or so has been really hard for me. I've always been hard on myself and I've been fighting against suicidal thoughts since highschool. I can give more details if you want. Just ask. I don't mind.Mostly I just don't think I can fight against it anymore. I think my relationship with my boyfriend is falling through and I might have seriously messed up at work today. I might get fired tomorrow. I think I've pretty much decided to kill myself if I lose my job. There is no one else I can tell. I'm too scared to tell my boyfriend. And what is he going to be able to do about it? 



The thing that keeps me from just killing myself is that I want a life. I want a family. I want to live and be normal. I just kind of suck at functioning and I'm just getting so tired. A friendly, understanding person would go a long way right now. Thank you.
