Can one mistake end your future?A while back, a somewhat well known internet personality (lets call him Max) was giving mean people room to vent on me. I tried to stay away and block people, but it became overwhelming. Eventually, I told him to stay out of my life and to "kill the connection with me". He didn't take that kindly, as he threatened to call the authorities on me. I realized later that it was a lie, as no one came. I felt so guilty, nonetheless, that I almost turned to self injury to cope with the guilt. Even though it has been months since that confrontation, I just feel like that person ruined any chance I have at a successful career knowing mob mentality, even though that situation has since been a dead topic. Is it worth trying to be successful anymore?
