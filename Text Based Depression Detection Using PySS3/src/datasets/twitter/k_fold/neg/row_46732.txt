Well... I guess this is goodbye...I tried all my best and apparently wasnt good enough i couldnt fix the mistake i made i rly tried every possible option to fix everything but it was for nothing i guess my family was right i really am a piece of shit and i guess i rly deserve death
Im sorry that i cant be with my friends im sorry that cant help them anymore or talk to them
Ill rly miss them and i rly love them but.... Ehh i dont wanna be a burden to anybody anymore
Im rly tired... Im going to kill myself right now...
Im sorry i dont know what to say anymore.. Bye
