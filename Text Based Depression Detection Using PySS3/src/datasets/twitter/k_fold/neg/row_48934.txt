Lost money gambling and want to die. Someone please talk to me. :'(Had put around $40 into a sports betting site a week ago, and managed to turn it to $500 though some luck and skillful predictions. Well, after getting $500 and instead of cashing it out, I bet it all on a bet to turn it into $700 and I fucking lost it. And lost all the money I'd made. 

Just $500 would have changed my life in the near future, and would have invaluable but lost it cuz of sheer stupidity and greed. Now I just want to die, I don't know what to do. I'm a college student and jobs are so hard to get in my country and they pay a pittance if you don't have a degree, and sometimes even if you have a degree. 

It's so hard for me to sleep at night constantly worrying about money and an upcoming expense I have to make, I don't wanna live like this. Even $500 would have solved 95% of my current problems cuz it's a lot in my country. I feel like I will die from sheer stress. I hate myself, and nothing seems to be working out for me. Why does life have to be so unfair? I've always wanted to be good and do good to others, but I can't even have that happen to me in return even once.
