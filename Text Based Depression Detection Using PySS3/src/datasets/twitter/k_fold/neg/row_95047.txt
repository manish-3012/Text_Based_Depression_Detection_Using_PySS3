Pride keeps me from getting helpAsking for help is declaring you're broken. Sure--be quick to say "no it doesn't!" But yes it does.

Why bother to go on being broken? That's reason enough to be done.

There's no "fixing" it. It'll always be that mug with the cracks in the handle. The sign misspelled. The board cut too short.

It's not even sadness...it's emptiness. It's being to tired but expected to be full.

My life isn't even bad. It's decent. But it's missing pieces. Enough not to see the picture, the reason why.

Wouldn't go back and don't really want to go forward. Now isn't perfect but it soon be the past as I really want t to say fuck the future.

Eventually I'll have enough reason to not leave my bad...I'm so tired. Just so so tired.
