Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ll be able to live past tomorrowFirst time posting here, feel free to take down if it brakes any rules.  Some context, I have been planning my suicide for almost an entire year actually, but recently things have been so much worse.  I can barely get up in the morning, I have missed the first two periods almost every day for the past month.  I have done almost all of the homework, but am still borderline failing most classes.  I have hit a point of fuck it if you will.  I donâ€™t have many real connections with people outside of school.  So tomorrow, I intend on killing myself and donâ€™t know what to do.  Thank you for reading
