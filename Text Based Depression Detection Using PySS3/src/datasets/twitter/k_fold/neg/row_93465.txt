I feel like i'm getting closer to killing myself everydayI'm 16 and have been wanting to die for quite a while now, but not until recently have I actually considered doing it. The last 3-4 years I have been feeling quite bad and I don't know how long I will be able to keep it up. I'm not even sure why I'm posting this here, I'm a dumbass so most of what I'm writing here is probably going to be shit. English is not my main language so I'm sorry if my english is bad
