If i dont win the lottery tomorrow im killing myselfim tired of this desperation. Im tired of the only meaning in life being your economic utility. its disgusting and inhumane. Im tired of all the suffering, I have disfigurements that make life not worth living. I was not meant for life. nobody hears my screams. they just play ignorant because its more convenient and they don't have enough money to fix there problems. I can see the vision so clearly. Once I get my paycheck, I will head to the store to buy the gun. nobody really gives a fuck unless you have money I cant wait to escape this hellish nightmare.
