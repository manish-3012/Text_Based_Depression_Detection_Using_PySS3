Be honesti just recently started posting after a terrible string of bad luck, drugs, and just all around bad choices. do reading others peoples struggle help you or make it worst? i love all the encouraging stuff people say on this sub. it actually makes me have a little faith for some of humanity.

tldr: after an episode does it help to read others problems or do they make it worst?
