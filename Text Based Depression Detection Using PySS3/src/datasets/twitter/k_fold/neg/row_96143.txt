Iâ€™m really nervous Iâ€™m gonna do itIâ€™m failing college and costing my parents $30,000. Everything was going so well and then bipolar fucks it up again. I canâ€™t keep doing this, I canâ€™t go back to the hospital. I think Iâ€™m gonna take my pills, all of them. I really like this girl however and Iâ€™ll see how it goes tomorrow. I gave her some wine for her birthday and she hugged me and all but was wasted and I donâ€™t want to make moves with her like that, Iâ€™m not about it. If that doesnâ€™t go well, than I guess itâ€™s my last â€œshotâ€, at least in my head. Iâ€™m really gonna make people sad if I die but I just canâ€™t go on like this anymore.
