I hate the holidaysMy in laws and family just argue about who is doing what where and it instigates so many fights. I wish I were just little again and Christmas was fun. I want to just stay HOME and do something special with my kid and spouse. It's like this every holiday since I got married. I can't wait until this season is over. I use to really like winter too now I just dread it... feeling especially hopeless but I hope everyone else's holidays are going well and if they're going like mine.. hang in there. In solidarity, baby! You can just think about how a sadassdinosaur wishes you the best ha
