I survived and I'm thankful for this communityWell, my 2nd attempt was rough and I ended a bit fucked up, but my roommate found me and called an ambulance. They saved me on time. Doctors said I'm really lucky for not needing a transplant or ever for being alive. At the start I felt so fucking empty and sad about my life, now I just want to try to live and be okay with my family. It isn't gonna be easy but I need to try so hard. I'm so thankful for this community, helped me a lot when I was suffering and even strangers worried about me. That feels so nice that I have to say here: thank you all. Every person here is so kind, every person here saved me. Anybody here deserves to die and suffer like we do, please be strong!
