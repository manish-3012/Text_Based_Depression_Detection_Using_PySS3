I'm having a good day and, more importantly, I'd like to share some of it with you.So I'm depressed. but for some reason today, things have been so great.
My thoughts have been clear and helpful, unusually easy to vocalize, and not painful. I don't know. I ate some blueberry cheesecake today and it tasted just excellent. Superb! I had to work, but it was okay and I fought with a romantic companion, but it was okay too. 

I'm listening to the most amazing Modest Mouse song and I have this theory, right? So basically, I think some people have suicide and some people have depression. But you're born with it. And it isn't necessary both. Hear me out. Suicide might not be the end game of depression, the result of horrendous difficulty and struggle with a mental disease, but rather a separate illness of its own. I don't know if this is conducive to anyone's night, but it's comforting to my own.

More than anything, I'd like to let you know that I support you and would love to talk to you anytime. Message me for my cell phone number if you need a friend. I think about you, yeah you, all the time. I love you so, so much. Let me know if I can help you with anything. I want you to be okay, and I want you to want you to as well.
