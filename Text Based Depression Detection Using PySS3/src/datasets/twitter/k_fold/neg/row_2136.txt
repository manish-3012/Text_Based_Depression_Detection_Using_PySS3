I don't want to live anymore.I've been driving around for an hour because I don't know what to do. I'm sitting in a parking lot and I can't stop crying because I can't figure out how I could possibly fix myself. I feel so worthless. I cut again for the first time in months. I just want to die. I'm sorry this is so vague I just don't know what to do. I need someone.
