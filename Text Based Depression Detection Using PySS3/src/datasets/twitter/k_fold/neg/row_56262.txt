I feel that i'm more useful than likableI feel that people see me as a smart person, but they not really friends, they prefer to be friends with other people and i'm never the "best friend" of someone...i always felt like i'm some kind of people that is useful when you need, but, not when you wanna hang out or talk...maybe i'm being too paranoid ...idk
