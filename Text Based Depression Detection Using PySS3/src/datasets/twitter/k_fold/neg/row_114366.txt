Feeling like a fraudIâ€™m a mental health nurse and my job is basically to stop people who want to kill them selves and make sure they get the right support. 

Iâ€™ve had 2 previous episodes of depression that required medication but in recent years Iâ€™ve always been able to deal with any dips in mood before it got too bad.

Iâ€™ve been on a downward spiral for about 6 months and nothing is working. I feel numb, I do nothing outside of work and barely take care of myself. 
Iâ€™m not sleeping and when I lie awake I end up thinking/fantasising about killing myself and how. 

Iâ€™m not at the stage I think I would do it but I feel like I will inevitably end up there. If I try to get help and be honest about how I feel I will probably get referred to my own team. My job is my only positive and I would rather die than lose my professional reputation. 

I want help and for everyone else I know the answers but for me I feel trapped and there isnâ€™t a way to get help without making everything worse.
