Everyday I'm just a little bit closerI thought it was my impulsive mood swings that would drive me to the brink of suicide one day but I'm realizing right now, it's more of a slow walk.

Suicidal thoughts used to come and go as I would give in to my emotions good and bad. Now it's just always there.

When I'm happy, I'm sad because I know this won't last and the thing that is waiting for me will come sooner rather than later. 

When I'm sad, I'm no longer feel the full extent of the emotion. I'm almost numb, the blows keep coming, I just don't care anymore. I know where I'm headed.

It's the anger that gets me. I'm angry at everything and because I'm angry at everything I see sides of myself I wish I never would. It reaffirms that I shouldn't be here. If there's one good thing I can do, it's remove myself from this planet.
