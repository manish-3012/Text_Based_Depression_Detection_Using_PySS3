Hanging myself as soon as I can.I just bought a rope, Iâ€™m writing this inside of a McDonaldâ€™s while I wait for a ride home. I wonâ€™t be able to do it tonight but I plan from Wednesday afterwards, whenever I get my house to myself (I live with my parents), Iâ€™m going to hang myself from a stairwell. I really hope it works, I canâ€™t afford to mess it up. I canâ€™t tell any of my friends or family because I just want it to be all over this time. Thanks for reading...
