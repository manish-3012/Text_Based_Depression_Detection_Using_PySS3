No more games.No more threats. No more hints. No more asking for help. No more trying. No more screaming to everyone how much I'm really hurting.

No more.

I'm so goddamn sick of it.

I'm sick of giving everyone else the power of whether I live or die. It's time to take control of my own life. It's time to do what I've always dreamed of doing. It's time to stop being afraid of death and to embrace it.

It's time.

I'm doing this, and I'm doing it now while I have it in me.

Let's just hope my 11 little pills are enough. Let's just hope this is really the end for me. 

And so the first time since I was a child I'm folding my hands and saying a prayer. Dear god(s) real or imagined, bullshit or science, please spare me. Please spare me the pain of having to live another day. Please bless these pills to my body so that they may grant me cardiac arrest. Amen.

There's no turning back tonight.
