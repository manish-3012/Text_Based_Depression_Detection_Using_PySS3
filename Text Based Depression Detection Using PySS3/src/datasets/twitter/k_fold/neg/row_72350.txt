Strange timesI don't really get it, you know??? I don't think I ever really feel okay but everytime I want to talk about it I'm stopped by the fact I don't want to hurt or burden others. Hello, my name is Lex and I'm a senior in high school. I get amazing grades, I have a loving family and amazing friends and yet, I still want to kill myself. 

I think about it almost constantly. I've never actually planned a suicide but I've written a note and I've thought about what would happen afterwards. I don't do it because of my mom and brother, we already lost my dad to suicide awhile back and I think if I ended my own life, my mom would too.

 I guess I'm just tired of living, you know??? It feels like it's just one bad things after another. I can never be free of hardships. All I want is to feel happy and safe and not in pain but I don't think I'll ever have that luxury.

Sometimes, I feel like all of this sounds like it's for attention and maybe I'm just being overdramatic. Maybe in a year I'll look back on this and think I was stupid for things like this. I hope I will because I can't take much more of my brain. Maybe I just needed a place to say this. Thank you for listening.
