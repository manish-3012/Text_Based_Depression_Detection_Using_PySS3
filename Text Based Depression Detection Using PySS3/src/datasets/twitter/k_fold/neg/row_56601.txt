My mom never fucking listens to me and I genuinely want to kill myself because I canâ€™t take this goddamn constant pressure to be a functioning adult when I canâ€™t be.I have told my mom countless times that I canâ€™t drive because I disassociate at least twenty times a day for up to two hours at a time, and that I canâ€™t get a job because I have such a low will to live that I wouldnâ€™t be able to keep up on my work or bring myself to even show up to the workplace. 

The first problem is not the biggest deal, I can have friends give me rides places, or hire an Uber(or similar) service to get around. But it the second issue that is the worst thing. As far as I know, I donâ€™t qualify for the disability thing where the government gives you money if you canâ€™t work because of a disability, but like I said, I would never be able to even GO to my workplace, let alone do work, and this wouldnâ€™t be able to keep a job. 

Yet despite these reasons, which I should mention she finds valid for OTHER PEOPLE, she still insists that Iâ€™m a lazy piece of shit who uses my anxiety and depression as an excuse to never do things. 

So Iâ€™m fed up. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can take this.
