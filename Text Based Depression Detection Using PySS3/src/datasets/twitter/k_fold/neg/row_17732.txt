I don't want to die, I want to stop suffering. I've been cursed by Bipolar 2... It's like I'm always in a self destructive mode... All I wat is for me and people around me to stop suffering... I want to disappear but I don't want to die... I try to reach out to the friends that told me they'd be there... \*\*Spoiler Alert\*\* they are not...   


  I know I'm not alone, but I feel so alone... Funny thing when they did my Spotify recap my 2 most listened songs were "So Lonesome I Could Cry" and "May You Never be Alone Like Me"....
