I am tiredAs long as I have lived, I do not remember having experienced a moment's worth of pure joy untainted by fear that it will all end.

All my life I have been told that IF I am a good person, IF I work hard, IF I listen to what everyone says is good for me, I will be happy.

Today I have come to a conclusion: that living is nothing but torture and that whatever thrills life has to offer are  but a mockery of my excruciatingly painful existence.

It is not that I fear the future. Surely there is a chance that I may yet experience something that will make me glad to have lived.

I just don't care. I don't care about the idea that, left to nature, I will probably have to endure another 50-60 years of this shit.

This is like a really bad movie in a theatre. I don't want to know what happens, I don't want to know how it ends. I just want to walk out.
