When I was 11. âš ï¸ Trigger warning âš ï¸ 

When I was 11 years old, I tried to kill myself. 

I took 13 sleeping pills from my grandmother and went to go lay in bed. A couple minutes later my mom came in my room to ask me if I was hungry. I was anorexic at the time, and I barely ate anything because I hated the way I looked. 

My mom tried waking me up but she couldnâ€™t do it, she found the bottle of pills under my pillow and apparently called an ambulance.. My doctor was screaming at me but I only remember little pieces of what happened, my heart stopped before they could pump my stomach and they got it going again. I remember looking up in the hospital bed and looking around, everything was bright but dark as-well. 

I hallucinated, felt sick, and was so tired for the next couple of weeks. I donâ€™t know what happened within the first three days. I was blacked out for a half of a week and had these terrible headaches for weeks after it happened. 

Iâ€™m 17 now and these feelings are coming back again. I donâ€™t know how to control them..
