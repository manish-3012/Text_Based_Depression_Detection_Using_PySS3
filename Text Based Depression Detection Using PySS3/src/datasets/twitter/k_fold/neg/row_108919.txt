I am scaredlately I've been thinking about killing myself. I have come to the realization that nothing matters, in short, i have come to an existential crisis and in existential despair. The only thing that is stopping me is that i don't want my family to deal with my death. But i am scared that it wont stop me forever. I don't know what to do, has anybody gone through this?
