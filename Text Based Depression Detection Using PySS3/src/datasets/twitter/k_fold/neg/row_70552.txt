Grocery shopping makes me suicidalThis is more of a rant about a large stresser than an actual cry for help. It's just one of the contributing factors that make me miserable. I'm an extremely picky eater, and my taste in food is total shit. I eat 98% oven food and fast food with the occasional cooked meal. I feel so sick from the food I eat sometimes, but I can't stomach the taste of anything healthy or commit to making better food. Always too broke to buy better good or ingredients. It makes me feel like a fuckin loser when I go out to eat with anyone else because they always want to go somewhere ethnic or exciting and I have to either not eat or insist on something different. I'm so used to the foods I eat that I started getting into hot sauce just to have some sort of enjoyment from eating. 

Whenever I go to buy groceries I feel like the biggest fucking idiot for getting the same things every week. And the same thought always occurs: "well I'm not going to force myself to eat better if I'm going to kill myself anyway". Granted, I'm not huge, but I eventually will be. With the food I eat, I'd be surprised if I didn't have colon cancer in a few years. Fixing my diet and creating a healthier relationship with food in general sounds like the most daunting task and I don't know if I'll ever be up for it. Fuck I want to die. Not going to do it, just want to.
