I want to kill myself as a way of saying sorry to those I hurt.I was sitting with my boyfriend tonight and that thought just struck me. Now it wonâ€™t get out of my head â€” I havenâ€™t been really suicidal like this in months, especially since him and I got together. I feel so bad for it, so horrible for having these thoughts â€” because heâ€™ll be all alone and I donâ€™t want him to be sad. But some part of me just keeps telling me that he wouldnâ€™t care, thatâ€™d heâ€™d be better off, all the typical thoughts that come with being suicidal.


   I feel like I hurt him too much. He says Iâ€™m the ideal boyfriend, that I do so much for him, but in reality I do the bare minimum; I put the dishes up he says, I scratch his back and head when he needs it he says, I make him laugh until his ribs hurt he says, I take care of our frog he says. But that barely feels like anything. Iâ€™ve known him for a year and half now, weâ€™ve been together for just a couple of months, and Iâ€™m obsessed with him. But I get sad so easy, and so does he sometimes, but I cry and I go sit in the bathroom for 30 minutes at a time when Iâ€™m upset as to avoid upsetting him. For some reason it still feels selfish. I feel like Iâ€™m the reason he has to take antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, everything. I feel like Iâ€™m the sole reason everything in his life turns bad sometimes and I donâ€™t know what to do about it. Iâ€™m his boyfriend. I shouldnâ€™t be so sad all the time and just drag him down all the time. All I should do is make him happy, I wanna make this last and it honestly feels like it really could! I know it will. But if I end up killing myself it wonâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to hurt him but either way it feels like I am.


Iâ€™ve hurt so many people it feels like. My therapist and literally everyone else Iâ€™ve ever even spoken with it briefly about says I needed to be the one to leave my past relationships because they were toxic, but everyone seemed so...sad when I left. Now everyone hates me. Iâ€™m the bad guy in at least two peopleâ€™s stories. Then my ex shows up after a year and a half and asks for a hoodie I havenâ€™t seen in a year. Whereâ€™s my dead brotherâ€™s hoodie that I let you borrow? Whereâ€™s my 60 bucks I gave to help you out all that time ago? Why would you randomly show up to my house with a dude I donâ€™t know and ask for that? That still swirls in my head and itâ€™s been months. I just donâ€™t want to remember these people anymore, but I hurt them, so why am I so angry? I feel like I kinda deserve to remember everything I did, making people feel pain.


I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m being unreasonable with myself anymore. My boyfriend just came back into the room and heâ€™s laying in my arms, scrolling through his phone. Heâ€™s so good to me. He shows me funny things he sees on his phone and he kisses my forehead and says â€œBaby, baby, baby,â€ in a high-pitched voice every time he wants a hug from me. I love him more than Iâ€™ve ever loved anyone or anything in the world and I just want to make him smile, hear his laugh. I tickle him incessantly sometimes just to hear him giggle, my favorite sound. He laughs and smiles with me, he swears Iâ€™m the best, so why do I still feel the way I do? Like Iâ€™m such a horrible burden? 

I dunno, Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m feeling the same way I was at the start of this post, but Iâ€™m going to post it anyway. Iâ€™m just hurting.
