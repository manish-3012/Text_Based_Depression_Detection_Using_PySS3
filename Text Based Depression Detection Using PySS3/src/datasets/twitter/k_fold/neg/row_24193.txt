My disturbing thoughtsI'm not sure what I feel anymore.
I've been having a ton of suicidal and even homicidal thoughts lately.
I just feel like I have immense hatred for things and people as of now (Including myself).
Nothing feels like it's worth doing anymore and I don't even try or do any kind of decent job for things.
I have school work and two failed test I need to redo, but I just can't be bothered.
I'm a big failure no matter what I do.
A miserable excuse that should have been aborted.
No positive traits can be placed on me.
I feel like no one likes me and never will, I have no best friends and no one appreaciates me.
If someone told me they cared about me or loved me I would laugh in their face, it's an obvious joke.
But it won't matter anymore if I end myself.
