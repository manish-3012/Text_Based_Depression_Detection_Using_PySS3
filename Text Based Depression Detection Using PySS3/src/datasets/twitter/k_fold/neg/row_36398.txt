i canâ€™t find the will to live anymoreiâ€™ve felt this way before, a bunch of times. like i couldnâ€™t do it anymore, and i was just going to end myself. iâ€™ve failed all those other times, but this is different. itâ€™s like more and more things keep piling on to my life. and the stress is just becoming unbearable. i canâ€™t ever catch a break and when i try to, something else just gets in the way. 
i wish i could find a reason to live but there really just isnâ€™t one anymore. i know i have people who love me. but most of the time it just feels like they arenâ€™t even there for me at all like they say they are. like i have to go out of my way to get help from the few friends i have, even when itâ€™s obvious that i need it. 
the only thing really really making me second guess myself is how it will affect my mom. i canâ€™t imagine the pain she will go through. me and her arenâ€™t close, and never really have been. but i know she still loves me. i know sheâ€™ll wish she did more, but really there was nothing more she could do. this is my choice. 
sometimes i think, maybe i donâ€™t really want to die. i just want to escape my problems. but i canâ€™t keep running from them anymore. theyâ€™re just getting worse. dying just seems so much easier. 
i wish i had more time before my life really got this fucked up. iâ€™m only 19, and all of my teenage years have been spent on drugs and alcohol and whatever else i can do to keep myself distracted. 
i was happy once, not that long ago. i thought i was finally happy. and content. my boyfriend and i had been dating about 3 years, we were gonna move in together and start a life together. but things just got messed up. and ever since then my life has progressively gotten worse and worse now to the point where i donâ€™t even want to live anymore. 
i wish i was better at writing all this out. i wish my story was more interesting than it is. 
i just wanted to write this down somewhere. like putting my words out into the world one last time. i donâ€™t know. 

i hope it works this time.
