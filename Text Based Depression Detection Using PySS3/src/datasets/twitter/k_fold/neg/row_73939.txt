Suicide isn't sad or scary anymoreI've been suicidal for years, but something has changed. Back in 2011, thinking about suicide would bring me to tears. In 2013, it made me feel sad, but I didn't always cry thinking about killing myself. Fast forward to now, after being suicidal every single day for the past 3-4 months, I've suddenly realized that suicide isn't something that scares or disturbs me anymore - I don't feel sad, I don't feel scared, it just feels neutral. Even when I'm not explicitly sad or depressed, all I can think about is killing myself. It feels like the only rational decision I can make. Every day is either apathy or depression, and checking out is feeling more and more like the right thing to do. I can be happy and around friends, laughing and having fun, but in the back of my mind all I can think about is coming home and ending it all. Again, it doesn't feel emotional, it feels the same as wanting to make a sandwich or put on a film - it's purely neutral.

It's a strange feeling. Does anyone else feel the same way?
