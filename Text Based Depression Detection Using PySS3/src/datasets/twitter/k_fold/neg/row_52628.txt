Posted this on my FacebookOn mobile. First and last time poster. 
Posted this on my Facebook page. Where all 79 of my friends are majority family. Didnt receive so much as a like, let alone a comment.  
This is what I posted: 
Not a cry for help because I've cried out many times and gotten ignored. This is my final peace. I know I wont be missed. No memories to dwell on. No true loss. That's ok. The one person who loved me was taken back in '85. Wish I could say my kids would miss me but that also would be wishful thinking. Just want to get this off my chest and free my mind. Idc if I'm judged because those same ones judging are the same ones who dgaf when it mattered. Dont care now. Dont act. Ignore and forget me in death as you did in lifeðŸ‘Œ
