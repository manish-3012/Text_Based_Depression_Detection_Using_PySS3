EverydayEveryday I wake up, go to school, then to work. But why? I have no clue where my life is headed. I have no direction, I think of suicide every hour of everyday. I thought being busy with school and work would help keep my mind off of how sad I really am but it doesnâ€™t, it makes it worse. Everyday I get up at 6:00 am and do the exact same thing, I take care of my dog (whom I love more than anything), get ready and go to school at 7:00am until 10:50, Rush home change and go to work from 11:30am to 9:00 pm. Then I go to bed. I have no social life (never have) but i feel like Iâ€™m drowning. I really really just want to commit suicide but am more afraid that I wonâ€™t succeed in dying for some reason. Iâ€™ve tried therapy, medication, journaling my thoughts. Nothing seems to help. So should I just end it? I didnâ€™t get into a college I wanted and that really hurts, Iâ€™m just a disappointment to myself although my family loves me and cares for me, but I canâ€™t keep living for them. I canâ€™t eat, I canâ€™t sleep but am constantly tired. Iâ€™m at my breaking point
