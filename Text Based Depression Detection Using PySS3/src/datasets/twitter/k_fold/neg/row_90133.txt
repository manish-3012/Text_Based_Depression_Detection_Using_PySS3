My girlfriends ex is threatening to kill himselfWell here it is, she told me before we started dating that she had an ex that was suicidal, so she didn't want to be really public about our relationship. As someone who has been around suicide a lot myself, I understand and agree to it. Well tonight we both had such an amazing time that she posted about it on her facebook. Her ex sees it and is now threatening suicide. She is stuck in an impossible situation and I don't know what to do. He cheated on her, so it's not like she is having to choose between me and him. It's that she's having to choose between a relationship with me at the possible cost of someone she really cares about. Thoughts?
