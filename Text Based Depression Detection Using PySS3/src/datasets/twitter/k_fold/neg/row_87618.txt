My girlfriend died and I don't know what to do anymore.My girlfriend was a member of the IDF and she died recently. Not going to give details. 

We had recently rekindled our relationship. I got some letters from her telling me how she felt and what not. It was very intimate. After that we just fell back into our hole of love. I planned on visiting Israel to see her. It was all so fast. And then it was all over in an instant. 

It's like I don't even know why I try anymore. Nothing works. Everyday I struggle with this pain. The person who understands me doesn't want to talk and hasn't talked to me in months. I just wish for a moment that I had something to live for. But what is there anymore.
