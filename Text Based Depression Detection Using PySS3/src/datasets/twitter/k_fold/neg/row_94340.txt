Im giving myself one more year.I don't think i have what it takes to get out of my fucking room. I spend much of my time in a panicked state. I miss being a kid, when i was happy. Now: i have to be a genius, i have to have my shit together with careers, i need a GF. Yeah admittedly i care too much about what people think of me but also you know having those things would be nice but im just a privileged pussy.
