No more looking out to the horizon. I'm already here. I no longer fear death and since I don't want to live another day on this Earth. I find life to be like the chain gang. I'm forced to work so I can live a little more comfortably. Even if I don't choose to work in a factory, I'm forced to work in nature to that I can live another day. Why would I want to stay, what's the incentive? There's no point in living. I guess if I keep myself distracted enough I won't see all the problems around me but that's not life, it's a lie. It's a lie I can't live because in my heart I would know better. There's always something standing in the way of happiness. Always something outside of my control. What if I had done it this way or what if I could have so and so back in my life? It doesn't get better. The odds are against me. I already see the wear and tear on my body. The quality of life isn't getting any better. The only way to know what the future will be like is to look at the past. It's been horrible. It's painted with regret and pain. Why do I expect it to get better? There's no one here to accompany me on this journey. It's just a bunch of people that lie to me that it's going to get better. They think if they work that little bit harder they will get that thing they want or impress that member of the opposite sex they like. I just want to shut the door on all this. I want the end to be now. I do not want your consumer items or recognition. I'm not interested in who's here. I just want nothingness. Nothingness is the true salvation.
