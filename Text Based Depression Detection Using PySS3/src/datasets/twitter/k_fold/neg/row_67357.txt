The repercussions are getting to me now-I donâ€™t want to say Iâ€™m depressed and self diagnose, but Iâ€™ve had depressive tendencies for years now, everybody around me is stressed and I donâ€™t want to add to them. The repercussions of keeping it to myself for years has started kicking me in the face- my inability to focus, forgetting basic things like washing or going to sleep and wanting to end it just never seem to end. Iâ€™m trying, but people think Iâ€™m just lazy. I donâ€™t deserve everything I have, I can never repay for the things Iâ€™ve been given yet I still feel so shit. Why.
