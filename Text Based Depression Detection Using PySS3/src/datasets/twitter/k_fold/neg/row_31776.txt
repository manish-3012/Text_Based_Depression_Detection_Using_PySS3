This walks getting real long and I'm getting real tired.I made a post here in January at my lowest. I was falsely accused of rape by a girl just because I didn't want to date her and she had a chronic victim complex. I felt like my life was over, persecuted in an unfair system (old Title IX) and even if I was found innocent it was going to cause irreparable damage. 

During that time it was a violent complusive desire to die. I had a sharp stabbing pain that I wanted out of. 

It's shifted. It's been nearly two months of hell and the pain has become dull and constant. I'm getting real tired. Everything seems dark now. I used to be so happy, I thought everyone was at heart good and they were just misguided. I'm so tired now. I just wanna stop walking. 

I see the fundings of the case Thursday or Friday. I don't know what to expect.
