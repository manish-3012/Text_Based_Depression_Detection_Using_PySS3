constant thoughtsI have a friend who has been considering committing suicide with a gun for the last few weeks. He told me that at first his thoughts were on and off, but now they are non stop. I don't think he has the courage to pull it off, but I'm afraid that if he is constantly thinking of doing this that he may just do it. I've recommended crisis lines but he says they don't work or they just want to send him to hospital which I think would make things a lot worse than they already are. What would you guys do?
