Iâ€™m not in immediate danger, but Iâ€™m not coping. Can anyone help me?Iâ€™ve considered suicide very frequently for the past decade but I have decided that I will never go through with it as long as my mum is alive. I donâ€™t care about myself at all, but I could not hurt someone else like that, and I know it would just destroy her.

With that said, if my mum were to die, I fully expect that I would follow shortly after.

Iâ€™m not coping with my daily life. I constantly put myself down. Iâ€™m a failure. I hate myself for making so many wrong choices that have made my life this way. Iâ€™m stressed all the time. I donâ€™t remember the last time I felt happy. And I hate myself more for being unable to appreciate the aspects of my life that are not in shambles.

I feel trapped in life. I just want for it all to be over.

Can anyone offer a fresh perspective to make this life feel not so desolate until I have the opportunity to end it all?
