i survivedyesterday i took a handful of my anxiety pills. i felt nauseous for hours and wasnt going to do anything until my friends said i should go to the hospital. i decided to go because i felt extremely nauseous and dizzy and at that point i started to regret what i did. so i texted my mom and told her i think i overdosed. yesterday had been extremely hard. i had cried and had panick attacks and was just tired of everything. im nearing 18 and i dont have a job because my anxiety is so big and im about to graduate collage. i feel like a leech just sucking up everything from my parents even though i try hard to get a job. anyways, my mom took me to the er and we stayed there for about 3-4 hours. i had a lot of time to think ab what i had done. i still feel extremely nauseous and dizzy and i just want the feeling to go away. but i think seeing my mom terrified of what i had done really hit me. i know i started to spiral off a bit at the end there but i just want people reading this to know that suicide isnt always the right choice. ive regretted my choice ever since i drank those pills down. in the moment it might seem like the best choice, but it isnt i promise. and this is coming from someone who is fresh out the er. it isnt the right choice and i dont want people to go through with what i did because taking a bunch of pills hurts like a bitch
