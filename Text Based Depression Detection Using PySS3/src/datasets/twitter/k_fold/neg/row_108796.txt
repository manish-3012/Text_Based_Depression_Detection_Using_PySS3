I am always on the vergeIâ€™m scared to even admit that I am feeling incredibly depressed again. I keep a journal but Iâ€™m too scared to even write in there that I feel like killing myself.

I feel like I am getting through each day by telling myself that at least suicide is always an option. Like every day I just say â€œwell if it gets any worse Iâ€™ll just kill myselfâ€ 

I have anxiety or something. Iâ€™ve never been diagnosed because Iâ€™m too anxious to call the doctors to arrange an appointment and Iâ€™m too scared to take time off work. Itâ€™s been with me for my entire life, even in school. Some months and years are worse than others. I find that if I can dumb myself down and settle into a boring routine I can be relatively ok for a while and not have these feelings. 

I messed up by taking a promotion at work. I now have a few more responsibilities and I spend 99% of my time at home absolutely terrified that Iâ€™ve done something wrong. I re-play things over and over in my head until I convince myself I did them wrong. A lot of my responsibilities in work now involve outside clients so if I did something wrong there could potentially be big problems caused for the company. This has really kicked my anxiety and depression into overdrive. I am so exhausted from constantly worrying. I canâ€™t sleep or eat because Iâ€™m so terrified all the time.

I genuinely feel like the only way out is to end it all. Like Iâ€™m worried about something specific at the moment: I may have sent something to the wrong client. Now at the time when I did it I wasnâ€™t worried at all, I just did it and didnâ€™t think about it. But because i came home and my brain started playing the day over and over for me I realised I didnâ€™t remember double checking it, so all weekend Iâ€™ve been in a state of worry and just complete emptiness because Iâ€™ve convinced myself I did it wrong. This isnâ€™t unusual. Every day when I come home I worry about something I did or didnâ€™t do. 

I canâ€™t carry on like this. I canâ€™t tell my employer because I donâ€™t have an official diagnosis and when I told them previously the managing director was extremely angry with me and didnâ€™t believe me, he said I just wasnâ€™t trying and i had given up and he wanted to fire me but gave me another chance. I feel like I donâ€™t have a leg to stand on because I donâ€™t have any sort of diagnosis because I am too scared to go to a doctor. 

Every day I just think about the worst things that could happen and I decide that if it does happen Iâ€™ll kill myself and that sort of gets me through. Iâ€™m so worried that the worst thing is going to happen one day and I will snap and Iâ€™ll kill myself and everyone will be so sad. I canâ€™t see another way out of this. Itâ€™s such a horrible tiring cycle. 

People just tell me to stop worrying because I wonâ€™t make mistakes because Iâ€™m so smart etc but that just makes me feel worse because when I do inevitably make a mistake theyâ€™ll all be so disappointed. And I literally cannot stop worrying. I can feel the thoughts going round and round in my head like itâ€™s stuck on a loop. I know my boyfriend gets frustrated and angry with me because all I do is cry and shut myself away, he doesnâ€™t understand why I worry about things. I just wish my brain could be normal and I could stop overthinking and thinking the worst will happen. Normal people donâ€™t think about killing themselves every day. 

Iâ€™m sorry for sending you this email. I know itâ€™s long and I donâ€™t expect anyone to read it all. I know Iâ€™m being ridiculous and Iâ€™m the grand scheme of things none of this matters. I just wish I could have a normal brain. Iâ€™m so scared for tomorrow because I have to go to work and Iâ€™ll possibly find out about all the things Iâ€™ve done wrong. I donâ€™t know what will happen. I could lose my job and then I will be destroyed because Iâ€™d be so anxious about a new job if I could even find one and I wouldnâ€™t have any money. We were meant to be buying a house next year but that will all go out of the window too. I feel like I canâ€™t talk to anyone because I donâ€™t want to worry them, I canâ€™t tell my employer because of what happened last time, I canâ€™t tell my dad because heâ€™ll be too worried for me and my boyfriend means well but canâ€™t understand because he never worries about anything and hasnâ€™t ever been depressed before.

I know this is too long for anyone to bother with. I just needed to type all of this out. Please donâ€™t be nasty to me or impatient I will cry as usual, just ignore me if you donâ€™t want this to be here and Iâ€™ll delete it.
