Can't keep doing thisBeen fighting suicidal thoughts on a daily basis for about a year now, and depression and personality disorder since my early teen years (I'm 24). 
Nothing seems to help. I'm in therapy, but it doesn't change anything. I've been through 5 different medications, but unfortunately they don't work. Talking to my family or bestfriend doesn't make me feel any better, and it pains and worries them a shit ton.
I've started self harming again and I've even written a suicide note...
I don't even know why I'm writing here, but hey why the fuck not, gonna end this miserable excuse of a living hell they call life soon enough anyway.
