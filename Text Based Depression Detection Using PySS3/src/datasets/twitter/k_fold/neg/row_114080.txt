Dying AloneIâ€™m ready to do it tonight. I donâ€™t have anyone so itâ€™s not like I could hurt anyone else. Iâ€™m just tired of physical and mentally hurting. Iâ€™m crying really hard. Im not built for loneliness. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ve held on for so long, but I canâ€™t hold on much longer. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m weak. Iâ€™ve been a weak disappointment for my entire life.
