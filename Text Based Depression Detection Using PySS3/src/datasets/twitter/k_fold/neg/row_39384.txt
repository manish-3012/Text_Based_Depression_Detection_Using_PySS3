I cbaI literally cba to do anything anymore. It's a constant pain in my chest and I really really wish the attempted OD would've worked but I was too fucking into crying to go find more pills it should've been enough. I really really want someone to genuinely care about how I feel. For them to ask hey hru unprovoked no one does that then everyone says when someone kills themselves 'hey I didn't know they were feeling like that' I wrote a note and I just want to do it but I can't but I want and I will. That's the only thing I'm motivated to do. Force myself to commit suicide. Literary nothing helps and I'm sick of trying and I understand others are in this situation but I can't really take this cause I'm too weak for it.
