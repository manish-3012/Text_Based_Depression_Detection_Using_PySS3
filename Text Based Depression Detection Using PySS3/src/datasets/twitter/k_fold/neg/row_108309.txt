My friends are all assholes and I wanna dieMy friends laugh every time they talk about a friend of theirs that killed himself last year. They often say he was weak or how he should have just gotten over it. All I want right now is to kill myself but I know I wouldn't be missed anyway. He is a spoiled brat who never had to go through any hardship. I can't take this loneliness anymore. I have no one to trust and I am in pain every second. It's been this way for as long as I can remember. I'm ready or at least I want to be. I write in my journal everyday and there is no happiness in any page. Perhaps it is a sign. I just want to cry all the time and any good thing is so fleeting that I don't see a point to it anymore. I just want to die but I can't fucking do it. I actually attempted earlier this year but I hadn't sharpened the knife properly. God I hate myself and I hate this life. I'm sure you see 1000 of these an hour so thanks for reading my post. I'm just going to lay here for a bit. I guess my friends just finally helped me find the quickest way out. I wish I could say I'll miss them but I wouldn't. You see my friends are younger than me by a couple of years but I can't believe how they think.
