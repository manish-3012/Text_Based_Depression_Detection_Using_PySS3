I want Him to do it.ever since I was little, I haven't ever been good at making friends, I was always the weird kid, my mom was always away so I basically had to raise my sister alone, but when my mom was around she was always trying to find someone to love her, with I think made me want to do the same, find someone who actually cared. I got bullied up until high school, when I guess people just stopped caring all together, so I started partying a lot, &amp; found myself drunk 99% of the time, I trying finding someone, then it just left me with a few one night stands, it hurt me, knowing that was all I was good for. Then I found someone via Facebook, I tried everything I could to be with him, I stole my moms car, I almost walked barefoot the whole way -he lived two hours away- I gave him everything which lead us to live with each other for about 6 months then after a year, I couldn't handle living there-because his mom was crazy- then after I left &amp; thought when he turned 18 he would come live with my family, but he decided I wasn't worth a thing anymore &amp; choose his friends and weed over me. Which I cried over night after night pleading with him to take me back, but he said no because his friend -who haven't heard my side of the story- said he was better without me. So I've been trying to find someone else ever since, which hasn't been to long..
