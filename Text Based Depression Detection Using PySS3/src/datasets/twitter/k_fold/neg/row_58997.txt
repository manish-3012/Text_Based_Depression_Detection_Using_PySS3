Don't know where to turnThis is my second post here in 2 days. I genuinely cannot bring myself to tell anyone how I feel besides strangers on the internet, I suppose. I feel like an idiot. I have a supporting family, doctors (if I could muster up the balls to tell them I'm suicidal), a promising future/career, ambition....so why do I feel this way? I mean, I understand how depression works....but I thought things were getting  *better* for me, not worse...

Or maybe I don't even want to be dead. All I've ever wanted is to be happy. I've been sober maybe 2 nights this week for the first time in at least 2 1/2 months, but I can't honestly remember. I have assignments to finish, applications deadlines, but none of it seems worth it anymore. I'm not smart enough to do these things. Even if I was, I'm certainly not mentally stable enough to be useful anyhow. I would do anything to not feel this way. 

I don't know if I want to die. I think I'm too scared to. The idea of waking up tomorrow sounds absolutely soul-crushing. I don't know who to talk to or what to do. I feel completely helpless. I need to talk to someone but I can't go bothering my friends at 2 am to scare the shit out of them.

I'm sorry for posting here again. It seemed a little less embarrassing than calling a suicide hotline.....last time I did that they tried to get me to pray with them..
