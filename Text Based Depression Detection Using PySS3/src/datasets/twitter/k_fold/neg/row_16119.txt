AlwaysI've always wanted to say good-bye
turn around &amp; leave this world behind.
I've always wanted to let go,
Plummet into the dark unknown. 
I've never felt like I belong. 
Someway &amp; how I'm whats wrong.
I've always had these feelings here,
For strange reasons I hold them near.
I've searched within, near &amp; far.
Yet no feelings stand at par.
I've always had these feelings here.
Staring back at me through the mirror. 
I'm not sure how I would react,
If they left &amp; never came back.
Because you see they're always here,
Filling me with sadness, hate, and fear. 
I know I'd be without them and alone,
If I said farewell and let myself go... 

I've always wanted to say good-bye
Leave myself and this world behind.
