This world is not meant for meAll I wanna do is die. Literally, when I get up early in the morning the first thought that enters my mind is ' I should die ' There is no place for a useless dumb fat kid on earth. 
I am not good at studies , I have only 1 friend who I would call before I die , don't have any social skills  ,don't have any hobby , don't know how to play an instrument, have severe depression and anxiety about which I cannot talk to anyone 

What should I do?
