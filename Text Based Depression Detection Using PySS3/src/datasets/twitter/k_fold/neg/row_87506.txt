I feel like I'm choking.even with amazing people by my side, I feel like I'm choking. I feel like I'll never get out no matter how much I cry and scream and try to break free and scream at god/our higher power asking why he is so cruel to us.. why?? if he loves his children so much why must life/he treat us like this?? maybe it's not his fault. no. I don't know.  

I feel like I am falling harder than I have ever fallen. I can barely get out to school, do homework/school work, I have no energy to do anything at all. I am scared of death. I don't know if we have an after life or reincarnation, but I hope it exists or I at least get to choose my path in the next life. I am scared of death because I don't know what it will bring. I'm scared to die painfully, which I know is the path I have chosen because there is no other way for me to go out. I wish I could press a button that could release my soul. I wish I could be free. 

the thing is I don't know if or when I will do it. I don't want to leave people, I'm scared. I just want to be someplace beautiful. someplace relaxing. a place where worries and problems dont exist. where you just exist in nature, it's just you and thousands of others but it's quiet. 

I want to be in a quiet place with my gf and just be in her presence when I die. 

I want to say "I love you" one last time. 

there is no place in society for someone like me anyway. 

god/higher power/whoever or whatever you are, please just fucking take me away. take me home.
