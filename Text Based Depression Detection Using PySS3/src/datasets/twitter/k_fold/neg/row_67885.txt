I attempted today. I have completely lost control of myself. Need help.I have few medical conditions that make my depression worse. But all my attempts have been in fit of anger and not knowing what to do. I have been brought down to this condition by my narcissistic brother. Who made sure I never succeeded. Took(borrowed in his mind) all of my hard earned money. Abused me when I asked my money back. Manipulated me to take care of everything while he was settling in another country. As soon as his life got better he hit me to the curb. Denied me my money. Abused me. Called me a "disabled fuck who is worthless" to my mother while she just listened to him. And then tried to get the house(father's property) I am living in transferred to his name. So he can legally evict me whenever he wants. 

I don't see a future. I know as soon as my mother passes away my brother and sister will come and take what's left of me. I am tired of all the fighting. I have wasted last 5 years for this family. Sacrificed everything. Got abused and looted in return. I am tired now.
