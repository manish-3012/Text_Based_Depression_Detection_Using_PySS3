I want to disappearI don't know what to say appart from the fact that i don't wanna be here anymore. It's not that i wanna die, because i feel like i won't be able to kill myself, i'm to afraid of what's gonna happen if i'm being honest. I'm only 14, i know that's its miserable. I know that i have a entire life in front on me, but, will it be great or will it continues to be a living-hell. 

I have a girlfriend and it's my bestfriend. Back in the days, she said that she loved me, but infortunatly, i couldn't say it back.More recently, she asked if i wanted to be her girlfriend, again. I was happy because our feelings were the same. Or so did i thought. Now, it's not the same anymore. Time goes by and i realise that i don't love her the way she love me. And that's awful. I feel horrible. I don't wanna hurt her like the first time. I would never want to hurt her again because i care about her so much. 

I feel guilty. There's other reasons that explained my suicidal thoughts. They didn't appear from now on. It's been 6 months since i restarted cutting myself. I have cuts all over my arms and my inner tights. I thought that i had stop but, the more i do it, the more i think i'll never really stop. 

I don't know how to help those thoughts. I wanna disappear but i know that i'm too afraid of dying to put an end to my life.
