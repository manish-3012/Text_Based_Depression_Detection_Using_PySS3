if society sucks and im just going to be a loser forever why not just kill myself?what good does it really do me to keep trying. I know its for nothing and even though I tried fairly hard it was too little, too late, and my problems have grown beyond me being able to handle them.

Im pretty isolated. the my family has a lot of problems, and anger towards each other and me because its a pretty hopeless situation.

Even if I find a way to be less of a burden, it still wont matter because things are bad, people are in rough health and the situation is still fucked regardless.

and as far as me, im doomed. I dont think it matters how hard I try, even if I try to open up a direction for myself its too late and Ive already fucked past whatever real opportunities I once had.

I have a couple degrees but its not gonna get me any good work out of the gates anywhere and doesnt really qualify me for anything even though I know a lot. I could go on further if it was really a possibility, but because of how Ive done it id have to pay to take a lot of individual classes over a year or two before I could even apply to go on.

im pretty much well fucked. I could go get certified to do some petty nothing job and I probably will. but it wont be much/any better than minimum wage and I'll probably still be locked into it for life.

Im already more alone and bitter than anyone. I even hate society and everyone else because I feel trapped with negative people in a hopeless situation.

I doubt I'll ever be in a position to date or be around anyone ever again. I dont even try. I dont even have anyone to really relate to. Im a mess and I dont expect any of that, but its really a depressing state.

my motivation to continue is dwindling as my chances of any true escape dwindle. Is it even worth trying to settle for less? Are things actually somehow going to get better someday if I only dont give up now?

or should I have just overdosed and died when I had the chance to?
