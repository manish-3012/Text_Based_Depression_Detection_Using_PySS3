I've been thinkingI've been with my bf for 9 years. The other weekend, he told me that if I died, it wouldn't matter bc I'm a stay at home mom with zero financial stability. I had our car for one month. He bought a truck and I had the car for 2 months so I could do things with our babies like the water park and library and eatout. His truck he bought 2006 Dodge Ram from a dealership in clear lake tx engine blew and he's still paying for it. He hates me. I hate me. Ive been drinking but it's also like he won't even talk to me. We haven't had sex in a month cause we live in a 2 room section of his dads house and we have 2 babysitters but he picked up kids early and won't let them leave and blah.
