How do I help my online friend who is suicidal?Hi. One of my online friends posted suicidal texts on his account. He is 15 and lives in Ohio. Through some chats I knew that he has an aunt at home who seems abusive. His phone was taken away today when he was about to call the national suicide hotline. He can only use his pc before 9:30 pm as well. What should I do to help him? Iâ€™m really worried now, because I canâ€™t lose one of my best similar age friend.. Please send me advice asap. Thank you
