FireSaturday morning I woke up at 4 am for no apparent reason. A few minutes later I begin to hear a large amount of commotion outside my apartment, I hear people banging on doors, and eventually hear someone shouting fire. I jumped out of bed and opened the front door only to be greeted by a wall of black smoke. I slammed the door shut and ran through the apartment yelling at my two roommates to get up and get out of the building.   


Minutes after the three of us got out of the building, our apartment was completely engulfed, and we all lost everything except for the clothes on our backs and anything we managed to grab on the way out.   


If my roommates hadn't been there, and I hadn't randomly woken up. I could have finally had what I have wanted so badly for the last 6 months. But instead, I'm forced to go into finals after having lost absolutely everything. I don't see any way for me to make it through this, and I just want to go ahead and do what the fire failed to.
