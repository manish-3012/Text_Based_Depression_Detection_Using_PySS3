Light myself on fireI was filling my car with gasoline today and I stood there for a few minutes considering pouring the gasoline on myself and setting myself on fire. My entire life I genuinely feel like I have been cursed, bad things happen to me at a near constant rate. Nothing I have ever wanted have I been successful at obtaining. I am a perpetual failure. I live in a near constant state of fear and suffering. People have always told me it would get better, but i have held these feelings for over a decade and they never do. I just want it to stop. I really can't take anymore.
