Bollocks to online therapy, I give upI tried online therapy last night but the person I was speaking to seemed absolutely useless. I explained the fact that I felt isolated from society due to the current circumstances because of certain conditions I have and that I suffered from having a nervous breakdown from everything building up, and they just responded back with "Well, we're very sorry to hear that but you always have connections online.". That's beside the point, sitting behind a screen 24/7 isn't going to do my mental well-being justice. I now have no counseling available. I've just come to a point now where I've near enough given up. I'm an ugly piece of shit who doesn't deserve to live. I hate this place, I hate what I've had to go through, I hate the lack of understanding there is in this world, I hate this shambles of a government, I hate the amount of abuse there is towards minorities and vulnerable people, and I hate the fact that whenever I get close to someone, I always cock it up on my own behalf without realising it. I've had enough. I've let so many people take advantage of me and I've lost many people because of this. I wish I could just fade away. I can't cope with the strenuous demands of life anymore because I just get too confused and overwhelmed.
