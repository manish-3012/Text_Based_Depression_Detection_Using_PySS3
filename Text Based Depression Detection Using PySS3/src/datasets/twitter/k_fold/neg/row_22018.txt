I'm trying, but that's enoughI've tried taking up new hobbies. Focusing more on myself. Nothing is really helping. 
I can't do this on my own, but at the same time I can't rely on others. 

I knew I was right - not everyone is meant to be happy. I just hope that soon I won't be scared to finally end it.
