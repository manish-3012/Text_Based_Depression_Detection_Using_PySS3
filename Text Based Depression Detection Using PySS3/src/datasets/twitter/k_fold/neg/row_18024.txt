I can't do this anymoreI'm going to do it today. I'm going to leave while my friend is sleeping and take the bus to the park. Then I'm going to cut my wrists by the lake.

I'm tired of constantly being hurt. I just want him to love me. I'm tired of the disappointment. I don't care about the "great times" in the future. Even if it does get better it's just going to turn to shit. No one can stop me. I've made up my mind and bought my bus pass.
