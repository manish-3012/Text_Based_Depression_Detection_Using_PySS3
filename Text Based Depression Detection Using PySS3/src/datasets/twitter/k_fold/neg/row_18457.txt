Not sure if this is the right sub. Looking for help.I've struggled with severe depression on and off for a few years. It has gotten really bad within that past few months. At moments it seems like it's getting better, and then I fall back into depression again. It's getting to the point where I'm scared to be home alone because I'm afraid of what I might do. I've come close to self-harm/suicide a few times. 

I've tried talking to friends about this and I've tried expressing my feelings through art (I write lyrics), but none of that worked for me. I'm still depressed and lost. I think I might actually need professional help. I have no idea how to do this though. I've heard of people checking into like mental hospitals (idk if that's what they're actually called). Where can I find one? Is it a good option? 

And feel free to suggest any other options. Anytime I've tried looking for help with depression on google it just gives me 10 step guides to make depression magically go away.
