I really want a good reason to liveI want to die so badly there's only one thing in my life that makes me slightly happy and i know it'll be gone in about two years. I really want to love myself or be able to work hard towards a goal but everything seems pointless. I really want some reason to come along to convince me to live but there hasn't been one. I'm sick of living
