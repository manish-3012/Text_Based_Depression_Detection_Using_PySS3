My self-hatred truly ruined my life. Please send me off well.I'm repulsive, and I am very aware of it. I got great at doing makeup at a very young age, hoping that someone would say I'm pretty if I knew how to do it well. Turns out makeup can't cover up my hideous being.


I feel sorry for all the people who ever had to touch me because I'm utterly disgusting. Some of my friends hugged me in the past, and I feel guilty to this day.


I look like a sweaty wrinkley pig. I'm fat, and have stretch marks, my breasts are also absolutely repulsive. Luckily, nobody besides me has ever seen them, so that's good. But they're still there, and I know about them. 


I'm unstable. I like to punish myself for simply existing. I hit myself, and used to self harm. I starve myself and throw up on purpose. 


I have one last friend who makes me hate myself even more. I send her plenty of messages every day because there's nobody else I could share my thoughts with, and she usually replies once every two or three days with one cold short sentence. I try to cheer her up, and I tell her how beautiful she is. I keep telling her how talented and amazing she is. I write freaking essays to encourage her in doing what she loves. I check up on her if she eats and drinks properly. Yesterday, she disabled the 'let-others-see-you're-online' feature, but before that, she used to be online constantly without even bothering to read my messages. 


I thought this was a puberty thing. But I'm turning 19 in a few months, and literally nothing changed. I despise myself exactly the same as when I was 13. 


I saw two therapists. It didn't work for me.


I really fucking tried, Reddit. The worst thing is, my personality must be horrible as well because decent people don't do shit like this to themselves or others.
