Itâ€™s too much this timeIâ€™ve got a decent job and things are finally going good between me and my crush. I should be happy.

Instead I feel insane. Been feeling off since the start of may. I just feel different. Itâ€™s as if I feel everything. So sensitive. Thoughts donâ€™t make sense. Iâ€™m afraid of my own mind. I overthink about anything. Extremely self conscious about my body. From my hair to my teeth. 

Iâ€™ve been in this position before, but thatâ€™s been years ago. I thought I was doing better. Turns out thatâ€™s not the case. 

Iâ€™m at work right now and I just feel so out of it. Everyone is talking and Iâ€™m just so down. Iâ€™m quiet. People notice. Iâ€™m usually pretty social.

Honestly, I donâ€™t think I can take it anymore. Life shouldnâ€™t be this way. Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t understand basic things. Itâ€™s like my mind is slowly deteriorating. All Iâ€™ve been doing these past few days is sleep and go to work. And at work I want to go home as soon as possible again.

I canâ€™t continue life like this. Suicide seems like my only option.
