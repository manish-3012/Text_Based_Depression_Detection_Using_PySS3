Not feeling depressed after deciding to kill myself but still want to go through with it anyway.I guess this is hard to explain but my life probably like most people here is pretty bad. Never had real friends never had a significant other the best way to describe my immediate family is trashy I never really had an interest in any career Iâ€™m treated like a burden around the house by everyone (although my mom doesnâ€™t typically) and basically donâ€™t see the point of going on. 

A few months ago I decide to go ahead and kill myself. After that every time something would drag me down into a super depressed mindset I would just say â€œ it wonâ€™t matter for much longer anywayâ€. And because if that Iâ€™m basically panicking because this almost fake happiness that I have is just that fake. So I intend to still do it despite not really wanting to anymore.

Now Iâ€™m super hesitant because 1 donâ€™t want to use a gun that would be cruel for my mom to see 2 the pain of hanging myself seems pretty bad even if it is only for a few seconds 3 i donâ€™t know if religion is real and donâ€™t want to end up going to hell even though iv been told committing suicide doesnâ€™t make you go there. 

I know this probably isnâ€™t the best place for an opinion on my situation but I figure since I have no one else to talk to I would ask.
