My note, if it comes down to it.Dear parents,

You made my life hell. I trusted strangers on the internet more than you. Not to mention, you pushed aside what I tell you. From facts about my gender to school work, you never cared and just gave me negitave attention.

As for my amazing boyfriend, and friends: you guys were the only things that kept me going. Well, until now.

School: fuck you. Especially you, you math teaching freak. You know who you are.

Well, I think that's all.



   Goodbye, dreadful world
