Why live when I make the world a worse place?Who am I helping by being alive?  Very few care that I'm alive and very few would care when I die.  I'm a inancial and emotional burden on everyone.  I hurt my classes and work when I am feeling too down to carry my load.  I hurt my family by being emotionally unavailable and needing money to cover for my therapy and medicine.  I hurt my friends by being unavailable when I am in a mood.  Who do I help when I am feeling like this all the time?  Fact is, everyone would be better off if I were dead.  I am selfish for keeping myself alive.  

I'm lazy.  I'm sort of an asshole.  I have few if any positive traits.

All of this reminds me of a poem by Audre Lorde.

&gt; suppose I die before graduation   
&gt; they will sing sad melodies   
&gt; but finally
&gt; tell the truth about me
&gt; There is nothing I want to do   
&gt; and too much
&gt; that has to be done

If I die before May I will be mourned by people who didn't know me and want to look "compassionate," and the people who knew me would secretly be glad I'm gone.
