brother tried to kill himselfidk how to feel, he visited a few days ago and kept sighing as if he wanted me to ask what was wrong and i showed absolutely no interest. i tried reaching out to him along with other siblings when shit was bad multiple times and they gave me nothing. would beat me when i was little out of jealousy, stole my shit and i was always scared of him. ive grown to downright hate him and i feel like a total piece of shit. he gave me absolutely nothing for years and for him to finally make a visit to ask my mom for money, and to say nothing to me, idk. maybe he just came to test to see if anyone cared and i blew it. i sent him a message explaining this and i hope he responds but probably not. i thought why fucking should i? i had an attempt recently, i was found this time and brought to the hospital and he nor my other siblings (counting one living with us) nor my mom said anything to me afterwards as if it never happened. they still dont mention it, and ive been thinking like wow i was right, the ol â€œno one would notice i was goneâ€ is true, and since then ive gotten more reckless and suicidal. the only person who seemed to give a shit was my dad who found me in the first place but he didnt say much himself. and it has me thinking, why does no one want to help each other, why is it only me who, right now, really wants to contact my brother and tell him how much i love him and that i dont want him to die? maybe he just didnt know? i dont know, regardless i sent it because i know how that felt and i dont want him to go
