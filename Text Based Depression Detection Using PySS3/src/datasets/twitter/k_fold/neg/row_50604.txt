Telling my dad my suicidal thoughts just generates a lecture about how I'm young and should be enjoying life.He just tells my I'm too young and that my feelings are invalid. He doesn't word it like that obviously, but that's basically what he's saying. When he found the cuts on my arms he just said I was stupid.

I get the same lecture everytime. I think it's time to call it quits.

Edit: I'm alright. I took a rest day my close friends house and I feel much better at the moment.
