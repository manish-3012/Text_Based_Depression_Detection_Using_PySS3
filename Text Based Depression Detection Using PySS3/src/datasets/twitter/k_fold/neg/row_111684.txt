I wish that truck actually ran us overWe were on a road trip, and I was sitting in the passenger seat and my father was driving.  The car was straying towards the opposite lane but my father did not notice.  There was a gigantic truck heading towards us at speed.  I wish I did not tell him to watch out.  I wish the truck actually ran us over.  Problem is that the truck was going to hit us from the drivers side.  If my father were to die it is going to immediately impact my 2 sisters' lives.  We would probably lose our home, one of my sister would drop out of her masters degree, and I don't want that to happen to my sisters.  I swear if i was on the other side of the car, I would definitely not say anything, and welcome the truck with a smile on my face.
