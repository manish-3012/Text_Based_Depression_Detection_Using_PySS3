I have a baby on the way, and I keep getting very intense impulses to end my life.I would say that in my early to mid teens I was incredibly suicidal. I came very close and sincerely did not want to be alive, as I was very fat and had a very unhealthy social life. Around 16 I made new friends and discovered reddit. My passion for science was catalyzed and life grows increasingly sacred to me every day. I would never kill myself because as an Atheist I think this is likely the only chance we get. Which is why I am here. I do not want to die, but I'm afraid if I just happen to be in the wrong state of mind I won't hesitate to cut an artery or drive off a cliff. It's like a sudden impulse where I just want to smash my face into a wall or imagine me killing myself in some brutal way. The impulses are getting much worse this past week and I have no one to talk to about it. The worst part is my girlfriend is almost 3 months pregnant. I'm excited to have a baby and I want to be a good father, but I know she doesn't love me. She doesn't like it when I kiss her or touch her. If I suggest sex she gets mad at me. She just doesn't care about me at all anymore, it's like I'm just a hassle in her life. I have one good friend who only hangs out with me because I'm his only friend. My siblings have all threatened suicide to me in the past few years and I feel like I would just be begging for attention if I told them. I don't have insurance and I have spoken to medical professionals concerning this and they say there is nothing they can do because I don't have a real plan. I really want to be alive for my future baby and I want to help fix the oceans, I just need some help shaking these feelings. Maybe someone who has felt the same can tell me how they got passed it.
