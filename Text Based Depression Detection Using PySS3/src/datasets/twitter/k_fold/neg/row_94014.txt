Need help stopping someone from giving upHi, I'm not usually here very often I'm here for a friend and I'm hoping someone can help me give you something for fight for. 

My friend was cheated on, and her home life isn't so well either and all those combined is really taking a toll on her and I really care about her and I need her to stay. 

Any tips? 

All help is appreciated.
