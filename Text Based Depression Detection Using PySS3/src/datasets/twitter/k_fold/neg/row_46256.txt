Can't support my family, probably gonna die soonI left a good job because I was miserable at it. I thought my girlfriend and I would be able to start a business and support our 5 kids on that. Well.. I'm slowly finding that, although it's starting to become successful, it's not enough. We're making enough to keep the business running but not enough to pay our bills and feed our kids. I need a W-2 job in order to keep us afloat. I have an associate's degree and a fairly decent work history. I've applied for 20 jobs since the beginning of May, some related to my line of work, some not. Only one company has called me in for an interview. It's a temp job, working minimum wage with no benefits for a summer camp for special needs kids. I have no experience in this. I was offered the position and I'm taking it but I'm not into it. It's making me so depressed. It's going to take me away from my kids during the week. Nobody in my field of work has even offered me an interview. I DON'T want to change diapers on teenagers. I don't want to touch them and I don't care want them touching me! I also won't be able to pursue other forms of employment while working for the company. Sure I'll be able to apply for jobs but I won't be able to go to any interviews if I'm offered any. I won't be able to help my wife with our business. I'm just so upset. I can't afford my meds anymore because no insurance. I'm a failure and a fuck up. I never should have left my past 2 jobs. I probably wasn't as miserable as I thought I was. I think about dying all day, every day. I'm convinced my family's lives would be better if I wasn't in it. Ever since my meds have worn off, I've been suicidal. I have bipolar by the way. My girlfriend never knew how bad it was until I got off the meds. Now she's scared she's going to wake up one day and I'll be dead. And you know what? She's probably right.
