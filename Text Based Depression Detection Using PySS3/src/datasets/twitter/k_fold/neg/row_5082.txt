i just want this nightmare to endIm probably going to end this life soon. I see no point in living, all of my actions bring nothing but sadness to me. I do my best to have good relationship with everyone, but im still so lonely, i got nothing in this life. I wake up every day i meditate i do excercise then go to work, come back home go to sleep and repeat. nothing good ever happens to me. I fucking want to kill myself and stop this suffer with no ending. This is worse than dead, because im suffering so fucking muchand feel no happynes at all ever.
