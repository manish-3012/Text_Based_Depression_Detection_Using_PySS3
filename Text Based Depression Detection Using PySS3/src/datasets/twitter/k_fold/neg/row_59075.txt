I didn't kill myself today.That's an achievement for me. I didn't kill myself today. I planned to, I wrote my farewell notes and I was going to the bridge to throw myself, but it clicked to me that I can't just do that. Not now, there are still things I have to do, people that believe in me to stay alive. So I did. I went home and told my parents. They know about my suicidal tendencies and are really supportive of me.   
I don't think this will be the last attempt for me, but it was really important for me. I'm kind of proud of myself.
Edit: Thank you all very much for your support, it really brightens my day :)
