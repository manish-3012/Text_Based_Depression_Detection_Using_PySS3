She knew and did nothing.I won't take up to much if your time and please don't feel obligated to read. This is just an outlet. 
Today my mother admitted she knew I had been raped at the age of 8.  It's been nearly 14 years of battling to try to feel ok again, desperately looking for help and it turns out she knew the whole time and did nothing. I wish I had died that day. I wish I would never wake up again. I'm so tired of feeling dirty and used. I'm so tired.
