I'm so tired I just want to die already
the only reason I'm alive is cause of my boyfriend . he is the only thing keeping me from going on a murderous rampage and killing myself . my life has been and still is horrible . I'm such a pussy that I dont want to , i cant , but at the same time i really want to kill myself ...or at least swallow a lot of pills just to see what happens . I'm so tired of waking up everyday to the same fucking miserable life , being trapped in this disgusting house with my shitty "parents", smoking myself out and only looking forward to the days I can hangout with my boyfriend . I feel like such a worthless faker cause I'm scared ...I'm scared of actually going through with it ..I love my boyfriend so much and he has been so good to me for the past 3 years but I just dont know what to do anymore ...I dont want to do this anymore . I cant do this anymore .
