I have a dog to care for and I'm in piecesI have been falling apart lately.
My family and friends don't know.
I'm currently alone in my apartment.
I have a dog and I need her to be taken care of but I'm scared about potentially making myself unable to care for her eventually.

How can I ensure she's going to be safe and cared for if things happen? Anyone here have a plan for their pets wellbeing?
