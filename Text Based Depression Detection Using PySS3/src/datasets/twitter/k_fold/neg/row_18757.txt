Itâ€™s happening tomorrowWhen I wake up tomorrow I will start my day as normal, shower, get dressed for school and leave but I wonâ€™t go to school. Instead Iâ€™ll go to the woods behind my house, Iâ€™ll walk deep into them and find a tree. Iâ€™ll sit and maybe consider this one last time but I doubt Iâ€™ll stop my self. You know what Iâ€™ll do with the tree and how itâ€™ll end. 

Some of you cared, none of you cared enough.
