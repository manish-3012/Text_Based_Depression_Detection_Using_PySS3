Iâ€™m scared for myselfIâ€™m lonely and far away from my friends. Iâ€™ve been suicidal and depressed for months. Itâ€™s definitely been affecting my work but Iâ€™d only gotten positive feedback until today when my boss told me that the previous person in my position got a lot more done and was more impressive and successful. The last time we talked she said sheâ€™d be happy to write me a letter of recommendation in the future. This time she said she wouldnâ€™t mind but that I might want to find someone else to. I feel like a colossal failure and a waste of space. I feel like Iâ€™m invisible to everyone and it wouldnâ€™t really affect anything if I disappeared.
After work I came so close to jumping in front of a subway train. Itâ€™s the closest Iâ€™ve ever come to killing myself with a method that would actually work. Iâ€™m kind of shaken up and am scared that Iâ€™ll do something impulsive but Iâ€™m also so so tired and donâ€™t know how long I want to keep doing this for.
