My teenaged son wrote some suicidal poetry. Coupled with his recent experiences and behavior, this is alarming. Please, I need advice.His mom died in March. I thought he was doing really well, but was concerned by his lack of grieving. He has consistently refused my offers of therapy, and is now completely withdrawn from me.

I am terrified and at my wits end.
