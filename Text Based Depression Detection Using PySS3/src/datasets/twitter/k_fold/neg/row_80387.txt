Lost my mother at 12My mom battled with many problems and couldnt handle the pain anymore and ended it the only way she knew she could, I was 12 at the time and from that day on I feel that I've lost any and all emotion. I'm 20 now and each day is a struggle, some days are better than others but every night I sit and think about ways everything could be over, and done. I've thought of countless ways I could end it all, but the thought of putting my family through it, is something I can't do. I can't live the rest of my live with these thoughts and I don't know what to do at this point, I've tried everything but nothing has helped
