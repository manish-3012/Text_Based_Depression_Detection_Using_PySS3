Solid reason why I really should want to continue living?Everything I'm going to say is totally literal.

I've had literally 0 friends or acquaintances in my entire life, a very high social anxiety, I'm hopelessly asocial (although I myself want to stop being so), I have a really deplorable weakness, aptitudes, qualities and physical condition (I'm obese, I have a hump and I can get tired to the point of exhaustion the moment I do any minimal exercise or even directly there're things that I can't do in any way, like doing a simple push-up), I have an innate and completely inevitable behavior of not trying, even when I've actually proposed it myself and want to do it, I have absolutely no taste, interest, or hobby, I have an overwhelming failure in school, secondary education being my greatest achievement without any minimum expectation or possibility that I may achieve a higher degree, my intelligence borders on subnormality, I don't have a job nor do I seriously believe that I'll ever get something, nor even the most seedy of all (and believe me I've tried seriously), my family considers me a failure (rightly so) and doesn't admit me in any way in their home or in their life and it's very likely that in a period excessively short in time, my expectations for the future are, hopefully, to live under a bridge or under a gallery as a homeless person.

Knowing all this, and it's very likely that I still left something else. What solid and real reasons do I have to want to continue living? Why do I want to endure the many decades that I can still live, inevitably living with continuous suffering and misery? Literally, the only good condition I have is that unfortunately for me I'm in exceptionally good health and it's really very difficult for me to get sick or die other than age (without going further, I have a clear problem of obesity and without however, I have absolutely no heart problems, cholesterol, sugar... among other things).
