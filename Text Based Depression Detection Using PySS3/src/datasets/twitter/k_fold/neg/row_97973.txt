I don't deserve to be hereEDIT: 20 years old, university student

I feel like I'm not even allowed to post here. I mean technically I'm a woman who is doing okay. I have few friends. I study. 
I don't even know what I'm doing here. Suicide has been more and more in my mind.

I just can't stand myself. I am disgusting. I'm utterly worthless. Doing anything feels like such a chore to me. I'd rather stay in bed and stare at the ceiling. Or maybe sleep for a year. Maybe not wake up at all. 
Being around other people is difficult for me. (I suffer from social anxiety) All I can think of is how fat and ugly I am or how stupid my voice sounds and it makes me want to run away. 

I do trust my friends but at the same time it's impossible for me to think that they like me. They just hang around and don't say anything for politeness sake. This probably doesn't make sense. Thinking like that makes me feel worse about myself.

I can't think of anything that I'm even remotely okay with myself. All this sounds so petty I know. 

I just absolutely hate myself. I can't remember the last time I felt happy. It's getting harder to convince myself to get out of bed. And it's not because I'm sleepy. Even that makes me feel lazy and worthless.

Sorry. This is so vague and rambly.  I don't know what to tell you.
