numb (m 18)i am so tired of being fucking tired

i just got my second rejection in two months of being unemployed

this is after applying to 50+ jobs in a desperate attempt to get out of Â£2000 of debt before I go to university this year - i got kicked out of my old university and fired last october

i got a seasonal job but i just left one day because i'm weak and i couldn't handle it

i use amphetamines 4+ times a week to excess and drink and smoke heavily also

i'm a financial burden to my parents

my best friend hung up after five minutes on the phone earlier (my only conversation in 3 days that wasn't with my dealer or my mum) because she couldn't "deal with me right now"

i thought i couldn't get lower and i think i have, there is a lot of reasoning pointing towards ending it

i honestly wish i could be kidnapped or make it look like an accident - i don't want to give anyone any reason to think i'm more selfish than i already am
