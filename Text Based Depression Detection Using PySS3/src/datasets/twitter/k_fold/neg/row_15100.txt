I want to hurt myself very badIâ€™m extremely scared I have a chronic parasitic infection. Itâ€™s most common in tropical areas in Southeast Asia and I live in the United States. But the pictures look similar to the rashes Iâ€™ve been getting for a good month now, though it says itâ€™s supposed to itch, mine donâ€™t itch. It has a mortality rate and my parents donâ€™t wanna take me to a doctor because of the rona. Iâ€™m helpless and Iâ€™m terrified parasites are living under my skin and in my intestines hence why my stool has been looking funny. I want to bash my head in my room door and just walk and drop my 6â€™0 220lb body without catching myself hurting my head . I just want to knock myself unconscious
