Some thoughtsI refuse to believe I have depression, even though I have been started on ADâ€™s and for a month or two I felt better for a little bit have recently been hit with everything I felt prior, + more. On medication I just feel stupid, slow, and perhaps even irritable almost. I have constant brain fog recently, although Iâ€™m not sure if this is attributed to the ADs or drug abuse problems I have. 

A common theme around here is that if there was a button to just cease existing I would press that 100 times over. But I just canâ€™t bring myself to seriously try and end it all. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s because Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m giving up too early or out of love for my mother and significant other. As a result I constantly run from my problems, skirt my responsibilities, and get fucked up as hell whenever Iâ€™m feeling sad or hopeless. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like this constantly, but I still cling onto the hope that itâ€™ll get better and Iâ€™ll be fixed eventually. Iâ€™m not sure what I was looking for by posting this, just wanted some comments or input as to what the best ways to cope moving forward is.

I did post here two days ago for those who see the familiar handle.
