I wish I knew what love felt likeI donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever felt genuine love in my life. I wish I had someone who cared about me. I have no one, Iâ€™ve pushed away friends and Iâ€™ve been abandoned by most of my family. I sometimes wonder why I continue to go on everyday. Struggling to love myself and find any kind of meaning or purpose in my life. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m here. I sometimes I wish I knew what happened after death so I wouldnâ€™t be so scared to end it all. I just want to be held and cry in someoneâ€™s arms. Iâ€™m tired of going through the pain and continuing on and acting like Iâ€™m fine. Only the alcohol and drugs make me feel good. They hold me when no one else will. Why am I so unloveable?
