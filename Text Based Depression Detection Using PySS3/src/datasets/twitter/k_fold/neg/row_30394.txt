I wish my brother was successful when he tried to drown me.I remember that feeling so vividly I remember feeling my body start to go limp as he kept pushing my head down further. I remember how clear my mind was. I wish he kept going. I wish he killed me under that water. I wish i died back then. I wish I died there, in the shallow end of a boys school swimming pool. I donâ€™t want to have to do this myself. I donâ€™t want to have to end it myself. Canâ€™t I just die a victim instead of a selfish monster. Couldnâ€™t my dad have been in my room that night, could he not have killed me. I just donâ€™t want to be here. I just want to die. Iâ€™m so sorry. I just want to die.
