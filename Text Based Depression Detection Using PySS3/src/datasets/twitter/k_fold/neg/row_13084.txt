What is the Meaning of life?I know this is gonna sound weird but ive asked myself this for a long time. On the outside Iâ€™m perfect. I have friends, I do well in school, I wonâ€™t lie and say I had a hard childhood bc I didnâ€™t. I date, I fit in, I have a job. Sure shits wrong in my life but I feel like I have it fairly easy. And yet when I look to tomorrow I donâ€™t see anything. Nothing to look too. Itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t have activities though, u just donâ€™t see the point. 

I planned on ending it after high school, but over the summer I got a girlfriend so I didnâ€™t. Now that we have broken up(it was mutual and we are still friends) I donâ€™t really have a reason to go on. The only reason Iâ€™m here is bc I know my family would be shattered. So my question is how, how do I live for me?
