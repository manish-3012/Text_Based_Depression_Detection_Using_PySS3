I have to do it today.. SorryI have nothing to eat.I'm broke. I woke up this morning finding only a piece of yesterday's bread (I live in a third world country).. I have no one. I'm just using a coffee shops wifi to write this and I sold my  phone to buy cheaper one. Life is unfair and difficult. I tried to find a job this morning for even one hour to even eat something but no one wants to hire me.
I'm not begging.. I just want you to be thankful and grateful of what you have even if Its little because I have nothing.. I'm crying writing this... Be thankful goodbye.
