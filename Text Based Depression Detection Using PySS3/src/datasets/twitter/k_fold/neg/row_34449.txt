I donâ€™t want to existI cant stand the thought people see me. Like sure they probably donâ€™t care about me but iâ€™ll still be seen by them and unconsciously judged and i hate that.
I hate that time wont slow down and every moment im wallowing in pity are moments, energy, oxygen, money im wasting.
If i die ill still exist, not alive but still. People will remember me, my body will still exist, everything ive wasted will still exist. I really hate that. That i exist and the decision for me to exist wasnt made by me and it cant be undone no matter how much i want it to.
