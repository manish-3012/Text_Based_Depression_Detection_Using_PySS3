Suicidal partner

I'm (29/m) due to get married soon. My partner (25/f) of 4 years has always shown signs of depression, but for the most part things have gone well. She does compare herself incessantly with other people and social media doesn't help with that. The fact that I and a few of my close friends earn more than double what she does also affects her 

Recently however, with planning a wedding, things have become worse, and most recently she pulled out a knife, told me to leave so that she could end it. While this scares me massively, because I care about her a lot, I'm worried about our future together.

I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells with her, and saying the wrong thing puts her out. Any time I try to make a valid point about her behaviour, she says things like "I'm a horrible person anyway". I've tried to get her to seek help but she just won't listen. I don't know if going ahead with this wedding is the right thing. 

This probably seems really jumbled but I honestly don't know what to do or say. We might have a couple of good weeks where we enjoy each others company before the same shit starts again.

Sometimes I worry that I'm only still with her because I'm scared of what she would do without me, how she would cope. Shes said many times that I'm the only person she has.

Any advice would be much appreciated

TL;DR my fiance is depressed and occasionally suicidal, wedding coming up and no idea what to do
