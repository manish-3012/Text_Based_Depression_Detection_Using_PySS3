I wish God would stop tormenting meIf it ain't God then who? No nobody fuckin knows, i always had a bad life after 6 grade, depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Im 22 now but i ask myself why? Why did i deserve to suffer so much? I was never a bad person from th start, i only smoke weed in high school once and that was it. I always cuss out God everyday and if i wouldn't cuss at him then who? I got no friends or family members that understand me. I went thru hell and no one in my family knows. Fuck my life.
