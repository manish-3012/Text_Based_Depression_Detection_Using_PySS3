At one point they were alive. And then they werenâ€™t.I am currently contemplating suicide. All of those times I have pushed people away because I believed they would be better off without me. It worked. I donâ€™t believe I deserve any help. Not from this messed up world, filled with these messed up humans. This world is pathetic. And I hate it. Iâ€™m perfectly fine, and I donâ€™t need anyone to tell me Iâ€™m â€œmentallyâ€ ill. I feel as though I am making the right, logical choice, in contemplating this.

At the same time, I fathom what it could be like to see old pictures of me, and then I am suddenly dead. Although I find solice in those who will not miss me at all; I enjoy that thought, because I donâ€™t deserve to be remembered by this cruel world.

All of you are a burden to me. Every last human on Earth. All the same. Brainless monkeys with primitive instincts. You cannot think beyond that and I pity you all. You cling onto all of these material objects and status symbols; when they break, you replace them. Arenâ€™t I the same way? Donâ€™t I share the same value as something you take for granted every single day? The answer is yes.

You should get over yourself. If I do decide to die, itâ€™ll be my choice.
