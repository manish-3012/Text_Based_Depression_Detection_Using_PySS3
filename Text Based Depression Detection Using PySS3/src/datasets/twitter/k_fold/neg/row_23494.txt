I'm done.I have Bipolar Disorder and ADHD. I'm always either out saving the world, or bedridden for days. There is no in-between; it's exhausting.

My mind feels *raw*; I experience everything so *intensely*, good and bad. That's not always a bad thing, but it just never stops. I simply want my mind to turn off.
