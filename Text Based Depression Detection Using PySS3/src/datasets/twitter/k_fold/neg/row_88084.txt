I've realised I'm a lesbian, and it's made me suicidal.I really wish I was straight. I know none of my family will accept me. My country isn't progressive at all. I have a husband. It would be so much easier if I was straight, if I was actually attracted to him. I hate this part of me, and I don't know who to turn to. There's no one in my real life who I can talk about this to.
