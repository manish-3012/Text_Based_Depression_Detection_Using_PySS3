i canâ€™t do it anymoreevery time i wake up it starts again. i canâ€™t escape my head and body. i havenâ€™t showered in a week iâ€™ve not eaten and iâ€™ve barely drank. i keep having breakdowns. i canâ€™t cope with it but iâ€™m still too scared and i just need some motivation to do it. all i can think of is how can i get the pain to end
