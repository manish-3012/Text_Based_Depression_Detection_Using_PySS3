Probably my last post hereWould it be cruel if I left a note explaining everything leading up to my inevitable death for my family? As is, no one knows that I'm suicidal, no one has any idea that I'm depressed beyond repair. I genuennly have no respect or care for anyone in this world, but I'd want to leave them, Idk, closure? My family is extremely religious, to the point where I'll probably get no funeral (islam). But, even with that, it'll brake them, so I just want to leave them closure. Is it a good idea?
