SuicidalWhats the point? My life has always been shitty and Iâ€™ve wanted to die since I was 16. I have no friends, family, or job. I lost and pushed away the girl I loved. Iâ€™m basically homeless and spiraling out of control. I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. I hate this world and myself so much. Who cares if one more person dies in the world.
