It's not if, but when. I think...So I kinda don't know where to start, or what or why I am writing this. I was typing into Google about how a fast and non painful way to end it. I came across a reddit post that brought me to this sub. I don't know why I am posting this. Not sure I am asking for help or screaming silently for someone to just hear me. Being silently beaten down by the one you love and who is suppose to love you. These past 6 years have been real hard, harder than usual. I have on 2 attempts tried to kill myself. One was a direct attempt. Lately, and I mean all the time. It's in my head again. I am just ready. I just so tired. I am tired if feeling rejected. Tired of being by myself. I feel alone all the time. The women that I married, has been pushing me away for so long, rejected from her all the time. I sleep on the couch and have been for over a year. I am tired. I really just need all this to just stop. The hurt I feel, the pain I have all over my body. There is more to this story. I am leaving a lot out. Like I said. I don't know why I am posting. I not sure I'll check it after this. I just wanted something, but I don't know what it is.
