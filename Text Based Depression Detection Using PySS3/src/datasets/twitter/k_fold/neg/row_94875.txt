Working on notes tonight...I have a plan. I know when, and how. A little less sure about where to do it. I donâ€™t want to do it at home because I live with my mom and I donâ€™t want to ruin her home with memories of my suicide scene. I would rather do it in the woods or maybe be super dramatic and go to the cemetery (mostly joking about that one heh).

Anyway, I have one week from tomorrow. So itâ€™s time for me to start preparing my notes. Iâ€™m writing one for my mom and brothers, one for my friends, one for my pastor, and one for my therapist. Iâ€™m going to make them short and to the point.

I hope I go to hell. I deserve it for how selfish I am for doing this.

I just needed to tell someone. I needed to be honest with someone so I can keep lying to my family and friends.
