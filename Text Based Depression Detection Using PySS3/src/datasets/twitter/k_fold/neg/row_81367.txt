Hello, everyone...Hello, everyone... how are you doing? 

This is my first Reddit post, itâ€™s nice to meet everyone and all of you that get a chance to read this. 

Iâ€™m a lonely guy whoâ€™s been obsessed with a girl Iâ€™ve met online over a year ago. I donâ€™t know how to explain what Iâ€™m dealing with. It seems that whenever I have the chance to get something off of my chest, I donâ€™t have the courage to put it into words. I still try. Life is moving on and it leaves people behind along the way. I certainly feel left behind. I donâ€™t really want to meet people in person either, but I also long for a connection. Theyâ€™ve all been the same, people seem uninterested and leave. I donâ€™t bother trying anymore. I go days at a time without saying a word. 

What are you dealing with?
