I wish they knewI wish she knew, i wish she knew every time she comes back and apologizes for being a dick and I accept her back with open arms it hurts. I wish she knew every time she flirts with me needlessly and get my hopes up of us again it was like salt on the wound. I wish my boss knew when he skipped over me for my promotion again it crushed me. I wish he knew how honestly committed to this company I am. All those off the clock hours I chose to work because I wanted whatâ€™s best for the company. I wish my parents knew that me loosing motivation isnâ€™t me trying to be a worthless pos, itâ€™s every-time I try and get ahead I get shut down in every avenue of my life. I wish they all knew how hard I honestly struggled everyday. But I guess deep down I donâ€™t want them to know, I donâ€™t want any of them to know. I donâ€™t want to seem weak to any of them, I try and seem like a godly salesman and man 24/7.  But if they knew, if they really knew, theyâ€™d know how many nights Iâ€™ve just put my mouth around the barrel but not had any balls...
