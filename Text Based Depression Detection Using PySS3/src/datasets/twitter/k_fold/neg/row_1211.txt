Simply put I want to die but I donâ€™t want my family to feel like they should have done something.Thatâ€™s it. I want to die.  I am tired of the people I love breaking their promises to me. Iâ€™m over it. Iâ€™m so over it. 

How do I write goodbye letters so they can fully understand this? Itâ€™s not their fault. I only blame a handful of people for me feeling this way (including myself). They can feel responsible but not my family.
