Sick of being sick and tired of feeling tired.I am so lonely and so tired and in so much pain.

No one will reply to this.

I canâ€™t kill myself because the few people that are important to me would blame themselves.

But I would like to go to sleep and not wake up tomorrow morning. Or wake up somewhere else. 

I cut myself, to try to stop the feeling. To feel something else. It usually works. But tonight I still feel so alone.

I hate this. I hate myself. I wish that I could sleep.
