Lonely and hopelessI honestly don't know what to do anymore. I'm so lonely I can't take it anymore and today I found out my financing fell through for my mortgage. I'm out a thousand dollars on a home I can't get now. I'm so tired of people lying about everything to me saying things from "it will get better" to "the loan is approved". I'm all alone and I have no one to talk to and no support. People keep telling me things like oh, you have friends and family that you will hurt. But I don't. I literally have no one. I get a constant weekly reminder tof it every week with an email from worj telling me I have to update my emergency contact. We'll, I don't have one and my cat is the executor of my will. That is how alone I am. I just can't take Amy more of this and I seriously don't think I can make it through this weekend, but I have no one to talk to or any way to get help. I'm just lost.
