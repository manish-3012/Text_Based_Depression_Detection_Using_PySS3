im young dumb, a bit careless at times but 2k17 has been the year where i just want to end it all.i have had more fucked up shit happened to me in the past but now its like im just being fucking thrown around like a ragdoll and my family "tries to support me" but you cant just throw someone in a mental hospital for half of their lives and expect the best out of someone afterwards. I need/want someone who can relate to me but its like I'm just a fucking lunatic in the family. I'm a FUCKING retard and nobody will ever love me.
