It sucks to feel like you want to live for a few small reasons but you know things will be too unbearable if you continue onThis is just going to be one boring rant but even if no one reads this, I just need somewhere to vent. Sorry.

I think Iâ€™ve always just taken things too seriously. I can see the logical side of my situation that tells me Iâ€™m only 14, and things can get better if I hold on. Believe me, Iâ€™m sure as hell I could figure it all out if I was determined enough. But I also see the side that tells me that there is a hell of a lot of agony just waiting for me if I donâ€™t do something about it. And even if I get past my first barrier (the horrors of my upcoming grades in which I will collapse under the pressure of homework), thereâ€™s still more waiting for me. Iâ€™ve never been normal, both physically and mentally. I have severe anxiety and I know that will limit me a lot in life and cause me unnecessary pain. I am also so picky about what I eat to the point where my body isnâ€™t getting nearly enough nutrients and I donâ€™t even know if thereâ€™s any treatments out there that can fix that. Iâ€™m not exaggerating; I eat like a damn 7 year old. Itâ€™s insane and humiliating. Iâ€™m also overweight and too lazy to change it. I only have one parent atm and I canâ€™t stand being around her, and now sheâ€™s making me live with her annoying boyfriend. I have no friends except for one â€œsort ofâ€ friend, but we see each other only about once every two months and we donâ€™t really have much in common. Thereâ€™s not a day that goes by where I donâ€™t fantasize about my death. I constantly wish when Iâ€™m at school for a teacher to just notice what Iâ€™m going through, but of course they never do. Itâ€™s not their job anyways. Iâ€™m very tired of it all. I just want to take the easy way out. I donâ€™t know what happens after death, but nothing can be any worse than this mess.
