Trying therapy, but it's making me feel worseThe therapist I've been trying to schedule with keeps saying things like 'but I need to trust that you won't do anything in between the times we meet.'

Does that just mean I'm hopeless? Everyone always tells me to get help and get therapy when I even hint at being suicidal,  the moment I do it just feels like a guilt trip. I can't promise I won't have an intense episode and just end it. She said that she deals with high risk, but it just feels like I'm lying to her when I say that I promise. I planned on ending it a year ago on April 29th, and I wanted to try again this year. I don't know if I should tell her that.

Maybe it's just me being dramatic, as usual. I just wanted some help, but this is just making me feel guilty. Sorry about the word vomit. I have no one to turn to.
