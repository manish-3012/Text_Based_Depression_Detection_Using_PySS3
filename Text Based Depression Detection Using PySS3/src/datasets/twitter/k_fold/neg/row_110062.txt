Struggling with judgmental mean peopleI am dealing with a ridiculous amount of issues at the moment, and honestly doing the best I can do. I make every day " not zero ". (some of you know what I mean by that). Yet out of the blue my sister in law comes at me in attack mode, calling me worthless and other crap. I only met the girl like three or four times briefly so I do not know how she can even form an opinion? I shouldn't let it get to me but I cannot seem to help it. I now feel like I have been knifed in the back by someone I never had a problem with before. And all the work I do to make anything better just feels so worthless and pointless. She said my house is always filthy... Eh she lives far away and has never ever been to my house? My house is not perfect but I am not a hoarder or leave garbage around etc, I clean at least an hr. day, usually more. She says I sponge off my husband and whine to get everything for free from him. We do not live any kind of glamorous lifestyle, I do not have any jewelry or go on trips or even own any item worth more than 600. So how is this equate to me being a sponge? I often even do without my medicines. I need new glasses and dentist very very badly, but we cannot afford it so I do not even ask. We never go out to eat or to movie etc. we do not waste any money he earns. We pay all our own bills, carry no credit debt and do not take welfare. Yet she accused me of getting welfare... Which is not true. People told me we would qualify, but we do not want it. I work too but I do not earn much or work long hours, I have fibromyalgia and other health problems. But I do volunteer work and teach too. In my community I believe I have earned respect and people like me. I cannot understand why she said all this and why did I take it all so hard? This happened six days ago and I have been crying off and on since. I want to be a better person and usually if I heard anything like what she said it would just make me work even harder, but right now I am sick and in pain and it's really hard to get work done, so I have no way to kind vent my feelings. My Mom is dying of cancer too and my husband is cheating on me and I am just trying to ignore it, I am pure survival mode. Being in survival mode is exhausting though and I have so little fight left. Not sure what would be more of a relief, to keep fighting or to quit. Please someone just talk to me and give me a shred of hope?
