Never felt so lowThis is long, or maybe short. Basically I want to die. I have a plan, I'm through. I'm married, late 20's, 3 kids. My husband and I were planning to buy a house, but as we were supposed to be going to the bank this morning he said he doesn't want to buy a house with someone he doesn't think he can spend the rest of his life with. 

We've been married almost 10 years, have had rough patches like all couples. The difficult part comes from me. I have clinical depression, anxiety, and PTSD from a very traumatic childhood. My husband thinks I have no faith in him and am too pessimistic. He also says I don't pull my weight around the house and am a dependapotamus. I'm a stay at home mom, I have a degree in a tech field but no experience so I can't find work. I keep the house as clean as possible but between 3 kids and depression sometimes the motivation isn't there. 

All I want is for him to be happy, but when he asks what I've done to make him happy I don't have an answer. All I am is a burden to him and I think he and the kids would be better off without me. I don't have anything to give them. I just drag them down and hold them back. I've been studying for various certifications and learning python (already know c#) so I can broaden my knowledge base and have something to show prospective employers I know what I'm doing, but it's not enough because progress is too slow for my husband. 

I'm scared to leave my kids, but I don't want to cause them pain.
