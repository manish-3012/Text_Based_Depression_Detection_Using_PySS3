Being sad is very comfortableIâ€™ve suffered depression and anxiety for a lot of years. Iâ€™ve had periods of my life when Iâ€™ve felt better but I always come back at it.
A few weeks ago I was experiencing one of the best periods of my life and something bad happened that got me into one of my worst periods of depression that I can remember. While trying to overcome what happened, I realised that being sad is very comfortable. Once you reach rock bottom, thereâ€™s nothing that can affect you anymore, so I tried to get to that bottom and Iâ€™ve stayed there since then. Iâ€™ve convinced myself of the worst situations and I have accepted that they will eventually happen and they will break me to pieces. I have accepted that I am terribly sad and I feel like I want to stay that way so I donâ€™t get that hurt when all happens, I donâ€™t want to heal because healing means being happy and being happy means thereâ€™s a big possibility I get hurt again.
I really donâ€™t want to feel pain anymore so Iâ€™d rather just be sad.
