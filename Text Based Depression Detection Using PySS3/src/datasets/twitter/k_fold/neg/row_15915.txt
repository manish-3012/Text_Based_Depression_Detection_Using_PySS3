Just a couple questions, any help is appreciatedOkay so I'm not like about to do it tonight or anything, so don't worry about me like dying right away. I'm not quite sure to put this onto a medical forum or mechanic forum, but this is probably the only one that wouldn't be weirded out so I'll shoot.

My current suicide fantasy is driving out to a secluded place into the woods with a silicone tube and killing myself via carbon monoxide. I like this method as it leaves the body untouched, ergo not as traumatic for whoever trucks my body away, along with minimizing pain for family members. I also like it, as while it seems to have a high likelihood of being successful (unlike a method like sleeping pills), it seems to have relatively small consequences if something goes wrong, unlike hanging or gunshot suicides. The largest problem arises with catalytic converters removing almost all the carbon monoxide, but I have a plan to circumvent that. I plan on unbolting the exhaust system right before the catalytic converter and inhaling those gases instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my main two questions are A: would breathing in exhaust directly from the engine of a modern car be similar to tailpipe exhaust pre-1973, and B: what are the health risks of a failed suicide attempt via carbon monoxide poisoning, are there any life-changing permanent disabilities?

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and I guess if we're throwing in questions what does it mean for like my mental state if I think about this on a fairly regular basis, like maybe 10 times a day or so. I use this typically as a method of escapism, like I get an overwhelming feeling of being a failure or social reject, I'll think about this until I get distracted with something else.

Any input is greatly appreciated, thanks a bunch!
