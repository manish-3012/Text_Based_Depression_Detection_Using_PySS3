Nothing mattersIsn't it strange how back in the day people would fight for their lives because otherwise they'd die easily. Don't get me wrong people still nowadays fight for their lives. Back then it was mostly physical stuff. Nowadays we struggle with mental shit. Are we all mentally ill for thinking this thoroughly about wanting to die?

I don't even know why I am typing this right now. It won't matter, it won't do anything. I know I am not alone in these thoughts; everyday people commit suicide. Every few minutes people post on this sub.
And I don't even want help. If someone doesn't even want help...just let them be.
