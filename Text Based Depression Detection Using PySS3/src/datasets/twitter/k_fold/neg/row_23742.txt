ranting how much i want to diei just turned 16 last month and i feel more lost than i should be in life. Since 2019 started, i havenâ€™t been able to sleep properly because my brain and my nightmares wonâ€™t leave me alone. My mental health is so fucked up i am in constant pain and always finding new ways to harm myself. No one knows how to help me because i lost all faith in living when i was 14 and still nine suicide attempts doesnâ€™t feel enough, i pray for the tenth attempt to be the one that kills me already. I started being addicted to cigarettes because itâ€™s the only way i can harm myself physically without people realising, itâ€™s not the same as cutting your arm or burning yourself. 
living is already hard but living just because you donâ€™t want to hurt others is worse because i canâ€™t  even stand myself. I shouldnâ€™t be here, i shouldnâ€™t be alive in this moment, i should be taking a bunch of pills right now. Iâ€™m gonna start therapy with a psychiatrist in october again, so iâ€™m already planning my suicide. 

I hope that by the end of the year iâ€™m already in my grave.
