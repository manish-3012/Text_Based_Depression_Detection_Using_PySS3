I kind of don't know what to doFor context live in the UK, I've got an aspergers diagnosis but I'm not that socially incompetent, the problems I have are more anxiety and feeling like shit all the time. I have sleep problems too, which is why I woke up at 1am today, I've kind of been sitting here for the past hour while everywhere my mind goes comes around pretty quickly to "I'm sick of this, I should kill myself". I don't think I actually would do it today, I don't have a good method and I don't want to upset anyone, but I just feel shit all the time and my life is pointless, I'm not accomplishing anything and I just don't have a reason to be here beyond not upsetting anyone else. I just hate it, my future seems really uncertain all the time, one of my parents is abusive or bipolar or something and the other lives hundreds of miles away, I don't really have any real life friends so I don't feel like I can get out, I just don't know what to do. Really now though I just want to stop thinking about fucking killing myself because it feels invasive, I just want that to end, it's just making me feel progressively worse and fucking worse tonight, like there's a chill going through my body each time my mind comes around to it

I promise I'll read any response here but I'll likely not respond, please don't take that as ingratitude, I'm grateful for all help but having a discussion here is pretty scary
