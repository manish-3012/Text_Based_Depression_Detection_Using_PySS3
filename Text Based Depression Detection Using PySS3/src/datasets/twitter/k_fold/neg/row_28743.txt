Close to really ending itQuarantine and anxiety isn't a good mix for me. My cuts are getting deeper, my mind is getting darker, and I'm feeling more empty than I've ever been. Just earlier I was searching for pills to overdose on. I was already planning to unlock my door and where I would just fall, do I want people to hear the sound of me dropping dead? Or just wait until they notice? I have a wild imagination but I can no longer see myself in the future. I overthink a lot but I can no longer see myself next week. 

I'm just really tired of life. I don't have goals, I don't have dreams, I don't have anything. I've developed many hobbies during quarantine but I've given up on all of thembas fast as I picked them up. I've given up on me.
