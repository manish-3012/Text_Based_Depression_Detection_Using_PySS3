A caring trans girl that's been beaten down one too many times.I never thought i would have come to this point. 
I pass except for my voice... I still smoke cigarettes. 
Daily, people make a conscious effort to remind me that I'm less human than them. People that walk by me take the time to look me directly in the eyes.... I've never felt so much deep seated hatred. Some even verbalize they see garbage, I'm not welcome, I should be at home and not challenge people by existing. 

I've spent 6 years of hard work, therapy, building a career, losing all of my friends when I started physically changing on hormones, but I made a few new people that could understand. It's not an identity to me... I have a genetic hormone disorder. That I hoped i could save the money to so, so I can heal and be the brightest light i can.
