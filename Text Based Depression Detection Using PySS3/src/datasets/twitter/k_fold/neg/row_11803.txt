Hung out to dry"Living", this sucks balls nowadays. I am smart, nice to everyone, yet genetically flawed in the worse possible way &amp; on top of that have a life ruiner mother..gosh just let this misery end. Shes making my life a living hell and the ironic part is i always treated her well &amp; guess where that got me? I don't want to be forced to stay in this shithole cage of raging illnesses for another yr just because she's crazy, full of god knows what diag, and cheap af. i want to live a healthy, normal life &amp; be me..have my life back again. Be free from whatever this shit is. Everyday i wish i was dead. k, thx-byeeee. Last yr I tried 3 ways, lets make the 4th count. Bring me home.
