I hate myselfIDK I just hate myself, and since I hate myself I am reluctant to be honest about it with doctors, family etc. I just fein being happy all the time.

I have a health problem that I just refuse to do anything about even if it is indicative of a serious problem, I never do anything nice for myself and basically just go to work and nothing else. I won't let anyone date me or even talk to those who are supposed to be my friends. I just post random junk on facebook just so nobody asks questions.

I have tried doctors and the like but all I have got from it is a bunch of acronyms in my medical record and some pills that make me tired all the freaking time to the point where it makes me make silly mistakes like scratching the car on a post or writing garbage at work, which makes me blame myself even more. So I stopped taking them
