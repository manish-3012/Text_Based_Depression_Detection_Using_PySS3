tired of being so aloneYou ever try try to get out more so you don't end up such a shut in, and try to out yourself out there because you think maybe, just maybe, you'd be able to find someone that likes and appreciates you? And it all ends up crashing down on you? It's been non stop with me, and frankly I don't know if I can or even want to continue living. It's so damn lonely..I'm so tired of feeling unwanted, and talking to somebody never helps. They all look me up saying the same thing, giving the same failed advice.
