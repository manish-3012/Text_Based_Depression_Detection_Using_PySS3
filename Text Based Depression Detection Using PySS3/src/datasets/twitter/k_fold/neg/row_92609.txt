Surviving.... what happens next?I'm posting here as a survivor. My most recent attempt was nearly successful, but I was brought back from the brink in hospital. I won't go into details unless requested, and even then it'll have ALL the trigger warnings. So I want people reading this to know that, as someone who very nearly succeeded, I AM glad to still be here. I AM glad that my attempt failed. I never would have had the chance to reflect on that if it wasn't for the incredibly hard working doctors and nurses. My question, to others reading this though, is... what now? My depression is still there, all of the things that made me feel hopeless have still happened, and I'm still cripplingly lonely. I've spoken to doctors, therapists, old friends, new friends, tried medication etc, and nothing seems to be helping. Whilst I no longer wish to cease living, I'm struggling to live well.. any advice would be great.
