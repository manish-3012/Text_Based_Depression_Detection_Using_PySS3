I'm so lonely. I feel like I have no one.I shouldn't feel that way though. Yes, I may have broken up with my fiance about a month ago...but it was for good reason. He began getting abusive again. I stood up for myself the first time. I had promised him when he got back together with me that if he had ever laid a hand on me again, I'd leave. He did good for nine months, and we just so happened to drink for the first time and it all went to complete shit. I should feel happy for sticking up for myself. I should feel happy for admitting that I deserve better. But what if I don't deserve better? What if he's right, that he really will be the person who loved me the most and I'm just going to be alone for the rest of my life? He was the only person who I liked that actually liked me back for once. I've always gotten rejected or used for sex and just...maybe that's all I'm good for. I'm so fucking disgusting. I'm weak. I'm just a fucking stupid, crazy, fat, ugly bitch who's never going to fucking go anywhere in life. I'm going to die alone. Everyone says oh, "you're going places. you're going to change lives. you're gonna be this. you're gonna be that. i can feel it." I know I'm not though. I just think the world hates me, and that's why my 10 + attempts haven't worked. Or maybe I'm even stupider than I think and I'm too stupid to kill myself. Who knows? I dunno, man. I just wanna stay high. I wanna talk to someone though. I don't like being alone. I miss taking care of someone. It made me feel worth it. I'm just so down. I have been attempt free since April 26th, 2016 &amp; self-harm free since January 19th, 2017...I don't wanna mess up again..fuck...
