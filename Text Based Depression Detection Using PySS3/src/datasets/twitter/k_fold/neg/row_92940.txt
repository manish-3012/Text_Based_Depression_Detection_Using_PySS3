i need help.iâ€™m going through a break up. of five years. it happened over financial disagreements. but i think itâ€™s gonna be permanent. it hurts to see her happy without me. i hate my job. i hate myself. iâ€™m so disappointed in myself. iâ€™m losing control. iâ€™m hurting myself. iâ€™m smoking &amp; drinking every single day. iâ€™m high pretty much every second of the day. iâ€™m falling apart. i donâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™m sitting in the parking lot on my lunch break just beat down. destroyed. i feel like my hearts ripping in half. this was the person i thought iâ€™d marry. this is the person i still want to marry. iâ€™ve done everything for her &amp; still would. iâ€™m so fucking dependent on this person &amp; i wish i wasnâ€™t. but i donâ€™t think iâ€™m ever gonna move past it. because i think iâ€™m gonna give up.
