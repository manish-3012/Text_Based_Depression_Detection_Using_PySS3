Slowly dying aliveRecently iâ€™ve been feeling so sad, son alone, so done with happiness... i donâ€™t now what to do or how to feel... it feels like iâ€™m dying.

I was in a love triangle, until today everything remains thÃ© same( possibly nobody will ever love me)

These days iâ€™am moving from home, on days like these i realize that i have never felt like i have a â€œreal homeâ€, and iâ€™m a very lucky girl with luxuries and stuff but i think i die more every day, i feel that nobody wants to listern to me, i feel like i donâ€™t matter at all.
Secretly i want to fucking die.
I feel that i am invisible :(
