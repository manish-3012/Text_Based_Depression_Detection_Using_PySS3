A friend is planning their suicide and I don't know what to doSo basically I have this friend and they have always struggled mentally. They have a long history of self-harm and they have initiated these sort of plans once before. Over christmas we were relaxing together and they mention that they want to commit suicide because it doesn't feel like there is anything to live for and that they plans to do it sometime after exams are finished when there was nobody around. I decided to let it go until we were both back in uni in a nicer environment, thinking that perhaps a change of scene would in turn trigger a change of heart. Turns out this isnt the case. They have even more things in order now, such as who will live in our shared house next year once they have passed. I feel powerless as I don't have a single clue about how I can abort this plan of theirs. What do I do?
