Got diagnosed with major depression and put on an antidepressant a week ago. I don't have any hope that it's going to start working or make me feel better. Advice?I just feel like I don't have any faith in the process of medication, because I've always felt this way and an increased mood would feel really alien to me. I don't think suicide is a solution to my problems, but I don't want life to continue to be gray and tasteless for the rest of my life.
