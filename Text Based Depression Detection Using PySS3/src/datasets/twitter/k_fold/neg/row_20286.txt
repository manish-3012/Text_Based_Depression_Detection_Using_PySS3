i have no idea what to title thismore so recently i have felt so shitty. i havenâ€™t genuinely smiled in so long and it hurts to say that. itâ€™s almost like as soon as i feel good and happy it just goes away in a matter of seconds. and it feels so much worse than usual. it seems like nobody in this whole world gives not a single care about me. i am so young and i hate feeling like this all the time. i cant even go out with friends because i always feel like the odd one out. i just want someone to talk to without being told to get over myself ..
