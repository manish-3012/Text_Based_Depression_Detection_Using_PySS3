Does anyone else think that it's a bit selfish when people tell you not be suicidal?I have fought depression most of my life and I always hear that it's selfish to feel like you want to kill yourself but I feel like it can be equally selfish to ask someone to continue to struggle with life. I have friends who have told me that they're always there if I'm struggling with my depression but I never feel like they're properly there. When I share my thoughts of suicide I mostly get awkward silences with them telling me not to feel like this and that things will get better but no actual solutions to my problems, they may not be able to help me but I just feel like I'm doomed to have to deal with my depressing thoughts alone as well as trudging through life alone.
