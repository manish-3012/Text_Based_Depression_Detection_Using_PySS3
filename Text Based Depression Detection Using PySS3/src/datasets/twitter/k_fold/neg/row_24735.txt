I'm standing on the edge I guess I'm just hoping that someone can change my mindI want to be a woman. I always have. I told my family tonight they told me they still loved me and that it didn't matter who I wanted to be. Despite the best response I could have hoped for I still want to end my life. I thought getting this huge secret off my chest would make me hate myself less, but it hasn't. I know that I'll really do it this time.
