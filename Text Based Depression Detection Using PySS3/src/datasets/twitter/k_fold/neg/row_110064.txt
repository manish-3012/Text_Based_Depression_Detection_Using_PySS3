I just want someone to talk to.Every night the thoughts come again. I'm going insane, literally. it's nibbling away at my mind, and it's... It's driving me crazy. I hate to admit it, but I'm weak.

I know there are many people in this subreddit who probably deserve more attention than me,  people that are suicidal over things way bigger than me, and I'm probably just making a storm over a cup of water, but... I don't know. I just want someone to chat about all the bullshit life flings at me.

I've had a really serious "argument" (she just kept saying stuff and downright ignoring me. This is probably one of the tamer arguments we have had...) my mother today, and I just feel... So lonely. I wanna curl up in my bed and just wither away... 

I guess I just feel... Meaningless. Well, in reality, I guess I *am* meaningless. I'm just a lump of flesh and blood, robotically following their day to day life. I feel like I'm just a shard of what I once was. 

Every day is just a continuous cycle of waking up, doing nothing, going to school, coming back, sleeping. This world feels so grey. My mother hates me. I hate my mother. My boyfriend... Isn't my boyfriend anymore. Everything just... Sucks.

I just want to feel like someone will care if I do end up killing myself. I know this is selfish as fuck, but... I just wanna feel somewhat important. Like I matter to someone. I've got a lotta friends on Reddit, but I just... Feel like a burden on them. On everyone, really.

I'm sorry for making you read through this. But... Thanks if you did. I appreciate it.
