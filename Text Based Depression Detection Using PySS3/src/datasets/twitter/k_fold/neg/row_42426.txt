AfterlifeI want to die. 

I hope there is an afterlife and I can reconnect with the ones Iâ€™ve lost, and get away from the people here. There is nothing holding me here. Iâ€™m not religious, but I hope there is a god who forgives me for taking my life and lets me into heaven. 

I see a lot of people here just want eternal sleep. The thought is scary for me. I want to see my loved ones who have passed, and if it is heaven like described I will always be happy there. 

Does anyone else feel this way? I only see people who want darkness forever when they die.
