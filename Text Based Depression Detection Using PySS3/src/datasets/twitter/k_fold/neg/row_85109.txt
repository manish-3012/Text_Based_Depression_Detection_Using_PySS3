Dude at this point I feel like death is the best thing that can happen to me. Sh*t i never felt this bad before.My severe depression has overtaken my soul and captured me in the infinite void. I can't even look at my face anymore, i forgot how i used to look, i don't remember myself anymore.

Everything was chill until I became 18, it was like i was walking in a forest with beautiful rainbows and flowers under a beautiful sunshine than suddenly it turned into dark and athere were nothing but hungry animals awaiting to hunt me down in a dark creepy forest.

It's so hard

It's so hard

It's so hard


Suffering

Suffering

Suffering


Lake of fire


Eternal void


Eternal torture


I'm suffering


Suffering


I want to sleep and never wake up


I just can't function properly anymore due to extreme depression.


I don't know what to do.


I want to cut my wrists


I seeked God and i got no answers.


Everything is against me



I must die


AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
