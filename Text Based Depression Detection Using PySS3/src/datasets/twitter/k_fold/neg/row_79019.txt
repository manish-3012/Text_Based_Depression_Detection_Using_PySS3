Is it worth trying to get past highschool?Does it actually get better? Iâ€™m starting 11th grade this week. Iâ€™m suicidal for the standard reasons, garden variety mental illness, lack of long term goals or aspirations, loneliness, the world sucks, etc etc. I donâ€™t want to stick around any longer if itâ€™s just gonna get worse down the line, which it seems to be doing. People like to say highschool is rough and it gets better once you graduate but does it actually? Iâ€™ve seen enough people online and irl still going through it in their 20â€™s, 30â€™s, 40â€™s, 50â€™s... It seems like it never ends. And yeah, I guess some things never change, itâ€™s just as you get older you become better equipped to deal with lifeâ€™s struggles, or whatever, but lots of people still kill themselves well into middleage, and god I donâ€™t want it to reach that point. Tell me, dear redditors, is it actually worth it? I imagine there are plenty of people here who have been suicidal for a long time, are you happy youâ€™re still here?
