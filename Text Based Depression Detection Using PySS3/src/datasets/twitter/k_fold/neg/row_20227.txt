What is worse, living empty life or not living at allFor past few years the only thing that makes me feel truly happy is knowing that one day I will die. I have no goals in my life,I've tried everything I wanted and there is no material,spiritual or sensual stuff to achieve. Life become ritual of things done mechanically with no feelings. I want to know what you people you like about this? How can you enjoy f.ex sunrise, kiss from a partner, sex, success and even falls when it all feels the same-empty, meaningless,repeated so many times it's not even cliche anymore. Biggest joke about all of this is the whole "get help" chain. What help may I ask, various pills that numbs you in various ways? Or therapy that brainwashes you slightly for a short period of time
