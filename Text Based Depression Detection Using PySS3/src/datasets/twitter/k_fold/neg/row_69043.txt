I've lost my only emotional help, had a seizure last night, and I'm completely over the brink.I have severe social anxiety and agoraphobia as well as major depression.

I made huge progress with social anxiety and the agoraphobia over the past 12 months, which has recently almost completely backslid due to COVID 19. I work in a hospital and take public transport and I've been more and more terrified of leaving the house as days go on

The only thing I've been relying on is my wireless earbuds, they gave me a new lease on life and cut down almost completely on hypervigilance and panic when I'm out in public.

Last night I realised I misplaced them at someone's house or their car, they would have fallen out of my handbag. I messaged and asked them to search (I can't go back there for two weeks maybe longer) and they couldn't find them and weren't too interested in looking harder. 

I have to be back at the hospital tomorrow morning at 8am. I can't face leaving the house and I'm just completely finished. The headphones aren't something I can replace, they're $70 and I don't have that money to spare. I have less in my bank account. I also start wailing and sobbing at the thought of even leaving the house to go to the shops. 

I can't take time off work. I'm barely holding off self harm. I have epilepsy and had a stress induced seizure, now I feel like a truck has hit me. I feel bad for my neighbours because I've been sobbing and wailing on and off for hours now. I bit through my cheek during the seizure and I'm still spitting blood.

I again messaged the person who's house my headphones are at to explain how important these are and tried calling them, they've seen my messages but not replied or returned my call. 

I'm barely holding on now. I have the means to easily take myself out and end my pain, but I don't have the means to replace the only thing that kept me going. I can't do this.
