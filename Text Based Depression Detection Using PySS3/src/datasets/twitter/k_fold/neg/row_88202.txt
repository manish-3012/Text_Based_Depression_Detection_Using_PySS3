Finally typed out my note. Gonna write it tonight when I get home.To Mom: I love you. You are not a failure of a mother. You have done so well raising Michael and I. You are the best mother anyone could ask for and I wish I couldâ€™ve been like you one day. Please do not mourn. Please do not think itâ€™s because of anything you did because it absolutely isnâ€™t. I love you so much, please get married to John. Heâ€™s a very sweet guy and treats you better than Dad ever could. 

To Michael: I wish we had a better relationship growing up. Iâ€™m glad we got closer but I often felt like I was just the annoying pest of a little sister. I didnâ€™t know what I did. I know I could be annoying but I didnâ€™t always mean to do you wrong and for that Iâ€™m sorry. I wish I couldâ€™ve been a better little sister. You were always a cool guy. 

To Trevor: Iâ€™m sorry things had to end like they did. At least you got mad and blocked me on a lot of things so that way you wouldnâ€™t care about me anymore. I guess Iâ€™m sort of glad they ended up like this. Maybe you wonâ€™t read this, but I still care about you. I hope you find your dream girl. 

To TJ: you are the love of my life. You made me so happy all the time and you made me feel loved, made me feel euphoric. Please donâ€™t do anything rash. Please donâ€™t do what I did. I hope you go through life to be successful in everything you do. Please try to stop the drug stuff. 

To my pets: I love you guys dearly. I hope you guys get treated well by my dad after Iâ€™m gone. Donâ€™t miss me too much. Maybe we will play and smile in heaven one day, all of us together. 

To all my friends: I love you guys so much. Thank you for keeping me in your lives and giving a damn about me. It meant a lot to me. 

To Dad: I wish we had a better relationship. Iâ€™m sorry I was such a shit daughter who only knew how to disappoint. I wish you made an effort too. I donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to have a father to be close with and I wish I had that. You always made me feel like shit and I wish things werenâ€™t like that. If only I could say â€œfuck youâ€ in a kind way, but I donâ€™t know how. You probably wonâ€™t notice Iâ€™m gone anyway because Iâ€™m usually out of the house all the time anyway. You just wonâ€™t see me anymore.
