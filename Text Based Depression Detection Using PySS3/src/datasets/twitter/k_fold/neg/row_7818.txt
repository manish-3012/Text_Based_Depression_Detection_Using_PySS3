What's the point? (Short vent)One of my favorite rap songs has a part in it where the rapper goes: "People telling me to be positive. How I'm supposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?". And that's always how I've felt. People want me to be positive for no fucking reason. You're alone? Be positive. You keep getting rejected? Be positive. You have no one there for you and no one really gives a fuck about you? Be positive. Your life's so bad you want to kill yourself? Be positive. But those are not things to be positive about. The only "positive" or good thing that could happen now is I literally just get a girlfriend that genuinely likes me for me. No effort anymore, no second guessing, no inferiority, no jumping through hoops, no being treated like I just invented this weird concept called "love" and am now trying to test it out on the unfortunate and unwilling. It just happens because it's supposed to. Shit like that doesn't just happen and it'll never even happen normally for me. After lots of effort, trial and error, and feelings of inferiority, so I really see no point in even living anymore. I know death is coming for me soon, but that's because I'm actually coming for it and not the other way around. Knowing I'll soon be rid of this whole world is the only bit of peace I have. I only fantasize nowadays about being dead and my consciousness being sucked from my body. I don't even dream about love anymore, just not being here anymore fucking everything up for the normal people.
