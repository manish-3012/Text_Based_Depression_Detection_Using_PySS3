I'm Falling Behind and Need Some HelpI am approaching the end of the first semester of year 2 of my Master's Degree in Chemistry at university and I can't help but start to worry about how far behind I am with assignments, lectures and general content from where I should currently be. I have been suffering with a great deal of anxiety and depression for several years and only as of a year ago I went to get some help from my doctor, I was prescribed some medication and was recently changed onto Mirtazapine... I have been on this for a couple of months now and the side effects that come with taking this medication such as increased exhaustion and tiredness and a constant feeling of hunger have subsided
