Staying alive for other people is hard when they want to die too.My entire family is suicidal. I could go into my personal reasons-- divorce, foreclosure, depression, etc.-- but they're not important. Only staying alive out of guilt for your family starts to become less of a reason when they are too. It seems like a mass suicide of 5 people would be the perfect solution at this point... just today I had to talk one of my siblings off the ledge, it sent me into another suicidal spiral. I can't see any solutions as the root of all this is unlikely to change. The list of reasons to live is becoming shorter and shorter... I often wonder if it would be best if we all just died.
