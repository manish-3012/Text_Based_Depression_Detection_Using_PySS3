Suicidal thoughts todayI'm not actively suicidal at the moment so please don't worry about me.

I'll admit earlier today I was thinking about ending it all. I'm stuck in a marriage I don't want to be in, with a husband who hasn't hugged me in years. He has intimacy issues with any kind of emotional or physical intimacy. Anything he perceives as intimacy will set him into a rage.  Living with him is hell because he cares about no one but himself and constantly rages.

I was thinking earlier today that if I have to live like this for the rest of my life, I may as well end it all.  Just not living would be better than being with him.

I am having an affair with a man - also married - who seems to like me very much.  Neither of us are leaving our spouses.  The time we spend together is amazing.  I feel like if anything happened to me, he would be sad and I don't want to do that to him.  I also have 2 kids I love.

Then I come into work tonight and everyone starts teasing me in a vulgar way about a really hideous guy I dated 14 years ago (a huge mistake). This wasn't their intention, but I ended up literally shaking and wanted to go into a corner and cry.  I feel like I'm never going to live that down. The guy would be so happy to know that people are still harassing me about him. If I can never just close the book on mistakes from my past, isn't it another reason to just end it?
