I feel miserableMy fiance who has BPD just like me took drugs three days straight and had barely contact with me because thats what you do when youre all drugged up. With one of my only friends and her ex btw. I know nothing changed between us at least im 90% sure. Even if i was 99,9% sure it craves my heart. She will be emotionaless the next 4 days probably. I told her right before i wanted to jump off a bridge but as i let go i just want somebody to catch me. She said she would want to do that. Now she pretty much leaves me 7 days alone... suicidal as fuck... does she even give a shit?
She always says she does but i cant trust anymore.
Cant even tell a doctor about my thoughts otherwise ill be locked up. What a useful strategy.
Maybe i go to the bridge now and maybe none will be there.
I know the current will suck me up and ill drown its very strong.
I dont know what to do anymore...
