Every day is a torture and there is no way that it will get betterMy hips developed the wrong way from birth and cause great pain every day, starting 6 years ago. I got surgery for one side this summer but everything is still just as bad. Still can't sleep because I can't lay down without pain. The bone they had to cut isn't healing. The doctors say it'll get better but they have been saying that for the past 6/7 years and it only got worse. I try to starve myself because I don't want to get my period (I'm female to male transgender). I'm not drinking because I hope I die. I have repressed memories of a pedophilia relationship with a 40 year old guy that lasted one year. They still terrify me and started all this shit. I'm self harming (itching until it bleeds, it looks like cuts). I have spoken to therapists but when I do that it usually leaves me even more suicidal because I don't get anything from it. I talk with them and that's it. Nothing comes from it, nothing changes. The up and down of my daily life exhaust me, one hour I'm felling all good, the next in asking myself if I really want to continue such a life. I'm trans and there is no way I can transition in a way that would satisfy me because my parents are unsupportive(I'm 16). I see no reason to keep living this life when every day is a torture i n itself and I don't have anything that I hope/work for. I dont have any dreams that I want to fulfill. I'm not passionate enough about things that doing them brings me enough happiness to outweigh the daily pain. This life simply isn't worth it  when every day comes with such great suffering.
