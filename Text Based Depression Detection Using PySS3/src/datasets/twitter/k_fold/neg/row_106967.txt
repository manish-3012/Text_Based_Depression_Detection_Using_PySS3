used to be successful, now suck ass, not feeling so greati've been depressed off and on for most of my life since i was a a kid.  sixteen or so.  maybe a few years younger.  it got bad in my twenties with my first office job and then grad school, and all the poverty.  the paycheck-to-paycheck.  i hope this doesn't make me sound spoiled, but i'd never had to cope with actual hunger.  i came from a nearly featureless middle-upper-class family and i had never lived anywhere dangerous or unheated or etc.  

shit, getting away from the point.  i was really down then, i'm trying to say.  i came close to suicide on several occasions and i thought about so often it was like my fucking sidecar.  

but i got through it.  after grad school i wrote a book, and it was a good book, and it sold, and it did well, and for the first time ever i felt like a success, like i had proven people wrong about me.  that i was ok after all.

it was fucking unreal.

but then things just kept getting worse.

i sold two more books, and they were reviewed well---i know:  how can i complain, right?  i'm a shithead, right?---but sold like crap.

and my career started fading.

i had been a young hotshot and i became a lukewarm journeyman and now i'm kind of nothing.

i've lost my talent.  i can't write more than two fucking sentences.  which means i don't get paid.  

and i've been losing more and more money every year.

even worse:  i'm basically afraid to write.  something that had once been inside me, some kind of spark that was at once given to me and also a part of me, was just gone.  

my agent's gone cold on me---for good reason----and every day i sit with the computer on my lap all day and just commit one act of cowardice after another:

i look at porn.

i watch netflix.

i follow auctions on ebay on which i have no intention of bidding.

saving "favorite houses" on zillow that i have no way of buying.

i'm turning into a fucking wraith.

i think of my younger self, the one who was loved and who wrote bravely and against all hope, when he didn't even know HOW to get an agent, when he dared because he was, well, just BETTER than i am.

and all the book money is almost gone and i just can't get another job and i'm living at a friend's house like a fucking sophomore on summer break.

i checked my dad's shotgun to see if it shells in it, and it didn't.  and i'm still far enough away from actually taking any kind of action that i was able to believe in that as a sign and NOT do anything.

but it keeps feeling closer and closer.

you know that feeling when you're camping and you keep hearing noises in the woods and you can't tell if there's really an animal out there or not?

that's what suicide feels to me right now:

it might be out there, coming in for me right now, me and my tortured pillow and my snot-sweater and my misery, but maybe it isn't.

i can't tell.

i don't like to talk on the phone.  it's kind of a phobia, but if anyone's feeling like some fingerwork, i'd love to hear from you.
