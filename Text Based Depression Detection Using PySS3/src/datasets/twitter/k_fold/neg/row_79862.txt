I shouldn't be aliveI've been in two car accidents which I should of died from and then I tried comitting suicide by taking 100 Xanax and I didn't die from that either.. all i got was a ticket for public intoxication from the police while I was blacked out .at night my sadness takes over and all I can think about is the past and how I wasted my time, all my friends faded away.. no one cares . I had a severe coke/gambling problem despite my parents not being good financially . I shoulda gave all that money to my parents, they would of used it better. I couldn't stop gambling and I couldn't stop using coke because I know if I stopped my sadness would come back but it's done more damage then anything. i don't deserve to live
