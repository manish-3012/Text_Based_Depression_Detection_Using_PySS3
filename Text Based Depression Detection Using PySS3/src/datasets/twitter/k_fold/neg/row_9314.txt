Iâ€™ve solidified my suspicions on how my parents would feel if I committed suicideMy mom is more colder to me lately. Anytime we talk, itâ€™s always her criticizing or making fun of me. I mentioned me dying in passing, and she brushed it off by saying â€œeveryone dies some dayâ€. My dad might be a little concerned but I doubt it. Iâ€™m so tired of living when the people who gave birth to you hate you so much.
