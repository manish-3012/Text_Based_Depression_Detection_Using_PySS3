Suicidal ThoughtsHello, I'm 14 years old, turning 15 next year and for a couple of months now I have been thinking of suicide. I don't have any friends to talk to because they all just either ignore me or don't give 2 fucks.. My parents also both separated about a year ago which also caused me to really not get along with both of them since I don't see my dad that much anymore. Only thing that really helps me is playing video games on my computer, but I am going to high school soon and knowing that I can't play video games all my life is really going to be tough. I don't go outside as often well because I always get bullied because of how I look and my weight. What is next for me in my life? Should I end it to never feel this again? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. 
Thank you for taking the time to read this.
