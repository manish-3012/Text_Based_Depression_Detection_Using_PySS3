First/LastFirst, and last post, so apologies for community standard violations

Iâ€™m trans (mtf) and have bipolar 1 with lifelong ideation. My straight gf and I have had an ever -broadening rift as I get further into my transition. Shit is awful. Every step forward that I think I make destroys something else. Itâ€™s this constant cycle and Iâ€™m so tired of it. My lifeâ€™s canvas is black. 

Itâ€™s something like 40% of trans people and 50% of BP1 have an attempt. I did. ODâ€™d on molly. Was almost enough. Since then Iâ€™ve kept 10x the lethal amount of cyanide around, but by all accounts this is supremely a nasty way to go. 

This time Iâ€™ll either OD better or asphyxiate. As a chemist and a welder, I have access to all of these things. I have plenty of BTC to order anything I need. 

I fucking hate this.
