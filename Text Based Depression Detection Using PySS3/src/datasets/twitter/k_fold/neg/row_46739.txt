Itâ€™s unfairWhy do I have to be told everyday that Iâ€™m retarded, worthless, ugly? And then I think that too. Itâ€™s unfair that I get targeted. I donâ€™t want to be here if that really is what I am. I donâ€™t want to be feel unwanted constantly by others. 

I get that itâ€™s high school but honestly I donâ€™t want to end up as a fucking mess in the future. I donâ€™t want to be socially inept and lonely. Iâ€™m angry and I despise the people who continue to do this SHIT. Iâ€™ve had to go through this crap since middle school and I donâ€™t want to now. I thought it would be better since I moved. 

Another thing in this crappy rant, Iâ€™m tired of feeling weak and being belittled. The main friend group Iâ€™m different from because weâ€™re different genders and so forth and that is a big deal apparently. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like I am an outcast because my friends are also considered â€œweirdâ€. 

If I tell the counselors and I did about people being assholes, suddenly the person acts fake nice and I have to feel bad because of that. I hate this I donâ€™t want to be here and I will die if this is what my life is going to be like after high school. 

Iâ€™m sorry.
