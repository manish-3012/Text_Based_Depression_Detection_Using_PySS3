I have a perfect lifeI should have everything I could ever need. Someone else mentioned that they want to switch places with rich people. That's me.
My family is wealthy, even for 1st world standards, I  can get anything I want physically wise. I'm pretty popular in school, make a lot of friends, go to a lot of parties, etc. I'm also pretty smart and combined with the wealth thing I can get into a good college and get a good job etc etc. (High school senior now).
I also have no shortage of emotional attention, a loving family and lots of good friends who genuinely care for me. I'm active with a very fun and enjoyable xc and track teams. 
Essentially I have a perfect life as of yet, the quintessential high school stereotype. But I still feel so so lonely, and that no one can understand me yada yada the classic teenage hormone stuff. Sometimes I feel completely worthless and that I let down everyone around me.
On my good days I know this is completely false and on my bad days I know objectively how stupid I'm being. Still doesn't stop the feelings from existing and I don't know how to fix it.
I'm not actively going to go out and do anything to myself--- theres no way I have the strength of will to do that. In any case I would probably feel too guilty anyway.
I know this is coming off rambling, but I'm completely at a loss for what to do.
