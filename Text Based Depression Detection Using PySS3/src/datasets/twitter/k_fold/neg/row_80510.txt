Please, I need to talkI have panic disorder, severe social anxiety, and agoraphobia. The one person who I ever got remotely close to has stopped communicating with me. Every time I try talking to someone, I'm so worked up that I spill all my bullshit and they end up running away, I don't blame them. I'm sitting here crying and no one would think of hugging me, not like there's anyone around. I feel like a speck of dust floating in the wind, no one notices no matter how much I scream. 

*I won't kill myself*, but god damn if I wouldn't rather be dead. 

I really just want someone to listen, will anyone DM me?
