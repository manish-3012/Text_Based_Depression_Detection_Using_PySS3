My mental health is leaving me drained and suicidal. I need advice? I feel so alone.My mental health has been hanging by a thread lately. I'm just tired of feeling dysfunctional and paralyzed. I have a hard time carrying out my thoughts properly, and I'm so frustrated with the constant screeching in my head. I've learned to silence the self-deprecating/destructive voices for the most part, but boy does it leave me exhausted. I haven't left my bed apart for when I've had to work, and even then, that's been such a struggle. Because of this, I've become a total flake. I don't hangout with my friends anymore (and even if I did, I hardly know who I would hangout with because my best friend moved away this summer, and my girlfriend and I do long distance during the school year while she's in uni - disclaimer, I see her once a month for 3-4 day periods), I don't keep in touch with my siblings who are quite literally my only family apart from my parents, and I haven't been going to school since last month because it got so overwhelming that I began having self-annihilative thoughts which scared me so much. What drives me insane is that beneath this foggy mind-mess, I'm sincerely happy. I have no toxic relationships, and I'm constantly in a safe space which I'm endlessly grateful for. The people in my life bring me so much joy, but my head never stops. I'm tired of being sick. I'm tired of this barely functioning mind. I'm so fucking tired. This isn't me. I just want to recover. I don't want to haunt myself anymore. I just want to be okay. To help, here are my diagnoses: ADD Anxiety Depression (unofficial, but I think I may suffer with BPD as well)
