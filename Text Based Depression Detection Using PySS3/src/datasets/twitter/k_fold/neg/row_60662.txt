No one cares and neither do IWhy do I have to keep living if I wish I was dead everyday? When I hear a sound at night in my flat I wish it was a murderer trying to fucking kill me. I'm always alone and literally no one I knows understands. I'm just a shitty person to them. Not a good friend because I just can't be bothered with anything. I hate myself because of it. Everyone says they want to help but they dont. My stepmother can fuck off for the awful things she said to me and about me while she was trying to help, yeah right. 

How can normal people do this? I'm supposed to start University at Monday. I'm so fucking scared to go because I hate myself so much and everyone else will hate me too. My therapist says I should try to imagine a "companion" in form of whatever I want to help me through it. But thats not gonna work? I already know? Why do I have to imagine to have someone to help me and not have someone real?! Its so fucked up, I'm so fucked up. Crying while typing this and not even seeing the point anymore. I don't know if anyone cares, I don't. Just kinda wanna swallow some pills and have it over with.
