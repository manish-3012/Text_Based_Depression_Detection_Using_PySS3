Crushing anxiety penetrating all facets of my life, thinking about killing myself frequentlyI have spent a lot of time thinking about how nice it would be if I just ended it.

I have terrible GAD that is being treated medically as well as therapeutically.
My grades are in the shitter and I'm only 4 weeks into the semester.
I panic before I go to work.
I panic throughout the day.
I panic about my looks.
I panic about my pet.
I panic about my health.
I panic about food.
I panic about money.
I panic. All day, every day. A whirr of horrible thoughts streams through my head on a near-constant basis.

My partner tells me how I get on his nerves and I need to suck it up and I irritate him and stuff but he just doesn't understand. He also just graced me with "you really think normal people would put up with this?"

He just checks out into the computer and is lost on me.

I am just waiting for the day I finally have the balls to drive my car off the road and get rid of all this weight.

I hate this life.
