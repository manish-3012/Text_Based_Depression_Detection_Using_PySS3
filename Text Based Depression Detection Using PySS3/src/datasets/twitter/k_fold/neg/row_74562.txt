I have no reason to stayI have no friends. I can't get good grades no matter how fucking hard I try so nobody in my family respects me. No one in the world would even give a shit if I disappeared so why I am even still fucking here. The girl I love hates me. Not a single soul really cares for me anymore, so what's the point. I guess I choose to stick around because this life is the only thing I have now, and I'm scared to lose one more thing. It's like my self destructive tendencies are driving me towards life  because I know, as my existence has demonstrated, that awful things happen one after another, and never stop. I'm just so fucking tired the second everything seems fine something bad happens. The fuck is the point.
