I donâ€™t wanna do this anymoreI hate living so much, I feel like such a failure. I am gay and it affects me. My family is religious and I always feel judged. I told my aunt and she compared being gay to overeating etc. So, now I am simply starving myself because I donâ€™t have the will to take care of myself anymore. I am only alive for my girlfriend. She would be sad without me, and I donâ€™t wanna hurt her. I just wanna die.
