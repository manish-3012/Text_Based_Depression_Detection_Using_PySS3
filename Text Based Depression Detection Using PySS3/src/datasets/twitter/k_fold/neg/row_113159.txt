I really want to do it today but....I live with an abusive mother and I really can't take it sometimes it's one of those times. I know it will get better someday but I don't feel like living the pain gets too much. I really don't think anyone cares about me except this one friend I made on Internet they live in an abusive situation too. They are probably more depressed than me they have tried commiting once, they also self harm and I don't want to leave them alone. They're really nice and precious to me and I want to meet them once but somedays it's just very hard. I don't talk about my problems to them coz they can't be online much nowadays and I don't want to burden them coz they have enough problems worse than mine. Why is life like this...
