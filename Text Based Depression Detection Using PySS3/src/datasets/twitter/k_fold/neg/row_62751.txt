I am feeling extremely hopeless about everything.My mental health is deteriorating everyday. Regular schooling where i live fucking sucks ass and it makes way worse. Everyday i just spend hours trying to come up with a reason to live. i cant think of any, everything feels blurry. My mom tries her best to give me the best life she can, but it just never works out. I spend hours out about in the night riding my bike on those empty streets or at 3 in the morning. I hate where i live, its sooo cluttered and filled with hopeless people. I cant help but notice all the strking contrasts that others cant. i just dont know anymore. i cant fucjing gain weight for shit, i tried everything, i look like a fucking stick figure, i hate my body. i have a fucking bmi of 15. i am sick of my body, i am short and just feel extremely out of touch with my body, i feel soo insecure about things. i wish i were an adult and i wish i grew up in a normal fucking household. all those crappy memories i had from my childhood still haunt me to this day. my head fucking hurts rn. i hate this fucked up world. maybe i should just kms. idk.
