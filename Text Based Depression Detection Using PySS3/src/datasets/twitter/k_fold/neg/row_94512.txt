It's probably over...I honestly have no clue how to start this. You guys are probably the only think I can consider as "family or friends", so I am writing this post on r/SuicideWatch. Since I've already posted on this subreddit a few times, maybe a few people might read this. I ment so much to me when people started texting me, after I posted this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/djlzlu/used\_and\_fooled\_my\_entire\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/djlzlu/used_and_fooled_my_entire_life/)

I promised myself to fight atleast until the end of the week, maybe something changes for the better - and if, I will try to stay here until January. 

If things do not get better, no matter how hard I try, I will leave my goodbye-letter, within the next weeks, here.

Thank you for reading this, God bless you!
