completely given uphi, i made a new reddit account just to post onto this subreddit. im 14 and suicidal, my mother left me for drugs when i was around 4 and my father recently went to rehab for his alcoholism- i have nothing to live for anymore. ive reached out for help lots of times but everytime ive been told just to 'man up', i dont really know what to do anymore at all. ive self-harmed, and ive been into marijuana and drinking for the last year or so. i dont care for myself anymore and im constantly self destructive, ive attempted 2 times but each time i was sent to the hospital and that was it basically, im going to a support group but the shitty advice like "dont give up", "go for a walk", "meditate"- it really isnt working, on here as a last resort for any advice or support at all
