Is today my last birthday?Well 50 mins ago it was my birthday. Iâ€™m 24 and not sure how Iâ€™ve made it this far. This last year of my life has been the hardest Iâ€™ve endured and Iâ€™m afraid I have no strength left to keep going. they say life is like a book and the years are chapters, but I read ahead and saw nothing but more pain, regret, and sadness. Not everyone gets a happy ending, and it appears that includes me.
