I can't believe I'm actually posting in hereMy mind finally gave and I lost it. I cannot tell up from down anymore. I feel like the worst human being that ever roamed this planet always contaminating everything I touch. 
I just want to close my eyes and seize to exist. My mother killed herself 9 years ago and I know what suicide does to everyone around you. I don't want to do that to my friends and family but I'm in so much pain. I can't take it anymore. I wish I could just die.
I'm writing this as I'm waiting in psych ward by myself feeling lonely af. 
I can't stand this pain anymore I need it to stop.
