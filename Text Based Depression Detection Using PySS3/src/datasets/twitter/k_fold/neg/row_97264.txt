I had something, and lost it.Freshman year of college I had a group I friends I would always hang out with and talk to. Now most of them are either in another part of the country, or just have life that don't intersect with me anymore. I try to join new groups, but I'm always just on the outside looking in, getting ignored for the most part. I had the one group I could fit into and now I won't.


I see some people I know getting in relationships, having sex, and I obviously I will probably never do either no matter how much I want to. 


It's just that I know everyone looks back at college with fondness, but I feel my life peaked my freshman year. I hate life now, and I only see it getting worse. I'm 20 now, but before I know it, I'll be a 21 year old with no friends, virgin, never held a girls hand, nothing fun to look back at in college. Then the same at 25 then 30, or whenever I finally die. I don't like school and I'm starting to not like work, so that doesn't help. It just seems like where everyone else has lives with friends and stories and experiences, I'm just sitting here wasting away. And every time I try to make new friends it just amounts to nothing.


I don't see the point of going on if I know there's only shit and loneliness and failure compared to others for the rest of my life. I also, the older I get, feel humiliated by having never had sex or been in a relationship. I've been using Ok Cupid but that hasn't lead to anything, just reminds me of how no one would ever want me. 


I know this was rambling but I hope someone understands. Seems like it would be best for me to just get run over by a train and avoid more of this shit.
