WHY CANT I DO ITI want to kill myself. I just want it to end. But I canâ€™t. I can hold a knife to my neck but I canâ€™t manage to stab myself, I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m a coward. I wish I could. I wish. Why am I like this. Why canâ€™t I do it? I have nothing to lose. The pain doesnâ€™t even scare me anymore. If anything the pain is nice, it makes me feel something. Feeling empty is exhausting. I want it to end. I donâ€™t like living anymore and thereâ€™s nothing to live for.
