I miss having other suicidal friends...Not that I want anyone to feel like this, but I miss having people who didn't freak out every time I said I wanted to throw myself off a cliff. 
I miss having people to talk to who know what it's like to want it. And who didn't pity me or treat me like I'm fragile. Because sometimes I just want to be able to I say "hey, I wanna fucking die" to someone who understands.
