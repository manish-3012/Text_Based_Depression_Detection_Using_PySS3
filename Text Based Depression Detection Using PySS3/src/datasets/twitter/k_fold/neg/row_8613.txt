I just came to the realization that everything which gave me enjoyment were just distractions to forget my shitty lifeMy counselor asked me to list things which made me happy and i had nothing to say. When i went through the events in my life i realized i was just pretending to enjoy everyday life. Gaming, reading novels, programming and eating food were all just distractions that i had myself convinced were things worth living for. I don't actually feel any joy or a sense of satisfaction from anything. The activities which i mentioned just lessen the pain temporarily. What should i do? Should i just keep pretending or just off myself?
