I made my bed and now I have to sleep in it. I just want to go home.I've been anxious and depressed for over a decade.  I can't afford a PCP or shrink.  I'm on a sliding fee scale with a counselor I see once every two weeks if I'm lucky.  Anyway, Wednesday, I didn't call or show up to my job working with individuals with neurological deficits.  Half the clients are downright impossible to work with, most of my co-workers were the same way, and the 'training' I received was laughable at best.   Instead, I went to the free clinic, because my fiancee and her mother thought I might have pneumonia.  Just bronchitis.  Work calls, I ignore it.  Spend 80 bucks on the various prescriptions, haven't had the job long enough for insurance, can't WAIT to see that bill.  Thursday, I'm looking for jobs as a dishwasher or something where I dont have to deal with people.  Fiancee comes home, I told her I'd called out sick.  Work called her looking for me.  She kicked me out of the apartment.  I don't want to impose on my friends and family, so I go back to the hospital, this time to the ER.  It's that or the cliffs in town.  When I had insurance, my last visit for Suicidal Ideation ran 300$.  Can't wait for this bill either.   Now I'm sleeping on my parents couch.  There's not enough codeine left to kill me.  An old buddy came into town, just called to hang out with me and my fiancee.  I had to tell him what happened.  I just want to go home.  I just want all this to stop.
