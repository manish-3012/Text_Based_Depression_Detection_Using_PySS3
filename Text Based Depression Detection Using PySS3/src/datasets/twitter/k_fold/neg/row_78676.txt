I canâ€™t deal with this.(I know Iâ€™ve already posted here before.) 

Iâ€™m only 14. I just started High School. Why am I feeling this bad? 

Iâ€™ve gone through so much trauma and Iâ€™m too scared to be happy because bad things come immediately afterward. I got my trust broken. I lost all my friends. I went through two break ups. Losing my trust in people took my sense of safety away. Just because I over shared to the wrong person. Now I canâ€™t open up to ANYONE anymore. 

I requested to get admitted to an Out-patient pyschward, but my parents wouldnâ€™t let me. I want to get help before I actually end up killing my self. 
Iâ€™m screaming into the void all the time. No one listens. My requests and vents go one in ear and out the other. No one cares about me. Everyone leaves me. 
Iâ€™m so paranoid all the time. I feel like everyone is out to get me, and I canâ€™t trust anyone. I only trust myself, and the imaginary friends that comfort me during hard times. But I know theyâ€™re not real, yet theyâ€™re the only beings that I know that actually love and care about me. 

Iâ€™ve gotten severely bullied, Iâ€™ve been doxxed online by my ex best friend, and all the friends I ever had never stayed around. No one would care if I died.  

I think people only talk to me or care for me out of pity. I donâ€™t deserve anything nice, simply because Iâ€™m a terrible person. I used to be an awful school and online bully, but itâ€™s been a long time since then. Iâ€™m always lovesick, and attention/affection starved, but Iâ€™m too scared to trust people or I think I donâ€™t deserve love despite craving it so badly. 

Iâ€™m just so unhappy. I hate my life, myself, and everyone around me. Iâ€™m tired of my anxiety making me live in fear even if nothing bad is happening. Iâ€™m anxious about my failing grades and overdue assignments. But Iâ€™m just too depressed to do anything. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. If I wasnâ€™t living for other people I would of died a long time ago. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like this.
