So tired. I feel nothing.So im 17 right now. I got accepted into college but i won't make it unless I pass my classes for credit. I am currently failing multiple classes and deadlines on tuesday. I was depressed for 5 years and in my sopomore year quit school and started online homeschool because I couldn't deal with public school. I just feel like killing myself everyday and honestly can't deal with it. I told myself it will get better every new year but honestly I know that it just wont magically get better. I have to put in effort and at this point im too burned out to put in effort. I havent felt emotion in a long time and just feel like im already dead inside. just wanted to talk to someone before the end of the year.
