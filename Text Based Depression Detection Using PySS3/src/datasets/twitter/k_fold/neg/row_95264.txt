I think itâ€™s too lateI am 38. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized over 12 times. Once for 8 months. Medication doesnâ€™t work so I have ECT every month. It keeps me going but Iâ€™m going down again and I canâ€™t handle another stay in the hospital. Itâ€™s too late to to do the things I wanted to do in my life. Iâ€™ve been hanging on for so long so as not to hurt my family. But Iâ€™m tired. I wonâ€™t go back to the hospital. I donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s not fair. I donâ€™t want to be a person who suffers from delusions, I donâ€™t want mania, and I canâ€™t shoulder another deep depression.
