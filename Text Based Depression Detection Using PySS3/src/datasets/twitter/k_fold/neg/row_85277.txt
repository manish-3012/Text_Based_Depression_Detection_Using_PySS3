Everything is too much to handleWhere to start. Im a 13 year old male with a great family and great friends. But I have a few problems which include agoraphobia, depression, suicidality, OCD, general anxiety, and panic disorder. I am in therapy and have tried medication which didnt help. I have already 1 halfass suicide attempt in the past which resulted in me deciding strangulation was no good. I can no longer go to school due to the agoraphobia and I have isolated myself from all of my friends. The last time I tried to go to school, I had a panic attack while getting ready and just gave up. I really dont know what to do anymore. The agoraphobia is all due to my mind telling me I smell bad. Which I know is ridiculous but I still believe it. This post has been structured so poorly so sorry about that, I just wanted to have something to talk to that isnt family or my therapist who has never struggled with mental issues and therefore has no idea how to help me. Im thinking about using pills this time because it seems the most peaceful and the option with no mess. I take trazodone for my lack of sleep so I could easily take the whole bottle while drunk from my dads alcohol. The only issue is my parents would probably be pretty fucked up. Well im trailing so I think that ends the post.
