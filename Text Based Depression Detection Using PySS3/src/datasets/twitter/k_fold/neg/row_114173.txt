I can't live with myself because of what I've doneI cheated on my husband at the end of December. I haven't told him and I don't want him to find out. It was such a mistake. A stupid drunk mistake. I didn't even want to do it - I kept telling the guy "no I don't want to have sex with you" but he kept pressuring me and pressuring me and I felt I had to. I think about it everyday. It's eating me alive. I don't want my husband to find out. I'm just so scared I am going to lose him if he does. I don't know what I would do if he found out. I regret it so bad. I just want to disappear. I am a bad person and I hate myself for doing this to him. I'm sorry I'm just rambling right now. I just feel like I'm in a very dark place right now and I'm scared
