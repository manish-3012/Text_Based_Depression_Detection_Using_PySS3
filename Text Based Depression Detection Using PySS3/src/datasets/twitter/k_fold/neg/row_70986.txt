My birthday is in 2 days and It's making me really suicidalThe worlds just real heavy, at first I was upset about not having anyone to spend it with but now that I do all I can think about is canceling or ghosting them and just laying in bed all day when it comes around. Like how am I supposed to pretend to be happy and act normal? How am I supposed to keep living another year and again and again if I feel so dead?
