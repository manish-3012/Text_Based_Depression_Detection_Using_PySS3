Things that draw and repulse me to suicideThings that draw me to suicide:

1. Stories about baby-faced kids middle school kids who killed themselves. If they can do it then so can I.

2. Kurt Cobain. I can see why he did what he did.

3. My legal woes. Have no interest in jail.

4. Hillary Clinton's infamous quote "what difference does it make?" I ask myself that when I try to imagine a life where I can reconcile the bad and the good.

5. I no longer really believe in God or an afterlife. We all end up dead in the ground and sleep forever. No worry about Hell.

6. If people really knew how sick I am, they would probably want me to die because they wouldn't want me around.


What repulses me away from suicide:

1. I like the feeling of being high on opiates.

2. Like, I will actually have to kill myself.

3. Doubts that things are as doom and gloom as they really are.

4. It's what people want to hear.
