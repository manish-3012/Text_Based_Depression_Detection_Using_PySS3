I don't know why, but I felt compelled to share an anecdote today...Perhaps this doesn't belong here, but I'll probably delete this post when the alcohol and benzodiazepines wear off...before I pick up the bottle to face the struggle of another 24 hours. However, I thought I would share a moment in my life of what I suppose true relief feels like.

A number of months ago, I was working with a long-time friend of mine. I owned a small business, and had hired him on to work with me. While on the road, I was very down that day, and was talking about how I felt. He convinced me that we take the day off and visit a large city not far from where we live...one of the largest in America.

We were walking down the street in this massive city with hundreds of thousands of people and I still felt completely alone, much as I always do. Then, there was a single young woman that was on a morning run that passed by us. I met her eyes and she with mine, and in those short couple of seconds, we had one of the deepest conversations I have ever had...but no words were ever spoken. I've gotten so proficient at putting a mask on; I've become a master of showing others what they expect to see instead of what is real. In that moment though, I let her see my unguarded self. The decades of internal pain and torment. The tears and the hurt that I had buried for so long. And for some reason...I felt understood...like for those few seconds it was all okay. I never talked about it, and I'm sure she doesn't remember that young man that day, but it still gives me peace to be able to think back to that moment. I know I'll never have another like it, and I'd like to think that with my last conscious breath, I'm able to see those kind, understanding eyes looking back at me in my mind's eye.

For those of you that are able to, perhaps you can do for others what that young woman did for me that day. Sometimes it is the simple moments like these that mean the most to the most troubled of us.
