Relevant.Got in an argument with someone over the protesting and political climate that has taken hold over the US and they told me to kill myself because Iâ€™m white. *Heat of the moment; empty words, blah blah blah.* But still. With everything going on, and my already present suicidal thoughts swirling around in my head (unknown to her), I canâ€™t stop thinking that sheâ€™s right. Let me do my part to fix the problem by physically taking myself out of the equation. At least that would solve my own problems; donâ€™t know how much good it would do to help out minorities. 

God, what a vile, chaotic, divided Hell-scape we live in that Iâ€™m even dwelling on her words towards me. Can none of us have a true conversation with each other and then work towards a solution? Fuck it, Iâ€™m going to bed.
