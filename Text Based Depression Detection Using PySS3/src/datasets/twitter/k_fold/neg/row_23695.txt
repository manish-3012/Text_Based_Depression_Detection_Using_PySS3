You have forgotten meThe world has abandoned the closeted gay man. The one who is hurting, the one who has no family, no friends who can really empathize. You all watched our marriages become legalized, you invited yourself to Pride parades and watched Modern Family because of your "progressivism." You have not saved a space for me or people like me in your hearts. You have believed the lie that everything is remedied. You refuse to look at my scars or, if you do, you do so nonchalantly. I want to die because I must not belong here in this timeline where the rest of you are happy and where my problems, my iniquities, and my shortcomings were created by my own hand. Look at who is still denied a seat at the dinner table. And then look again.
