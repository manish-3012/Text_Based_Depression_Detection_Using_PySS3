I canâ€™t take it anymore!Iâ€™m 22, turning 23 in two weeks. I have no money, no career, no degree, and nothing to offer the world. I graduated high school in 2014 then took a year off because I didnâ€™t know what I wanted to do and I was stupid. Started at an online community college in 2015 and got distracted when I was traveling and breaking my back to go through immigration with the girl I married who didnâ€™t love me in the end. In 2017 I transferred to an online university, where Iâ€™ve been for two years and still havenâ€™t graduated. Iâ€™m physically unattractive, everyone Iâ€™ve ever dated has broken up with me and the girl I married divorced me. Iâ€™m a lesbian, which puts me at odds with my family and overall attracts more attention to me which I hate. Iâ€™m living with my uncle and all of his kids because my stepdad saw what a loser I was and kicked me out. I tried to kill myself in February of 2018 but I failed, and not a day goes by that I donâ€™t wish I had succeeded or want to try again. Iâ€™m always uncomfortable everywhere and Iâ€™m always a stop never the destination. I wasnâ€™t made for this world and I canâ€™t imagine spending decades more here.
