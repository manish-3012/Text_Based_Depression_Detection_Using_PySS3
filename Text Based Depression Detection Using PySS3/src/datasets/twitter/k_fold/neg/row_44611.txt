Guaranteed isolationI've never been a people person. Cringey, awkward, forced humor with guys, and nothing but that forced "niceness" with women that I only fall back on for lack of anything interesting to say or do. 

I'm in community college at the age of 24, meaning I'll start college next year proper 7 years older than anyone else there. Studying computer science doesn't offer a lot of social opportunities, not that I would be able to take advantage of them. 

I feel like I missed out on the chance to have friends, and now I just have a long, boring adult life. I've inflicted myself with an isolated life and it just doesn't seem worth living. Being lonely and young sucks, and being lonely and old seems like the path to madness. 

I just don't see the point in slugging through life as a person no one wants to be around or trust with responsibility. The easy way out seems like what other people would prefer and I really feel like taking their suggestion.
