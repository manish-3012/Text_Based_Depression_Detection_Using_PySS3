Please Help MeI can't go on like this anymore. I've been waiting since the eighth grade for it to get better. Now it's twelfth grade and it's only gotten worse. I just want to die. I don't want to be around anymore. There's nothing about me worth keeping around. I'm not beautiful, I'm not smart, I'm not talented, I'm not skinny enough, and there's much more cons to me than there is pros. I suck at everything I try and I'm awful at keeping friends. 

I hate myself so much. I want to stop existing.
