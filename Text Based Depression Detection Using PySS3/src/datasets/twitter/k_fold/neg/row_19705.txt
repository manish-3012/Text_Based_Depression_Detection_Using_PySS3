I'm tired of this endless cycle.I just can't deal with the back and forth of recovery. Especially when it has to do with things that are out of my control. I was in an outpatient program and they were such a mess that they didn't schedule me with a therapist until the day I was discharged, so it's been over a month that I've been having to wait to see a therapist and the total lack of follow up care has been hitting me so hard. I'm tired of therapist shopping and thought this place was going to help me find a therapist who would pick right up where we left off, but a friend I made in the program says the place they sent her two has just been doing intake questions for three sessions now. I don't know how I can feel so drained and at the same time feel like I'm getting ready to explode. I can't deal with the medicaldebt anymore. I can't deal with the student loan debt. I can't deal with not being able to work because I feel so tired and weak all the time.  I can't deal with not having a car. I feel like I can't breathe anymore. I'm tired of having to just think the happy thoughts when I know that there's no solution to the problems. I'm tired of debt being the only guarantee in my future. I just can't do this anymore.
