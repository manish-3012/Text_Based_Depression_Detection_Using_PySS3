Everyone hates meEveryone Iâ€™ve met hates me, everyone Iâ€™m going to meet will hate me. Follows the same goddamn pattern every time. Everyone gets mad because they give me condescending advice on how to get better with their perfect goddamn lives, lording it over me. Everyoneâ€™s lording it over me.

â€œGo see a therapistâ€ I already have a therapist

â€œTry this or thatâ€ I have

â€œGo exerciseâ€ I do

I HAVE TRIED EVERY GODDAMN THING PEOPLE TELL ME TO DO AND IT DOES NOT GODDAMN FUCKING WORK!! WHY SHOULD I NOT BE ANGRY WHEN WHAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE ELSE WONT WORK FOR ME?? ITS NOT FUCKING FAIR!! I JUST WANT TO FUCKING DIE AND IM TOO FUCKING COWARD

I mean this is why everyone hates me, why everyone who tries to help me ultimately goes away because Iâ€™m just so angry and hateful that they canâ€™t stand it anymore. And I donâ€™t know how to engage with people without hating myself, I just donâ€™t. I donâ€™t know how not to hate myself. When youâ€™ve been hurt as often as me this is what you get. I donâ€™t want to be broken. I want to be beautiful like everyone else is, I want to be loved like everyone else is. Iâ€™m not asking for a lot from god Iâ€™m just asking for the bare fucking minimum. Iâ€™m asking for just enough to be classified as a human being. Thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m not asking for a million dollars. Iâ€™m just asking for the aching void that is myself to go away. But Iâ€™ve been cursed because everyone hates me and I donâ€™t know how to make anybody love me because Iâ€™m so fucking lonely. Youâ€™d get this angry too if you were as lonely as me. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m owed it or I deserve it, Iâ€™m just really fucking lonely! When Iâ€™m alone, Iâ€™m lonely, when Iâ€™m with other people, Iâ€™m lonely.

Nothing makes it go away. Itâ€™s just eating away at me inside and it hurts so goddamn much and people get mad at me for being in pain

Iâ€™d do anything to make it stop.
