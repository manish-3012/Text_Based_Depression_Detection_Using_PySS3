It's my brother's ducking cake day party.And I'm in my room, being depressed af and googling about the exit bag.

I know, I'm still far away from actually committing suicide, but I still want to get this off my chest.

I've been depressed since I was 12 years old (I'm currently 16), but I'm not constantly sad. I experience depression more in like.. phases. Sometimes I'm really happy and cheerful and then (after a few days/weeks/months) I'm suddenly too sad to function normally because of no particular reason.

It is really hard for me because I never know when the next phase is going start and there are no reasons why they start. 

In school, I'm known to be the happy lovey-dovey kid that always laughs and smiles, that's why I'm too scared to actually talk with someone about how I feel. Some of my friends do know that I used to be depressed, but I'm too much of a chicken to tell them that I still am and that it is getting worse again.

I should be happy, I don't have any problems in my life. I don't have the right to feel this way and get help from others. I don't even have the guts to properly talk about it with my boyfriend (he is probably going to read this post tho, but I hope he doesn't) Speaking of my boyfriend, I think he loves me because I'm always so happy (at least in in his eyes) and I can't bring myself to ruin the way he sees me. If I told him what I actually feel, he would probably be sad and maybe even disappointed. Still, I wish I could just tell him everything that is going on in my head, it would help me a lot. 

I'm even too afraid to ask my parents if I can take more therapy sessions, because I just can't admit that I'm still depressed. 

At this point I'm just asking myself why I'm still alive, even though I hate myself this much. 

Sorry for wasting your time with this long text, I just needed to let it all out in one way or another.
