Tired of being uselessI'm tired of living like a fucking loser, trying desperately to get a job and coming up empty handed. I had a part time job with very few hours, but now I don't even have that because I was forced to move out. Now I'm living with my mom again like a stereotypical loser, hurt hurt hurt I'm nearly 30 and living with mommy, how pathetic. I'm sick of trying to find a job, and its making me think more violent and irrationally. I can't deal with it. I'm also getting sick of my mom thinking that I should get a girlfriend because THAT will give me a reason to live. I'm fucking ugly and completely fucked in the head(according to my ex), so I don't even want to bother with that anymore. I punch myself in the nose trying to make myself more unattractive because I'm sick of people not believing me when I say women don't want me. Then again, I punch and cut myself because I just hate who I am overall. I'm a miserable fucking failure with nothing to show for 28 years of life. Big deal, I learned some programming languages that were fucking useless to me in the end because I couldn't get a job in this shit any way. I wasted my time learning to play guitar like an idiot, not like that ever earned me a dime, its not even anything I can put on my resume. 

Fuck everything, I want to slit my fucking throat and just be done with life.
