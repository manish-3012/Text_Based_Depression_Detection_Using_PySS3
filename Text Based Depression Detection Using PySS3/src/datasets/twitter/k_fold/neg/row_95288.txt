The only thing keeping me from killing myself in the next week is access to alcohol.If you look at my post history, you can see how my constant, unavoidable fuckups in life have led to this situation. Plus, I feel I've worn out my welcome (God, I've heard that phrase so much in my life) in r/ADHD, I have little left to say, and aside from that, I don't think I'm getting anything new from there at this point.

If things went my way, I'd be able to get insurance, then get treatment in as little time as possible. Then again, there are people in similar situations to mine that are far worse off than even I am, so if there was ever a thing such as Karmic Triage, I'd be pretty far back in line, the 1st world privileged whitey that I am.

You know all those "lifehacks"? I wish that they could work, but because of my broken retard brain, they never stick. I'll do the useful things every other day, but the harder I try, the harder the stress + anxiety that blocks me. It's like a telekinetic monster is grabbing my chest, my guts, and the front of my skull whenever I do try my hardest and receive stress as the result.

C2H6O, Ethanol, it's the only thing keeping me alive right now. 

There are at least 6 things I could do in the next few hours that'd almost certainly be enough to finally finish me off, and there's no way anyone could stop me.

However, as long as I have access to alcohol, I have access to inner peace.

If a suicide hotline could refer me to a doctor, maybe I'd consider making a call. If anyone could refer me to a psychiatrist, therapist, and/or a sleep doctor within the next week, I'd gladly take the crippling debt that my insurance-less ass would receive from the visit.

But until then, I drink, because it works.

I ruin everything I touch
