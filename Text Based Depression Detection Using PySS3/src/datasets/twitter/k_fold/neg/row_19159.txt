TRUTH IS PAIN!!!I BELIEVE... I NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU... I BELIEVE... I NEVER MEANT TO BETRAY YOU! 

- KoRn

The raw emotion at the end of that song. Describes my thoughts. My mind just goes crazy sometimes. 

Forgive me my fellow redditors. Just needed to let that out. 

Edit: Song is â€œHolding all these liesâ€ if you were interested in listening to it. 

The part I love starts around the 3 min mark.
