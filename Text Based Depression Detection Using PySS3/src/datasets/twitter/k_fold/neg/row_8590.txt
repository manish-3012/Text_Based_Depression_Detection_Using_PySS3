TiredIâ€™m tired of feeling this way. Feeling like a complete burden to everyone around me. Iâ€™m tired of trying to find someone who thinks Iâ€™m worth it. It doesnâ€™t exist. It shouldnâ€™t exist. I didnâ€™t ask to be here, so why should I keep living when there is no point? We all just exist and then one day we die. Thatâ€™s the only guarantee anyone has in life. Too many people are afraid of death, but to me, I could not see something more comforting. To not have the pressures of living, the stress of trying to make your way, not having to work meaningless jobs to make money that has absolutely no value except what we put on it. When you break everything down, there is absolutely nothing to this life except naivety and fear. Stopping it gives me the power. Iâ€™m tired of saying everything and nobody listening. Nobody cares.
