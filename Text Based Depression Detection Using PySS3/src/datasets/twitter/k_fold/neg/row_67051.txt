I don't know what to do. I just realized that I was maybe abused as a child, but I feel like I've also been an abuser

**Memories of Sexual Interactions in childhood:**

I have a memory of one interaction with a girl of 5 years of age, when I was also 5 years old or so. I don't remember much of the incident, before/after, or who started it between us... or where the adults were. I don't know why, but I just remember being naked with her, and stuff. I don't remember what all we did, how we knew to do anything, or anything else. 


There are also three other instances that I can remember between the ages of 5 - 10 with other children my age. Those other ones, I can remember that I believe that I instigated those ones, and they were not intense at all. Nothing really happened, at all. Like, as far as I can remember, the worst one was slapping a girl's butt when she had her pants down (she pulled them down herself, not me in this instance). 


I don't know why, but I remember feeling very sad from the ages of like... well time period of 1st grade to 7th grade. I remember it built up to it's worst around 6th grade, when I got so sad that I would cry myself to sleep and want to kill myself. I don't remember why or having a reason for it, and I have no idea about it. Until recently, I had brushed it off or actually forgotten about it, and never talked to anyone about it. 

**Guilty over sexuality:**

I remember feeling guilty about having so many sexual fantasies about people I knew I shouldn't. Like my Mother, Aunt, Teachers, or people outside of my age group. Usually older women, but I guess that I felt guilty about all sexual feelings until I was 16. Mainly, I wanted these feelings to stop or to not feel attracted to all the adults who I thought of as good people, but I couldn't help it. 


I also remember that when I discovered erotica and porn, within around a month or so I couldn't really enjoy the "normal stuff" in that area. At first it was just like... erotica or "doujins" (aka Japanese comics with nudity and sexual themes. Often involving two men, although I didn't really know why? I thought I was a straight guy, but I liked thinking of myself as the girl sexually or like being a woman, but I hated everything masculine, masculinity in general, and myself as a man. I thought everyone did, and hated all male traits I had, and didn't really find men attractive..?). But then, it all went to like BDSM (Mainly, I thought of myself from the sadistic pov until age 18 or 19, then I went super masochistic and got depressed outside of sexual themes as well, but I feel unable to stop being either S or M. I have to be one or the other...?), abusive stuff, or just odd fetishes. I felt really bad about it all, but it was like I couldn't enjoy normal things at all. Also, when I was into like doujins or guy x guy stuff, I also... like put stuff in my butt even though I didn't have a concept for "anal" or sex at all, I just kinda looked at the screen and saw a guy sleeping with a guy, or a guy with a girl, and I thought I wanted to be the girl and I don't know? It just like came to me or I did it and yeah I have no idea. I ended up eventually forgetting about it and just being into women for many years, like until I was 19 or 20. I hated everything masculine like I said, but then later on years later I've dropped that... like weird hatred for men, and I can see why people like being guys now, and I don't hate myself for being male that much anymore, but it's not fully right yet. I used to idealize women or think they were perfect, for a long time as well. 


I also have always been afraid of true love or thought it wasn't for me. I have no hope of ever being able to be in a genuine, regular loving relationship. I feel that is impossible for me. I want it often or... I mean I really really really like cheesy romantic films and books, but I feel like I don't deserve it. I feel worthless or unattractive or awful. I feel like the only way anyone will ever love me is if I let them hurt me or if they want to abuse me.

**Memories of Sexual Interactions in childhood v2 &amp; Abusive Fantasies/Problems:**

Outside of that... I also remember being aroused around my cousin (age.... 4 - 7?) when I was younger (age 8-10?). I don't know why and I felt really guilty and bad, but one time my Aunt put her on my lap and I got like really turned on and a hard on and I felt so embarrassed and bad, and I don't think anyone saw, but I still feel bad. I don't know if that counts as abusing her, I didn't touch her or do anything else, I just don't know. Years later when I was maybe 14 - 18 and she was 7 - 10, I still had another moment of feeling attracted to her or something. I hated it the whole time, but it was... I don't know, I didn't understand or see any reason for me to feel attracted to her. I don't physically even LIKE children, how can anyone find them attractive? I don't. But yet, I still got aroused in situations around her, even though I don't find her body attractive or the idea of abusing a child attractive (it makes me feel sick or like vomiting, actually). 


In addition, I have another cousin who I had a similar thing with, where I felt like random moments of very very very very inappropriate sexual attraction or desire to do things, with no explanation. I don't like children physically, I'm not lying about this. I legitimately would not "get off" on seeing any child nude, I would feel sick to my stomach. However, this feeling still happens in these situations. I've even come close to like... bad things, as in like I was in the car with my cousin (4 - 8) while I was (15-18), and I had to resist not touching her arm or leg too long whenever I had to for whatever normal reason. I didn't find her attractive, want to hurt her, or have any reason for it. Yet, I still had trouble not doing more, and I feel so sick thinking about it and I hate it all. 


Outside of children, I also pretended to be a woman online various times, to hurt men. I wasn't sexually attracted to men at all at the time still, but I guess... I was jealous of women or femininity, and I really hated myself and hated male-ness. I guess I was sad when I would ask men to hurt themselves for me (claiming to be a dominant woman), and I would almost feel as much pain as they would, I didn't enjoy hurting them, but yet I did it multiple times. I felt like I was "confirming my beliefs" that "women have it easier in the world, being male is inferior/worse to being female, and that males are disgusting". This all stopped around age 18. 


&amp;nbsp; 

**Depression and Masochistic Fantasies, Suicidal urges:**

I stopped hurting people completely for like... a long time. I was crushingly depressed (and am) for the first time that I admitted it to myself, and told others or tried to seek help for the first time. So for the last 2-3 years (18 - 20) I have been really, really depressed. I feel I deserve hurt or abused, I feel worthless, and I hate myself. I have sort of totally swapped on those negative or abusive thoughts I held towards others from ages 12-18, and now have them towards myself. I would rather be abused than to abuse anyone else, and I truly feel I deserve it. I feel like from ages 6-12 I was the same way I am now, hence being sad and crying and feeling depressed. What changed that? At age 10 - 12 I had a major disease and surgery, and I think around that time something changed or I turned cold, and became more abusive or hurtful towards others, and blocked out all my emotions/pain inside.

**Other details:**

There are a lot of details missing here. Like, my Mom and Dad always argued, yelled, often screamed in each others faces, went around the house slamming things, threw things, and other stuff. I wasn't beaten as a child that I remember, but I was sometimes put in "timeout" for around an hour or a long long time. I remember feeling so alone in my room or feeling like I was never going to be ungrounded. I would sit in my room and feel at first impatient to get out, then slowly I would try to calm myself and say to wait, that I would wait until they came in to get me and it would be over. But I would wait and wait, and as time went on I actually lost the anger or impatience to get out of timeout, but rather I became like... sad or kind of numb or hopeless to get out? That sounds really dramatic, I don't know why I worded it that way. I eventually would get up and go out to ask to get out, or to talk about it, because I really felt like it was never going to end. But my parents would always say that "timeout was JUST about to end, that it was like 29 minutes in, and they were planning to let me out after 30, so I had to go back for another 15). I just remember that happening a lot, like.... a ton of times. I remember them promising to talk to me, to discuss/debate about whatever fight happened that caused me to be put into timeout, and stuff like that... after I would get out of timeout. But inevitably, everytime I got out of timeout they would either say we weren't going to talk about it at all and forbade me from talking about it (or I would be put back into timeout), or they would tell me to be quiet and only say their opinion or side of the story, and I was unable to say what I felt or thought happened. 


I also remember always being afraid of the dark and especially footsteps at night. I sat awake in my room a lot of times as a child that I can remember, always looking down the hallway or feeling like a person was going to come into my room and get me. I had this one instance where I was awake and conscious looking down the hall, and this big black dog appeared and ran at me, and jumped. I was really afraid and threw my hands up, but the dog vanished or seemed to disappear right as it jumped at me. I didn't know if it was a ghost or a dream or something, but it always bothered me. I still have this paranoia or fear of intruders in my room, although it isn't all the time or every night. It's only maybe a few times a week or month, but I get so paranoid and I can't stop checking corners that I have already checked, and I feel very unsafe or that I am in mortal danger. It only happens from like 12 AM - 5AM when everyone is asleep, usually. It happened sometimes even when I did temporarily move out to other places, but was much less frequent. It happens a lot more frequently in my bedroom that I have had since I was a child. 

In school and outside with other children, I remember being bullied or made fun of all the time by almost everyone. There were times where I remember lashing out, or being a bully as well though. Like, especially from ages 6 - 10 I had a lot of issues in school. I remember being mean to a few people or lying or stealing, which is so weird. As I got older, I am probably the most open &amp; honest person I know. That isn't a humble brag, I legitimately cannot lie now even if I want to, or like... I talk too much or tell people everything. I am unable to keep a secret or lie or deceive anyone, and I HATE lying. I consider it to be like the worst thing in the world, so thinking of how I am then is so strange. Plus, although I still struggle with the random, weird, desires to abuse other people, I mainly never want to see anyone else hurt and I try very hard to not judge others. I try to look at things from everyone's point of view, and I forgive everyone even if they hurt me. I remember apologizing just two years ago to a friend who told me to kill myself and was being emotionally abusive, but she still ended up blocking me after I was trying to apologize to her (she started to tell me to kill myself and that kind of thing because I told her I think I might be LGBTQ, and she said she had liked me...? But I was really blind previously and hadn't noticed she liked me, and I never hurt her). So it's like in the past I was a bad child at times, but somewhere it all changed and I became like... I guess more open &amp; honest &amp; caring about others than most of my peers. Like in University, I've been told a lot that I think too much, and sometimes that I care too much about other people (both in the "what they think about you" way, and the "some people are assholes, you shouldn't trust everyone as much as you do" way). I can't seem to not trust or love other people, even if they are repeatedly assholes or do bad things, it's like I feel that deep down they aren't bad people no matter what they do?


I also know my parents did a lot of drugs (well, mainly my dad, my mom did too, but not as much). Not just Marijuana, but like painkillers or LSD or MDMA or Downers. My Dad is really into Downers, and he always had a lot of friends over to do stuff with, watch car shows, play games, and hangout. They all stopped coming over when I was around 6-10 though, I don't know what really happened or why my Dad stopped hanging out with his friends. 



My Dad was physically and emotionally abused by his Dad growing up (as well as witnessing his sister being raped by her babysitter, but he didn't know what it was at the time or was too young to help/understand), and my Mom was sexually abused by her Uncle growing up, also for reference.

**Conclusion:**

Okay, that was a huge wall of information. The point is that I get so depressed or down and feel I am worthless, deserve abuse, and hate myself. I do self harm, and I do drugs, and I seek out others to hurt me. I don't know how to stop or how to work on it, I've started to see a therapist ~3 weeks ago, but so far it's like.... she has to learn so much about me before she can fully help, and I don't know if she will be able to help. I'm afraid to tell her of my abusive times towards others, because I feel so guilty of them. I have told her about most of the other stuff, but I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't be an adult and be independent, find a loving relationship, or succeed in life. I feel like I will always be someone who hurts others or fails and an embarrassment, and I don't know what to do.
