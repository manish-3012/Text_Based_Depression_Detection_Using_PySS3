My life is spiraling out of control and all I can think about everyday is how much I want to die.I don't want to hurt anybody but I've been hurt so many times. I'm tired and I've been fighting this battle for years. I need relief. The Prozac doesn't help and I just spend $120 with a psychiatrist who spoke to me for literally 10 minutes before dismissing me and not changing the medicine or dosage. 

My ex boyfriend who i loved more than anything left me. He broke up with me back in the summer but our relationship barely changed. I'm tired of feeling like he's only sticking around because I was institutionalized and very obviously suicidal. I just told him to leave me alone from now on. I love him too much and he is the only one I have but he's a reminder of the worst heartbreak of my life.

I'm a good student but I've dropped all but one of my classes because it's too much. I'm watching these flowers on my dresser die and I feel like it's a metaphor for my life. I don't know when it's going to happen but I'm already dead on the inside. If i had a sure way to do it, like a gun, i'd have been gone by now. Overdosing no tylenol and dying a week later from liver failure doesn't sound fun. I just want to end it. I might jump.
