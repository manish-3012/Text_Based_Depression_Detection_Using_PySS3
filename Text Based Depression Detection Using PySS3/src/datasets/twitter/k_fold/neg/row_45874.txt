I'm thinking of ending it todayIt's been a while since I had depression, severe depression, for years and years, I always managed to lift myself up again, with the help of my friend and all, because I had a goal in life, to leave the country and live in the city of my dreams following my studies and all, it was enough for me to keep going despite all the problems I'm going through every single day, my family doesn't love me, the only person who cares about me is my friend and I'm strongly believing that even her.. she's not that caring anymore, a couple days ago, all of my dreams have been shattered, I lived up for those dreams, thought about them every single day and they were my only motive to keep going, because I felt like things will eventually get better, but everything is gone, I'm broke, I can't follow anything like that, not after a long time of waiting anyways, and I don't have the patience to live in such a shitty environment like this, an environment full of hate... I lost all motivation to do anything, I feel empty, very empty, I'm lost in life and I don't know what to do anymore, I just sleep, I'm not attending school anymore, I'm not eating, I'm not contacting my friend, she knows what I'm going through yet she never bothers to ask how I'm doing, I just feel... meaningless, I'm thinking of ending it all tonight, I really don't want to live another day feeling this way, it hurts too much
