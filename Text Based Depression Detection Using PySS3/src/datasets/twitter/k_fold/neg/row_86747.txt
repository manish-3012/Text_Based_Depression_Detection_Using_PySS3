I'm going to be homeless tomorrow.This is my last night that I get to sleep with blankets and a roof. 

I'm not going to make it out there. Tomorrow I'm going to die no matter what. It's for the best. I'm just using up air, really.

Sorry, I just need to tell someone. And there isn't anyone to tell. And I'm not using s throwaway account because I'm passed caring.
