Hi everyone..I just want the suffering to stop, too many people have just ignored me. Still cant get over family deaths. I've had a shit run. I have been born into an ignorant family, I have epilepsy and some of the reasons why I don't socialise is because all my "friends" decide to make me have an epileptic fit, I've never done anything about it because I know my parents won't believe me, I am constantly bullied for it even now when I hoped more people will be civilised. My ex decided to ask me out but it was just a test to see if I'm desperate or not, so I'm bullied for that now. I don't want therapy or anything like that because I don't want anyone to know what goes on. I try and make myself look as the "funny one" but everyone just beats me down to the place I belong. My "friends" physically abuse me, I have a massive 5in bruise on my leg when they kicked me, I have been thrown against a wall and stood on just of their amusement. So that' it.
