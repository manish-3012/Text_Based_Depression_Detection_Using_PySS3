really bad depression 15MThis past week has just been the worst week in my life. Getting in fights with my sisters, being angry each second, wanting to cry at every moment, so much crying in private, stress from school, and I have just had the strong urge to commit suicide sometime soon, like this next week or so. Also my parents are going through a divorce and they involve me in it. They both always talk to me about it trying to see my opinion on something or they want to train me on answering a question in court with their preferred answer. Iâ€™m 15M and i shouldnâ€™t be hearing all this fucking bullshit all the time at my age. I got counseling for about a month until I decided to quit it because I didnâ€™t get any benefit from it and it was a little expensive. Nobody in my family knows about my depression and I never want to tell them because I know they will look at me badly. (My mom has said shit about depressed people in front of my face. She says stuff along the lines of â€œDepressed people just need to cheer up and enjoy lifeâ€ well clearly sheâ€™s never suffered from depression). Well anyways, I think Iâ€™m going to make Hydrogen Sulfide using Hydrochloric acid (toilet bowl cleaner) and Calcium Polysulfide (pesticides). I havenâ€™t been happy in a while and I think Iâ€™m finally ready for a big change. (Have been feeling suicidal for 5 years) If I donâ€™t post anytime soon, bye.
