To give value to life, but not my ownMy existence is just. I sleep, eat, attend college, work weekends, wash, rinse, repeat. Even in my rare bursts of random actions, I find no pleasure. Sure, I can laugh and cry at times, I'm not stone cold. I just don't know how to make things better.  

I sometimes cry randomly, then have trouble crying when the time comes for it. I am starting to visually hallucinate and have bouts of delirium or confusion. The colors are nice but I get tired of seeing them all of the time. Like extra fuzzy TV static that fill the walls. 

I like to help people, to make them happy. If I can't do that, I have no worth. I feel like like I'm constantly waiting for the next day. I just want the day to end so I can sleep.  I have stopped doing homework, I'm missing classes more, called off from work, etc... 
Panic attacks are worse, Most cruel actually. My existence feels meaningless, even if it has meaning to others. 

I feel as though my mind is made up and it's been for a while, many of my things have been thrown away or are being donated. I have started looking at funeral arragements, and writing out letters. I'm 26 and I am getting use to the idea of not existing. But, my biggest problem would be my friends and family. 
I have had dreams of my loved ones at the funeral and it hurts in a way I never want them to feel. My fiance to lose a battle he didn't even know he was in. My peers and mentors talking about what I could have been. This is the part that has kept me going. But I fear it won't hold for much longer. 

I just need someone to talk to, medication can only do so much. Please, help.
