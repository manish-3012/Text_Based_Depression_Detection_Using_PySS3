I want to dieIâ€™ve been praying to god to kill me quickly. I donâ€™t want to commit suicide. But I donâ€™t want to continue living. I understand why my dad did it. I resent him for doing it bc I know if I do it I know how much my family will suffer. So all I can do is cry and pray. Pray that someone out there will kill me. Iâ€™m afraid of the pain caused by dying but Iâ€™m not afraid of death itself. I donâ€™t wanna hang my self like he did. I donâ€™t want to shoot myself either bc I donâ€™t wanna make a big mess.  Iâ€™m tired. There are a lot of people out there saying who think Iâ€™d be better off dead. And I agree. I wish I had pills that made me sleep forever but the only medications that I have is Tylenol and aspirin and I know that most people who take that route fail or die slowly of liver damage 

I donâ€™t want my family to come into my room and see my lifeless body. But I donâ€™t want to die alone. I escape my world by watching tv or reading books. At this point Iâ€™m more dead than alive. I donâ€™t know what to do.
