I need your help! I'm unsure if I want to go through with suicide.I submitted a post the day before, saying "Hi. My name's calla, i'm 13. I'm looking for a painless and efficient way to kill myself. Don't come to my post with your let god in bullshit or "everything will get better". If you are here then you are here to help me, MY WAY. Thanks!" But I thought about it and i'm actually afraid of what will happen after my body dies. And i'm not sure if I want to end my life here. If you do believe you can help me, I will tell you my situation. Thanks.. for anyone who reads this and cares enough to respond...
