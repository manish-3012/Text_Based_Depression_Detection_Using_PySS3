I'm in constant mental pain and there's no way out.For the past few years I stopped enjoying evetthing that made me happy. Playing soccer, drawing, going out with friends: all that is over. I got injured, lost interest in drawing, and all of my friends only talk to me if their other friends aren't available.

A few days ago my best friend and family dog died. He was the only thing that would ever love me and listen to me unconditionally, and now that's taken away from me. I'm trying to grieve it normally, but my family is accusing me of "trying to act more sad than I am" when I'm actually trying my hardestto look happy. Every family decision never has my opinion put into it, I'm always yelled at and scolded when I try to speak my mind and get things off my chest (not even bad things and I don't say anything with attitude) and now my two sisters constantly remind me of my dog when I just wanna not think of it.

I think about committing suicide like every hour and I genuinely get to the point where I'm gonna do it at times. But I literally have no access to any method of killing myself without being in excruciating pain for minutes or hours. I just wanna fall asleep one night and never wake up, I can't deal with all of this fucking torture my family puts me through, and my dog dying multiplied my depression by 100.

I'm stuck where I am, I CANT FUCKING DEAL WITH THIS SHIT ANY MORE.
