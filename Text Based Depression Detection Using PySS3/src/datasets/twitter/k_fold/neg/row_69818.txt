least painful methods?Carbon monoxide is the most painless I think, but the feasibility on that isnâ€™t realistic I donâ€™t think, I figured maybe opiates or something of that sort in a high enough dosage will make me numb enough that I donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s happening. I think firearms are the most risky but also have the greatest chance of success; if I slip up even in the slightest Iâ€™ll be a vegetable but if I donâ€™t then mission accomplished - only catch is that itâ€™ll be messy but I guess it doesnâ€™t rlly matter. If anyone has any other insights or suggestions please feel free to share.
