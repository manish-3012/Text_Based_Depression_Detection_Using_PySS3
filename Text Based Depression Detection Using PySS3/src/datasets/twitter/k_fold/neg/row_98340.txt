These lyrics are hitting me hard.. My reason for living is gone and idk how much longer I can keep goingLost the most important girl a few months ago and have been so depressed and suicidal ever since. Most songs nowadays are about how great love is or how badly someone broke someone's heart. Happy love songs kill me because I know I'll never have that with her again and sad love songs are even worse because I was the one who broke her heart. Seems like the pain in these lyrics are the only ones I can relate to anymore. 

I got a feelin' that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So, let's laugh a little before I'm gone
Iâ€™ve been dreamin' of this shit for a while now
Got me high now
She don't love me, but she's singin' my songs
Oh, no
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back, and a bullet in my brain
Iâ€™m clinically insane
Walkin' home alone, I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it gettin' high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now, I'm so high, I be fuckin' with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the mornin' with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me
Runnin' away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you, no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see thingsï»¿


If it's my own life on the line then it's fine by me
'Cause my time is fadin'
I got five hoes, right by my side
They wanna die with me, but I'm tired of waitin
If it's my own life on the line then it's fine by me
'Cause my time is fadin'
I got five hoes, right by my side
They wanna die with me but I'm tired of waitin'
Let me know and I'll go tonight
On my own not a soul in sight
All alone with my ghost tonight
Let me know if it's scarin' you girl
I don't even wanna fuck right now if you really want to you could fuck me
I don't ever put my double cup down if you really want to you could drug me
I ain't ever gonna run my town imma kill everybody I'ma bounce
I don't ever gotta talk that loud everybody get quiet as a mouse

She said I'm a crybaby, I can't be up lately
Girl, you drive me crazy, AMG Mercedes
Speedin' down the highway, lookin' at the street lights
Geekin' on a Friday, I can never sleep right
Knowin' I hurt you, I don't deserve you
I shoulda curved you, I know I'm the worst, boo
But, I could be cool too, and you got them dance moves
And I got this vibe, I swear it's perfect to ride to
I wanna die too, we all wanna die too
I got this vibe, I swear she love gettin' high to
I love gettin' high too, I wanna hide you
How did I find you? I'll be inside, I'm makin' music to cry to
Oh, it's a lonely world, I know
Gon' get a lonely girl, that's fo' sho'
Oh, I'm a lonely boy, she made a lonely boy, yeah, I know
Oh, it's a lonely world, I know
Gon' get a lonely girl, that's fo' sho'
Oh, I'm a lonely boy, she made a lonely boy, yeah, I know


Nobody wants to talk to me, but everyone wants to walk with me
And I always been that kid, maybe I won't be if I live
Long enough, but I think I'ma die now
I just keep it to myself and I try not to cry too loud
I just wanna lay my head on your chest, so I'm as close as it gets to your heart
We can fall apart, start over again
Nobody knows me, nobody knows one thing about me
Everyone doubts me
But, I'ma make it all come true, and I do it for you
I know all about the pain that you go through



Let me bleed, watch me die
I got golden teeth, she got bright green eyes
She's my fantasy, she only comes at night
She don't know 'bout me, what goes on inside
I'll let you feel my pain if you would get me high
Had to make my name, I had to break my spine
Now I'm on my way, I'm just lookin' for pain
Bitches fuck me the same, it don't matter the place, okay
I just wanna die by my momma side
Tell her that I love her while my brother cry
I don't got the time for no compromise
I need it all, I'ma make it mine 


You were nothing more to me
Than when you loved me in my dreams
Still dreamin' about you
You know I'm crazy about you
You know I'm crazy about you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I remember the first time
Baby, this is the last time
You were nothing more to me
Than when you loved me in my dreams
Still dreamin' about you
You know I'm crazy about you
There is nothing more to me than you
I died that day you left my room in tears
This is the last time
Me and you are a past time
Both wish this didn't have to end like...
This is the last time
Me and you are a past time
And I know that you and I both wish this didn't have to end like this
But, it's that time
Put the kid on the map time
I just finished the last line
Can't believe it's the last night, the last fight with you

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again

[Verse 1: LiL PEEP]
And if I don't break your heart
And if you don't break my heart
I can feel the passion from the start
Girl, its your life, baby, I just wanna play a part
Real Gothbois like it in the dark, real Gothbois like it in the dark
I can feel the passion from the start
Ever since I met her I don't wanna be apart from her
And if I don't break your heart
And if you don't break my heart
I can feel the passion from the start
Girl, its your life, baby, I just wanna play a part
Real Gothbois like it in the dark, real Gothbois like it in the dark
I can feel the passion from the start
Ever since I met her I don't wanna be apart from her
So I stopped the car, I don't need nobody
Just the cracks of my heart, I've been feelin' lonely
Silver chains in my heart, I've been caught up
Just take me away I give it all up
So I left the scene, heart beatin' so loud
Why you runnin' away? I need you right now
Silver chains in my heart, like I was so down, like I was so down
Like I was so down
So I stopped the car, I don't need nobody
Just the cracks of my heart, I've been feelin' lonely
Silver chains in my heart, I've been caught up
Just take me away I give it all up
So I left the scene, heart beatin' so loud
Why you running away? I need you right now
Silver chains in my heart, like I was so down, like I was so down
Like I was so down
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'

Life gets hard sometimes I know
So I be leaning, I be smoking my dope
I see your face everywhere that I go
It's the only thing that reminds me of home
I be with my team racing whips on the roll
Rolling off a bean that I took at the show
Young limousine I'm a backseat rider
She only calls my phone when she thinks that I'm dying
Baby you're the one for me that's fosho
I just need your company so ride slow
This ain't what you want from me so cold
Girl you're the only one for me I know
You're the only one that I love
And I can't name one person I trust
If you're on one, then I'm on one too
If you're leaving, then I'll go with you
You're the only one that I love
And I can't name one person I trust
If you want one, then I'll find myself
If you're leaving, then I'll leave with you
I'll leave with you
I'll leave with you, I'll leave with you


Spent a lot of time in the background
You know I spent a lot of time in the background
Everytime that we together, I black out
Everytime that we together, she tap out
I remember, but she part of my past now
I remember all this shit from the past now
Took a pill and we passed out
I made a deal with the devil
You know I got my problems (problems)
Know you got yours too (know you got yours too)
Hold on to my revolver (revolver)
They ain't lookin' for you (they ain't lookin' for you)
Oh, girl, don't even bother (bother)
Why she act brand new? (why she act brand new?)
Take what the devil offers (offers)
I got nothin' to lose (I got nothin' to lose)

Fuck these songs got me crying and feeling so lonely like I always do now. She was the only one I truly loved and ever wanted to be with. I want to spend my life with her so badly. I hate myself for messing it all up and I honestly don't know how I'll ever feel normal again. The suicidal thoughts have been persistent for weeks and I only feel like I'm getting worse. I don't feel alive anymore. I'm not living, I don't know how much longer I can go on merely "surviving". What's the point of living if I'll never be as happy as I was with her?
