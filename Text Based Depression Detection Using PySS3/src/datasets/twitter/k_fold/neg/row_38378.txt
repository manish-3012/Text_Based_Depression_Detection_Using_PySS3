It doesn't get better.I'm sick of people trying to convince me to keep my spirits up, to keep going, to hope for anything. It doesn't. The minute I decide to try and be positive, or things start to look up, something new comes along and crushes it. I was never meant to find happiness. There's no point holding on anymore.
