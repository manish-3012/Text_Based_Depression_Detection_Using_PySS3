Mom is dying, I want to die with herBarely even have the energy to write this but don't know what else to do. I just found out my mom's cancer is back and within probably a couple years at most, she will be dead. She's not a candidate for more chemo because of her poor health.

I have nobody to talk to. I have siblings who I love but talking to them just makes me feel worse because we're all going through the same thing and they're not in a position to take on my burden as well as their own. It's just brutal. Like a nightmare I can't escape. I just want it to end. I don't want to wait to lose my mom.

I try to distract myself but no matter what I do, I can't think about anything else. Anything I'm normally interested in I just scoff at and think "who fucking cares?" Everything I read online is about how after you lose your parent you never really recover. I can't imagine going on living life being this miserable.

I can't keep going like this. Need an escape now.
