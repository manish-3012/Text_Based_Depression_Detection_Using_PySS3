Everything I know about life is a lieI have never felt so fucking numb in front of the mirror with a loaded gun all I feared the most is wanting love but chasing ghosts,I can't live like this anymore every day is agony. Some people say it will get better but if the futures so bright, the path should glow and all i see is inevitable death. Life has no meaning the only way to be happy is to lie to ourselfs until we belive that lie. Im 16 an i never had a gf or bf i feel like im unlovable fuck-up and all i do is meaningless. Im from Croatia and here is big stigma about everything i stand for and believe in. I can' be honest with anyone because then they would make fun of me and I'm rarely in the mood for a fight so i just keep it to myself but at the same time i feel like if you are not yourself then you're nothing. Does somebody have some advice?
