Not sure if I should post this here, but the feeling is there and growing.I'm 18 years old, in the middle of my high school exams and done 4 subjects already: 3 out of 4 fail. Today maths, which I thought would go well--NOT. While I was practicing old papers I stopped halfway-- because it was easy, those old papers were fucking easy. Then came the real deal. And my mind went rambo when I couldn't even answer the first question. The fuck.

I have another 2 exams coming up, but fuck this already!! It's so hopeless now and I feel so depressed, not because I'm failing high school-- but the realization that I am the cause of failing; I am the failure. I paid 200 euro's for an exam prep. I bought brand new dictionaries, references... damnit. All gone to nothing. I mean, you gotta be real stupid to go this far and not get any results.

This painful feeling that you're disappointing other people than yourself; my parents, siblings, my teachers, the whole freaking school. This nauseating feeling that you're going to be one of the minority who had failed, sitting with  younger peeps-- feeling mocked because a more experienced brain failed. And then this feeling that it's all your own fault, for not being good enough. Fuck this man. I feel even more like an idiot when I hear people say that high school is easy. 

This is why, as wrong as it may sound, I really feel like killing myself. For being a failure.. I'm just so afraid to face the humiliation after the results come out. School is like a barrier and I can't get out.
