Life is a bloody competition and I don't want to fight anymoreI'm tired of getting beaten down by cruel bastards who beat the living shit out of me. I'm tired of being forced to study hard in school. I'm tired of this pressure to succeed financially because of my overbearing and poor parents who breath down the importance of money down my neck. I'm tired of having to be likeable and presentable for fucktard guys who have given me trauma and PTSD.

I'm tired of the fact that life is a bloody, endless battle. I don't want to participate in this fucked up war where only the strong prevail and the weak succumb. It's an inevitable loss for me given my standing in life and society.

I refuse to play this sick game made by psychopaths. Fuck it all. I'm done.
