I need an angelLast time I dieted I was hospitalized for anorexia. That's what it turned into. Now my weight is on the high end of normal. I've had family members, lovers, even fucking employers comment on my body my diet or the importance of thinness. Hell, I've never eveb been in the overweight range. :'( I'm scared of not having enough energy for work or getting through the day due to calorie restricting. Whatever I guess I gotta due it. &gt;:( Heart palpitations, spaciness and amenhorrea are great I guess (sarcasm). I have a healthy non crash diet plan, but I am crying and afraid of the ED thoughts, but maybe I should just succumb to it since no one else cares about or loves me much. I come here in case I can prevent another human from the level of darkness I feel. I love you guys with all my heart though, I am sending hugs. Stay strong. You are beautiful. Hope this touches one person.
