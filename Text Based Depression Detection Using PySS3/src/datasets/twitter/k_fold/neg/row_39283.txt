I don't like endorsing it, but seems inevitable.So, I'm too drunk to give my arguments, so I will just write the conclusion here. 


I have come to the realisation that existence is pointless, death inevitable and that the whole universe will have it's atoms spread apart so far that nothing will be. Thus, life is unimportant and inconsequential. 

I also decided that my existence is pain and going on with it will only result in more pain. I don't hate living for any particular reason, I just hate 95% of it. The 5% are alcohol and food. 

I feel as if dying or living doesn't really make any difference and quite frankly, my death will be a sweet relief of my incessant pain. 

Do you, my friends, have any further comments, similar thoughts or disagreements with my thesis?
