Pseudo Survivor's GuiltI just found out an artist died of cancer and it wasn't someone I followed closely, but just. I wish it had been me. It's so unfair, why do people who want to live, who have something to give to the world, who are loved by so many get hit with cancer and stupid, useless idiots like myself who don't even so much as appreciate it get to live? I wish I could at least appreciate all the good luck and health I have, but I can't really generate genuine appreciation if I have this part of me screaming in the back of my head that I should be dead. I should be dead.
