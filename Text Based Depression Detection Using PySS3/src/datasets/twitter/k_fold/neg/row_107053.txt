What happens after you kill yourself?Hello everyone. I hope your day is going better than mine. 

I have had suicidal thoughts for a long time now. I don't know how much longer I an deal with this before I do something. I have a question. I was wondering what happens after you kill yourself? Like, what does your work do when they find out? What are things that happen?
