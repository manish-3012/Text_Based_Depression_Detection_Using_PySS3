Therapy doesn't seem to be working...I started therapy a couple months back. Went okay for a bit but I've been getting a lot worse lately. However I am trying to just talk my way out of depression, do I maybe need medicine? All I know is I'm getting better at cutting and closer to picking a day. I'm scared at times, but at other times I feel nothing at all. I'd like to stay because I don't want to hurt anyone, but why should I suffer through life so a few people won't be sad for a few months?
