I just donâ€™t want to live with myself anymore.I honestly donâ€™t know what to expect posting this but I donâ€™t have another outlet. 

I think about dying every day and itâ€™s exhausting. 

I donâ€™t necessarily want to kill myself but I canâ€™t standing living in my own head. I have nothing of value, no skills to offer. I dread and am repulsed by human contact. 

Iâ€™m just a shell a person who canâ€™t pretend anymore.
