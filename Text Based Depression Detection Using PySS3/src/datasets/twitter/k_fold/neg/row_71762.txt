I'm afraid I'll not survive 2020Everything in my life has collapsed since October 2018, I have been the joke for 2 fucking years at this point and I'm bored of the repetition of worthlessly surviving on the little pleaseure I get from the internet. I have an autistic brother who constantly abuses me and my family, however when I'm subject to the abuse there is no support for me. My mother has psychosis and uses that as an excuse for fuckin' everything even though it likely doesn't instigate wrecklessly wasting money and stealing from me just to buy shit that's killing her.

That's only a small fraction of my shit situation, I just want to stop existing at this point.
