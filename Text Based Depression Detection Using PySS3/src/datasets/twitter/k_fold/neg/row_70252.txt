I am afraidI am so afraid to lose you. We've gone through so much lately, and life's been so hard on us too, and us finally getting back feels like a dream. But it's a bit scary, I know we've just begun our restoration process and we're still getting back into it, but the wait for us to go back to how we were is really scary. I want to be more affectionate, and more open like I used to, but I'm afraid. I want everything to go back to how it was so fast, I feel so selfish. I want to know how you've really been and know what's on your mind. I'm so sorry for being so emotionally high maintenance. There are a million things I want to tell you but I'm so afraid. While you make me really happy, I feel so overwhelmed by all these thoughts that have built up and I keep having so many anxiety attacks. I don't know why I'm writing this here really anymore, I guess it's my way of letting things out, like a diary, but faster and easier. I just want you to know that I really, really love you and you make me happy, and I'm really sorry for being so selfish sometimes.
