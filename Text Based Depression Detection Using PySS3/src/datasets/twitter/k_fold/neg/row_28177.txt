What the fuck is wrong with me?I can't do anything right. I just fuck up everything i do. I can't take it, I've been so depressed for so long. I just hit my last straw and i can't take it anymore. Its all too much and this is just getting fucking ridiculous. Later tonight I'm gonna get a syringe of bleach as fucking end it. I am completly worthless. I'm just the worst fucking peice of shit in the whole fucking universe. My boyfriend broke up with me after I threatened to leave him because he had hit me. A braindead fuckup like me deserved it but it still really upset me. Also I should mention I'm a faggot, just another one of the many things I've screwed up.
