If I killed myself now, no one would know for days.That's what my life has become. I'm really alone. And the shitty part is that I'm doing everything right. I've worked so hard, despite people trying to tear me down. The problem is that no matter how hard I've worked and how far I've come, the bad just keeps coming and it's completely out of my control. Other people keep making everything worse and I can't stop them from deciding to treat me poorly. It's been too long. I'm too tired to go on. I'm not afraid of death anymore. I'm tired of holding on "just a little bit longer". That's what got me here. Nothing gets better. I feel like nothing. The dissociating is permanent now I think. There's only one thing that would make me feel like maybe I could go on. But we're probably never going to see each other again. I think they hate me. And after this, I genuinely feel like I am incapable of love. I don't feel love for anyone in my life anymore. Just emptiness. I'm so empty and tired and it's only going to get worse. I've had enough. I want to be done.
