A lonely life isnâ€™t worth livingVirgin loser in my 20s. Never had a kiss or a hug. Never had any friends or goals. I always feel alone and empty everyday. No motivation to work or do anything. Life is a depressing hell that torments me endlessly. People donâ€™t understand me and they donâ€™t know how to help me solve my problems because you canâ€™t fix this. If no one likes you then youâ€™re fucked. A life without love isnâ€™t worth it, Iâ€™m just done with life. I want to die.
