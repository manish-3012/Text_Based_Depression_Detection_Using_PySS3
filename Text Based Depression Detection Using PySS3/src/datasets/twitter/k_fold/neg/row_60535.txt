I canâ€™t stop thinking about it.I donâ€™t think I could go through with it but I just canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself. It comes up in my head every time I start to stress out from how much shit is not going to plan. Iâ€™ve fucked up soo much and I feel like Iâ€™m in a hole I canâ€™t get out of. I donâ€™t want to die but I keep thinking about the pistol in my closet and how all my stress would go away. How do i make these thoughts stop?
