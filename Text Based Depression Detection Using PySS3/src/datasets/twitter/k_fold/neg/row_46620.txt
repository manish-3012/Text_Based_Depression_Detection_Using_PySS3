general InquiryHey SW,
I am not sure if this goes beyond your experties. So far in this forum, I have seen a lot of support, but not much science. I might post this to ask science latter, but I think you guys might be more understanding.

My question is pretty much this:
"What effect do the testicles have on my mental state?"

I know that they are responsible for the production of testosterone, but do they effect other parts of my chemistry as well?

The reason for my question is that I have had surgery about a month back, and since then I have not been myself. 

I know that correlation doesn't imply causation, it could also have to do that I haven't been able to run and workout for a while.

 To all those who have seen fight-club, this is what your subreddit feels like to me.
