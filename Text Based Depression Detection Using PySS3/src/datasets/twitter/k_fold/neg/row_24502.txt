I am getting more and more tired each day...I have a building near here with a dome that someone swan dove off of its dome one time years ago. I got kinda mad after getting yelled at about something and thought "Someday, that will be me one day".

 I get the few thoughts of doing this because some people don't seem to like me a helluva lot. I know I have to change some behaviors to get the reactions to stop. But, now, I just fantasize about doing a swan dive from there. I am so tired.
