Not sure what to doMy wife and I are getting a divorce, due to my infidelity.  My reasons for my actions is I have not felt loved by my wife in several years due to the lack of intimacy.  In the past when I approached her about it she told me that is not how she was raised.  Her family is not very loving (i.e., touch/feeling).  When I explained to her she didn't used to be that way she just said I am not the guy she married and doesn't feel the same way.

We have both agreed to get a divorce 3 weeks ago after she found out I was on Tinder (Yes, I was careless). I told her tonight that I have not felt loved in years and I was looking for an outlet.  She just thinks I am addicted to sex and that is why I am looking.  I can assure you that I am not addicted and I was just trying to fulfill a missing element in my marriage since we had not been intimate in years.  I understand that it wasn't the best decision, so please don't criticize me for my mistake. My youngest daughter (age 10)  is not aware of everything that is going on and she still seems to care and love me.  However, my oldest daughter (16 years old) has seemed to take sides with my wife although she is very nice to me.  I say this because everything I have said to her she has told my wife.

My wife told me tonight that she is willing to allow me to see my daughters once a week and every other weekend once we divorce.  While I have not talked to my lawyer, I am scared to death that this will happen.  My daughters mean everything to me and I cannot bare to lose them.  If my daughters are taken from me, I really don't see any reason for living.  My family and friends keeps telling me that my wife cannot take my daughters away from me, but I have my doubts.  I admit I was not a great husband, but I believe I have been a good father.  My daughters seem to gravitate towards my wife, which places doubt in my mind that they truly care about me.  That is where I begin to think that they will be better off without me.  Logic tells me to let my lawyer handle this, but my emotions keep telling me there is no hope.

Has anyone had a similar experience?  If so, how did you handle it and what was the outcome?  This may not be the best subreddit to post, but I thought I would try.
