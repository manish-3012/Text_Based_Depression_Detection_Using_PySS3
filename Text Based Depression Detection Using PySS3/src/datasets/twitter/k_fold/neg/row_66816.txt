Suicide hotline just hung up on me.Yup. My entire life everybody in the world has hated my guts, to the point that even the suicide hotline hangs up on me when I'm trouble. 
This is why I hate the human species. Wont even help another individual in trouble, when its your fucking job.

I need to buy some cyanide..
