A poem I wrote about my deathEndless screams
As you hear I took my last breath
Can't comprehend 
That I shook hands with death

No sleep
For nightmares plague you
Never knowing
Why I couldn't pull through

Silently crying
Under an old, creaking tree
Holding flowers
Never destined for me to see

Beneath the dirt 
In a wooden carcass, I bathe
Still living on
In the shadow cast by my grave
