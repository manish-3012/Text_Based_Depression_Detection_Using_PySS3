I am completely worthlessI have been trying like hell to find another job after being fired in June but it feels like I've been blackballed from the optical industry. All I feel like I'm good for is being a basic minimum wage cashier. Nobody wants me for anything else and something tells me nobody will want me for a cashier job either. I can't afford to keep my apartment because unemployment doesn't bring in enough money. I've already sold off all I can but it wasn't enough.

Maybe I should take the hint and just give up on everything. Life, job, hobbies, everything. This hint is made even stronger since when I ask what I can improve about my interview skills all I get is "nothing really you just weren't a good fit". So there's nothing I can do to improve then what's the point? I should just die right now and save all the disappointment and heartache.
