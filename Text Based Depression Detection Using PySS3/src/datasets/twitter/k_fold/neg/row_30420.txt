Iâ€™m only here because if I killed myself iâ€™d be killing my mother tooFor some background: my mums a single mum, she chose to have a sperm donor. I have no siblings or cousins and my grandparents are dead. my grandmother was the only person I ever loved. 

I hate my mother, sheâ€™s abusive and iâ€™m only in the house because she has control of my bank account. sheâ€™s also manipulative, and shows me affection just enough that I love her somehow. 

Iâ€™ve been at a low point for years now, it doesnâ€™t help my mother has labeled everything with â€œself-indulgent, self pitying behaviourâ€. I want to kill myself, nothing is going my way and Iâ€™d rather feel nothing than feel so terrible all the time. 

But, if I killed myself my mother would kill herself too. I am the only other person in this fucked up family, she has no friends, I know she would kill herself. I canâ€™t stand the guilt of knowing Iâ€™d be responsible for another persons death, but I hate everything so much I almost donâ€™t care anymore.
