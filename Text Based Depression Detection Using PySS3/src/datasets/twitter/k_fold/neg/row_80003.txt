Help - SuicideHi reddit. Before anything, i wanted to say that i'm aware you are not professionals. Happens that I have noone to talk too, netheir friends or family. I found a draft my father did as a suicide note. I have no idea what should I do now. He is a man "from the old days", so talking directly with him about this would be shameful for him. Same for seeking professional help (which probably is the best solution, altho shameful again). The "reason" for him to be like this is due to a mental degenerative sickness, that is been taking a lot of liberty and messing his daily life.

What should I do?
