sorryI feel awful about the way I come about suicide. I tell it all to a person who is the only person I have but I feel bad about the way I talk, I donâ€™t want to hurt him but itâ€™s nice to talk. I donâ€™t want him to think itâ€™s his fault and I donâ€™t want him to think Iâ€™m saying it for attention or anything. Talking about it for attention is the scariest thing that someone could think about about me. I mean it when I say Iâ€™m dying inside and I mean it when I say I think about nothing but death and how peaceful it could be to be done with such bullshit of a world. What I donâ€™t understand is why suicide is such an awful thing to people, everyone dies eventually so why not let someone be done with hurting everyday? It feels selfish to make someone keep living because u believe the world is somewhat good. It really isnâ€™t and nice people always get hurt and Iâ€™m too kind to be cruel. I want to get better and pickup hobbies if anyone has suggestions, I want to give everything a try before I end the hurt so at least everyone knows I didnâ€™t give up on them, because everyone gave up on me.
