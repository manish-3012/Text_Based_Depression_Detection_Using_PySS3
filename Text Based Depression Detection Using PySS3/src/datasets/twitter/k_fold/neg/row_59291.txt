Life has no meaning and with no good it's not worth livingI no longer live with my parents.  I work 25-30 hours at my job and find that between that and school I have little to no time for anything.  And yet, rent and bills eat up all my money and I'm too broke to fucking do anything. 

My dad tells me that this is just how life is.  But if this is how life is, perhaps I don't want to live this shitty life.  It's all shit and no good.  I probably have some undiagnosed mental disorder.  I can't make friends, I'm horrible at trying to get a girlfriend.  I just can't do shit like that.  I just lock up and don't know what to say. 

My hobbies all require money.  Money that I don't have because of bills and rent.  I miss living in my old house driving on my old familiar roads.  My parents won't let me move back in with them though. 

I'm finishing school up here shortly.  But when I do, what will I do then?  I fucked up and probably won't be able to find a job in my field.  I realistically see myself driving long haul truck after school.  

I hate working out.  I hate exercise in general.  It feels like I'm dying and with no gains or good feelings it's insanely hard to keep going.  I'm just punishing myself. 

Life fuckin sucks right now.  I have no girlfriend, no friends, I'm tired all the time.  Waking up early as fuck.  Working and going to school.  

There is so much shit in life and no good to make it worth while.
