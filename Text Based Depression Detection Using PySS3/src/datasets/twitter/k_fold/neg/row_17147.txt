a shell of my former selfI donâ€™t even recognize myself

My depression has been very bad for years, and one of the biggest outcomes of that is me being always angry and bitchy and easily irritated. i hate that iâ€™m like that, but iâ€™m just so easily frustrated which leads me to crying which leads to me isolating for days .

My family is all i have anymore. and today my dad asked me why iâ€™m always such a bitch to them. i havenâ€™t stopped crying since. i donâ€™t mean to be!!! itâ€™s the mental illness :( 
i used to be the most happy innocent child, i really miss being so nice and easy going , but this depression has me turned into a shell of my former self, iâ€™m even hurting my family at this point , the only people i care about. 
why am i so angry at the world? whatâ€™s the point of being here if all i do is burden my family with my grumpy unpleasantness. iâ€™m so sad tonight
