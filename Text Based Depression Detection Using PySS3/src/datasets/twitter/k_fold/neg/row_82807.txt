I'm ready to fucking die, 24 male, Orange County, CAEverything I see pisses me the fuck off. I have depression and anxiety, maybe bipolar, they don't even fucking know after 4 years. On top of this bullshit I have chronic fucking pain in my legs which prevents me from doing everything I loved doing (snowboarding, skateboarding, surfing, running, cycling, baseball, sports in general). None of the meds I've tried have helped me. I resent my friends and family, it's like because I can't be happy no one else should be. It legitimately pisses me off to see others happy when I can't be, I can't even have a conversation with my "best friend." I just fucking sit there with him and tag along. I haven't worked in over 2 years or been to school, with zero plans of doing either in the near future. I have no motivation to work, work for what? So I'm not homeless, so I'll have food, so I can have basic necessities of life.. fuck that. I was motivated by being able to go on the snowboarding trips I loved so much. I'm not a paraplegic, I don't have cancer but I don't give a fuck. At times I think maybe a beautiful girl could change my world, but that's fucking stupid, there is fucking nothing about me to like and another person won't be able to fulfill the emptiness and angry I feel by no longer doing the hobbies I once loved. It's been over 4 years since I've even kissed a girl, the loneliness is starting to become unbearable anymore. I should live so I can work? Fuck no, I've had jobs, i did work to live but I'm not fucking living anymore. I think about hurting others only so I can be killed, I don't want to hurt anyone physically, I don't care if I die and others are emotionally hurt, their lives will go on as they have been without me these past 4 years anyways. I've overdosed once, this time I want to leave the car running with garage closed so I'll suffocate, not just blackout. If people cared they'd encourage my death, because all I am doing is fucking suffering.
