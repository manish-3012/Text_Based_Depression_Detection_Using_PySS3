Sorry to bother, just having a tough timeI've struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts my whole life. It seems pretty unwarranted from the outside, but for a good portion of my life I've known it would end by suicide. I had made pretty detailed plans on how to do it by causing the least amount of pain possible (as far as who would find my body).

I began drinking blissfully for 10-20 years until a wake-up call this year, and now have been sober for 6 months. I've made huge strides in self esteem, my anxiety, so many areas since cutting alcohol. But the pink mist has faded and I'm finding it harder and harder to stave off depression.

My husband still drinks, fairly heavily. He's my best and only friend. He does not think he has a problem but refuses to stop even though I've made it clear how awfully it affects me. Its just not his time to realize he has a problem. It's beginning to feel like that time will never come. Were thinking about having kids, but the thought of post partum on top of this scares me so much that recently I can't stop the intrusive thought of "well at least you could kill yourself".

The holidays suck, covid sucks, I know it's a slump, I know I can get through it. Yet, it's beginning to feel like a certainty again. And the plans are being made again. The worse I feel, the harder it seems I'm screaming and no one is there. I'm supposed to pick myself up and dust myself off again and again and again but I'm tired. And it's sounding old and stale. Thanks for listening.

Im using a weird reddit account, I hope that doesn't affect anything. I try to be a positive force in my other account. I don't want to hurt anyone if they found out I'm struggling this badly.
