My storyOk where do I start?

I've been thinking from some time now about writing on my depression problems but never went through it because it felt like this wouldn't help.

But since like every day it's around midnight and my brain is curiously not allowing me to get some much needed sleep, i have nothing better to do until i am physically exhausted enough to be able to actually sleep.

I was about to write that i did not know why i was writing about this here, anonymously online, but then it struck me: why keep this to myself? Maybe someone will read it and give me a solution I could not have thought about before?

Ok so where do i start, again? Let's try historically.

I rembember beeing a happy child. I liked school, i had good friends, my parents loved me. It was not perfect of course, but i think i was happy. That's how I recall it anyway.

Then when I was 14 my parents got separated. It was brutal. Seeing the 2 people i loved the most destroy themselves also destroyed a part of me.

One thing about this will be stuck in my head forever: when i catched my father in a bath with an electrical shaver in his hand as he was about to commit suicide and prevented him to do so. It's been 16 years since this happened but i remember it vividly. My mother told me he was just pretending and wasn't actually going to do it, but i guess i'll never know.

After this I chose to live with my father because my sister was with my mother and i did not want my father to be alone, as i was still caring for him.

He quickly found a new girlfriend who was 20 years younger than him. He first introduced her as a "cleaning lady" but then we quickly found out that the cleaning lady was also cleaning his "private things". For all i know she could have been a hooker.

She was a mean and evil person who was ready to anything to get the best out of it. Eventually it reached a point where i could not handle living like this, so i told my father about this and he made me understand that he did not care about what i felt. He did not say it literrally, but it was pretty clear and obvious.

So I got heartbroken and went to live with my mom instead.

Then time went by and it helped healing. Also i had great friends at school which also made it easier. I even made some kind of peace with my father and his girlfriend after some time.

So again, everything was not perfect, but it wasn't too bad either.

I went to college with one of my best friend and failed after 3 years because it felt i was forced to do things i did not want to do. I mean who likes doing 4 hours of hardcore maths with a boring teacher when you don't understand how it will be useful for you in the future?

Failing at college destroyed me. My best friend succeded in it, and since that time he did not care about me like he did before, so we slowly stopped beeing in touch.

I felt like my world had collapsed. I was on a train and the train derailled. I was so ashamed of my failure that i didn't want to see anyone anymore.

So I bunkered up in my room and played online video games, which were the only things which would make me feel good, alongside with junk food.

It lasted some time until both my parents had enough and forced me to go looking for a job, so i did and became an IT hotliner for an big company.

After 2 years i understood that our bosses didn't care much about us, either we worked good or not. So i was back to be forced to work on something i did not like for people i did not like either.

One day I could not bear it anymore so i just gave my resignation, knowing i had nothing else behind.

After that i went back living with my mother and her new husband for some time, until they also got fed up with me playing video games, so i had to find another job and move out.

Then same causes, same consequences. I always felt i was beeing used at my job and no matter how hard I tried or good i was, it was like no one cared anyway. I was just there because i had to, nothing more, nothing less.

After 1 year i left like i did with my first job. I found another one which is about the same story than the 2 others.

Some time passed, and then that's when I had my first severe depression event during my vacations. I felt my life was about to be forced to do things that i did not want to do and also being completely alone. So what was the point of going on if it's only pain ahead? I spent days in the dark alone, crying on my bed and wishing to die because the pain was too great.

My mom found out about this, but talking with her didn't help. We didn't know what to do about this.

So i went to see my doctor and told him i was depressed and felt like killing myself. He gave me some pills to take. To this day i'm still wondering if it wasn't just candy as it did absolutely nothing.

So i went to see a psychiatrist which required me to work on some stuff at home for my next time. I did not have the courage to tell him i was incapable of doing anything at home. Hell, I could not even take out my garbage by myself. I felt like he did not understand me, that all of this was pointless and also costly (about 60â‚¬ for each interview), so i stopped going there.

I still kept going to work after my vacations anyway because even if I was miserable, I felt like i had to go else it would be much worse. It might have been the instinct of survival.

So there were ups and downs, but then i reached an historical down point about a year ago. The pain was excruciating. I thought that maybe i had bad luck with the first psychiatrist, so why not try another one?

So i did, but this time i found one where i actually did not have to pay for it since my health assurance covered the price of it. So I could go there anytime i wanted without thinking that there had to be results because of the costs.

I went there thinking "she'd better not tell me the same crap than the first one or i'm gonna kick her sorry ass".

And yet she did! She asked me to do stuff at home for the next time. But this time i did not agreed, got a bit nervous and told her she did not understand me if she told me that because i was not able to do it.

And from there she did understand me. I went to see her regularly. I told her about the exact same things i'm writing about here and we talked about it. And finally after about 10 weeks i had an epiphany. She made me understand that life has no point in itself so the point of it is in fact to define what you want from it and go for it.

So i took a moment to think "what do i really want in life?". But then the problem to answer this is that there are things you want that you cannot possibly get. For example, if I want to be president of the united states, since i'm not american this will most likely by impossible anyway. So i found a way around this by thinking "if you had a genie bottle, what would you wish for?".

And then I made the list. And then i translated these wishes into things that i could actually get. And then i translated it to "how do i do it?"

And then it was on. It started by wanting to loose weight to look better. So i started running and see a diet specialist. First time i went to run i ran for 5 mins and felt like i was about to die. So it was very hard. But i had a goal that was stronger than the physical pain i was enduring.

Next thing you know, 8 months later i went from fat to skinny, went to the gym so got some muscles as well and managed to run 10 kms in under 45 minutes, which i never thought i would have been able to do.

But i still didn't find me attractive and still lacked self confidence. I didn't feel healed.

One of my other goal was to get a driver licence, so i studied in hardcore mode for months. I learned everything there was to know, trained with literraly thousands of tests. I did everything humanly possible to pass this test. Yet i failed it because of 1 mistake which i knew i made and wanted to correct before the end but it was too late.

When i received the results of this exam, it felt like when i failed college all over again. The pain was too great, and so sucidal thoughts came back running.

Funny thing is, i finally went to the same exam again 2 weeks later and i passed it! But even if i was happy passing it, the damage was done and i still felt depressed.

It was the first time i actually seriously started searching a way to kill myself. *commented out talking about ways of suicide* Let's just say i don't have an easy way to do it.

I went back to my job after some vacation time but it felt even more pointless from now on. I was actually suffering at my job as well, even more than at home.

I went to work for 1 week to finish stuff only me could have done back then because i did not want to my coworkers to suffer as well because of me.

Then once i was done with it i went to see my psychatrist that stopped me from going to work for 2 weeks. It's been 1 week and a half now. I explained my bosses i was depressive and feeling my job was empty of meaning and they just answered me "ok well get well soon", even if i think they don't understand what's happening and they care more about me not working rather than my well beeing.

So here i am: i don't want to live, but i don't have an easy way out either. If i had a gun, i would have been long dead already. Moreover, i feel like this world stinks. It's everyone for themselves. The survival of the fittest. Success is defined by how much money you make, even if it's by beeing evil and crushing others people life with no regrets. That's how the system works.

If these people are the fittest ones, the ones that will survive, then let me out of here and let them jump at each others throats because i don't feel it's worth living for this.

But then i don't have an esay way out of this life. So i'll go back to see my psychiatrist in 3 days to see if she's able to pull another miracle out of her pocket.

I don't know if i'll keep posting here, whatever the results. Only time will tell.

Anyway if someone went this far and read all of this, i would appreciate to know what do you think/feel about it. TIA.
