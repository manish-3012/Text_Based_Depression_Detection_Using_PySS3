What activities have you guys engaged in to eschew suicidal thoughts?I'm currently suicidal.  I attempted suicide one year and one month ago.  I'm feeling suicidal at the moment.  I don't feel as though I would actually go through with it at the moment.  The thoughts of suicide, however, are not healthy and they're not good for me.  If you guys have any suggestions for how to stop thinking these thoughts please let me know.
