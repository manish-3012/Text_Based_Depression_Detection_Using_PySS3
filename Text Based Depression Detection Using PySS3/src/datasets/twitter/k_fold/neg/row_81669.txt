Facebook is actually the worstJust going on facebook and seeing how everyone you were in school with has progressed in life, and you're still living in the same home and have literally done nothing at all.

Birthdays are the worst. I get like what, two comments? Then you look at anyone else's facebook feed and they seem to get loads of birthday wishes.

Just goes to show how useless I am and how no one gives a damn.
