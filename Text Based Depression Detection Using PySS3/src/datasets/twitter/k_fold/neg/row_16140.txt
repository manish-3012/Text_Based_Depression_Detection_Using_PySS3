Tired of livingIm so tired of living life

It really doesnâ€™t seem worth it anymore. Nothing brings me happiness or satisfaction. I have goals and ambitions but no money to follow them. All I do is work, smoke, sleep. I have no family or friends to talk to Iâ€™m always lonely. 

Iâ€™ve worked my ass off since I was 18. I have nothing to show for it Iâ€™ve been homeless several times throughout my life. Iâ€™ve tried to go to college to get better paying jobs but it just left me in debt and no degree.

Iâ€™m sick of living life. It seems like nothing but stress and competition and pain. I wake up every morning feeling like shit. I go to bed feeling like shit. Iâ€™m just going through the motions waiting till I die. Nothing seems like its worth it anymore. Nothing brings me happiness or satisfaction. I have tried so many different things. I am so done with trying. I want to give up allâ€™s Iâ€™ve known is poverty and pain.
