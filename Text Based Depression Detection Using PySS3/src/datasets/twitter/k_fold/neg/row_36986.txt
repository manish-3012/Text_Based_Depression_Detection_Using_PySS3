Looking for some advice...I've been very depressed for the past year and a half and I cry myself to sleep every other night. I don't know what my point is anymore. I seek friends but they are oblivious to me. I have constant voices and thoughts with only two words repeated in my head. "Kill yourself..." I don't want to but I've been trying and fighting but nothing seems to be a well thought out plan to ignore the idea. I was close last night and now I feel empty and a void within my conscience. Any advice?
