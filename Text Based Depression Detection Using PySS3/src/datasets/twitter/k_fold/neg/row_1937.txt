:(sometimes, like right now, i think about how people would feel if i wasnâ€™t around anymore. i feel like they wouldnâ€™t care. i normally donâ€™t complain because i donâ€™t deserve to complain but nobody really knows what iâ€™ve been through. i try telling people but they either donâ€™t believe me or they brush it off like itâ€™s nothing. iâ€™ve been raped by my â€œfriendâ€ and i canâ€™t even remember their name, i have friends that say they care but i know they donâ€™t. i ask constantly ask my mom to get me help but she claims i just â€œwant attentionâ€ and iâ€™m done with it. iâ€™m just tired of being tired and hurt and happy one second then back to being sad. nobody notices anything and iâ€™m tired of it. i just want it to be over already
