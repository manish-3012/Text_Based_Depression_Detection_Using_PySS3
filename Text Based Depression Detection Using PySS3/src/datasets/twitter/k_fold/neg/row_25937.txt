Warning Harmful Or Fatal If Swallowed Or Inhaled. Contains Ethylene Glycol.In two days, I will be homeless.  I have no money and I do not have the ability to stay at a job.  I have struggled with depression (possibly borderline personality disorder) for years.  I tried treatment.  I have been hospitalized twice.  I cannot do the one thing society requires: work a job.  I truly feel that I can't live on my own and that I need to stay in the mental hospital - not for a day, a week, or a month - forever.  I don't think society will allow me to do that, so I will officially attempt suicide on Oct 1 when my rent is due.  By the time my landlord comes knocking, he won't get any money.  He'll have a dead body.
