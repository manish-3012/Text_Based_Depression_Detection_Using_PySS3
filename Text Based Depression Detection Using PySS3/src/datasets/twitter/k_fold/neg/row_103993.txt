I definitely feel like it's an optionTo copy and paste my thoughts raw:

&gt;I feel that I'm absolutely going to be able to go nowhere in my life right now (even though I'm eighteen, shouldn't it be true that my rights as a person and what I should be doing in order to get what I need shouldn't change anyway?)
Knowing that my parents definitely treat each other like garbage and have physically and have verbally been violent towards each other in the past, I can't expect that they are going to be alive for long enough to support me financially and emotionally but also that I cannot feel obligated to take from a separate government/family if the people who were directly responsible for my life don't have the capability to look after it anymore.
I suppose what this means for me now is to just rot financially and physically or immediately commit suicide if I want to immediately not be a burden to anyone that I have previously supported. I don't want to do anything else in my initiative to contribute if it means that potentially my parents and people around me who support me will get agitated and attack each other just like my parents did.

I don't think I know what to do and what options I am allowed to have.. but this is for those who want to read me anyway.

thank you

*I want to add some more:*

I feel like it's also disrespectful to look for others to support me in my journey because no one deserves to have to support someone out of their family and take time out of their busy lives. In the end, all I tried to do was work or study while not being immediately detrimental in the system I was working in, and I guessed I was being detrimental to the system in that people inside this system had to support so far while I knew that I wasn't going to focus on being far enough.

Thanks for the support guys
