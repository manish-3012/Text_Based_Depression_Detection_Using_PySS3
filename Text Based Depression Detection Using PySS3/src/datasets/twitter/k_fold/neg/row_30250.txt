I flushed all of my anti depressants down the toilet last brakedownSo as the title suggests, I was a big fucking idiot. I have been taking citalopram for about 2-3 maybe 4 months, at 20mg per day when I wake up. Last week I had a breakdown and during it didn't think I deserved to be happy so flushed them all away. Since then I have only had one other breakdown but had feelings of extreme anxious come and go today alone. What should I be worried about? What techniques should I use if I feel like I'm slipping? And if a prescription is going to take a few weeks to sort out again (also flushed my repeat prescription slip) is there any point in trying to get back on them?

Also I'm really sorry if this is not the place to ask this, I'm clutching at straws at the moment

EDIT: Should note I live in the UK
