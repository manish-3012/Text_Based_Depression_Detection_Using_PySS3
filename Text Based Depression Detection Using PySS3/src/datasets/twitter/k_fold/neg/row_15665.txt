They really don'tPeople really don't love. My family feels that they need to love me because well I'm family. Otherwise they don't give a shit. Society doesn't care because I'm sadly male. All the things for women saying that you are loved and its okay to be depressed are directed at females. I don't have friends anymore. They moved on and told me to go away. I got nothing left in me. Everyone says push yourself and it will get better. 3 years pushing and Im lower than I started. I just want to kill myself but that is too much of a burden for everyone. Im too much of a waste. However no one is gonna read this so meh. Good Bye then.
