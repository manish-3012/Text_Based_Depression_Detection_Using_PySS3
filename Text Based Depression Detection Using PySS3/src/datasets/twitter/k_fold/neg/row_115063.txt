I'm Nuts To Do It, Always Been My Whole Life That's Why I'm Here Where I'mAll my life I've been nuts to do things. Nuts to talk to the girls I liked. Nuts to talk to people. Nuts to do what I want. Nuts to say what I wanted to say. 

I'm almost 20 years old and I feel like it's over. I'm too late to fix things. I have a girl that I like now and I'm nuts to be nice with her. I'm at my home alone. Feeling lonely. I have a bottle of champagne I want to drink it, but I know it's just a temporary solution. 

I'm ready to do 'it'. What's stopping me? Is the fact that I'm nuts to do it like I've always been.
