I have strong urges to veer off road on my motorcycle.I would say I've been secretly severely depressed for around 6 months. I've been trying my hardest to get over my heart breaking over a messy break up with my ex (together for 3 years, it was perfect mostly). We broke up around Octoberish and I thought I really could carry on. But the more I try not to think about her the worse it is. I've tried taking up physical and mental hobbies to take my mind off but I just can't stop thinking about memories we shared together. She's obviously moved on and is happy again, which I'm happy for but I can never extinguish the hope that we can still share a few more memories together.
So anyway, I've made a serious cry for help gesture before by means of a pain killer overdose and sleeping tablets but now it just seems like I really can't go on. My heart feels broken and shattered.
I have a motorcycle which I ride regularly in heavy, open road traffic to commute and I never forget when riding how easy it would be just to swerve slightly to the other lane and get hit head on and end it.
I know this is incredibly stupid because of the immense damage it could cause to so many other people but it's always there in the back of my mind.
I just can't move on. She's slept with other men now and has got a whole new life, she was incredible in almost everyway. I know she's a totally different person now but I still can't shake her out of me, she got so inbuilt, everything I did, I did for her...

Help me.
