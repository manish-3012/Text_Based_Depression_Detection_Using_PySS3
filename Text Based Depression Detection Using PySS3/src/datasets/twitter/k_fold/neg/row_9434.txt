Offing myself seems to be the only â€œcure allâ€ I can think of and I hate it - a rantIâ€™ve been having terrible spirals lately and todayâ€™s is probably the worst yet 

 I once again push my significant other away and was very hurtful with my words. I sobbed to my mom. Wrote to my cousin that I wanted to get away at her house; this was all made more complicated because COVID is still a thing so I canâ€™t actually just get away without having to quarantine after, etc etc etc. which is another big pain 

Amidst my breakdown, my mom asked â€œwell what do you want?â€ Like do you think I know??? My partner made a very good point where he thinks I havenâ€™t been trying hard enough to get help (heâ€™s right). My sisters said â€œcan you give us more info?â€ When I told them I was gonna run away for a bit because theyâ€™re worried about COVID and what would happen when I come back. 

Iâ€™m too scared of blades to hurt myself. I donâ€™t want to look like a weirdo for lying in the snow for hours even tho i want to. I donâ€™t want to completely off myself but that seems to be what my mind is revolving around 

I donâ€™t even want to die I just want help and attention and for someone to fix me. But I donâ€™t know what the fix is and because of that, death is the easy option. After my breakdown I was just lying here thinking â€œif this is going to be my life... I donâ€™t want itâ€ 

Anyways, rant over. I just have a headache and want someone to help me figure out what tf is wrong with me but no one knows, not even myself and Iâ€™m so tired
