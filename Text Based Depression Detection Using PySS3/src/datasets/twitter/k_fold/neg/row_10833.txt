Sometimes-poster here. I got a tiny, but much needed, bit of relief yesterday.I know many of you are struggling. Sorry to be taking up space on SW but I felt like saying something about myself - plus I've posted here as a helper and helpee many times in the past.

Anyway, I've been crushed by poverty and health problems for years. And, let me tell you, it's a good way to find out who your family and friends are -- sadly I found out I didn't have any because they all left me nearly to rot and tried to make it seem like my problems weren't real.

Yesterday, I finally came across the missing piece of the puzzle about my health that I had hoped I would come across for so long. ~~Studies earlier this year validated that some of us suffer from~~

I was going to go into detail. But, I guess in reality I just wanted to type something here because I have no friends to tell things to.

I'm by no means out of the woods at the moment because the only thing I've really gained is a better understanding of what makes me sick. I do have a small amount of hope that I might be able to make a fresh start. Even if I manage, it will be difficult. But, I am hoping to be able to build a new life with people who truly will be real friends and family to me.

It'll be tough. We'll see how it goes.
