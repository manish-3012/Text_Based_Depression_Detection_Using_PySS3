Still sad. And I always delete my posts. What next?I literally wake up every single day and wonder if it will be my last. I don't have a plan. I'm not in crisis. Nobody needs to hide the knives. 
But it is literally my first thought when I wake up each day.
"Will this be the day that is my last day"
I am just learning that other people don't feel that way. I thought I was normal. 
Every time I cross a bridge over a highway, (which is daily, back and forth, where I live), I want to jump into traffic. I imagine and fantasize about it. It's like a plaguing, intrusive thought. I can't help it and I can't turn it off, even if I want to.
