I Really Need Help. This Life Is Tearing Me Apart.8 months ago I had everything in place. I had the most wonderful girlfriend, I had my dream job, I just graduated college with my bachelors degree, and my life was truly beginning to start. A few weeks after college graduation I went to a party and well, Iâ€™ve never done drugs or anything like that but I decided why not, everyone else is doing them. Long story short, I had a bad reaction to the drug and I ended up with self induced brain damage. I started to decline both cognitively and physically as the months went on. I could hardly walk to the restroom or wherever I needed to go. I couldnâ€™t hold conversations with people, I couldnâ€™t hang out with friends, I could no longer work, I couldnâ€™t play games, read, watch tv, etc. It tore me and my girlfriend apart, I was in a really bad place and it caused a lot of anger issues and confusion. She broke up with me three months after my injury, I lost my job shortly before that because I was deemed unfit to work, and I moved in with my parents because I could no longer support myself.

Fast forward 8 months and Iâ€™ve made slight progress in â€œhealingâ€ if you can call it that. I go on daily walks, I can exercise for 20 - 30 minutes, I can hold short conversations but too much talking causes my brain to become overloaded, I still canâ€™t read a book, watch television, play games, drive, or even hang out with friends. My brain becomes fatigued incredibly easily still, I have about 6 hours of battery life every day before I physically and mentally collapse. Iâ€™m still heart broken and think about my ex every single day... I know sheâ€™s out and dating again and it absolutely destroys me. I shouldnâ€™t be here right now, I should working my dream job, I should be living with with her, I should be able to do the things I love and enjoy life... instead Iâ€™m stuck in bed 90% of my day. I suffer from frequent headaches, reality feels completely different than it used to my brain doesnâ€™t perceive the things around me correctly it makes just existing in my head a nightmare. Iâ€™m crying every day. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™ve been working my ass off to heal but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to heal or be anything close to what I was before. I want to feel happiness again, love again, and I just want to feel normal. Itâ€™s almost like my soul is the same but Iâ€™m in a damaged body, trapped and unable to escape. 

I was always one of those people with the mindset that I would never end my own life. But here I am, contemplating it. Iâ€™m not living, hardly existing. My only hope is that one day I can have a fraction of everything I lost back. Itâ€™s overwhelming and Iâ€™m trying to keep these dark thoughts away but they are flooding my brain. I even dream of suicide... I really need help.
