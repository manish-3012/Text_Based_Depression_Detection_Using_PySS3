Need some advice, nowhere else to askSo, context. I'm about to hit 20 years old, live with parents in dead end retail job in England.


As far as how i've ended up here? I'll try to make it short.
In secondary school I started having panic attacks as a result of anxiety, went to counsellor. She told me CAHMS (Child and adult mental health service) would like to see me, needed parents to know before referal. Months of persuasion later I say, sure. Parents react badly, am branded 'Selfish, lazy and a liar' for it. Never bring it up again. GCSE's go by, I do alright with 13 from C - A*. Go to good 6th form, new school though. Become complete loner. See Councillor there, she says same thing as before. Self harm started around here. I flunk 6th form. Go into dead end retail job i was working part time in for the summer. September comes, start college course for computing. Do alright in the first year, they cancel second year as not enough new starters. Back to dead end retail job. We move across the country to center of England. In new dead end retail job. No friends outside of work. Only reason i leave the house is to get food or go to work. I don't think im a bad person, but they way things have turned out kinda makes me feel like I must be at this point. Just seems like every days a bit more effort to go through and im certain at some point i'll give up.


wat do?





*Also, I did go to the GP about my issues, he simply gave me a pamphlet and sent me away. I waited until I could drive and all to get there without telling anyone and yeah, fucked me up a little more with how little he cared.*
