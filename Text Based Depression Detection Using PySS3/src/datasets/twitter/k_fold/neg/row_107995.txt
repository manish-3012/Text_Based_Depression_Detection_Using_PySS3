I still like my best friend, but I loved her so muchSo I gotta go back to school, after this weekend, knowing that the girl I love is probably going out with my best friend. I can't do nothing about it since he's the better version of me. I'm too shy anyway to do these kinds of things. I'm done with this game. It sucks.
