I need help with a gfs suicideJust for some context. This is a gf from about 3years ago. She committed suicide after her brother sold her for drugs. We were still dating at the time. This might not sound real but I honestly just need some help. Iâ€™ve tried therapists, going to her grave daily, writing to her all those things Iâ€™ve been told should help but Iâ€™m still stuck at the bottom.
