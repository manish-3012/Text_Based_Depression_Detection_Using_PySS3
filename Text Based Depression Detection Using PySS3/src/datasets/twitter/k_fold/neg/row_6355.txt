Suicide high.Quick background:

I've attempted suicide twice. Last time some 5 months ago.

OD on opiates first time - got 'saved' by neighbor who wanted to peek on me through the covered windows.

OD on opiates and asphyxiation second time - got 'saved' by a distant friend I stupidly sms'd "good bye" too. 
Messed up my lungs.

Either way not important.

------------------------------------

Both times when I was out 'shopping' for Oxy and generally planning the suicide, when I KNEW I would do it - I was in fucking GREAT mood.

Nothing mattered anymore, not even the problems, I even in a way got over my emotionless state during that time.

It was just me and my date with death. Prancing through a flowery field towards the abyss.

You have you *whole* life planned out ahead of you, it was sweet as fuck. I was chipper as an idiot.

Anyone else had this "suicide high"? Is is common?

On the other hand waking up after each failure sucked amazingly much. Suicide wards probably increases the suicide rate.
