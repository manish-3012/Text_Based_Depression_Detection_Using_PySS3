This distance is hurting so much..I feel so alone. I want to be loved. How can I be loved? I am alienated from the world and no one remembers me. Let me die. Give me what I want. I want to kill myself. I want to die. Please, no more.

Nobody likes me and I can't change that. Some people are just more likely to be hated than the others. I am easy to hate. I am arrogant, selfish, poor, mentally ill, I can't take criticism, I can't validate people's struggles. What am I supposed to do?

I'm not relevant. My life is irrelevant. I am capable of love but no one wants to be loved by me. I try.. I fucking try.. Life is shit. Prove me wrong.
