If I get my class scores back and I failed my class, I will want nothing but to kill myselfI just took an exam worth almost all of my grade and I knew nothing, probably because I have depression and I've been rotting in my room all day instead of studying. If I failed the class, my parents will take everything away from me and the abuse in my home will get worse. I can see myself kmsing over this at some point during the winter break. I know what you're thinking "its just a grade, it doesn't matter that much" but for me my whole life, grades define me as a person. grades are EVERYTHING, therefore if I failed this class then I should just consider myself a failure. Don't act like your grades don't define you. I just want to die.
