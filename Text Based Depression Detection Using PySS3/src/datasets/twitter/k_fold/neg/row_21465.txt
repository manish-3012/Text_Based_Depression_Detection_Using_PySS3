If weâ€™re all gonna die, why try to live? Feels like itâ€™s not worth it to try anymore (long vent).It feels weird to post on here because it feels like Iâ€™m far from actually killing myself but I just canâ€™t stop not wanting to live and I donâ€™t have friends so Iâ€™m sharing here...


I keep thinking that if we are all going to die what is the point of living? I understand life is a journey and I used to really enjoy that journey, write your own life outlook thing but now I canâ€™t help but find everything so meaningless. Like everything worth living for, if you zoom out enough is just nothing. It means nothing. I miss that passion and zest for life I used to have. I donâ€™t care about being happy I just want a purpose back or rather the ability to see life as I used to see it. I want to get out of this dark mindset but it never goes away and itâ€™ll always be here. I have to fucking cope forever and I hate it! 

I keep falling in and out of this. Sometimes Iâ€™m good and motived but then other times I donâ€™t wash or do much of anything. I hate it. I hate how lazy and unproductive I am. The only thing that helps is self harm. And even that isnâ€™t always helpful. I tried talking in the beginning but Iâ€™m learning people really donâ€™t wanna hear about all this. They lie and say you can talk to them but the they get upset at you for talking (yeah I know people have lives and stuff and Iâ€™m not the fucking sun but just set fucking boundaries. Just tell me you care about what I have to say but just arenâ€™t in a place to listen effectively and Iâ€™ll be fucking fine with that! Instead people blow up at me making me feel like a fucking burden or fucking ghost me. I hate people sometime!) So now I try to keep to myself as much as I can or post on here occasionally. 

I just donâ€™t wanna live like this anymore. Iâ€™m so tired of the ups and downs. Iâ€™m so tired of being fucking depressed. I wish I could die because I donâ€™t wanna do this anymore but people in my life are selfish and want me to stay around regardless of how shitty things are for me. That and what if I try to off myself and mess up? Then my life would be even worse. 

Sorry this is so long and I donâ€™t really care if anyone reads this or not. Iâ€™m just so fucking tired and sad and needed to vent.
