I just want something for myself and now I don't have anything.I'm a financial strapped college kid supporting myself and my mother on a part time walmart paycheck and school loans. I finally got some money for myself and decided to go to a videogame tournament and 1hr away. I just wanted something to break the gloom and financial stress riding on my 24/7. Long story short, weather got bad I ended up in the ditch couldn't get towed, car didn't start, brakes where locked. First thing My mom ask isn't how I am but how could I be so fucking stupid for thinking we could spare cash for me to drive there and back. Now I'm all out of options nothing cant make rent cant get food cant get the car can finish school nothing is there for me.
