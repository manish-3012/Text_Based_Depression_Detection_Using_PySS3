I feel so empty, I'm lacking of love so much that I think to die. 

I've Writen this an hundred times before posting it.

It is how I feel, you can disagree, you can not understand, but it stay how i feel

When I was a child, I never thought about my future.

Iâ€™ve always thought that it gonna be like everyone else.I was wrong.

Why did I have to see people die ?

Why did my family has to fall apart ?

Why people had humiliated and hit me ?

Why did I have to live sexual abuse ?

And more importantly, why did so many people have chosen to look away ?

I never found any answer to this question, other than â€œitâ€™s like this.â€ So I tried to ignore it, a life without past, a fresh start.

I was stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if I can forget about my past, other scars will remain.

I understood this too late. Being like everyone else was difficult for me, it was not easy to not be scared.

Of course, during the next years, I failed multiple times.

Even thou, I was able to make a few friends and to change.

I thought it would be enough. Again, I was wrong.

For me who lost his family at 11 years old, who had been abandoned by the one he loved, by his friend during teenage years, something was missing.

I was lacking of love.

I needed to feel loved, to have someone by my side, to have the right to say â€œI love you,â€ to take someone in my arm, to hold a hand, to kiss someone, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to fight, to do my best to be able to achieve my goal, or maybe should I say my dream . And the worst was that my best wasnâ€™t enough.

I just had my heart broken a lot more.And it hurt, it hurt so much. I just want to happy, to be loved.

Why is it so wrong ?

I see other, in the street being happy, being in love, life what I want to live so much without being able to live it.

It destroys me.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot ignore this feeling inside me, itâ€™s not just a thought, not just a feel, itâ€™s vital, like you cannot ignore your hunger or your thirst. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

Iâ€™ve fought and Iâ€™ve lost.

People tell me to wait, that Iâ€™m young.

But wait is not the answer, waiting will not stop me suffering and waiting will and give me back the time lost. Iâ€™m not able to do succeed by myself, whatever the effort I put in.

&amp;#x200B;

Iâ€™m almost at my limit.

I feel that I will break.

I need help, but no one to help me.

It hurt so much, I just want this pain to stop.

I would prefer to die than live like this.

Â I donâ€™t want to die, but I donâ€™t want to live like this either, I donâ€™t know what to do.
