I'm at wit's endI'm a 20 yo M on the brink of flunking out of uni due to not attending classes this past semester because of depression and SA. I have almost no friends because everyone just hates me for no reason. I'm ugly and girls find me unattractive (even though I'm 6'3"). I'm a loner. I am going fucking nowhere in life. I need help.
