I hate myself so muchI have no self esteem, I try to hide it and act normal and confident in public but Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m 18 but I look like Iâ€™m 15. During the quarantine I have been thinking more about how I am a virgin and that I may never lose my virginity. I think I am alright looking but I have no confidence and Iâ€™m really insecure and quiet and invisible and I donâ€™t think any girl would want to be with me. Not that it matters right now. Iâ€™m in online college until January at the very earliest. Iâ€™m so lonely. I barely see my friends. Covid fucked whatever social life I had. I hate myself. If I donâ€™t lose my virginity or find a girlfriend by the time Iâ€™m 25 I swear to god Iâ€™m going to rope because I donâ€™t want to exist if I have to be alone.
