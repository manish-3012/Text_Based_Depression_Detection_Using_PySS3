I found oneI found a bottle of oxycodone. After calculating the LD50, I figured out the required amount for a lethal dose. 

Now I finally have an easy way out, take the bag I prepared with some alcohol and just wait. Iâ€™m going to wait until the schedule but its nice knowing I have it. Even if I wont use it, or will.

To think like this is disgusting.
