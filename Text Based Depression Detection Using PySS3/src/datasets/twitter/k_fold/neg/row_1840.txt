WHY?!?My mother read my notebook for some reason and I had a page where I ranted. I basically wrote similar to what I write on here. She just came into room to talk to me about it. So fucking mortifying man. â€œThink positiveâ€, â€œGod has a plan, â€œBe happyâ€, etc. The â€œGod talkâ€ doesnâ€™t work on someone who was told I would be going to Hell if I was gay. None of that stuff puts me in any good mood, in fact, it does the opposite. All I did was carve into my skin with my nails while she was talking. God, I am so stupid. I should of been trashed that notebook. Just another thing in my life. I canâ€™t go to her or any family member about the shit I think about. I fucking hate this.
