I just want to dieEveryone keeps telling me that I can hang on. 
Survive this. 
But I don't want to goddammit. I want to close my eyes and never open them again.
Disappear from this world and never come back.
I just made 218 cuts on my legs. I'm lying on the floor, writhing in pain.
But I STILL feel lonely.
Humans have advanced so much but we still can't make a pill to cure loneliness?
