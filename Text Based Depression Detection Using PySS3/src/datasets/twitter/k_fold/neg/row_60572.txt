killing myself in 2 weeksHi, i'll be killing myself after my exams end just because.

I have attempted to kill myself around 10 times now. I wait and wait for stuff to get better, it does for some time but then it goes back to being a mess. For some backstory, long story short, i had been sexually assaulted when i was 14, my ex boyfriend manipulated me, sexually harassed me, emotionally blackmailed me into staying with him, and my family is religious as fuck and they found out i was in a relationship, so as a result i was fucked pretty bad, and my mom beat me up the first time she found out i tried to kms because of my bf. I am a bisexual and i cannot dare to tell anyone about it, because i live in a very religious country, im tired of hiding it over and over again. I'm 17 right now, my family is financially in a very tight spot, i did my olevels privately yet still got B's and a C. I am a burden for my sisters because they are providing for me, my dad doesnt get paid his salaries quite often, my mother constantly compares me to kids my age who are so good at studies and all and i want her to be proud of me too but theres nothing in me to be proud of. I do not have any friends either. I know i'll fuck my exams up because i cannot focus on my studies, i feel so empty and hurt i do not know what to do. My family will be better off without me and i know that for a fact.  
This post probably wont reach anyone since i just created this account just to let it out, and thats okay. Anyways, im done and i hope my suicide attempt is successful this time.
