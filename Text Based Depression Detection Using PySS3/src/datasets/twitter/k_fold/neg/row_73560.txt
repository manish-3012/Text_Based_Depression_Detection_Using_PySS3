Just fucking do itYou've got the plan. Drive to the next city over. Rent a hotel room. Take a bunch of pills, get really drunk. Jump off the roof. It's foolproof. But you're more of a fool than I anticipated. 

I used to always know what was going to happen. But I don't know anymore. I'm all alone. My boyfriend wants to be a doctor. He meets cute little nurses and PAs all day, not losers like me. I don't even have a fucking college degree, I'm an idiot piece of shit. He wants away from me so bad I can feel it. I'm so sad, I can't go to work tomorrow. If I call in tomorrow, they'll be mad at me. I have to do it tonight, or never. I have to be dead. I have to get it over with. How long can I go on feeling like a fraction of a person? 

When I was a kid, I dreamed of being an educated woman with a loving husband and a family. It's too late for all of that now. I'm 30. Even if I was going to get those things, even if I just had to work hard and I could get them, I'm tired of working. 

I'm just so fucking tired. 

It has got to be tonight. 

This is my end. I want to write my life story here, but none of you would read it, and that's appropriate.
