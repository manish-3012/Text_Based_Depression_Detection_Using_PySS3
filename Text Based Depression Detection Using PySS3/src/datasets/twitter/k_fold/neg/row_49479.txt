I was born with one of the worst fucking genetic combinations ever and it depresses the shit out of me.I was 86 kilos at the beginning of the year, and 6'1. I had a very chubby face so I decided to cut weight down to 77 kilos. Now according to my gym machine I'm 12.2% bodyfat. That being said, my face is STILL chubby.

Another thing that sucks is my recessed chin. In case you don't know what a recessed chin is, have a look at this:

Anyways, this is what my chin looks like:

Notice how it goes behind my lips? It's very short compared to the rest of my face?

The worst part is, it's not like my dad had a recessive chin or anything: [https://i.imgur.com/d23Toop.png](https://i.imgur.com/d23Toop.png)

I have about $20,000 saved up through trading Bitcoin, and I put that in Apple stocks recently so it should hopefully grow. I plan to get extensive surgery from Barry Eppley and have been communicating with him recently, he says that his jawline implants and chin augmentation surgery can give me a less misshapen face. However, I still feel like it might not work at all. I can literally afford the plastic surgery right now but my mom won't let me get it, I have the bloody money... guess I'll have to wait almost 2 years then. I don't know if I can.

EDIT: A lot of people say "oh just get braces" but braces only fix your chin if you have an underbite. The dentist said it would make 0 difference to my face shape, so I'm not going to spend thousands of dollars to put pieces of metal on my perfectly straight teeth because some internet losers recommended it.
