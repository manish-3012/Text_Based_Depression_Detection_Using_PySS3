It's inevitableHey everyone. This is my first post, so please bare with me. 
As of recently I have been thinking more and more about leaving this life behind. I have nothing worth living for, except sparing the feelings of my family. I'm 26 y/o I've never slept with a girl, let alone kiss one. Every girl I start to feel a connection with, she either is too young, has a bf, or just doesn't feel the same way.
 I work at a shitty Pizzeria for shit pay while getting belittled by my boss. Any other job I try to get, they don't even call me back for an interview. I have no car, therefore I progressively lose the teeny tiny amount of friend that I have. I ask for help from my mother, but she won't even respond to a phone call or text. The rest of my family tease me and make fun of me for things and they don't know it just keeps chipping away at me and every time I say something to them they tell me to shut up about it. My bills are just keep piling and piling up. Nobody has any faith in me and doubts my existence. I surely will not be missed. I don't know what to do anymore and the time to leave is rapidly getting closer. I already know how I'm going to do it, I'm just waiting for the right time. Sorry for laying this on you all, but I just didn't know who to tell or talk to about it.
