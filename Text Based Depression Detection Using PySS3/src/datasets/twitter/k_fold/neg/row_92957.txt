Whatâ€™s nextSo I want to die after almost ODing on Oxys. Been called a drug addict since it happened by my loved one. What do I have to do to convince myself to do it. Iâ€™m withdrawing from this shit so if there is a time to hurt myself, itâ€™s now. Would I rather hurt myself to prove a point instead of just going all the way out? Yes. But although I maybe afraid; you canâ€™t stop the process once it starts. Sadly I donâ€™t own a gun but maybe Iâ€™ll get one and reconsider next time this happens. Anyone had this thought process?
