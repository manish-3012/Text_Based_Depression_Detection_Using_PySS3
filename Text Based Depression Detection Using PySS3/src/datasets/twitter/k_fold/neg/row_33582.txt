If life is like a box of chocolate...Good lord look at what I am doing trying to do make a joke here wtf is wrong with me. I am such a waste of space. I could fuck up a wet dream. So xanax and Jack are looking better everyday. Sorry just needed to say something to someone I have family and friends who would probably give a shit if they knew how I really feel but I don't know if I'm embarrassed or afraid or what but I can't seem to say it to any of them. Hell I'm done ranting about for a while I would like to thank this sub for a lowing me to do this some nights it's been all that has kept me from taking off walking finding a pretty place and pouring myself a drink with a xanax back.
