Reddit disclosed my account to law enforcementThis is all part of my plan for suicide, because I fucking hate existing. I want to die, and I want to die fighting.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm irredeemably batshit insane anyways. I just want this pathetic existence to end already.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no hope. r/collapse has convinced me it's not worth fighting on anymore. Even if by some miracle of science or whatever that the world gets better? I'm past the moral event horizon. There's no place for me in that better world.

&amp;#x200B;

It's time for me to die.
