Not SureI'm going to try to be brief with this because I'm gonna go to bed soon.

What do you do when you're uncertain about suicide? I'm sure a lot of us feel that way, I know I do. Like, you think about ending it all but you don't exactly want to. However, you don't want to put up with the pain, anger, sadness, anxiety and frustration that life throws at us.

I've been feeling like that frequently. Being in a spot where you can't change anything is really getting to me. The main problem is my family and a lot things changed in the past few years. I have different feelings towards some of the people I used to love and I constantly worry and fear the future.

The thing is, I don't want to let anybody down, especially my mom. I'm the youngest of three sisters and it'll most likely leave her heartbroken if I committed suicide. I definitely don't want my mom to suffer because of me. Then, everything will be my fault if I left. :'(

Can anyone relate to this feeling? It's a tough decision. I want to disappear sometimes but I'm not sure if I can do it. I'll be 22 in January and I've got a ton in front of me. I'm still learning and growing up yet intrusive thoughts get in the way of everything.

What should I do about this? I am seeing a therapist, in case you're wondering. But I wonder about suicide and cutting myself.
