just cut myself for the first timeI've been thinking about suicide a lot lately and even find solace in in idea. Tonight by ex called me out of the blue to ask a random question and she sounds so happy without me. I didn't want to feel the pain in my chest so i took out a knife and sliced my wrist a bit in two places. i've never done anything like this before and part of me worries im just getting closer and closer to pulling the trigger.
