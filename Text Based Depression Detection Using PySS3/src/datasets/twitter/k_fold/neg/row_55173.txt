I'm worried my friend is suicidal, what should I do to help him?My friend is a 17 year old guy, and he is very emotional.  He falls for girls very easily, and is currently infatuated with one girl.  Recently he was told that she was interested in him, but this is not true. Eventually he will find out that this girl does not share his feelings, and i'm worried he will do something rash.

He recently told me that he has thought about suicide before, he has even made plans.  His family definitely has no idea just how bad he is.  I'm scared that when he finds out she is not interested in him he will do something, and I know I have to do something to try and help.

I was thinking that I would talk to a school counsellor about it, is there anything else I should do?
