I beg all of you to help meI have an online friend that has suicidal thoughts, i tried to help him but he doesnt want to listen to me. Here's what i know:

His family or friends dont know about it

He almost drowned once and said "it felt good", he is going through this but he has been bullied in elementary school.

 He's 18-20 years old.

I tried to make him tell his family about it, or contact a therapist but he doesnt want to hear any of that, what do i do??
