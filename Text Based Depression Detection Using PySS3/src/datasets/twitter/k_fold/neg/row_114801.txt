Why can't I get better?I just can't take it anymore. I'm 26. I have a child of six who doesn't live with me (he lives with his father who can better support him) my depression wipes me out for days, last night I cut chunks out of my hair out of sheer anger and misery at myself for not looking after myself and I kept thinking why even try anymore? 


My son knows I love him, but I am not strong enough anymore. I keep looking at the antidepressants I have, contemplating taking a strip and closing my eyes and giving in. It's selfish, I have a child I shouldn't want to hurt him and I don't but the pain is just too much now. I hate my body, my life, everything. I used to try to look at the few positives but even they don't seem to matter anymore. My little boy is the only reason I am still breathing but even that love is going to Peter out and I'm scared. I'm scared because I want to die.
