How do I stop having an emotion anymore?It just hurt, everything is hurt. I have been talking with my therapist but these past couples of months I haven't got a chance to go back and see them. Right now I am living by myself and my bf is currently in the quarantine (we are living away from each other). My family is living in another country, and It currently on lockdown so I can't go back. I used to cut myself nearly every day, and it has been around two months since I stop cutting. I have been tempted to start it again, now that the pain is coming back.I have always been a private person, so I usually only share with 1 or 2 peoples and one of them is my bf. He told me that he has been stress out lately and it slowly burn him out. I felt like it is my fault that I cause him to be so stressed out. I want to stop being depressed and being anxious about everything. I wish I could just stop living so I don't have to feel all this anymore. So many have happened in the last 5 months and I hate that everything is affecting me. I wish I can just stop feeling altogether and become a psychopath or something.
