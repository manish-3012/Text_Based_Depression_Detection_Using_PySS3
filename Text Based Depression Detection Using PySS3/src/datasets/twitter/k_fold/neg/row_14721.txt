No more friendsI know I've been here before and I did seek help after the last post but nothing really helped, in my last post I talked of how I was losing my two close friends but since then they seemed to have distanced themselves from me. I now have no one. I was never the favorite child in the family and my therapist is terrible. I've accepted the aftermath of what would happened if I ended it all and I don't really wish to continue on. I just don't want to keep going my emotions are slowly dulling and it seems to be the only thing I think about anymore. No friends no love no hope :/ no reason to continue
