How can I help my friend?Iâ€™m very sorry if this is the wrong place to post this? Please tell me if thereâ€™s a better one. But I have this friend A who is depressed. And she looked into going to therapy but she says she canâ€™t afford it. Twice now Aâ€™s messaged me in the middle of the night talking about how sheâ€™s had suicidal thoughts or how she wants to die. And I always try to reassure her that I really care and appreciate her and how caring she is for other people but I worry that one day that wonâ€™t be enough. Does anyone have any advice for how I can help her more/ help her get more help?
