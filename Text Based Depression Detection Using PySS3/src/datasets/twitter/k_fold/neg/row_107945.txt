Really need to let this outI have been thinking about killing myself for the past few months, before this I was getting help and was actually starting to feel pretty good about myself. But all that changed, things just started going downhill for me, my life is basically the same thing every day. No one really wants much to do with me, I feel as though everyone I know just wants to use me for their own personal gain. I feel as though I am alone in the world with no one to go to when I need help. I have been struggling with depression for about 2 years now and was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. When I was diagnosed I kind of just fell apart inside because I know what my life is going to be like in the future.
