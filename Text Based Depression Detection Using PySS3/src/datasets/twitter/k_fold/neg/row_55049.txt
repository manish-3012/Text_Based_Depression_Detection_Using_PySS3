wrote a suicide note for the first timei don't know if i actually want to die. i just feel so tired from trying to be happy. i don't think im strong enough to handle anything anymore, everything sets me off into a spiral. I've pushed almost everyone in my life away because i felt like i had to put a facade of normalcy and i can't do it anymore, i don't think I'll ever be normal or what people want me to be. i don't want to be alive but i don't want to hurt the people around me by killing myself. i feel selfish for even thinking about it. I don't know what to do and im really scared
