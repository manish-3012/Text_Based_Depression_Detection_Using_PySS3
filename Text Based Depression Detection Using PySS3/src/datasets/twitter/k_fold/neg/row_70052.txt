just need to chat with someonei'm 26, clinically depressed.  my boyfriend, my rock, the love of my life, just broke up with me.  he has helped me through depression for the last 5 years, improved my life tremendously, and i really thought i could win with him.  i was ready to spend the rest of my life with him...i still am.  i'm devastated.  i cannot talk about this with anyone i know due to the nature of our relationship.  i don't have close family.  i just need to talk with someone right now.  thanks.

also, this is a throwaway, so no worries if i don't respond.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the responses.  I'm glad there are people like you out there.  I just needed to talk, you gave me the opportunity to do so (through PMs) and my state of hysterics and crisis has eased a bit for the evening (where I live).  You guys are really great, I hope you know this.
