can't find job or internshipIt's summer of my Junior year, i am majoring in IT and i can't seem to find any jobs or internships. All of my friends have some sort of work and then there's me doing nothing. I've been searching but it is impossible to get anything when you don't have experience. I've been doing food delivery gigs just to make some money but that makes me feel so depressed. I don't really believe in luck but nothing good ever happens to me, disappointment after disappointment. My whole life has been a disappointment. I really want to work hard and change my bad fortune but i don't know how to get started. I really don't see a way and i feel like killing myself but i am not even strong enough to do that. Every morning i wake up and there's nothing i can do that is meaningful, i have to resort to doing deliveries to make some sort of money so i can help my family with the rent. This is just one part of my life that's wrong, there's more things too, such as me having gynocomastia. No matter how hard i work in the gym i still have bitch tits, can't even go out with friends to the beach because of it. All of this combined is making me feel like shit :(
