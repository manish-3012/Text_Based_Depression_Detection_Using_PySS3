Taking my meds, doing the therapy;Yet I still cry every day, want to kill myself every day.

My work has changed hands recently, and the new team has forced us to understaff every shift, making things dangerous and stressful.

So moral is low. People are leaving, signed off on stress leave. So we become more understaffed.
Should have had 6 staff on last night.
We had 3.

I did everything alone, until the last 30minutes,  when I asked someone to help me with a 2 minutes task.
They blew up in my face and there I was, crying again.

I want to die.
I donâ€™t want to do this all over again.
Iâ€™m all pale skin, black bags, split skin and spots.
I want to scream and punch and break myself and let everything out until I donâ€™t exist any more.
I want to die.
I just want to die.
