I have no one and im selfish.ive been battling depression for so long and i just dont know what to do anymore, i just want to die so badly and get away from this lonely hell. but i cant because my daughter would be alone and i know my parents and sister would be hurt. but i have no one to talk to and i keep cutting. im on medicine but it doesnt help. i have social anxiety so i have no one to talk to. im so lost. Too many things have happen these past 4 years for me to just live with this depression like i normally do.
