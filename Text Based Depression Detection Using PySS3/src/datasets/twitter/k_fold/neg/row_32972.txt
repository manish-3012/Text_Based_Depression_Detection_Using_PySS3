possibly my last yeariâ€™ve been thinking a lot and i think this is my last year. iâ€™m taking the semester off from college this fall. i told my parents itâ€™s because i want to pursue something else. which isnâ€™t entirely false. but iâ€™ll never have a genuinely happy life. not doing what i love. not anytime soon. a bunch of family is coming this weekend which is good. i can spend time with family. i can enjoy my favorite seasons (fall &amp; winter) one last time before itâ€™s my time to go. i feel a sense of relief when i think about it. living in my dreams forever, happy.
