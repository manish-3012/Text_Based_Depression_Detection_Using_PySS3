Et Sic Vadit....and so it goes.

It's funny I've spent the last nine months thinking about it and soon it will all be over. I used to have three possibilities that could happen after you die, and now I've narrowed it down to one. People spend their entire lives buried in religious literature, or recycled anti-spiritual secular/humanist ideologies thinking they will find answers there, but they won't.  

Only logic and rational thought can actually guide you in this endeavor. I know what will happen to me when I'm gone, and I know it's better then where I am now, although I've been here before.
