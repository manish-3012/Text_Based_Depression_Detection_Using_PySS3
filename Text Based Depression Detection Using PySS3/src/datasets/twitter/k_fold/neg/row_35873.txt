Feeling horrible about former political views.

Before I start, Iâ€™d like to say Iâ€™m not making excuses, just a combination of trauma and me being prone to extreme views was the perfect storm for some crazy stuff. This post mentions sexual assault, suicide, self harm and sexism. Before I start Iâ€™d like to say Iâ€™m a woman, itâ€™s relevant later. So, I was sexually abused as a child and didnâ€™t even know how bad it was but I realized how bad it was when I was a teenager, as a child I didnâ€™t even understand what was happening. Iâ€™m not going to say what happened because some sadist will probably enjoy reading it and also you donâ€™t really want to know anyway. The person that abused me was an older woman who was a family friend, it was some pretty humiliating stuff but I wasnâ€™t too physically harmed but the trauma messed me up. I was later diagnosed with CPTSD. Basically, I adopted the view that all women were sadistic creeps. Since Iâ€™m a woman I hated myself to the point of wanting to die but I thought I deserved to suffer so I self harmed a lot to punish myself. To make it worse, Iâ€™m pretty much the stereotypical feminine person, both physically and emotionally. Iâ€™m not transgender but I tried wrapping bandages around my chest to look like a guy but it was uncomfortable and I just looked like a girl with a slightly flat chest. I brainwashed my little brother into becoming some crazed incel, that obviously turned him against me. I let myself be in an abusive relation in which I was slapped and degraded to the point of tears. Youâ€™re probably thinking, this girl is into some kinky stuff but Iâ€™m not, I just thought I deserved it. I hate myself for being like that. I ended up spending time in a psych ward, I still managed to self harm but I wonâ€™t say how because, to be frank, itâ€™s disturbing and I donâ€™t want to give anyone any ideas. I tried hanging out with other sexist creeps but since Iâ€™m a woman that obviously didnâ€™t work, so I basically pretended to be a guy online and validated all the hateful stuff those creeps believed. To be honest, Iâ€™m probably going to be on SSRIs for my entire life and sometimes take Klonopin but I now realize how wrong I was. I was so hurt and humiliated that it kind of drove me into madness. I guess the moral of the story is that people can change. Iâ€™m trying to undo the damaged relationship with my little brother. Me being abused didnâ€™t come out until later because I didnâ€™t have a good relationship with my mother and I was uncomfortable telling my father about it and stuff. Iâ€™m not making excuses, I was wrong, and I feel so bad about it, but Iâ€™ve changed and accepted that it wasnâ€™t my fault, I was an innocent kid. I just wanted to get that off my chest. Also, Iâ€™m not begging for sympathy I just wanted to tell some people.
