An urgent call for assistance.I swear over the graves of my dead great grandparents, I am in a dire situation at the moment, filled with panic. This week has been horrible, and I am feeling worthless. I desperately need to discuss things with someone, or be apprehended by the police.

There's only a *few* problems: I don't own a cellphone, there are currently no telephones in the house, and there is a lack of resources aside from law enforcement in my area.

My life has reached an all-time low and I can't even bust out of my cell just because I don't have the luxury of possessing a damn phone. Wow, thanks a lot, society.

But seriously - I need lots of aid. Stat.
