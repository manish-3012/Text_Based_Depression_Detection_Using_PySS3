please helpI've been feeling pretty upset lately because of my situation at home and at school 

i started cutting my arms and legs again (it's been around 5 years since the last time I did this) and it feels great and offers a good amount of relief

I've been exercising and eating healthy but it doesn't really help. I've talked to professionals in the past but that didn't help either

what worries me most is that the problems I'm having exist as a pattern, the same old situations over and over again, and a lot of catch-22 scenarios that leave me feeling helpless 

that being said I've been seriously considering suicide in the next couple of months via sleeping pill overdose. I've had suicidial feelings since I was a child and I feel like the time has truly come for me to go through with it 

part of me obviously is very scared and doesn't want to pursue this line of thinking, that's why I'm posting here. If anyone has any advice I would truly appreciate it 

thanks for your time
