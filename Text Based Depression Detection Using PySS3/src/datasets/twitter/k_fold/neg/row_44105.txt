Does anyone else feel weaker and weaker by every day?Like I used to think I was strong but Iâ€™m starting to feel weaker and weaker as every day passes, itâ€™s so rough and I donâ€™t know how to cope, Iâ€™m trying my best to keep going and do well in school but itâ€™s just too much I feel like Iâ€™m breaking apart : (.
