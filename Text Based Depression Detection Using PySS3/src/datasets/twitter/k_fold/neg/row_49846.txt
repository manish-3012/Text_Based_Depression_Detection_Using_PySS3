My girlfriend has anxiety problems suicidal thoughts, how can I help her?Hey everyone. So when we got home from last night's party, me and my girlfriend had our usual random drunk honest conversation. I asked her about her on-going anxiety problems and if she still has suicidal thoughts and she said yes but she's 100% sure that she'll never do it because she doesn't want to cause pain to me and her family. 

* She's in her last year of her degree but she doesn't enjoy it. She'll randomly break down when she's studying or doing her dissertation.
* She doesn't have a friend in her classes. Not even someone to have lunch with. So sometimes she skips her classes and says "oh don't worry, it's recorded". But one day she said that she hates sitting alone and people would stare at her because she's alone. 
* She's a foreign student. She only has me and her best friend (she's far away) here. I always tell her that it doesn't matter how many you have as long as you know you can trust them. I'm a very sociable person but I only have 2 friends too.
* If I'm not home with her she always think that she's alone.
* She doesn't know where her suicidal thoughts are coming from. I feel like she does but she just doesn't want to say it. More than likely because of the things I've written above. 
* So last night she say's "Don't worry. I would never do it because I don't want to hurt and burden you or my family." I told her she can't live her life for the sake of someone else. However, when I thought about it while writing this post I sounded very hypocrite. Since my mother passed away, the very main thing that's keeping me going is my 8 year old sister. I want her to be happy and have a bright future.

Before we slept it off, she cried and I said to her that she can always talk to me. I assured her that I'm always here for her but honestly I don't want her to feel this way, that she's alone and I'm just scared that one day she'll do it.
