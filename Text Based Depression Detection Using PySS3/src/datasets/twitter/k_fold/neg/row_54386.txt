Willpower is bullshitI must be so fucking lazy that for no reason at all i broke down during my late teens  and lost all my sense of direction motivation and dignity and now i just wont even get a job and want to get on ssi so i can be lazy.

I done all the healthy bullshit from diet and excersise to nose breathing. I have taken all meds under the sun and have yet to be diagnosed with the things i was supposedly taking the meds for. I therefor am uneligable for disibility. 

We all tell each other to talk to a professional and it gets better but the reason so many people kill themselves is because statements like that make us feel broken when maybe weâ€™re not the problem.

Joker was right that our society treats mentally ill people like garbage.

You here stories of all kinda of neurodivergent people succeeding in life but they all have community to support them.some of us dont feel safe.

Im transgender, autistic, bipolar, adhd and had early childhood trauma, have no resources  and am relying on my abusive narcisistic abusers who completely deny that im disabled and act like im just â€œgoing through somethingâ€ to have my basic needs met right now in exchange for sacrificing my dignity and freedom (im not physically in immediate danger so nothing theyre doing is illegal.)

while too fucked up to use the resources like medicade for free therapy for diagnoses and SSI.

I have been gaslit so hard about my mental health and they act like its willpower.
