depression. darkness. help?ive been quite depressed lately. my mom is growing tired of me. my dad keeps screaming at me. i hate it at home. all i get is silence when i enter home. no 'hi' or 'how was your day?' or 'i love you' etc.  everyone at home is annoyed by my presence. school is my only escape. most people say 'thank god its friday'. i hate being at home. when its monday, my face brightens amd then i get away from home for major of the day. 
im the type of person that keeps getting low grades or failing classes. i put in soo much effort but they seem to think i waste my time reading books and writing. 
their disappointment each time i get low grades hurt me soo damn much. so i have decided to end my life. ill give it a couple of more days to see if things improve. i know they wont, but it doesnt hurt to try. if i still disappoint my parents, then im just going to end my life. its easier than seeing them stare in sympathy mixed with anger at their useless kid...
