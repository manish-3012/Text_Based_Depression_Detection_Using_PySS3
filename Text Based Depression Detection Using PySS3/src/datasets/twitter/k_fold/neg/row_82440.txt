PanickingAll I can think about right now is using the little bit of money I have left to buy a bottle of liquor and using that to wash down all the depression pills I have left this month.  

Last Friday I was supposed to get my paycheck just like I always do every other week.  However last Friday we were told the company can't afford to pay us our full check and is going to give us 25% that day and the rest today.  Well, we come to work today and find out that we're still not getting paid today.  

I have to pay rent today.  I was already barely scraping by, living paycheck to paycheck unable to save anything.  Now I don't even know if I'll be able to eat, much less pay rent.  I don't want to be homeless again.  I'm crying just thinking about it.  I worked so hard to get out of it &amp; now I'm on the verge of homelessness again...
