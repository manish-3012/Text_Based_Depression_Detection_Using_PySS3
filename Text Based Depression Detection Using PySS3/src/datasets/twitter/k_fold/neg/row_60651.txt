Maybe I'm just not good enoughI worked my ass off for this exam and I still messed it up. This exam wasn't important or anything but my parents just care a lot about grades and they're going to be super mad when they find out I got a 75%. I just don't want to disappoint them anymore. I feel like maybe if I just kill myself tonight, it would all end up being okay. There wouldn't be anyone to disappoint them further. They have high expectations from me and I never deliver. It's not like they would miss me or anything. They'd still have my sister. Plus, I wouldn't be a financial burden on them anymore. My overall percentage is 90 but that doesn't make up for my 75. I honestly can't keep doing this. I've disappointed them last term and I've done it again. I did contemplate suicide last time too but I was too much of a coward to go ahead and do it. The anonymity of the internet has once again helped me pen down my thoughts and ideas. Maybe this time, I won't chicken out. I sincerely hope this is the last thing I'll ever post on Reddit. 

Bye :-)
