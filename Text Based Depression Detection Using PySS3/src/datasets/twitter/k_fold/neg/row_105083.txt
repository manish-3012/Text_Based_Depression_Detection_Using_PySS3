HopelessI feel I'm a burden for everybody, I don't currently have a job, it's not that I don't have the studies, cause I do, I went to college and I have some "talents" but the problem is that I cannot get passed job interviews because I'm autistic and people can really tell about my awful social skills, I've considered just removing things from my resume and getting a crappy job like a cashier or a janitor otherwise I'd be overqualified for it, but even then I feel that It would be just easier if I just disappeared, cause I'm just wasting everybody's time one way or another.
