Getting closerI have major depressive disorder. Every so often I have an episode and I can choose to fight it and end it before it gets worse or let it take me over. I basically did the latter with this one. Before this episode happened, at least that's what I remember, my life has already started to come undone.

It feels like everything is breaking at the same time. For weeks now, I've been in a constant struggle. It's just getting worse. I don't get how people live for 70+ years; I'm only in my 30s and wish I would just die.

I keep thinking of killing myself. I own a gun, I keep it loaded under my bed. I live alone though, so no one would even know until the smell got horrible or someone calls the cops if they hear the gunshot. The only thing holding me back at this point is the question everyone has. What happens after I die?

I've used DMT. I've meditated and performed a pilgrimage. Part of me wants to believe there is something afterwards. But there's no proof. Just dying, my conciousness, whatever that is, just turns off? I cease to exist and I don't even know because I'm dead.

I'm trying. I really am. But I've had death pacts before. Giving myself a deadline. If shit didn't change then fuck it all. These days...well I'd say I'm one bad day from blowing my brains out but every day has been a bad day lately.

I guess it's only a matter of when at this point...
