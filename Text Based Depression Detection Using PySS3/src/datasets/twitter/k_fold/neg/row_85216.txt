I feel like I'm still alive only to avoid the pain I would cause my family if I killed myselfLike the title says, every day I feel like I'm getting closer to actually going through with it. My family is in a bit of a mess (without going into details, messy divorce, fighting, the whole ordeal) and I feel like if I did it now it would only add more suffering to everyone, yet I can't seem to shake off this feeling of wanting to die.
I've been having this feelings since I've been a teenager (23 now) and it's only getting stronger lately, I can't seem to get excited for whatever future I may have, it all just seems hopeless. My most recurring thought is wishing I accidentaly died, just to avoid the extra pain if I were to die by suicide
I can't seem to know how to bring it up to my parents or siblings, don't know how to explain my feelings, and honestly don't know if I should, on the fear that they'll lock me up or look at me like im a freak
I'm ashamed of how selfish I feel, but afraid I'll do something
