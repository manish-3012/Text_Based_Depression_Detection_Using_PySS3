Small crisis, I don't think I'll make out of this building today.If I do manage to get myself under control today, I might post again here because suicide has been present more and more in my mind for the last few months.

There are no suicide hotlines that work from where I am, and I'm tired of telling my story because no one believes me anyway. I shouldn't go home tonight at all. my partner is there with my family, waiting for me, I don't want to see them. I don't want to be me, or be here anymore.

A friend of mine tried eloping as an alternative to suicide, he failed miserably and I fear I might as well. I don't have enough money to go on on my own without probably starting to become a sex worker on the way, and honestly... I don't want to be alive anywhere else. I don't want to be alive here even.  I just want to dissolve, and leave nothing but air behind.

I think I should go upstairs to the roof of my office building and just jump. Saves myself having to see their faces again and feel guilty because I can't function.
