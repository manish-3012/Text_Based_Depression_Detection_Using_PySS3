I will do it tonight.I honestly can't take another surgery. Going through the first one made me consider suicide but going through it again is just not possible for me and I can't stand the thought of having another surgery in October. 

I will do it with my heavy pain meds and some of my dads booze, I already have anxiety cause of my first surgery and now getting told that I might have to do another one is not possible for me to live with
