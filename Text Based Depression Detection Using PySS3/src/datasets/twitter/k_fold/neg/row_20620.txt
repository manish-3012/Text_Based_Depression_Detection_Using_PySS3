The effect of someone you idolize throwing in the towel.Perhaps idolize is a strong word, I was not about to throw my man pants on a Linkin Park stage. This whole Chester situation has hit me harder than it should. I enjoy their music and it got me through pretty hard times when I was growing up. When I read the news that he hung himself, it's made me spiral in quite a negative rut. 

I'm always questioning the purpose of my life.. I attempted to off myself in November last year and failed. I resigned my job and moved in with my parents. Since then I've been attempting to live a more positive life. 

(you can skip this part) I use to love the thought of having children. I'm a very loving/caring individual and I thought it would give me meaning and joy.. but over the years that thought has been tainted as I would NEVER want my kids to feel this way. It would destroy me knowing they aren't happy and that there is nothing I can do to help them. 

TL;DR Chester had accomplished more than I ever could. He helped millions of people. He had a family.. six kids and a beautiful wife.. which leads me to the question..

If someone stronger/more accomplished than myself couldn't fight the darkness they felt.. what the hell chance do I have?
