It doesn't get betterThere's a point where you don't care. About anything at all. And you don't even try to care about anyone or anything, not even yourself, it just doesn't matter. But listen, it doesn't get better, you have to make it better. Don't try to get friends or to date someone right now, we're not ready for that yet, let's try really hard to just care. To hang on and live the best we can, because what if there is something afterwards, what if we regret not trying, not caring? It takes a lot a lot of effort, but it's doable. I'll help you, a lot of people here will help you. A lot more are probably going to end up being close to you, because in this community where everyone is so open and so messed up, we don't judge, we just think more than the normal people who just live by. We're afraid to live because it's too much for us, but we can make it a lot better. 
Don't take any decisions yet, try really hard to care before you regret it.
I need someone to talk to, and there's a lot of people here who also need someone. Let's talk.
