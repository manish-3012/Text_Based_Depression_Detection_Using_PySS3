I plan on dying in my boyfriends armsHe's breaking up with me this week. I'm going to ask him if we can spend one more night together. I'll ask if we can split a bottle of wine, drink myself silly, then slip into the bathroom to swallow a handful of my meds. I'll get to fall asleep in peace and with him. I've fantasized about this for a while but now that he's breaking up with me it's urgent and decided. 

I'm scarring him for life but he's the strongest person I know and I'd be a mess without him. I don't want to spend the holidays alone. I don't want to spend my birthday alone. I don't want to have to watch him love someone new someday. I'm struggling to function as it is. I'm going to let my whole family down no matter what, I don't want to be around to watch.
