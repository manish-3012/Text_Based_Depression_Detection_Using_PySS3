Am I in crisis?Changing meds around. Getting off pristiq that Iâ€™ve been on for a year and switched to Wellbutrin, because pristiq did nothing on its own. Added lamictal and itâ€™s given me energy and my anxiety is down. I want to SH, deep. I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t know if I can stop myself. I donâ€™t want anymore scars especially because of work. Iâ€™m a mental health tech working in a group home for teen boys. Either way Iâ€™m going to h*rt myself. I just needed to vent.
