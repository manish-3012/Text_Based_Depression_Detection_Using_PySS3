Am I just iving to make people happy?Am I just living to make people happy. I was talking to some people and they were like â€œsuicide is just selfish because you are making people feel really sadâ€. So am I really only living just so people who donâ€™t really care about me can be happy? I know I cannot really be myself around parents. The only thing that I â€˜haveâ€™ is science but I donâ€™t really. So itâ€™s just expectations. Thatâ€™s all people have of me, high expectations. So I do things to make people happy. Iâ€™m not dead to make people happy. And they arenâ€™t even happy when they talk to me. I can see that they are better without me. So what on earth am I doing? My parents are like â€œyou need to think about other peopleâ€™s feelingsâ€ and I do. Hence why I am actually alive right now, donâ€™t think I will be for long and I am like that â€˜therapist friendâ€™ if you know what I am saying. So I donâ€™t need them telling me so think about it others more. This is all just pointless and Iâ€™m only here to keep others happy. Thank you for listening to me rant about This.
