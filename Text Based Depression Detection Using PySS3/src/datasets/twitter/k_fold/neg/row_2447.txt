I'm so lonely, lost and depressed and I just want it to endHello. I'm a 22 year old college student. I can't shake of the feeling that I'm a big failure, that I've disappointed my friends and family and that things never will get better. I know, logically speaking, that things ain't that bad. It might get better in a while and I know that people don't hate me, but the feeling of that everything sucks has occupied my mind. I've been battling my depression for a long time, but nothing seems to work. I've been exercising, going to a therapist and done all the things that's supposed to help. It's like I'm cursed and I just can't take it anymore.
