What Do I Do?Every day a thought never leaves my mind, "I should kill myself." even when I'm happy and laughing I still just. Don't want to be alive anymore. I don't have any idea why. My antidepressants seem to be working fine, I no longer spend every day with a sense of complete dread. But the days seem to drag on forever and each day, even if I did a bunch of productive things, I feel like I haven't done anything. 

I'm tired. I just don't wanna go on anymore. Sometimes the days can suddenly change from good to deep depression, and I wind up feeling terrible for hours from one minor thing. During one of these episodes, I tried calling a suicide hotline, but she waved me off because I just couldn't think of anything that was bothering me, but I was sobbing like crazy. I don't know what's bothering me so much. I'm just tired of being alive. 

Every time I talk to my boyfriend about how I feel he says it's stupid that I want to kill myself and calls me selfish because I say I just don't wanna go on anymore, even if it means breaking his and everyone who loves me's hearts. 

I have no idea what to do. I know I've got a lot left to live, but I just don't really care, if I could I'd end it all right now. The only reason I've lived this long is because I'm afraid of how much the knives will hurt. 

What do I do? How can I help myself if I don't even know what's wrong?
