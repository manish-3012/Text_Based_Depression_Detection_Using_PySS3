I truly believe no one would actually care if I was goneI really genuinely believe this.

Maybe for a week, give or take. Then everyone would just go back to their lives. Honestly. No one would actually give a fucking shit if I just vanished.

Iâ€™m the least favourite, no ones friend, the loner, the stranger. No one would care.

Iâ€™d just be gone.

And no one would know. Or care.
