i wrote what a felt on my laptop and never againi never once in my life talked about my depression an anxiety and so i just keep it all bottled up inside of me or write it down somewhere whether it be on my laptop or on paper. ive been writing on my diary for years now and my parents havent found it but the one time i decided to write it on my laptop my parents found it. all it said was how ive been feeling so depressed my whole life and i wanted to die but it wasnt a death note or anything it was just me expressing what i was feeling at that time. when my mum found it she screamed. she yelled. she blamed it on me. and told me never to do dumb shit like that again because me "depression" is all in my head and that im just faking it for attention, i feel down because im always on my damn phone. and ever since then once in a while she would bring it up and ask me if i still think about dumb shit like that and i just say no because what better would it do if i tell her the truth.
