I wish that I would never wake up again.I'm so tired. Physically worn out and emotionally exhausted. I don't know if I'm just getting more cynical, or if the world is just an ugly place. I'm tired of playing these games where everyone expects a lot of me, but no one can even acknowledges my existence. I'm tired of being a disappointment. I'm tired of becoming uglier and uglier. I barely sleep at night anyway. It's ok, no one will despair when they find me, if they find.
It'll be ok. Just a few more and I can close my eyes for good.
