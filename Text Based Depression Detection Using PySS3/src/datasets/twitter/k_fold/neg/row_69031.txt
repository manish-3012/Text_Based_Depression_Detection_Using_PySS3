I wish it would get worseI wish my life was worse. Selfish, right? If my life was worse, family trouble, social trouble, more traumatic events, etc, then I would be able to off myself. Compared to many other people, Iâ€™ve got a pretty good life. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore, but I feel so guilty for feeling test way that it prevents me from doing it. I always feel like Iâ€™m making a big deal out of nothing, my trauma wasnâ€™t â€œthat badâ€. It feels like Iâ€™m trying to make excuses to be unhappy.
