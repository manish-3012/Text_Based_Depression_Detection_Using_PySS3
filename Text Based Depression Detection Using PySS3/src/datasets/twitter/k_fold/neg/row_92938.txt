I just wanna stop everything!Have you ever felt like you donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on anymore? 
Like you donâ€™t care about anything anymore.
Youâ€™ve lost your motivations to do anything.
You are confused about your feelings, and you canâ€™t explain how you feel.
You have that feeling of emptiness, and the feeling that no one is there for you. That feeling that no one understands you anymore.
And seems like there is nothing nothing to look forward to anymore.
