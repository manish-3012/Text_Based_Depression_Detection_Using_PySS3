I can't fucking do this anymoreMost of my "friends" hate me because of my personality. I'm too emotional and pathetic. All I wanted was to be nice and make people happy but I'm just a burden. I just want to kill myself constantly and the only reason I haven't is because I don't know quick ways on how to do it. This was probably the first time I tried suicide by hanging and I even failed at that because I'm too much of a moron to tie a noose right with a cabal and I just hurt myself by falling. At this point my existence is just suffering.
