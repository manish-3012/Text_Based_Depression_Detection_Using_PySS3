I want to goLife is the same everyday. I wake and sit in online glass with a glaze of sadness over me. And i spend the rest of the day talking to someone. And we talk about the same thing everyday. I like talking to that person. But i just hate the monotony(i despise this word more than moist). Today i was on the verge of ending it. 
I even wrote an anti-climatic letter. Here is what my letter said: 
" Its not your fault"
                               - by Cyborg with a heart of gold(name retracted)
And here are some rules:
1. Dont tell my friends that I am gone.
2. I dont want a funeral donate my body. 
3. Mom,you wanted me to be happy. This is my first step towards that. 

But when i actually had to do the deed i COULDN'T get myself to do it. I had the blade in my hand,even pressed it on my wrist. It hurt. And i stopped. WHY.DID.I.STOP.
GIVE ME COURAGE TO GO THROUGH WITH IT. 
I CANT LIVE LIKR THIS ANYMORE. JUST.CANT. ITS ALL THE SAME. 
ALL DAYS HAVE AMALGAMATED.
