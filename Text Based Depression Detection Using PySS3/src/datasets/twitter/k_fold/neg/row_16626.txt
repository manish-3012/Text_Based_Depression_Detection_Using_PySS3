My last messageI would've put this on my main account but that's just asking for these people to find out what I'm doing. I'll be using real names so these people can have a chance at getting some closure. This goes out to Ollie, and Katie.

Ollie. You have literally helped me beyond imagination. With my mental health, my identity, my life as a whole. I can't thank you enough. I am absolutely begging you - do not blame yourself. It's not you who is to blame. Life is too much for me at this point. There's too much going on. It's not something I can handle. Again, I cannot thank you enough. You were one of the biggest reasons why I reconsidered. This is not a final goodbye. We'll meet again. I love you. Thank you for all of your support. I would've been dead way sooner than this if it weren't for you.

Katie, hey hun. First of all - do not blame yourself. At all. This isn't your fault. There's nothing anybody could have done. Life is too much for me to handle. I love you. I love you so much. I wouldn't trade you for the world. You, much like Ollie, have given me hope. But again, life got too much. If all life is, is just hurdle after hurdle after fucking hurdle, what's the point? I love you. Say hi to Patch for me. &lt;3
