My dog is probably the one thing keeping me alive.Every time I start crying he comes to comfort me. I love the little guy so much. My boyfriend of five years is breaking up with me (understandably) Iâ€™ve been a complete failure of a partner and in my life for a long time now, jumping from shit job to another, abusing alcohol and drugs, bi polar, major depression, and managed to gain about 90 pounds over the course. He just canâ€™t handle my shit anymore and needs to move on with his life, finishing graduate school and already landed a well paying job and shit I wish him the best. It only makes me feel more worthless. He broke up with me on the 1st of August and gave me till the end of the month to find a place to stay and get all of my stuff. I constantly think of suicide because of all of the stress of what is going on. The only thing keeping me from doing it is my dog, heâ€™s always there. Iâ€™m not hopeful for my future after this, but Iâ€™m going to keep living for now.
