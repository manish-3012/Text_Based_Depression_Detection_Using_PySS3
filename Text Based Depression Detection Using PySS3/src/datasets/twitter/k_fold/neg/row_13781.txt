how to make sure that i don't have any regrets? what should i remember to do before taking my own life?hey, everyone. sorry if this is hard to understand or anything, i'm so drained and am just completely lacking the motivation to type.

basically, i'm a teenager and i've been suicidal for many years now. my mental health is wack, and i'm so unstable that i geniunely could be pushed off the edge at any moment. anything could trigger me at any second and that would be enough for me to end my life.

but i'm also someone who doesn't want to leave anything unfinished, because obviously i know how permanent death is. i don't want to leave my family with any questions, i want to offer closure for them, etc. so i want to make sure i at least have some sort of explanation, or something that can bring them comfort when i'm gone.

what are some things i should ensure before taking my own life? thank you, i hope this makes sense; if you need any more information just ask. i hope you're all doing well, or as best as can be. &lt;3
