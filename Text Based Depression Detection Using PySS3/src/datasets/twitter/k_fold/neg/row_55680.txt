I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m a combat medic with ptsd and Iâ€™ve been dating this girl for a little over three years and today we broke up. I have never felt so horrible in my life and Iâ€™ve been married once and had a kid with another chick but she I thought got me and everything was good ish. Anyways I donâ€™t want to kill myself but I keep leaning towards it. To the point I had my own dad come to my house and take all my guns out of the house (I live in America so GUNZ) I cant help but think about how I always mess things up but this time I donâ€™t even feel like living anymore. She helped me so much to better myself. I quit smoking rarely drink and just all around she has made me acceptable to society. I love her but I know she constantly upset with everything I do. Iâ€™m kinda money hungry and I always am trying to get promoted to better positions. Iâ€™m just glad my dad took my guns. Sorry for the rant guys
