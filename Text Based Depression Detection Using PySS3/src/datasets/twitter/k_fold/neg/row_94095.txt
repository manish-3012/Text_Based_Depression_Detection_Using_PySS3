18 seems to be enoughI got into a shitty American college cause I fucked up high school and here I am in the middle of fucking nowhere, surrounded by idiots, wasting my young years. There's more to the whole issue, like family crap, non mutual love, cold (Illinois is goddamn cold in winter, I miss HK), etc. 
I'm sick of cutting every single time something goes wrong, and there's a lot of things that go wrong. OTC medicines seem ridiculously appealing now. Help?
