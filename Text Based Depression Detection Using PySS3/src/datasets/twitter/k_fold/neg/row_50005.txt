Getting closer to going through with it than I have in awhile.I've asked for help several times in the past month or so on SW. Most of the time, I've been able to punch myself in the face to get it back together or walk home from the train. But tonight I'm especially  scared. You see, it started off with an abstract idea of having a cop shoot me. Or taking pills with alcohol etc. But tonight, almost like a zombie, I laid the pills out on the table, put the bottles on the table and started drinking. Then I put the fake gun on the table and sharpied out the orange on my fake gun. I know it sounds crazy, but it's like I'm on autopilot. I'm scared to call a hotline, because last time they said they were going to send someone over. I've scared if that happens I'll go through with the suicide by cop or just end up in some psych ward in an even worse situation. I'm so confused and scared. Is this zombie feeling normal?
