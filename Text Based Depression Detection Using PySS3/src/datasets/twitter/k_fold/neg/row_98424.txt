I just don't feel like I don't have a purposeI feel like nothing I do matters. I know that I'm there for people a lot, I'm peoples shoulder to cry on, I help people, I give advice, and I just kinda assist them in their passage through life. I do it a lot, sometimes I can't even help it. It's all just so emotionally draining. Every time someone vents to me, it makes me a feel a little bit worse. I know this part doesn't quite tie in with the title, but I still had to say that.

I don't really know where I'm going with life. I can't work, I procrastinate and I just don't do things a lot. It's not that I'm lazy, I love doing things for people. But I just don't think that school matters. I believe at this point I'm just rambling, because I can't quite articulate what I'm trying to get across.

Also, a lot of times I feel like nobody cares about my opinion. Like my words just float away in the wind. And I don't stand behind my opinions either. I'm an absolute fucking pushover, and I want to stop but I can't find a medium of not being a dick and not being too nice. I choose to be nice, but I can't *not* be too nice. I can't deny a favor, can't say no, can't stand up for myself. I just kinda, feel like "if anything too bad ever happens, oh well. I can just tie a rope around my neck and die and that will be the end of my life."
