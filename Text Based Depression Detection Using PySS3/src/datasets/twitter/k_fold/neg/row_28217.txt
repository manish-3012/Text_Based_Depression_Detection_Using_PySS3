i dont knowive had suicidal thoughts on and off for a few years now but ive always been able to ignore them by wasting time on my computer but earlier i heard my family talking about how they regret buying me a computer because it means i spend no time with them which is true i hate spending time with them because theyre not good people and i can often overhear them insulting me but i can always handle the insults but the fact of knowing this is the last computer they will buy me i cant handle and it made me want to write an angry note telling them how much i despise them and then kill myself as the thought of them finding my dead body and a note explaining how its their fault sounds really great to me i know when my computer breaks then i probably will end up killing myself since my computer is the only ounce of joy in my life and i just dont know what to do the only person i know who i could talk to about things like this is much too busy for me and i havent talked to her much in months to add into the fact that i hate real life i have had constantly terrible insomnia and i just woke up at 12 pm after passing out on my keyboard around 6 hours ago
