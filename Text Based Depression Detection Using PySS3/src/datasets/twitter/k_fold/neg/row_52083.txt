Unhealthy fantasy I have to cope with the painEvery night before I go to bed, I pray that I'll wake up transported to the moment before The Bad Times^(tm) started. I give myself two sentences that I would remember when I woke up, two sentences that would fix everything if I would've listened to them \~ 5 years ago. Everything else from the terrible life I've lived would fade away like a bad dream when I woke up. 

At least this way for a half a second each morning when I open my eyes, I am full of hope. Then I realize nothing has changed and the pain returns. 

Anyone else do something similar?
