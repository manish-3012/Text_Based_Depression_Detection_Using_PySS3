Losing self worth. Again.Battling depression since 2013. Thought I finally started recovering and coping. But I'm jobless - university diploma but no experience, no one's hiring me. 
My husband and I fight constantly. Went to bed fighting last night. He fell asleep while I tossed and turned and finally ended up having nightmares about rape events in my past. He wakes me out of my nightmare. I turn to see that I've slept less than 4 hours. As he prepares to go to work we start arguing again. He goes to work. 

Now I'm in bed and so tired. So, so tired of everything. I just want to disappear. 
I can't even go downstairs to take some pills because his parents are staying over here. Like they have been so often the past half year because they're in between houses and our house is closest to all their  appointments and such. I would do anything for family but I can't recover without my own space. I  have severe anxiety which makes any sound or other stimulation crippling at its worst.. 

I feel uncomfortable in my own home. Struggle with my past, feel such a burden. I'm the burden and I just want to disappear.
