I'm going to die soon enough, I just know itI'm finally feeling more and more comfortable with killing myself. I don't know how long it'd take for suffocation to kill me so that's why I didn't do it a few days ago. I'm basically fucking stuck and every small mistake that I make is effecting me even more than usual. Everything is getting to me. I have no useful skills and I can't think well or remember things. I feel guilty for wanting to die but I just can't bring myself to care anymore
