Feeling suicidal over being downvotedYeah, I know itâ€™s lame. 

I was trying to offer support to someone, and I. Got downvoted. 

I made a post yesterday on having a plan to. Omit suicide. I decided not too. The thoughts came back again. 

I have been struggling with whether itâ€™s worth existing. The world is complicated. Being downvoted when youâ€™re trying to help is discouraging and brings up a lot of complex trauma. 

My plan would most likely be to overdose. 

Yes, I know that people shouldnâ€™t be so sensitive and how it may be seen as weak to commit suicide over being downvoted. 

Why not? I donâ€™t care if I cease to exist.  It seems like the United States of America is catered to a very specific type of person. 

Thanks for reading.
