I stumbled upon an email. Iâ€™m devastated.The context of the email isnâ€™t important. It was an email from my mother to someone else where she said â€œIf she were to commit suicide we would have to ask ourselves did we do all that we could?â€. I thought I was hiding it so well. My family knows of my mental problems but I assumed they didnâ€™t know the extent. I feel horrible. When you hear your mom panicking trying to find ways to make you better when you feel like there isnâ€™t anything she can do if crushes you. None of this is her fault. It never has been. I have been bullied sense the age of 3 for a disability. In the past two years I have been sexually harassed three times. Last year I lost my 19yr old cousin who was like a brother to me. I try so hard to be fine. They never asked me to be fine but I still feel guilt. I donâ€™t want my parents to loose their only child and think itâ€™s their fault. I have tried so hard to keep pushing and hide stuff. But knowing that my parents can see through that and think that there could ever be something that they did to contribute to that CRUSHES ME. I know loosing me would crush them. But to know that they understand that Iâ€™m at my brink and that they could loose their only child is devastating. (This might be an exaggeration and might be offensive) but it feels like I have been battling a terminal illnesses and I just found out that my parents know.
