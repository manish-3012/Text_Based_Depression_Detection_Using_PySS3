Things are NOT getting better! Is there a point to continue living?!The Coronavirus, the protests..

..I honestly thought things are getting better. But now, we see violent acts outside our homes. It's so dangerous to go outside right now. My mental health is getting worse, and I'm fearing for my life. 

I don't see a reason to continue on living if the world continues on like this. I feel like it'll get worse. What's the reason to live? 

I wanna die. I can't take this anymore. No one understands the struggles I face mentally. They always tell me to "suck it up" and "things will get better". No, I'm tired. 

I'm tired of living. I'm tired of the bad news in life. 

I wish this is all a bad dream, but this is reality. I'm contemplating in going to a riot just to get hurt and die. 

Kill me now.
