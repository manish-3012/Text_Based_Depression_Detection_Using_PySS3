I have nothing to live for.All my life I got used. Used by people. I did tons of fucked up stuff which I can't forgive myself for. It's gonna come back to haunt me in my future career. I tried apologizing to people but a lot won't apologize to me and still hate me. I barely have any friends because of my social anxiety. People are against me. They say I'm annoying and clingy. People seem to laugh at me, they want to see me fail. I have mood swings, I feel like everyone has an awesome life, while I'm there suffering. I feel like the only way to fix everything is to no longer exist.
