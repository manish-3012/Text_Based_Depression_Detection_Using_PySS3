I dont enjoy lifeI am 25 years old and I hate life. Iâ€™ve been through suicidal phases as a teenager but growing up I stopped thinking about suicide as a solution. I dont want to be alive and have to cope with this bullshit. I am exhausted. I want to rest... I desperately need to rest. Every single day is a struggle. I dont believe that I will ever be happy. Life scares me. It is the most disgusting thing to breathe in a world full of pain. What am I supposed to do? How can I enjoy life when everything seems to be so painful? I dont want to kill myself but I dont want to live either.
