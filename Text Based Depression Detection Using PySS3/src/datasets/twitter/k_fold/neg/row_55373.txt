Should I tell someoneIâ€™m 16 years old, Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship, and I donâ€™t have a lot of friends. Iâ€™ve never really told anyone about this, but Iâ€™ve been a lot thinking about suicide for probably the past year. I donâ€™t intend to go through with it, but I usually consider it a few times a day, even consider how and when I might go about it. Most of the time itâ€™s off and on, but this last week has rough. Itâ€™s been getting harder to talk to my friends, and I feel like Iâ€™m not trying as hard as I usually do in school. I donâ€™t want to tell my parents about it, I think theyâ€™d be disappointed, and it would only cause more family issues. I remember when I was little they made me promise to tell them if was ever thinking about killing myself.  I also have some scary thoughts sometimes about what I might do to other people, and itâ€™s usually pretty impulsive. Iâ€™m afraid that if I talk to a professional Iâ€™ll get sent to a mental hospital. I donâ€™t know what to do.  If youâ€™re someone who knows a lot about this, Iâ€™d like your opinion on what I should do.
