Cutting myself has become a habitI bought a knife set (to cut fruits, as my parents believe) for my dorm room in uni and I started cutting myself last year one day when I was drunk. From there things have escalated to a point where I can't go longer than a week without cutting myself. And at this point, it actually feels exhilarating and relaxing, like good music ; and I've started using it as a tactic to stay awake to study or just get a laugh. (I laugh when I'm in pain, idk don't ask) or that brief adrenaline rush. 

Not for attention mind you, haven't touched my wrists or anywhere the scars might get spotted but I've started considering my neck. How do I stop? I'd like to cease now before I mess up. (I mean an accidental death would be great and all, but not like this)
