Relationships make me suicidalI know, weird title. Let me explain.

So whenever I make a new sort of â€˜relationshipâ€™ with someone (god knows how) I usually get really depressed. Why?

- I get anxious over what I want out of a relationship, and if they feel the same way 
- repeatedly stress over if they are gay/bi (Iâ€™m bi)
- ultimately get depressed because of previous anxieties and fuck ups
- Give up trying to maintain contact. 
- feel suicidal 

Repeat. Endlessly. For the past 5 years of my life. It never gets better. I have fucking tried so hard to make something work, or to be special, and it always ends in pieces because I fuck it up somehow. Iâ€™ve become numb to making new friends and trying to get to know people better, always initiating friendships, Iâ€™m so tired of it all.

Its great to have online friends but that just makes my need for physical relationships even more apparent. Iâ€™m thankful for my online friends but ultimately they canâ€™t replace real human contact and connection. Itâ€™s been so long since I felt a genuine connection to somebody and I long for someone to be a light in my life.

there are people I know that could be; but ultimately their presence in my life just makes it more depressing. Theyâ€™re always people with tones of friends and popularity whilst Iâ€™m happy to even be an acquaintance of theirs.

I met one of these people again today. I knew it was a bad idea. All the old feelings of them resurfaced  (it had been 8 months since we last saw each other) and all these depressing feelings have come crashing down onto me despite the fact that the time I spent with them today was the best time Iâ€™ve had in months. 

Despite all this, I regret it. Having friends who are so nice makes it so much easier to realise my own flaws and how much their life contrasts mine - theyâ€™re extroverted, Iâ€™m introverted.

Itâ€™s an endless cycle that I donâ€™t have the energy to continue or care about anymore. I have no idea where to even start if I wanted to communicate this to anyone I know personally. 

The isolation is killing me
