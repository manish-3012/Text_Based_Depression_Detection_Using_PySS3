So Much up and downA week ago I was here, now this week I'm full of confidence again, feeling like the best I know I can be from time to time.

It's awkward, how do you explain the extreme ups and down? 

 Anyone else feel that way?  Like know their good at whatever they put their mind to, any job.

Then a single wrong from the wrong person, and your back in the hole in a few minutes time.
