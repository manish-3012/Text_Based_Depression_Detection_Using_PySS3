A family member has given up, advice needed.So I'm at my wits end here, long story short 9 years ago my wifes mother went nuts and ran off to a different state with one of her daughters.  Fast forward to this past couple years and her daughter has gone off the deep end, she was suicidal about 6 months ago after deciding she wanted to drop out of College. What prompted me to seek advice here was a conversation I just had with her a little while ago regarding life, I'll list it as simplified bullet points here:

- She has no plans for the future

- Is on various sleeping meds, anti depressents, and who knows what else. The last time we saw her pills she had a gigantic bag of them.

- Is scared of relationships though shes never had one

- Never wants her own place

- Plans to spend the next 40 years doing nothing but devoting every waking moment to her mother

So essentially she seems to be completely brainwashed and has given up on ever having a life, is there anything we can do for her at this point outside of sitting back and letting her life fall apart before our eyes?
