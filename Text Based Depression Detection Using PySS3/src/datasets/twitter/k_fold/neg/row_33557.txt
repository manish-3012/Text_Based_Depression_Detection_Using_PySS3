Really just looking for some supportMy husband has had strange seizure-like spells in the middle of the night for the last year, every 3-6 months, still not sure what the cause is after multiple doctors appointments. He's been fine afterwards but they're terrifying when they happen. I sense one coming tonight and I'm having so much trouble dealing with it. Really, I can't handle it right now. My heart is pounding out of my chest, I feel like I'm dying just from the worry that it's going to happen and I'll be all alone. So alone. He's my support in life, he cures my anxiety when I'm with him but only when he's conscious.  Not when he's limp or twitching with his eyes rolled back in his head. I have no one else for support in this. No one gets it, I need to grow up. I'm just looking for someone to ride it out with, even just on spirit.
