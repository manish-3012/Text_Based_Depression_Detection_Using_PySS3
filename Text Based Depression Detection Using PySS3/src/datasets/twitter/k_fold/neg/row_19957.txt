I am an abomination and curseI am literally an abomination and a curse on my family, I was always ugly and fat my whole life, even when I starved my weight didnâ€™t drop enough, I was born cursed and I feel like I should have been put down out of my misery. My genes are low quality, my iq is low, I have 0 talent, I look ugly and I am fat, if I could I would torture myself in the worst way possible because all I do is fuck up everything and no one loves me and wants me alive. Canâ€™t wait when I hang myself for my parents to throw a huge party and then throw me into a trash can I am not deserving even of a funereal or a grave. I hate myself so much itâ€™s so bad, I wish I were never born, my biggest wish is to get cancer or any other dangerous illness.
