I don't want to live anymore.I'm not going to go on a rant. I'm not going to write a poem. I've genuinely lost the will to live and negotiating with me or trying to find the metaphorical reason for my suffering won't change how I feel. All I can do now is live my life until I pass away, no matter how much it hurts.
