What do I do when I've tried everything?Theres literally no where left for me. Nothing left for me to do. I've tried everything in my power to make myself better. But I can't. It's just not going to happen. I've known for a long time death is my only way out and I've tried to act on it so many times but this time it's going to work, I'm going to make it work, I'm going to die
