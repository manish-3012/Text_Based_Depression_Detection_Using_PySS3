Is there really a point in continuing to live if I feel I will never contribute anything significant to the world, much less my own community?It's comparable to a faulty cell killing itself for the greater good of the entire organism.

I'm dealthy afraid of being a failure to the point of me not wanting to fail before I even get the chance to. I'm not too sure if I'm fit for the things I dream of doing and if I can't achieve those dreams, there's no point in continuing to draw support from my family and friends for no net gain.
