the most amazing girl Iâ€™ve met is falling out of love with me and I donâ€™t know what to do...we met, everything was great. she had to move. she said we could make it work. everything was good for a couple of months. sheâ€™s texting me less and going out more. sheâ€™s doesnâ€™t love me the same any more. 

if she leaves then I have no one.

i might as well end it all.
