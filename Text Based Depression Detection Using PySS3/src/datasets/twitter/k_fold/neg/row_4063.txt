I'm not depressedI feel like I want to die but my life isn't bad.  I don't really feel the need to be alive though. I can't get this image of going to the kitchen slamming a knife into my skull and being done with life because nothing can stop me. Life just seems unnecessary to me and I don't really see much point in finishing it when it'll end anyway. I don't care who I influence I don't care who I hurt. Could die today or tomorrow and I wouldn't even see it coming so why wait ya know. Idrk what I'll do I just cant stop thinking or the urge. It just makes so much sense!

Edit: OK starting to panic I feel this is getting real... I really feel like I need an answer to something but I don't know what.
