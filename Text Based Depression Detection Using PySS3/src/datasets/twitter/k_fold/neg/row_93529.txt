I deserve it.This past year has been rough. I made a lot of friends and lost nearly all of them, one after another, for reasons ranging from disagreements about politics to someone legitimately trying to manipulate my friends into dumping me because they thought I was making everyone else depressed. Ever since then, that person has been stalking me. Another person also started stalking me after they decided to end our friendship, because I was "being too nice" to other people, and he thought it was fake of me. I've lost other friends, countless friends, throughout the years, and these aren't the ones that have hurt the most, but they're more in a string of bad endings to friendships that always seem to be my fault. So I've been thinking I must deserve it. 

I got up today thinking about ending my life, and that's all I've been able to think about, all day long. My family would get over it. My friends would find new friends, if they haven't already. The people who live to torment me will probably be pleased as pie. Everyone can just go on without me and it'll be fine. 

The only thing stopping me right now is cowardice, but I'm seriously afraid that will eventually run out.
