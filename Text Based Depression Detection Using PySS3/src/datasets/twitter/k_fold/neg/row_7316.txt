I'm so sick of being aliveI hate being alive and I don't feel like that's something anyone or anything can change. I'm so lost and while I don't think about actually killing myself as much as I used to, I want to die and obsessively think about cutting and otherwise hurting myself. The highs are so good, but they are so damn few and far between and right now I'm drowning in the lows. I can't take this life anymore.
