being the "fat girl" has made me suicidalhello ya'll.

I've been fat for my entire life, and to make matters worse not only am I fat but I am tall as well (6') so I am a huge beast both vertically and horizontally. I am in my late 20's and have gone through my entire life like this. I get treated like I am invisible all of the time, my friends (I only have two of them, both lovely girls inside and out) usually want me to go out with them but when I do I usually end up just watching their stuff while their out at on the dancefloor dancing with guys. The only time my presence is acknowledged anywhere is when people are making fun of me .  I have only dated once and it was with a guy who would call me a fatass all the time and would tell me how I was lucky he chose me because he could date any girl. That ended when he broke up w/ me though. After that I haven't  really bothered with dating because I know I am not the caliber of girl any man would want to be with. With all of that said, I recognize it is important for me to lose weight (I am 220 pounds, which is bad) so I can be healthy &amp; I have been trying. I recently became a vegan (more for ethical reasons) and I started a gym membership even though I am terrified people will make fun of me or something. I am 2 weeks in but for some reason just feel hopeless, I think I figured out i am just a bullshit person all around and I make no contributions to the world so the world is better off without me. I have a job I dislike, I mainly spend freetime playing video games or fucking around on python or doing stupid cinematography projects that are a waste of time probably, and that is it. I rarely go out w/ my friends anymore so we're not as close as we were. Basically everything would just be better if I wasn't around anymore. Maybe if I'm lucky reincarnation is a thing and I can come back as beautiful, until then I wish anyone suffering the tranquility in life that I just wasn't able to attain.
