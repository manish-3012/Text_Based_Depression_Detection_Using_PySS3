Will I ever be happyI mean truly happy. Not just short bursts of laughter from the funny dog video I saw. But actually happy. What does that feel like. Why don't I remember. I want to die. I just want to die. Why haven't I. I don't want to kill myself I'm to scared to. I just wish I was dead. Nothings worth it anymore. Who the fuck cares anyways. What impact would I have if I died. Or even if I stayed alive what would that change. I want to die. I'm trying not to cry and wake anyone up. No one would care anyways. Please please I just want it to stop please why am I still alive.
