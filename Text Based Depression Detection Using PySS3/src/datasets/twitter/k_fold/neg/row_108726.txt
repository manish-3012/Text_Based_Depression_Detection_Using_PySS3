Pooh, Piglet, and EeyoreThere's this thing that circles around my feed every once in a while, about how Eeyore is feeling low so he stays at his house instead of going out with Pooh and Piglet, so Pooh and Piglet go to his house, where Eeyore says he's not been hanging around with them because he's sad and low and not much fun to be around. So then Pooh and Piglet sit next to Eeyore and don't say anything, they just lend him their presence, with love and without judgment. And then, although he doesn't feel better, he \*does\* feel better.

I've got people like that, people who have straight up offered just to sit with me, who don't care how low I am or how un-fun I am to be with, they just love me. But the thing is, the thought of having someone just sit with me while I am dying inside -- I mean, I seriously can't even bear it. As much as I would be willing to do that for someone else, I simply cannot accept being on the receiving end of it.

What is that? It would be such a comfort to be so wholly accepted, to be so free of expectations and disappointment and pressure; but I can't even imagine it without spinning out.

Anyway. This post brought to you by Sleeplessness. G'night.
