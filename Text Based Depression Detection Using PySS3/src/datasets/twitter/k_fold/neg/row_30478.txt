My brother killed himself two years ago today.I wish I could say it gets better, but I still miss him as much as ever, and I'm still horrified by the way he left us. July 4th was always his favorite holiday, it was his girlfriend's birthday, and the birthday of our closest cousin. Now this is just another difficult day to get through. 

I love you bro, wish you were here.
