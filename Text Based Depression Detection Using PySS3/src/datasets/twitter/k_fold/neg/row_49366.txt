I am giving up..(please don't judge my actions)I attempted in December 2013 at school, was found by a rude janitor  and teacher, then the nurse treated me like shit. Anyway, fast forward to now, I feel like complete shit. No one can help me anymore, it is pointless. My PTSD has been really acting up. I had an abortion last year in March to, I couldnt take care of it, I am too young and my boyfriend had dreams. An abortion, at 16. And of course the protesters outside made me feel worse. that day just keeps replaying in my mind. Maybe I made a mistake. No one ever wants to get one. I am pro-choice but it will always mess someone up. Also, my teacher has been treating me like shit for no reason. Ignoring me, yelling at me for not doing something properly. She even rolled her eyes at me because I called her out on her bullshit. My arms cant be destroyed anymore than they already are. MY anxiety has kept me up for so long, and when I finally dream, it is so vivid that it causes anxiety. OH and I was given a 1 to 2 week notice about my dad's ex wife moving back in "because she can", she will be renting out the basement, which is my storage space that I have to clear out now. She is honestly the reason for a lot of my anxiety issues and depression. I hate her guts. Plus my dad promised me that I would never have to see her again. He doesnt seen to even care about that. I also feel so bad because my boyfriend has been doing everything he can to make me feel better and it just isnt working. Also, I am pan but I think I am more attracted to women, I cant tell my boyfriend that. NO one seems to be helping me anymore, nothing seem to work. Just cutting and drugs. I think it is time to give up..
