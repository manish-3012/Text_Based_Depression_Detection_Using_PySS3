I hate myself so much I donâ€™t even feel it anymoreI hate myself so much I donâ€™t want help because I donâ€™t deserve it.

I hate myself so much I donâ€™t even want to end it all because I deserve to be stuck in this seemingly endless cycle of self-loathe.

I donâ€™t deserve to be happy.

I donâ€™t deserve to be given help.

I fucking hate myself and I canâ€™t stop.

I feel so empty because every night ends with hours of painful recaps of everything Iâ€™ve fucked up, every mistake Iâ€™ve made painstakingly replayed in my head so I can once again feel self-hatred.

Hell, I donâ€™t even feel the self-hatred anymore, itâ€™s just overwhelming emptiness.

I canâ€™t even end my life I canâ€™t even do anything Iâ€™m just stuck.

I have so much love for everyone but myself.

I canâ€™t force myself to love myself no matter what I do. 

I canâ€™t force myself to get help for my obvious problems because my mistakes tell me that I donâ€™t fucking deserve it, I should just suffer.
