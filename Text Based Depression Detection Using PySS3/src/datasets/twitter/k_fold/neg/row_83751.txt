Dont know what else to do.. help ASAP..I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for about 2 years and I just started getting prescribed to : xannax, k-pins, and Adderral, along with some anti depressants. This week has been bad , I have been taking about 70 mg of adderral in the morning and some mornings 4-5 mg of Xannax. This has been going on for the past 2 weeks. I dont know what to do, i feel like its the only cure. I dont know what to do anymore..... [Edit: im 17]
