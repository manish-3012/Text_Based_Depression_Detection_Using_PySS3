I'm fucking sick of this painful cycleEvery day I seem to try to jump through the same hoop. Day in and day out  without change. I just want everything to end. I decided to go to college out of state to get away from my family which keep giving me the same three lines of encouragement I give myself just to crawl through each day. As it turns out, to  no ones surprise, the cost of tuition for me out of state is such a large emotional burden I've wasted $27k just to make it here. Now that midterms are over, the odds of me getting my GPA back up to where it once was are reduced to null and this just adds more to my emotional burden. I'm trying to get in with the schools psychological services but it's proving to take weeks, my meds aren't doing the trick, and I can't get ahold of my doctor and I've been trying for 3 weeks. I'm just tired and disconnected from my courses and I just want to end it. I can't even sit down to read my book without wanting to fucking slit my throat or be the  books next victim. I want to withdrawal from school but that will also take a mental toll of having the shame of going back to my fucking family and still have thousands in debt. I don't know what to do and I just want to curl up in a ball and be done.
