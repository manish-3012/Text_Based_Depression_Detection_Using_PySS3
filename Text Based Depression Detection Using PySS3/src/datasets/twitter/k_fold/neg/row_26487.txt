I'm really tiredI go from day to day; doing my job, talking to my friends, and my girlfriend. I wake up. I eat sometimes. I go to sleep. The weeks pass by, and then months. I don't want to do interesting things. I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to get up or do anything at all.

I've been through depression, and this looks like it, but doesn't quite match up with it.

I'm tired of going on. The only reason why I choose to go on is because my parents, my little sister, and my girlfriend will be sad if I stop living. But they will (at least my gf will) move on. It's fine.

There was a time when I was afraid of deathâ€”apprehensive about what the world would be like, what the people I cared about would be like after I died. I no longer care about that.

So, in summation, yeah. I don't know why I'm living any more.

I can't talk to my girlfriend about this because she's depressed, alone in a far away country, and needs my support. She's in much worse shape than I am. Held together by a thread. She can't help me.

I can't talk to my mother because she has seen me at my worst, and she will probably freak out if I tell her what's going on. I don't want her help. Too much trouble.

What's the easiest and most peaceful way to stop living? :)

Thanks

**Addendum**:

It feels like my post was incomplete. I have a dream job, but I don't want to do it any more. I have a great girlfriend, but I don't want to care any more. I love food, but I don't want to eat any more. There is nothing interesting happening in my life. Nothing that gives me happiness.

I know I'm privileged. I know I should be happy. I just am not, and I'm tired of trying.

Come to think of it, I don't really understand why I'm feeling the way I am. When I think of the future, I feel despair and a feeling of wanting it to not come. I don't get it.
