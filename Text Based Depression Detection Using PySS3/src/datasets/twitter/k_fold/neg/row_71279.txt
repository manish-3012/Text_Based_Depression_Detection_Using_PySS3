What's the quickest way?I'm an 18 year old who just graduated, got dumped, can't eat and keep trying to overdose on my own antidepressants. I was just given another kind of antidepressant along with upping my previous one. I've been referred to cognitive therapy, mental health, and a psychologist. This all just won't work for me. I feel hopeless and objectified, alone. I've felt hopeless for 7 years since I was diagnosed when my parents had a rough patch and it never ended. So I ask:
What's the quickest and most painless way to end my life?
