I will kill myself soonI have written my suicide note and my goodbyes inside it. I can't live for much longer. I cut myself with a dull pair of scissors. I had to press down pretty hard to peirce my skin but after that it wasn't so bad. I never really knew how thick your skin could be. It's kind of like rubber.

Watching the blood come out of my arm was nice. It made me realize that I can do this. There is a very sharp knife in my kitchen that I can use to cut along the length of my forearm. Once I cut myself I just have to wait to die and there won't be any turning back.

I'm making this post to thank the positive commenters on my other post. You are good people. I wish you the best wherever you find yourselves in life. Positivity cannot change the fact that I am not enough.

Thanks for reading and trying to help. For a little bit, I didn't feel alone.
