Il scared to commit suicide because I know nobody will careDonâ€™t worry, I donâ€™t want to kill myself (I mean Iâ€™m not going to, and I donâ€™t have any plans) but I want people to care that I die, thatâ€™s more of how I feel. I need to know people care about me. Thatâ€™s it. Is this common? My therapist says itâ€™s normal and I can work to make it better. I just kinda need reassurance Iâ€™m not the only one. But please be honestly though
