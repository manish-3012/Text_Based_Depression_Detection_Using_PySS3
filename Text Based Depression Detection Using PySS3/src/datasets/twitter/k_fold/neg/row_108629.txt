Never improvingSince I was 13 Iâ€™ve wanted to just jump off a bridge. I have had no improvements, no significant other, My dreams are as far as when I started and I canâ€™t find a reason to live. Iâ€™m thousands of dollars in debt at 19 and I just started a new job thatâ€™s 100% commission so I still havenâ€™t made anything. Itâ€™s just proving to me that I have nothing to live for. Iâ€™ve failed as a son, a salesman, a musician. everything I love, I suck at. Theres just no reason to keep going but I canâ€™t stop. I canâ€™t just pass my pain on to someone else. Hopefully I donâ€™t have to kill myself. I hope I just die randomly and people wonâ€™t care. Iâ€™m tired of living, nothing is worth being here anymore. Sorry for the run on sentences I am just venting before I go to bed. I hope tomorrow is better.
