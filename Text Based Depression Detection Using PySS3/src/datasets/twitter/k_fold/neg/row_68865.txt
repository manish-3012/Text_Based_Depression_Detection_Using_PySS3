Thoughts on my situation?Now, I'm pretty sure typing this out is stupid of me, but I might as well give it a try. See, I don't think I'm depressed, although, I definitely am suicidal, as I had multiple shots at suicide attempts in the past, but as you can see it didn't work out for me just yet, and I've given up lately until my will to do it builds up over the course of multiple months, and I attempt it yet again due to a burst of negative emotion.

Told my family, they always forget, think I'm making shit up to get their attention, do nothing next. Was in therapy, it didn't help. I don't know why, but I just can't seem to derive satisfaction from the thought of possessing a "bright future," how people like to call it. A good job, a family, wealth, or something similar. It's just, I don't even want a partner, I'm not interested in sexual experience. The only satisfactory thing in my life, or you could say, "outside" of it, seems to be the belief an afterlife exists, a delusional belief of being happier, more entertained, *satisfied* if I'd die. It's odd, I acknowledge it as being wrong, but alas, I just crave for it. What should I do, even? Might as well ask, since it doesn't hurt me, and it might even help me if something's convincing, but it probably won't change the fact I'm going to attempt suicide in one way or another in the near future, yet again, this time in a more effective manner than before, until it brings upon my end.

Thank you for responding, if you will. Anything's welcome, be it harsh or not, because I'm not an emotionally unstable person, just a suicidal, "unsatisfied" person.
