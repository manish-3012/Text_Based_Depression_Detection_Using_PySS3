I couldn't do itI'm 18 and I'm college at a decent school. I always had plans for my life. I wanted to graduate college and become a commercial airline pilot and marry the only girl I've ever loved. Well my grades had been terrible because I just don't have the motivation to try as hard as a i used to, it's like I don't even care anymore. I figured I would figure it all out and it would be okay. The only thing that made me happy in my life is when I was with my girlfriend and making her happy is what gave me the little motivation that I had. She decided to leave me and she's now back with her old boyfriend and other than a couple of my friends I have no reason to live now. But anyways, I was sitting in my room thinking about killing myself and I grabbed my belt and put it around my neck and shut it in the door I leaned forwards and I started to pass out and it was like a natural reaction to just reach back and open the door stopping myself from dying. How can I just get it over with?
