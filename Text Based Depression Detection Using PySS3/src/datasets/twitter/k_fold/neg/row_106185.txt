I'm not selfish for wanting this all to endI don't open up about my mental health often, but when I do people act like I'm the selfish one for being suicidal even though they're the ones forcing me to stay. It's like they care enough to tell me not to kill myself but not enough to give me a reason to live.

My mom never cared that I was being emotionally abused, for example, but when I tried to kill myself in high school she made a show out of acting sad and hurt by it. She then tried to make me appologize to my family for the trouble I caused them the day I got out of the hospital.

It's because she doesn't actually care, she feels guilty about not caring at all so she overcompensates by acting like my wellbeing is her only concern.

And I'm the selfish one? Fuck that. I just wanna die, it's their problem if they want me to stick around and be miserable all the time.
