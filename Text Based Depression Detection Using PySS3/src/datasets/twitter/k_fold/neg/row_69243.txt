Are suicide hotlines and text lines only for people who are about to self harm?Ive had days where I really needed someone to talk to to get very strong suicidal thoughts out of my head but I never actually put myself in danger. I'd be afraid to call or text wasting time from someone who'd actually need it and is in the verge of self harm
