DesperateAfter fighting depressing and suicidal thoughts for years, I've started to break. Its exhausting trying to look okay and trying to force myself to feel okay. I've gone almost numb, which is terrifying. I want to get better, but I can't see it getting better. I've been getting worse, cutting my wrist to the point where I'm just ripping open old scabs and scars. I've gotten rid of my razors, giving them to friends so they can get rid of them and also keep an eye in me, but I'm giving up. 

I've started starving myself, not eating so that I can lose weight to be skinnier, even though I know that 110 lbs isn't healthy for a 5'5" teenage girl. 

Years of being told I'm not good enough, not smart enough, or not pretty enough by my older sister is killing me. Its been so ingrained into my mind that I'm worthless and don't deserve anything good have made compliments feel like absolute lies. I feel worse about myself after. Being ignored, resented and verbally abused by someone you're supposed to look up to breaks you faster than anything else. 

I'm the 'loud, happy and positive' one of my friends, but I'm really not. I don't want to let them down. I don't want to let my friends who've helped keep me alive for so long down, but I know I'm going to. I know how disappointed my friend is evrytime I give him more razors, every time he checks my wrist. I know they're getting sick of me being so pessimistic about myself and refuting their compliments. I know they're getting tired if dealing with me, they have better things to be doing. 
I'm only a sophomore in high school, but I don't want to go on. I don't have the motivation to study, to do well on my exams, to actually try. I know I won't be able to get into a good college with Bs, and I only look worse due to my sisters academic success. 
I can't keep doing this, so I'm coming here. I need help, in either staying alive or killing myself.
