I've passed the point of no return ...so, I read this sub often.  I've had suicidal thoughts for many years.  I suffer with chronic pain, PTSD, feelings of inadequacy and a less than successful career.  My boyfriend of 2.5 years just left for grad school and I can't go with him.  I've got some serious legal issues, business is failing, not close to my family.  All I have anymore is my dogs and I will find them a good home before I go.  The process is nearly complete and I will finally be free from the pain after 20 years.  I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, I'm just making it public.  Tick tock, tick tock
