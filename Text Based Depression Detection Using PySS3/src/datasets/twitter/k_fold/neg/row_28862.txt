Is it selfish to continue living?You know that clichÃ© of "would the world be better without me"?

the answer is typically, no it wouldn't be any better without you than with you

but what if it was? what if i'm a genuinely bad person who is harmful to those around him?

is it selfish to continue living as a person who has the potential to do very shitty things to others?
