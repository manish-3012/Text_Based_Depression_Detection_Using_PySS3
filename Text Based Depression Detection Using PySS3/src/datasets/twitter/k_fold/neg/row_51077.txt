I have been suicidal recently Hi everyone! I have tried twice recently to commit suicide and both attempts have not worked. I was diagnosed with depression earlier today and I have been given pills to help with the depressing thoughts to help me sleep etc. I tried to kill myself because I have no friends, my family dont want me around, nobody in general wants me. I cant find work despite having diplomas. The so called "friends" I have one of them always laughs at me for asking questions that he thinks are stupid and funny. My dad is in hospital and when I go to the family resthome ( we own resthomes here in my town ) to offer a ride to some staff to hospital, I get laughed at by them for wanting to see dad. There response was and I quote "\*insert laugh here\* Oh we don't care about your personal life. Just stfu and drive!." Its because of those responses I dont go to the resthome to help out anymore. It hurts being around those people and if I do go back it makes me look weak if I do go back. My dad is in the hospital right now going through round 2 of his chemo battle. He has terminal Lukemia and has less than 90 days to live, this chemo has a 10% chance of working so thats why he is in hospital trying. If he was to die I would probably follow suit soon
