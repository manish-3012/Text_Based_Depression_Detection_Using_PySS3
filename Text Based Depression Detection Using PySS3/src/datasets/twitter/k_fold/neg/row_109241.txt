I feel like this is pointlessI was born in 2005, im male, and I was born in Las Vegas Nevada. my father an addict who spent
t most of my life in jail, my mother a failure who hated the mistake I was. I was abused, raped tortured, and beaten by my mom's many boyfriends for as long as I remember then at 12 and 13 my mom got into drugs so the abuse got even worse. By this time I had 2 siblings who I tried to help but I couldn't save them from the same abuse I suffered.

 Then at 13, with a glimmer of hope, I went to live with my grandmother and father in Illinois. My father was abusive and intent on killing me or beating me until I understood exactly why I was being beaten. Wish I could have died then.

 This went on until I was 15, I got another chance, my mom's parents offered to help me, to make sure I could be ok, and so far I've failed them. I argue a lot I can't follow rules I continuously lie I do bad at school I don't help out I suck at chores I don't know how to help with stuff and I can't be normal.
This leads to the present, now. 

I can't get any mental support, it's too expensive with covid. And I need meds. I refuse to do drugs like my mom but I need something to keep me from slitting my throat. It hurts to be alive I need help. I just want the pain to stop. Even now with a decent family, I can't stop thinking about the past, and not a minute goes by without me feeling as if im being beaten within an inch of my life even though im physically fine.

I won't ever be normal, I have no interest in life, I have zero friends, my grandparents have even grown to hate me as well. I think this is the end huh. I've wanted to die since 6 years old and I may finally be able to rest now. 
I've promised myself a week. I'm giving myself a week.
If I find a reason to live, even if it's just a show I like or something I want to do when im older, it would still be more than I've had all my life.
If this post is a week old and I haven't replied then im sorry. At least some of you inspired me to live this long. 
Thanks, Reddit you've done more for me than anyone ever has.
