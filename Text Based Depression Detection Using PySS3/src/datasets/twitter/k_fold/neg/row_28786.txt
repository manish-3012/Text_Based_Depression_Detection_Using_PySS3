[TW: Suicide, eating disorders, substance abuse] I don't want this any longerI'm at my fucking breaking point, I don't know what to do.

I can't eat. Sometimes 3 days pass without me eating. I'm sitting there, my stomach twisting and hurting because I'm so fucking hungry. I try to eat and need to concentrate real hard on not puking.

I haven't eaten in 2 days now.

Cannabis used to help with that. I used to be able to eat after smoking, but now? Nothing.

Every damn night I have to numb my self with whatever substances I have available so I don't try to kill myself that night.

I can't take it any longer. I don't want to take it any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm broken.
