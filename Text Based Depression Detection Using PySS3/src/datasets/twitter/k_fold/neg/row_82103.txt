Thinking of ending things(Iran)Iâ€™m 20.male.living in iran.my parents are idiot losers who arenâ€™t going anywhere in life                               
Things just havenâ€™t been looking good for us financially as long as i remember(at least in the last 15 years)                                                              Iâ€™m actually a dentistry student so i for myself can have some hope towards future                                                         But at this moment i just wanna die                                                         My girlfriend is the best girl in the world and iâ€™m ashamed that i canâ€™t even afford a car to give her rides.The worst thing is that i always act like i come from a rich family so she doesnâ€™t really know my situation                                                                                                              Iâ€™m feeling kind of isolated because i have no car or i donâ€™t even have my own place                                                           I donâ€™t wanna blame others for my problems but really this isnâ€™t my fault                                                          At least in this country,this is how it works.Iran is financially ruined by itâ€™s hypocrite government and itâ€™s very very hard to even have your own place if your family arenâ€™t rich                                                          
I love my girlfriend.I donâ€™t wanna lose her.sometimes i say to myself that lets just breakup with her and focus on my studies so at least i have a bright future for myself.But really it just hurts me to lose her                                                         
And by the way,living in one of the worst countries of the world doesnâ€™t help either.
I just say to myself:Die and all this embarrassment will be over.Itâ€™ll feel like youâ€™re asleep
