How do I let people know how to find my body?I am shooting myself in the head, so I don't want my family being the ones to find my body, as that would most likely not be a pleasurable experience. I do have a sleeping bag that I will be in as to minimize mess.

I live in a rural environment, and will be going into a forest where nobody else goes in order to be isolated while I shoot myself, and not risk my body being accidentally discovered. 

Should I tell them where my body will be? Who should be the one to discover it? 

Please help, I  don't want to scar my family.
