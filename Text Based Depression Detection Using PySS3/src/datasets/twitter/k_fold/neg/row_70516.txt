Life seems pointless to me.*Backround*

----------

Right now, I'm a freshman in high school. I have that all a person would want. Water, food, education, phone, transportation, etc. I don't know if I'm spoiled or if I just truly feel like I can keep on living this kind of lifestyle. My mother was born poor in the Philippines, and she always brings up how I'm so fortunate to have all these luxuries in my life. To me, money isn't everything that a person wants or needs. I see no point in living. To me, life is just education and work. That's all I see. I try to talk to my parents about this but our regular fighting makes me not even want to talk to them about anything. I try to escape how I feel about life when I play games on my computer, sometimes. Not only do I casually play but I try to *change* people in the gaming community that I participate in. Instead of helping me, it backfires. When I try to be nice and spread good vibes, I just get thrown back an insult like, "kill yourself f\*\*\*\*t" because it's the Internet. I weed this kind of stuff out a lot but the gaming community service s so large that it doesn't happen once or twice, it happens daily. I try to do other things to get thoughts and stress off of my mind, and nothing seems to appeal to me like games. Just the laid back, no stress experience is just something I like. After a while, I've played so much that my parents think that I'm addicted (rightfully so) to games (60hours/2weeks) so I have no computer now. I really don't know how to ever decompress and get things off of my mind. I've gotten a lot more salty recently and have gotten into more and more fights with my parents, some verbal and some physical(I know this really isn't good). After a few arguments, I've been threatened that ill be kicked out of the house. I'm planning on joining on the military at 17 but I'm not even sure I'll make it there. (I'm 15 now)

*Now*

----------

I've been getting mad at everything. Myself, my parents, my school, *everything*. I feel like live just isn't worth all the hardship and pain that I go through. I know that some things that I go through isn't that bad and that I have it good but once it happens day after day, I just can't stand it. When I was younger, I used to use God as a reason to say, "This is why I am here". Now, I just can't believe that someone is there to look after me. I can't relate to anyone, and I feel like I'm alone. I don't feel comfortable with talking to any of my friends about this, my sisters are always away (jobs, college, etc), and my parents aren't even an options. I don't know how long I'll last, or even if I'll last here. I don't ever even know what anxiety or depression feels like but I feel like I have it sometimes. I've tried to block out things with love but the one girl that I have feelings is [not really comfortable explaining this part :/]. Sorry if this is really all unclear or poorly written. I'm just trying to get trying out and see if someone has anything that I can do to help myself. Thanks a lot.
