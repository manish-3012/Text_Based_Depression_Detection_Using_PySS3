I want to kill myself for no reason as far as i know.Now I don't know if there is a reason or not, but sometimes I think that there is and I just can't find it, or I just see no enjoyment in life. I'm always bored, and I feel that no matter what I do I will always remain that way. Every day from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed, all I feel is sadness, and when I say to my family that I am feeling better, I say it because I believe that I want to feel better but I just feel like absolute shit as I say it. I was in a psych ward 5 times and it seems like those places don't help that much for me. The staff are usually nice and all of that, but it seems that whenever they give me a new medication, it never ends up working. I don't know what to do and I'm seriously considering suicide. I just wish I could figure out why I'm so miserable in life. I just don't know if I enjoy it or not. I wish I could express how sad I really feel, but it's so hard to do it when I am just typing things out. I wish I could get some help to feel better
