Today I realized that I'm probably going to actually commit suicide sometime in my life.It may not be today, tomorrow, or even 10 years from now, but I honestly think there's a 90% chance that the way I will end up dying is by killing myself. I've struggled with depression since I was 14. I've been making significant progress in therapy and I am the happiest I've ever been. But somehow I keep ensing up depressed and coming back to these thoughts.

I have a fear of being elderly and alone. I am divorced, don't have kids, and don't have many friends. I'm afraid of living in an old folks home and just being forgotten about. And then today I realized that I pretty much already am forgotten about. I moved across the country a couple years ago, none of my family or friends ever call me. My mom never calls, my sister doesn't call. The only time my best friwnd messages me is to complain about her life. She never asks me how I'm doing or what's going on with me. I'm always the one calling them, and if I don't we simply don't talk. It's like my fear of being alone has come true, the only difference is I'm younger and able to take care of myself still. I do have an amazing boyfriend, but lately I keep screwing shit up so I wouldn't doubt it if he left me soon too.

So ya. It may not be today or tomorrow, it might even be 10 or 20 years from now. But unless I have an accident of some sort this will probably be how I die.
