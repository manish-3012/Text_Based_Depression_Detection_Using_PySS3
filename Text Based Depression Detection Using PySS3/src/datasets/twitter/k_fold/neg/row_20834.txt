Nobody takes my suicidal thoughts seriouslyBecause Iâ€™m young no one believes that Iâ€™m suicidal. My friends think Iâ€™m being emo. My parents think Iâ€™m looking for attention. No one on the internet seems to believe that anyone under 16 can want to hurt themselves. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m feel like no matter what I say no ones gonna believe me, so whatâ€™s the point. Why should I live through these adulation thoughts if thereâ€™s no way of getting help. People always say it will get better, but I donâ€™t want to wait much longer. I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m saying anymore. If anyone sees this could you give me advice or something. Idk
