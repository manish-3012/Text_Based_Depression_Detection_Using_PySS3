I'm done.well reddit, I think this may be the end of the line for me. Im simply over it. I'm failing at uni, something that is rather unacceptable in my family due to the fact that I was "too smart" to do what I really wanted to do in life which was art. I only have 1 friend in this world and is a complete selfish, irrational, self-centred, know it all douchebag and the only reason i'm friends with him is to at least try and fill the void and try to feel less lonely in the world, I can't even remember when the last time a girl approached me or showed any sort of interest in me whatsoever. not to mention work has dried up, i haven't had any income in the last two weeks and I'm trying to pay for all my uni fee's car, petrol, parking, books not to mention the debt I owe for my car considering that my parents were unable to afford one for me. like I said before, I AM OVER IT, this 'life' I'm leading is not what I had planned and I don't see any other options. Goodbye reddit, you have been my only true friend.
