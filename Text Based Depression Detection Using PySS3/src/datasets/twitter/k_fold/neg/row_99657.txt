Someone please talk me out of if....pleaseI would put my whole situation on here, except that it's a very, very long story, starting with my entering foster care, and ending around now, 20 years later with my desperation to stop these feelings and memories. If anyone out there is reading this, please, send me a kind word or message. You don't know how much it would mean right now. Thanks.
