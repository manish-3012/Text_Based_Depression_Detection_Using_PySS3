No friends only family holding me backEveryday I want to take my own life, but when i think about it more and more i start to think how my brother, sister and mom would react. They would feel horrible, torn apart. I imagine them sitting at a restaurant and just seeing the empty 4th seat and imagining me there and hoping i never left them. Every time I go through that thought procces I get angry and sad, I scream into my pillow, I punch my matress because I know I'll have to fight through my misery to save them from theirs. I honestly wish I could fade away from their memory's so they wouldn't have to grieve my death. Everyday my misery gets worse and the less I want to stay here, I truly wasted my existence and just wish I was nicer to anyone i ever spoke to so they could be happy when I wasn't.
