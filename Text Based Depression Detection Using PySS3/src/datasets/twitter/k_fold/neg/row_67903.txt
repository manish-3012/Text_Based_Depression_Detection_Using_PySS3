My puppy is dying and so will I.I don't know what to say. I've raised a special needs puppy from the day she was born. This weekend she took a turn for the worse and has been at our vet. Today she was sent in emergency to a Veterinary college in our state and I took her the three hours out there under a lot of false promises. They said after accepting her it would be thousands more dollars than they told me this morning. I've sold my camper and took a loan on my car to put the downpayment on her surgery, but they want even more tomorrow or they won't treat her. They won't release her with a balance, even if I could get only the gas to drive the three hours back to the college, I can't even have her with me at the end. 

My depression and social anxiety have made me shit at life and at social media so nobody in my small circle can help, and the GoFundMe I tried in desperation has gone nowhere because I can't get the word out. I'm out of money, out of food, out of hope for this world. Two years ago I lost the person dearest to me to suicide and it's been a very very VERY teetering line for me of deciding if and when to follow. It's now, she has been my hope and my tether to this world the brief time she's been here beside me but I am worthless and powerless to save her. I'm a broke, ridiculous piece of shit in a dead end shit job, alone, lonely. I've dealt with enough, failing someone so dear and dependent on me so greatly, probably losing her too to the great beyond, it's the last straw. 

There's no hope. No kindness. No charity. No warmess. This world is cold and unfeeling and money grubbing. 

When they kill her, when I've lost everyone, it will be time. I'll join those I love in sweet eternal silence and leave this dirty greedy world behind. Sometimes it is okay. Sometimes, this decision is all we have. 

Good luck, fellow travelers.
