feeling serenehey everyone,

iâ€™m not sure this is the right place to post but tomorrowâ€™s my birthday. and as i sit here on this couch, i just think, itâ€™s been 841 days since my attempt. and iâ€™ve had relapses of suicidal thought since then, self harm, panic attacks, and all of that. i didnt even know if iâ€™d be alive today up to two weeks ago. my family is not emotionally safe for me and iâ€™ve been stuck with them because of quarantine. i have severe pmdd and it makes me feel like a slave to my hormones, and i feel like it isnâ€™t real, especially because iâ€™m a teen and i think itâ€™s just me being young. iâ€™ve called the suicide hotline three times as often during quarantine as i did when i attempted. but honestly, right now, i feel on top of the world. or at least not suicidal.

tomorrowâ€™s my birthday. i did it. i did it for 841 days, and it wasnâ€™t easy. it was mindblowingly, painstakingly, fucking annoyingly difficult, but iâ€™m here.

i donâ€™t know why iâ€™m emotional right now but im just proud of myself. i donâ€™t even know why i live but iâ€™m here. and iâ€™m alive, and breathing, and havenâ€™t cut in two weeks.

thank you for reading. i love you, iâ€™m proud of you, and i hope you will have one of these moments too. have a good night.
