Planning my exit strategyIâ€™m worth more deceased than alive.  If my insurance policies wouldnâ€™t disqualify me for a self inflicted gun shot Iâ€™d be in the morgue at this moment. 

Iâ€™ve pissed away the prime of my life. Every time Iâ€™ve thrown something at it to fix it, itâ€™s made it worse. Make it stop. Make this end. Fucking junkie losers in section 8 housing have it better than me? 

Iâ€™m bankrupt and $89,000 in the hole and growing.  Iâ€™ve given my wife everything Iâ€™ve had and received zero in return.   Is this love? Is this what marriage was supposed to be? 

Donâ€™t tell me to get help. Iâ€™ll still be an autistic man that no one gives a shit about. Iâ€™m ignored more than yield signs on New England interstates . Iâ€™m irrelevant. Iâ€™m just useful for whatever (money, emotional validation) and then tossed out when Iâ€™m used up. 

I just wish someone would have told me that this was how it would be instead of all that â€œyou can be an astronaut â€œ bullshit. I was set up for failure from the get to. 

I no longer see the point in getting out of bed, slaving away, for the gain of absolutely nothing. Nothing will change it. Not another divorce. Not another career change. Not another relocation.  Just let me end it and someone gets paid.
