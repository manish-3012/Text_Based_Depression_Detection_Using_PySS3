I'm still tryingI'm still trying to stay alive but without a goal or any motivation and my situation is getting worse real fast (unlinked events) and it's already hard enough like that. 
I have no reason to be there, no one needs or want me and I don't either and I'm losing more and more everyday, I would need a miracle to get out of this mindset.
I feel like my body is slowly dying and I can't do anything about it. I don't want to believe the "it'll get better" because even if it does get better because of how low I am it would still be terrible and miracles don't exist at least not in my life.

If I don't end my life myself I have a lot of chance to die in an accident because that is yet one of the only bad things that didn't happen to me and I feel like I'm collecting all of them.
