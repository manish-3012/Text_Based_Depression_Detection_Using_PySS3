CountdownI have a date, quite a good one because it is also my birthday, so I guess it goes full circle. 

7 days. 7 days to sort my things out and I am gone.

I am not looking for encouraging messages, although I appreciate the thought. I just need to write this down as there is no one I know I can say this.

I guess what some people say is true, â€œsuicide is selfishâ€, I am not thinking about what my family or friends would think or feel... I know how I feel and it needs to stop, I need to sleep and not wake up.  I donâ€™t want to write any of those letters to family and friends, they know I love them. Thatâ€™s enough. 

Iâ€™ve had fun, I have enjoyed life. But I donâ€™t anymore and havenâ€™t for the last 2-3 years, I have done everything I could to feel happy again, to no avail.
