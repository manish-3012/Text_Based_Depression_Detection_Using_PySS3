I canâ€™t even put anything to words anymore. I canâ€™t describe my suffering and pain.Itâ€™s like a static channel on the television. So alien and chaotic. 

Why can I not love again after what happened to me, despite craving it so badly. 

Why can I never trust, despite that bad event happening as a child. 

Why can I not motivate myself

Why can I not find joy in anything anymore. 

Why am I like this?

I donâ€™t even want the answers. Theyâ€™re just as scary as the unknowing. 

I just want a long hug.
