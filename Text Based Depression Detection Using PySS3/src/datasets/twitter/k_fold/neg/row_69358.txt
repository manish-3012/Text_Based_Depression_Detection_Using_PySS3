I scared myself today.For the first time today I put a plastic bag over my head and tightened it around my neck in hopes of being able to force myself to pass out. I wanted sleep, painless, dreamless, sleep, but I got as far as gasping before I had to rip the plastic from my face. I failed. I also scared myself badly. I'm not completely sure I want to die, but the thoughts are there right now. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist and counselor on Tuesday and will speak with them on Monday because my father has asked me to.

I'm almost 30 and currently non-functional. I had to call into work tomorrow because I don't think I can be around people in those numbers (I work in a service industry.) I've stressed my husband out who's had to come home early before because I wasn't secure emotionally. I'm a failure all over the place and sometimes just don't see the point in living.
