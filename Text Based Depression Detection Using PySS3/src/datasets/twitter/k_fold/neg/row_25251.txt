don't see a pointthis is just a stupid vent bc the people around me are probably tired of hearing me be sad lol. i'm thinking about offing myself by the end of august but i don't know if i'll be able to do it. i have two ideas on how i'd do it but i'm too scared i'll survive and cause permanent damage, due to the fact that for some reason i seem indestructible lol. so everyday i just do little things like i don't buckle my seatbelt in hopes that a car will hit me and everytime i risk mixing benzos and alcohol i hope that it's the "unlucky" time. stuff like that. i wish i had some disease that would kill me fast but i also feel guilty saying that knowing there are people fighting to stay alive, but everything else just seems like it would be a lot easier for my family to cope with than suicide, idk why. i have a college program in the fall that i'm dreading for  a million different reasons but i don't have any other career options and i'm already halfway there anyway. i've been miserable most of my life. i don't want anything out of life, i don't want a career, to travel, marriage, kids, nothing. i love my boyfriend and my dog and my family and i know those should be things to live for (they're all why i'm still currently alive) but i don't see any appeal in the future. i was gonna do an intensive outpatient therapy but i don't think i'll even get the chance to since i have to stay constantly updated with this college program. they said i could take a leave of absence the first semester but then i'll be behind everyone and feel 10x worse. so that's out of the question. i don't know. i don't want my family to waste all this money on my potential career just for me to die but i don't want to drop out and then regret it if i end up feeling better at some point. i'm just confused and on edge about a lot right now. if you actually sat through and read this whole thing then thank u for listening and i hope u have a good day
