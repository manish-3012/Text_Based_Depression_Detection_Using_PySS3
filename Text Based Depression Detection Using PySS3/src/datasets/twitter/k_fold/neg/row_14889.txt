Looked up if I could OD on my WellbutrinI don't know why. I just... It was an impulse. I was putting it in my medicine container for the week and the thought of "I wonder what would happen if I just took all of these?" Popped into my head. I'm 29. Crippling debt. But I have a good husband. Unfortunately we live with his asshole grandparents who treat us like children. I'm just so, very, tired.
