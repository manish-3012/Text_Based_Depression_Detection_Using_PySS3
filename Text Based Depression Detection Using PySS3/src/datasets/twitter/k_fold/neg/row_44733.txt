ScaredIâ€™ve honestly finally gotten to a point where Iâ€™m actually scared I could take my own life. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for years but my fear of death combined with the guilt I would feel for tearing a hole in the lives of my loved ones was always enough to keep the action of actually attempting suicide far enough away. But these last few months my entire life has changed in so many terrible ways. My friendships have begun to fade away and these people who I used to feel so close to are now practically strangers, my 4 year relationship ended (mutually) but has still left me feeling emptier and more heartbroken than I ever have before, and Iâ€™m currently living in purgatory (a mostly empty house with no tv or WiFi or friends) while Iâ€™m awaiting the move to a new house. With all of these things combined I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m just going crazy or if whatever gate that was keeping my mind away from attempting suicide has just vanished because Iâ€™m just truly for the first time in my life, alone. I donâ€™t want to die, I know I donâ€™t but the pain I feel inside my chest has gotten to a completely unbearable point and I really think my body is ready to get past that fear of dying Iâ€™ve had for so long just because the pain has actually gotten to the point where I think being dead and putting an end to it is without a doubt the better option. Iâ€™ve never actually felt like suicide was going to be the way I died but feeling this alone and living in this cold house and not having a friend to call has now made that possibility seem incredibly real. Iâ€™m just scared that Iâ€™m days away from my breaking point, the pain feels like itâ€™s growing exponentially and unless it stops Iâ€™m not sure how long I physically will be able to try and push the idea of ending it all away. Iâ€™m just so fucking terrified and sad that this is the hand Iâ€™ve been dealt.
