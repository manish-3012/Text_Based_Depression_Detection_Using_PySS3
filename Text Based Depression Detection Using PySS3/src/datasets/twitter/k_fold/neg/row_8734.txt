Boyfriend Wants to Die Young... Really YoungHi all, 
I (20F) have been in a relationship for about 2 years with my boyfriend (20M), Iâ€™ve known him since primary school. 

From the beginning of our relationship he has expressed the desire to die young. I have heard people say they donâ€™t want to live past 50, 40, maybe even 30. My BF, however, has told me he doesnâ€™t want to live past 25. 

At first I thought he wasnâ€™t serious, but as years pass, and he continues to express this, I realize that he is likely serious, and 5 years goes by faster than you might think. 

Weâ€™re both attending University now and I intend to attend graduate school, and I canâ€™t imagine losing him at what is essentially the start of our careers and our lives. If I say something along those lines he says Iâ€™m selfish, that he shouldnâ€™t have to be miserable for the rest of his life because of his attachments to friends and family. 

Is it selfish to want a future with someone who is apparently miserable deep down, for reasons that exist beyond the relationship?

Heâ€™s also expressed that he doesnâ€™t want kids, which Iâ€™m okay with, but I hate to think that He doesnâ€™t want kids because he doesnâ€™t intend to live long enough to raise them. 

I donâ€™t necessarily want to live to be old either, especially if I choose not to have children. Iâ€™ve watched elderly family members experience crippling health conditions including dementia and the thought of my body outliving my mind or vice versa is a deep fear of mine. 

So in a sense I can relate to him, but 25? Bluntly, I feel that (especially) if you donâ€™t want to make extensive plans for success later in life you could live spontaneously for long past 25 and have a plethora of unique experiences or take risks. You could travel, see the world, take a shitload of drugs, I donâ€™t know.

Overall he doesnâ€™t engage in risky behavior or anything that would make you assume he doesnâ€™t value his life. He doesnâ€™t drink or dp drugs. He is in school. He has a great relationship with his family. Loads of artistic talent. From the outside, someone would think heâ€™s got a lot to live for. 

I dealt with similar thoughts as a young teenager. I didnâ€™t plan to live past 16 at one point. The year I turned 15 was one of my lowest if you can imagine. I hung out with an older crowd, abused alcohol, prescription meds, coke, etc. I struggled with an eating disorder and engaged in other forms of self harm. 

That year I made an attempt on my life by taking sleeping pills and drinking alcohol. I woke up in the middle of the night experiencing sleep paralysis. I thought I was dead. I thought that after you die, you were still fully conscious. For what felt like hours I thought about what it would be like when someone found me, at my funeral, if I was in the ground forever or cremated. It was intense. 

I was okay, puked and hallucinated for a couple days. After that things got better, not linearly, but Iâ€™m in college now and things are good. 

What Iâ€™m getting at is, Iâ€™ve been there, but I still donâ€™t throughly understand. I love him dearly, and I promise that over these years Iâ€™ve tried to have in depth conversations about why he feels this way, but no matter how long the conversation goes on Iâ€™ve never gotten a real answer. Iâ€™ve  checked in to see if he was actively suicidal, and the answer has always been no. 

What Iâ€™m asking for is perhaps some perspective from people that may have felt this way before, or some guidance on having a very real conversation with him about this topic. 

Thank you.
