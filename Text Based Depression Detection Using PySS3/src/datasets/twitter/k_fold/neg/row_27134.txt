Couldn't go through with it, but I'm still suicidalI just want to write this down real quick. I'm 18, still in high school, so I'm still real young to jump to anything concrete when it could change. At the moment though, i feel very worthless. I have friends, but they all seem to be better friends with other people. I don't get asked to hang out, people blow me off and only talk to me for short periods of time, and I always see them hanging out with each other with never considering me. I have no one to vent to, no support system, and I feel unwanted. I'm a very depressed person, but I'm not always in a sad mood with people. I try to be charismatic but it never goes anywhere. I guess what I'm saying is I wish I had better friends and people who actually cares about me. Most others seem to have those people but me and it sucks. All I can think about is how much I want to end my life just to show up everyone who never give me any attention whatsoever.
