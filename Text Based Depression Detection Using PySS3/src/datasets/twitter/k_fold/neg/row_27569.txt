Attempted suicide and woke up in the hospital.This happened a few weeks ago, but it's enough to shut me in my room for the entire month with no contacting friends, work, school or anything else.

My reasons for suicide are very short:
- My family had been abusive and my father always included pro-suicide insults to me when I sought therapy
- My old boyfriend cheated on me for half a year in our 3 year relationship
- My friendships are too distant and a friend who dug out the secret I attempted suicide had called me toxic and put blame to our friends that I think she is disposable.

On my birthday, I hung myself after a few frantic desperate calls to a help line and friends. And when I woke up, I was in the emergency ward. Mom came home early and called the police. When I came back, she explained I am incredibly annoying and making her look bad.

I'm unsure why I'm writing to you today. 
I've been in my room and feel safe in my bed. 
I think I'm calling for a desperate help and I can't process it properly.
I know I also want to re-attempt suicide again.
