Need reasons to not kill myself.I planned on killing myself yesterday but didnâ€™t go through with it. Iâ€™m going to try again today. I wonâ€™t lie and say I donâ€™t want to get help but my family simply canâ€™t afford it. We already owe ten grand from the last time I was hospitalized. I donâ€™t want to make it twenty. Iâ€™m in so much pain from cutting my thighs up and I just donâ€™t have the energy to keep living. I tried talking to my therapist but he basically just told me to go for a walk. So maybe this will help me. I dont know if itâ€™ll stop me altogether but maybe itâ€™ll help me last another day. Sorry for posting two days in a row. I have no one to turn to.
