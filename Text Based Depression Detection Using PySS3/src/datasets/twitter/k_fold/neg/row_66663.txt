NobodiesI donâ€™t know if this feeling is wanting to kill myself. I think I have gotten less scared of death. Life has just become pain and only pain. I have no one to go to which is why Iâ€™m here. I canâ€™t talk to family. I literally donâ€™t have friends. I know lots of people say that. But I have no one. I have a partner who is currently away in the Falklands until January. 

But I donâ€™t trust him. I donâ€™t trust anyone. I feel the urge to just run the fuck away.... forever. Or end it forever. 

I want to say, Iâ€™m terrified of blood and pain. The likely hood of me fulfilling this is low. Very very low. 

But it doesnâ€™t stop me feeling so drain and alone.
