You guys really helped me. [UPDATE]Back in September, I posted in this subreddit talking about how I was considerig suicide. It didn't seem like much help at the time, but your words of concern really put things in perspective. I decided the pressure of college wasn't my kind of thing, so I decided to move to Maine with my close friends. I'm in the process of driving there right now, in fact! I took a break in Albany, NY and remembered my old post. I'm happily in another relationship, and although my old relationship still leaves scars on my emotional health, I'm adamant on getting better. You guys rock. I have nothing but respect for this subreddit. Thank you all, for everything. Keep doing what you do.
