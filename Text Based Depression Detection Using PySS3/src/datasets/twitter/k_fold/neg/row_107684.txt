Depressed for the last 25 years, failure in life, I miss my dead dog, I want to be dead too.For 8 years I kept myself alive, more alive than usual, because I told myself my dog needs me. Doggo was always there for me, and I probably never loved another creature or human as much as loved Doggo. Then shit happens and Doggo died, he's been dead for 2 years now.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since Doggo died I have had less and less reason to live, getting more and more passively suicidal this year. I;m even supposed to marry my boyfriend this year. he knows I have depressive tendencies but it's been years since i talked about my suicidal thoughts with him, because I don't want to tell him any more to spare him the hurt or even having to deal with me. I can't even deal with myself!  


Months ago, i dreamt the nicest dream i had in a long time. I was with my dog again! we were a family of 2, just like before! We went for walks, lots of cuddles, kissed his furry face, told him i loved him so much, then I woke up. I cried so hard. I wanted to be dead the minute I woke up.  


I can't even look at other dogs anymore without feeling some black sadness falling over me.
