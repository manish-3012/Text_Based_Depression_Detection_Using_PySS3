Suicide Notes Just Incase?I always go through this same phase where its deep hopelessness for days to weeks and then I hit my explosion where Iâ€™m hysterically sobbing and often go numb from the overwhelming urge to die. I feel slightly better afterwards, but I know Iâ€™m going to snap one day and end my life. Is it okay that Iâ€™m writing suicide notes/ funeral plans just so if I snap one day, Iâ€™m prepared? Am I really suicidal or just really sad. I parked at some train tracks and just stared at the stars. I ended up leaving because I felt impatient.  I think about suicide a lot itâ€™s just I donâ€™t have a method yet. I know if Iâ€™m ever given access to a solid way to end it, Iâ€™ll probably do it on a tuesday for the hell of if. Sorry that this is so much rambling.
TLDR; Am I really suicidal if Iâ€™m writing my notes just in case I feel like killing myself?
