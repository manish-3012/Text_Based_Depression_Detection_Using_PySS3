I just can't do it anymoreI just can't take it anymore. With keeping up with grades, friends, popularity, etc. Have you ever had a day where everything goes wrong? Well there's my fucking life for you. I have nothing to look forward to. I'm only 16 and I'm just waiting for death, hoping that I can get myself to speed up the process. I was an atheist until recently, because I know someone is making sure my life is a living hell. I don't want to go back to school, or even spend time with anybody, I just want to be dead or start over as someone god is not pushing to the limit trying to see how far he can push until I fly off the edge.
