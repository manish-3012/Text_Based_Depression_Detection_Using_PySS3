a rant to myselfsince i dont wanna post this to my vent account or the vent channels in my friends' server

I think everything i do is just a distraction from suicidal thoughts.

I can't be bored. I can't ever be bored. When I'm bored and I have no stimulus, i just turn to things that make me feel like shit. End up thinking of just killing myself. Of dying. I cant ever just lay around and do nothing, those thoughts will always be there. It's so stupid.

Stupid how dependent I am on stimulus. Stupid how i can't go one fucking second without thinking, "hey, what if i just fucking died right now yknow." Stupid. It's so fucking stupid. This is a scam. This whole thing is like if somebody gave me a gift card for my birthday and i tried to use it but it turns out the gift card was fucking ten years expired. Gee, thanks, loved the gift card.

Relaly stupid analogy, but. Fuck man, it's 3am. We're on a 3am high but in the worst way possible. Fuck this shit, am i right?

Fucking hell. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

Stupid as shit. Keep craving stimulus but when it appears, when a prompt comes up, turns out you dont have the energy or will or drive to do it. Fuck you, Mason. Just as much of a bitch as \*\*\*\*. Fuck you fuck you fuck you

i have a new binder my mom ordered me. Still havent opened it. Maybe i fucking should and just hang myself from the doorknob. Fucking hell.

i hate this.
