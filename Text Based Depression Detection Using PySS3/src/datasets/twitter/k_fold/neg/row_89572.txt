I'm very close to commiting suicide.Hello guys, I'm a 16 year old from Lithuania, and I think I will commit suicide in the next few months. I just can't handle it anymore. I have cut myself, I've smoked weed and nothink helps. I always feel empty, every night, every day. I am planning on asking a girl out on valentines day that I like for a long time, and if she rejects me, I'm almost 100% sure I will end it all. Right now, I see no motivation to live except her. I'm alive just because of her, and without her I see no point in living.
