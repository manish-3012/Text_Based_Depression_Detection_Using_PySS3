Suicide is not running away, it's an exit.Let's face it, people who are telling us to not kill ourselves are really just doing it out of self-interests. They keep telling us that things will be fine but they have no idea what it is to be us or have any guarantees that our life will BE better, and there is only so much failing a person can take before he says "nope, you win life, you beat me so just let me go in peace and dignity".

This Christmas will mark the second one in a role where my life when down the crapper with no job, no relationship and worst of all my family members are coming back to celebrate with their own friends just to rub it in (We are not Christians by the way but it is still a holiday in our country). Sometimes I wish I was alone in this world because if there is anything worse than being sad and losing at life is seeing other people you know actually enjoying themselves. 

Really, if there is nothing after suicide, just a big black empty then it is actually a relief because we don't have to endure or suffer this torture called living.
