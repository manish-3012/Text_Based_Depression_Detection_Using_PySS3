If something doesnt change in a season or two..My life has been on stand still, not moving a single budge for over four years now. I dont want to sleep another year away in a curled up ball, lucid dreaming &amp; things are not fun anymore. Nearing mid twenties. 


Cant help but edge closer &amp; closer taking my parents highblood pressure pills to lower my (sketchy as is) heart rate back down to unconsciousness once more. Very tempted to at least cut one in fourths and take 1/4 just to fuck around. 


A self-harmer is selfish, or so I hear. When it comes down to the root of it, I am selfish with self-harming nor care about anyone else when it comes to self-harming. 


Know what that means? I dont care about anyone else if I decide to take a bottle of high blood pressure pills; but that wont come till later though (if it came too it).



Im level headed right now, this isnt a heat of the moment letter; this is always in the back of my head. To nibble, nibble, nibble those pills.


Not sure what to say? Kinda dont care if anyone reads this or not.
