Overbearing parents.. Losing control. Please help.As a 20+yold living with parents I realize there isn't much liberty for me to live how I want to, and there are rules for me to abide by while I live under their home. While I am looking for a job, and have gotten an internship atm, this is not enough to satisfy my parents expectations. It's difficult when everything I do seems wrong in their eyes. From the way I do chores, to simply request some time for myself, if I don't do things up to their standard I am to blame. And they certainly make it known to me, insulting me by showing what a failure I am. I lost all confidence in myself because of these talks with my parents, because I feel that I am always to blame for every action or disharmony. 

While looking for work, all I ask is simply to be able to use the Internet freely on three days. Some days out of the week I get some freedom. And I cherish this privilege. But tonight, a night that I mentioned was one of those nights, without saying a word, they removed that privilege and just got rid of the modem. I mentioned to them before that we should have clarity in our expectations and clearly this wasn't clarified. I feel like they are imposing their decisions on my life and I find it extremely difficult to maintain my independence. 

I am looking for work. I want to just move out. I want my freedom. But I'm finding it difficult to live up to my parents expectations of me. I have trouble making my own decisions because I will never be able to please them. If I say something to them, they say I'm not listening or I'm just saying it as a cop out. I lost all credibility in their eyes and I feel like nothing I say matters. Nothing I do matters. It feels like I am the cause to all the problems and it would be easier if I wasn't here to cause it. 

I'm drinking a ton of energy drinks. I can't sleep.
