ending it before it gets any worseEverything I've done in life is worthless.  There's nothing about me that is worthy of remembrance.  I've been depressed for so long I couldn't even tell you when it started.  I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for my mother.  I've been wishing, praying that she would die so she wont have to bury her child.  But I don't think I can wait anymore.  Sorry ma.  

There is so much wrong with me.  But the most pressing is what I've let happen to my health, particularly my teeth.  warning gross don't click http://imgur.com/sWqkNFZ I've been to so many dentists.  Everything from non-profit 'help the community' type places to fancy private practices.  They are ALL THE FUCKING SAME.  Pay out of pocket for an xray (dental insurance is a fucking scam, pay them $800 a year for a maximum of 1,000 fucking pay out. what the fuck).  Then the 'here's what's wrong, this is very bad blah blah' now give us money or fill out this credit application so we can begin work.  Great, my credit is in the trash and I can't get approved any amount to get any work done.  NONE of the fucking places I've gone to are willing to work out a payment plan despite my holding a long term semi not terrible paying job.  I can't even brush my teeth anymore because it hurts so much.  Last time I tried I broke chunks out of my front teeth.  I even tried going to a dental school at my state's university thinking I might find luck there.  Those fuckers charged me MORE THAN ANY OF THE FUCKING DENTISTS for an xray and laid on the same bullcrap about paying in full or applying for credit.

I wish I never existed.  But I do.  And I've hit the end of the line.  I can't keep living like this.
