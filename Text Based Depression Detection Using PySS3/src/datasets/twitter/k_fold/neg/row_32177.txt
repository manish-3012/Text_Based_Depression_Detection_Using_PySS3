my parents are going to splitI've been living with my mum and my stepdad since I was 3 years old. My stepdad has a son, he's 40 years old. He used to do hard drugs and he has like 5 children from different mothers, so, he's kind of irresponsible. He lives with us, he eats everything, he doesn't shower, etc. My mum hates him, he works with my parents and he lies to them all the time.

My stepdad doesn't notice (i think he does but he is his son and he stands everything) and my mum suffers a lot. Today they had an argument, they screamed and my dad left for a couple of hours. Yesterday I yelled at my stepbrother for being such an asshole, he left the house. My mum wants to leave too. I don't want to. I can't stand watching my mum sad, because she gets angry and makes me feel like absolute shit. I had panic attacks, I want to throw up and I can't sleep.

I'm thinking about killing myself. I used to think about how sad my mum will be, but If I'm dead I won't notice, is that selfish? I tried to kill myself before and I ended up in a mental hospital. I don't want to fail again, I really want to die.
