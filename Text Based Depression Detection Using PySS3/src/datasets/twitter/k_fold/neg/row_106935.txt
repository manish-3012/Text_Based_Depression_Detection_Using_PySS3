No one will see this and likely no one will say anythingI'm not saying that as a negative on them. Tbh if I hadn't burned so many bridges I wouldn't be here right now. I don't really have anyone to talk to and my family is dead. I haven't been happy in years. I was in love with a girl I wanted to marry then lost her and lost my family. I have a job that is too fucking demanding for me. I spend all night every night dreading it and every day just trying to get by. But there's no alternative. Theres no way life can get better. I'm just the weak one. The fuckin coward who couldnt hack it. There's a rooftop patio thirteen stories above my apartment with no fencing or protective measures. Every fucking day I think about taking that plunge. I've found the exact location where it maximizes the length of the drop. I don't see any fucking point in not doing it. I hate my job, hate my career, and am honestly a fucking net negative on every single human being in my life. I'd be doing the world a favor if I jumped. There's no fucking reason for me to stick around. There's nothing special about me, and there won't be anything unique about my death. Just another fucking statistic in 2020's fucked up record book. At least it'll be fuckin over.
