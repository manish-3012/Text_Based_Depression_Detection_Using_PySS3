Just tried to hang myself, fucked up. Now what?26/F
I don't know what to do with myself anymore. No friends, no family, live alone, just lost my SO of 5 years. I have nothing but my career, which locks me out of any 'normal' life. Been on several antidepressants over the past 10yrs, but nothing really helped. I want the isolation and mental anguish to stop. I tried to hang myself but the pain of asphyxiation was more than I could handle sober. I wish I had a quicker way out.

edit: It's Saturday night and I still feel like shit. Nothing's changed. I'll be fasting over the next 48 hours to clear out my gut as much as possible, then take some xanax and try again. I appreciate everyone's time, but it just wasn't enough to stop the loneliness. No one should have to live like this. Goodbye.
