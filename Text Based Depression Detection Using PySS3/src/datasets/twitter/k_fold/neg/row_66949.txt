I Wrote SomethingBeen a long time since I wrote something but I really just wanted to get my feelings out. I am not going to do anything soon but death is on my mind constantly; in more ways than not I want to cease to exist. Thanks for reading.

"D---h is easy. Whether you believe it or not, it is.  You as a being just, stop. You cease to be. 

The hard part is all the baggage that comes with death, and this includes much more than the involuntary emptying of your bowels that you hear about on TV and in movies. Dealing with some shit in my pants for others to deal with is something I can take lightly. (Hell, I did it for the first couple years of my life and loved ones actually praised me for it.) What I really have trouble dealing with is the ripple effect that comes from me leaving. 

When I make the jump into the calm water that is death, the water quickly heals waiting for its next permanent guest. But the waves that escape from my jump cause more damage than a tsunami when they make landfall of the living. My friends, family, brothers, parents, and daughter will all be caught off guard when they see that massive wave hurling towards them. And that is the hard part about death. It is all the hurt and heartache for others that stems from my decision to take my game token off the board and not pass â€œGOâ€, no matter how many people judge me for not collecting that sweet $200.

Hurting other people has never been a strong suit of mine. I never had a hurtful comeback in time, I could never throw a punch, I couldnâ€™t pain someone on purpose. And that is why leaving would be so difficult. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, I just donâ€™t know if I can keep hurting myself daily; even if it upkeeps my loved oneâ€™s happiness.

What I really want is to enter the sea of death as a water droplet myself, taking all trace of my presence with me, and leaving no wake to hurt others around me. "
