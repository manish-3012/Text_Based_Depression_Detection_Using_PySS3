I wanna kill myself because I HATE everyone including myselfI can't take this fucking 50 miles down the track snooze you lose socety. All I ever wanted was to be content. I'm so FUCKED up that none of my meds can get rid of this endless loneliness. This rage I feel at other people for being able to not have emotional breakdowns every 5 seconds.

What does it say about somebody who had more meaningful relationships inside a fuxking psyche ward than with ANY of their friends.

People are always telling you how to act and what to feel and what 2 do.  Don't be desperate, have ambitions , don't disrespect authority figures, don't tell your peers how you really feel....oR Dodon't say this or think that.

Nobody ever tells you how to do these things and not feel empty inside



I can socialize pretty well. I have friends.but if I ever dropped my composure they'd see me in a completely different even scary way.

I don't want to be untrue to who I am and what I believe anymore but if I do that I'm fucked.

I wish I was a sociopath. I hate these emotions so much and they are unbearable
