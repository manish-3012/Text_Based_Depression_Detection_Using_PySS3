Thinking of quitting my job, but without it, I'm nothing.All I've ever wanted to do with my life was to get a job where I get to help people and make the world a better place. I finally got just that and at first I loved it. I found it rewarding and I was so excited to see what it would bring, but not long after, I got frustrated. I was disappointed. I can't get into the details, but I have lost my cool more than once. Maybe I'm not cut out for it after all. I'm thinking of quitting, but without this job, my life won't mean anything. I don't wanna just have some boring run of the mill job where I do the same thing day after day until I die. On my bad days, I think of killing myself because I'm not even sure I have a purpose after all. Without purpose, what's the point of living?
