I just wamted to thank all of youHello everyone, I just wanted to thank all of you.  From the age of 5-8 I was sexually assaulted by a female babysitter. In the end, her abuse caused internal lacerations, greatly affecting me physically and mentally.

I didn't have the courage to speak up until recently, and the rejection I recieved from my family after revealing,my secret was unbearable. I was told I should have enioyed it because I was a young male, by family members. They obviously have no understanding about child sexual abuse. It affected me in so many ways, it is so fucking sad, and I know children are still being abused, this really hurts me. 

This fall I was on the verge of killing myself, I didn'r tell family or friends that I was going to end it all. I planned to drive to a nearby major city and jump off of the highest parkade. I planned it for months, created my own will, and had money for my funeral, that is when Reddit stepped in.

I posted my story on Reddit, and a few kind souls suggested I go camping and gtfo of dodge, so I did.  During my adventure, I realized that none of this was my fault, and I can't blame others. That is what the weak and cowards do. I am moving on with my life, and recently enrolled in college. I am crying right now and would like to thank you all again. Dont let social stigmas define you, and speak up if you are a victim of sexual abuse, even if you are a male!!! THANK YOU REDDIT YOU SAVED MY LIFE
