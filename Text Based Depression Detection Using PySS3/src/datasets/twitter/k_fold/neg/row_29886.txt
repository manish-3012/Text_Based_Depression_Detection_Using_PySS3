PetsHonestly, I don't want to write some long pity backstory because as I have experienced that goes nowhere so I'll try to be brief as I can generically...

I have nothing left besides pets, but they have become an anchor to life more than a reason to live. My dreams are hopeless at this point, my family is split and I am hardly a factor for them (before anyone goes "THINK OF YOUR LOVED ONES" I have none, sorry.)  It isn't their fault, and frankly I know there is nobody to blame but myself.

In short, I am the very definition of failure. I have more burned bridges and disappointments than most to the point where I wound up alone. I can't keep relationships because I cannot escape the scars of my past, and I dont have enough "money or time" to keep those around me happy. This spills to friendship too, and that's a fact.

That aside. What is a good way to make sure my pets (2 cats) are taken care of?  They are... different. One is a nice but doesnt get along well with other pets. The other is.... slow. Very slow. He's a bit chunky, is sweet, but uses his claws too much and is eccentric with litter. Is there a generally good way of making sure they are taken care of?

Theyre still pretty young, so waiting another 10+ years feeling like this... isn't really feasible.  I am not planning this immediately, and I have done pretty thorough research. It's just better to get my ducks in a row, so any tips?
