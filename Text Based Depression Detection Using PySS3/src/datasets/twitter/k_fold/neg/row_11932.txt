I feel numb.I'm female, going to be 20 on the 21st. I have been in a relationship with someone I love very much for about two years. Because of my depression and borderline personality disorder, I feel like I have permanently damaged a relationship that I want to maintain for the rest of my life. I hate doing things I once loved to do. I hate getting up. I've gained a lot of weight because I don't care about being healthy anymore. I'm taking my medications but they don't seem to be helping. I know that therapy is supposed to help, but the borderline group sounds intimidating and sometimes I'm not even sure that I am borderline.

Every single day I think about killing myself. I don't know if I'll get to a point where I do it, but I certainly feel worthless and hopeless. I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to have friends or a boyfriend because all I do is cause people pain. Nothing works out the way it should. There is a negative to everything. It seems like life isn't even worth the pain.
