Just want to dissappearI'm 23 and I'm completely useless the only thing I feel is shame and embarrassment for my self I have no friends and I'm dating a girl who has the perfect life and when I'm with her it's the only moment when I don't want to just get a fucking heart attack and die  and my life fucking sucks I suck at everything I do and always feel fucking empty I just want to dissappear I've been thinking about ways to kill myself and make it look like an accident but also fast and clean so that my parents don't feel even more embarrassed for the pice of shit they have for a son I thought about getting run over by a car but I could survive and be even more of a fucking waste of space or go to a bad part of town and get stabbed but I don't want to get any one involved also Im not fat but I never work out so maybe I could workout a lot and hopefully get a heart attack or something this sounds fucking ridiculous but I just can't wait to die and leave this bullshit of a life also getting infected with that covid bullshit but I don't want my mom to get infected and fuck her life even more than I did when I was born I don't see any future for me and I won't be a successful person I just want to cry and scream  because I hate myself and the worst part is that even if I found a way to make it look like an accident I wouldn't even be brave enough to go along with it so I'm not even good at fucking killing myself I don't see any reason to be alive nothing makes me happy i wish I could go back in time and punch my dad in the face for not wearing a fucking condom so I wouldn't be obligated to be in this shit hole of a life just hoping for the day I die
