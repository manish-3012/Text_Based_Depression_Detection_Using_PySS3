Iâ€™m aliveThis is an update. Iâ€™m just here to tell everybody that Iâ€™m alive. Iâ€™m definitely not alright but Iâ€™ll try my best to keep going. Iâ€™m sorry I wasnâ€™t able to get back to every single on of you but opening my old post just puts me in so much pain and I get so many breakdowns. Thank you all for your support and Iâ€™ll be trying my best to heal. This is a throwaway so Iâ€™m going to be posting this and tossing the account. Thank you again!
