Probably never gonna find meds that keep the Bipolar awaySince my first medication I was on two and a half years ago, Iâ€™ve cycled through about 16 or 17 new meds. One has sorted out the mania. And none have sorted the depression and anxiety longer than a few months. 

I have no job. No girlfriend. Nothing. I canâ€™t look after myself properly, so how could I manage anything else.

Iâ€™m seeing my psychiatrist on Monday. If it doesnâ€™t go well and I leave without a new med plan, Iâ€™ll probably end it. Iâ€™m just a fucking useless burden.
