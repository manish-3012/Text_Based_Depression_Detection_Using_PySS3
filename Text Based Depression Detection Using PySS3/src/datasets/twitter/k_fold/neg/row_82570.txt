Darwin Was Right From The BeginningI still can not believe the fact that i am creating a post on this subreddit. But do not worry there will be no personal drama.

4 years ago i was on top of my game, i had an athletic build, i was socially great even had girlfriend(s). Then i had a drinking problem which led to a major depressive disorder. From than, my life keeps getting screwed for 4 years. This makes roughly 1460 days, 121 months,  35.040 hours. Can you imagine living a doomed life for that long. The only reason i have been alive so far was the hope of change and a strong temptation to resist the natural selection. Through those years, my view about life completely changed for many times. I had close friends trying to "change my perspective" by uttering some ideas which sounded like they are taken from a spiritualist-self improvement-bullshit-but-i-still-had-your-money  type of books. Now i am in a situation in which i am broke, physically fucked up, semi-social pushover (some people still have respect for me because of my previous works and the intellectual capital which i possess) and i have god-knows-what disorder which taxes me mentally. I almost tried to change everything i have control over in order to make some difference but my attemps have failed very badly. Last 2 days i started to have episodes of anger and extreme sadness. During those i have decided to end all of this. Now some people might think that me writing this is a sign of seeking help/support because of subconcious thought but no seriously i have no fucking idea why am i sharing this to an internet platform. Another thing i want to say to the  people reading this subreddit is i was thinking like you once while reading all suicide notes and even trying to help them, i was thinking that some of the posts are really stupid or not a reason to kill yourself. But believe me my friends, this is a position where you wish to project your feelings emphateticly but words are inadequete for this purpose. If that was possible, people would understand the guy/girl who killed himself.

Now i am planning to take action in 2-3 days. I just wish good luck to all people in this subreddit hope you can find another way around and yes Darwin was right about his theory, the man had my respect for thinking about such a revolutionary concept.

For all basement bugs who are calling people weak etc... for their choice of ending their lives, fuck you and your stupid social norms you insects are in position to judge or name-tag another person because of he/she does not want to participate in your flawed, non-logical social rules and systems. You are discriminating people for their choice over their life, sexuality and bunch of other stuff because they do not fit your "normal" description which even you can not describe completely, you are the ones whom shall be destroyed you god damn retarted primitive monkeys, your kind has been in majority over 21 centuries and you fucked up the entire thing. "I can bang a lot of hot chicks in my school becuz of ma cool insta photos, hell yeah 21st century" congrats motherfucker this was exactly what humanity needed you god damn moron.
