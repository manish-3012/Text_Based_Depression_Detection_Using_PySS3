I feel like one day Iâ€™m just gonna kill my selfI feel like one day Iâ€™m just gonna kill myself

So this is just gonna be me venting about shit I donâ€™t like about my life. 

Iâ€™m one of those wastes of space that was just destined to be a waste of space. You know those incels or nice guys or neckbeards or whatever? Since this is throwaway anyways but Iâ€™m afraid to say I feel like Iâ€™m subconsciously becoming one, and Iâ€™d rather eat a bullet than become one. 

For a little context Iâ€™m an 18 year old highschool dropout. Iâ€™ve never dated anyone. I donâ€™t even have any friends. My parents give me zero support and I donâ€™t really have the energy to really get up and do anything. I do have a job, itâ€™s not enough to pay rent so Iâ€™m just forever under my moms roof and I feel like thatâ€™ll be the case for like..as long as I decide to keep living. 

I dropped out because my school closed down, entered an online charter school, then they kicked me out for now doing any work. I just couldnâ€™t it wasnâ€™t a classroom setting and I donâ€™t know how to get back into school Iâ€™m
A dropout, no school would take me. Most people my age are already in university, Iâ€™m so behind. 

Iâ€™ve never dated, Iâ€™ve never had a true friend. I never even really hugged someone; let alone the other stuff. When I go on the dating subreddits and I hear stories of other people failing too despite actively trying and it just demotivates me to even try. No one has ever shown interest in me. I feel unattractive and gross. The only time I feel safe going out is to work but only in my nice work uniform . All my other clothes are trash. My room is trash and smells like garbage, thereâ€™s holes and blood on the walls (yes i self harm) stains all over the carpet. Canâ€™t even dream of bringing a girl over. 

Iâ€™m not even sure where to start. Everytime I think of going to gym I think about one last McDonaldâ€™s trip. Everytime I think about buying me fresh clothes I just realize it wonâ€™t change my ugly face. Or when I decide to make my room nice, itâ€™s a lot of money to spend for a lease that ends pretty soon so thereâ€™s no point. Always these fake ass excuses I make up and Iâ€™m aware of it and Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m in a bad place right now I just wish like, I just ..I donâ€™t want this to be what I amount to but when I lift a finger I just fall back down I fall back down.
