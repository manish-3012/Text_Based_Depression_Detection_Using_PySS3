friend is suicidal rn and I dont know how to helpMy friend opened up about his suicidal thoughts and depression a few months ago and he is refusing to get help. Yesterday he almost killed himself before he bandaged himself up. I am very afraid that he is gonna try again soon, maybe even today, so what can I do to help him? Last time I asked this sub people said to leave him to find help on his own but now he is extremely suicidal, so I just want to find a way to help my friend. I almost called his state's police department yesterday when he stopped responding and was dialing when he responded. Now he says he hasn't calmed down and I'm scared that hell try again
