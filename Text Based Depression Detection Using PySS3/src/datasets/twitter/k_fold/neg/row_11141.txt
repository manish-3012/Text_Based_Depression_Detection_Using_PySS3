This is my goodbyeI don't know what's happening to my life. My fiance just walked out on me. The one person who I was trying to stay here for. She's not here so I guess soon I won't be either. I hope she realizes I never stopped loving her. I don't know what else I can say it's just too hard to keep trying without anything to look forward to.
