Took the wrong job out of college, no way out. Just done.So I recently started my first job as a junior developer. I'm 28. I've known for a long time I didn't want to do this for career, because I'm bad at it and I hate the stress and anxiety it causes.

Along with this I signed a one year lease. The lease agreement is clear that if you try to leave early, you have to pay the remainder of the rent. 

Even if I could get out of that, my family keeps pressuring me to stick with it. "Everyone is lost at their first job, it takes time." Nobody will believe what I'm telling them, which is that I just do not belong at this job, I don't belong in the town where I'm living, I want out and now. If I were to up and quit tomorrow, my parents and siblings would just be ashamed and angry, I'd probably have nowhere to live while I look for a job. 

Of course all of that is a moot point anyway because of the fucking lease I'm trapped in.

I'm literally in a situation with no escape. Except to just end it all. I'm tired of having this knot in my chest 24 hours a day. Tired of waking up from a nice dream, having a panic attack and thinking "fuck, I'm back here again." Tired of being a burden on my family by always calling them to cry and complain about my life. Just tired of everything. I don't want to hurt anybody or make them feel any guilty, which I know my parents will, but I can't go on like this anymore. I will never be able to just breathe and feel normal again. I'm opting out.
