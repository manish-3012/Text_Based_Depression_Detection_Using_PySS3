Confused FeelingsI used to be a more broken and lifeless person but Iâ€™ve found that recently, Iâ€™m starting to reconnect with people. Life is meaningless to me, but Iâ€™m happy. Issue is, the idea of suicide now seems to feel like a *need*. I used to think about it a few times a week, but for the past two months, itâ€™s become an everyday thought that clogs up my mind.

I feel like my mind is in that planning stage. I keep thinking of the stuff I want to write in my letters.

I was wondering if anyone could help interpret why thereâ€™s been such a sudden shift. I donâ€™t understand. Why, in my current state of content, do I want it more than ever?
