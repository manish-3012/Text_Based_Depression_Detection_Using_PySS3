I canâ€™t tell who or what is real or fake anymoreI think tonightâ€™s the night I might kill myself. I just canâ€™t tell whoâ€™s being real with me and whoâ€™s fucking with me. I canâ€™t take anything at face value and itâ€™s taking its toll on my mental health. Iâ€™ve always been told Iâ€™m funny but also retarded and Iâ€™ve started to believe maybe Iâ€™m actually dumb af. And in serious situations idk if people are being nice to me because they feel bad or if theyâ€™re real with me. Other shit plays into factor here like Iâ€™m 26 working a shit job 2 1/2 hours away from friends, and parents are dead and Iâ€™m stuck and canâ€™t think of my future and have no idea where to go or what to do, so might as well die.
