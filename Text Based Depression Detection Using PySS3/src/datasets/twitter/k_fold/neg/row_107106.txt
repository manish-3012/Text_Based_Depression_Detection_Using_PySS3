I think my time is coming.I donâ€™t see a point. I donâ€™t see a future. I donâ€™t see anything anymore. I have nobody left. Nobody with me, nobody near me. Every passing day the urge to leave grows. Iâ€™m not going to fight the urge anymore. Why am I here? Iâ€™m sick of this place. 

Nobody does anything I need them to. Nobody to feel okay with. Iâ€™m here though, and while Iâ€™m here they hurt me. They take advantage of me. They kick me around left and right with their actions, their words. This world will keep turning without me. I am insignificant in this world, just as Iâ€™m insignificant in my own community. 

This urge keeps telling me to go. I wonâ€™t fight anymore. I feel relieved when I think of my death.  I feel so much pain, yet so much peace. I know it will be over soon. My life will be over soon. Too soon. And itâ€™s so wonderful. 

Goodnight.
