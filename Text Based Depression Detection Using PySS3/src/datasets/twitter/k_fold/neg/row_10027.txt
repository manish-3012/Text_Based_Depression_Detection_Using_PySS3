I'd rather take my own life than let my father do itMy father said that if he ever caught me smoking weed or tobacco he'd shoot me. Well he found my pipe, vape, and other stuff so.. I guess this is goodbye. I hear him finding his gun.

I want to die with dignity and I'm going to take things into my own hands.

Thank you reddit for being the best community I ever joined.

Goodbye world..
