I'm fucking pathetic.My life is shit. No friends, everyone hates me, I find no enjoyment in anything. So what's the point in me being alive? I share no traits of any normal person. They enjoy stuff have hobbies friends and care about family. But I don't have any of that. I hate everything and everyone I'm outside in the public I look at them smile and laugh and wonder how the fuck people can do that. my life is misery loneliness and boring. I'm losing patience with this world and don't think I will make it another year. Not at this rate or state I'm in. Someone please tell me how to enjoy life.
