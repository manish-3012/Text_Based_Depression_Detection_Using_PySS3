I told my family that I've considered suicide and now I feel like a fraudI've been going through a really rough patch and I've many times now considered suicide as a way out. This rough patch has also consisted of me being in a dull and shitty mood as well as abandoning social and school responsibilities. _x000D__x000D_The thing that makes me feel even more guilty is how nice and understanding everyone in the family is. They noticed my mood change and wanted to help, but they kept helping in the wrong ways and eventually I broke down and told them I'm suicidal and can't get anything in my life straight right now._x000D__x000D_Suddenly everyone went into overly nice mode and I feel like a dick for making everyone worry and being extra nice to me when I wouldn't have the courage to kill myself anyway. I feel like such an asshole for making people worry and such a whining loser about getting all caught up and I feel like I threatened suicide about my tiny problems in comparison to everyone else suffering and suicidal. And this just makes me want to kill myself all the more for being such a burden in everyone's life and for being unable to deal with my minor issues when everyone else is having such a tough time.
