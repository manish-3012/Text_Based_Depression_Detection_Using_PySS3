i canâ€™t handle being around my family and something happened to day that made it a million times worsetoday was the best day iâ€™ve had in months. i wasnâ€™t stressed and my family actually seemed  happy to be around me for the first time in years. the thing is something happened to me today and i never want to see a certain family member again. iâ€™ve always been uncomfortable around them my entire life and this further solidified that feeling. i canâ€™t tell anyone because any time i tell my family something this person does, they write it off as this persons dry humor. i donâ€™t know how to get over this. my entire family just accepts their odd behavior but i donâ€™t want to put up with it but i have no choice to.  i just feel sick to stomach.
