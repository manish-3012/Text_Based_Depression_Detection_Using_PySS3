Iâ€™m thinking of getting rid of myself I need adviceIâ€™m only 15 and Iâ€™m probably only looking for attention but I really want to end my life. I was diagnosed with depression months ago and I still canâ€™t get on with my life. I barely go to school, my family are sick of me, Iâ€™ve hit my mam multiple times, who is disabled might i add, Iâ€™m just not able to control myself no matter what I do and my family have even said nobody wants anything to do with me anymore. Should I just do it?
