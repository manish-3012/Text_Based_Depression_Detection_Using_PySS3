To all the people who say "you have so much to live for! I am here for you!" then aren't available when you try to reach out to them when actively suicidal.I am so sick of people's fake bullshit. 

Always the one reaching out to hang with people/make plans with people. Rewarded for this by just being told "but you're an extrovert! But you're the one who brings everyone together! But you have SUCH an incredible network of friends!"

Well, I am sick of being the one who brings everyone together. I am sick of being the "group mom." I am sick of the one NEEDING people, when these same people tell me I have *so much to live for* when I told them about having been actively suicidal last week, then just not plain being available to even answer the fucking phone when I am in the midst of a panic attack/flashback and could really use someone by my side.

Real friends? I don't know that I have any. And then you tell me I have so much to live for? Lmao
