Thought my problems would go awayMade a post to this sub before and got it removed because it was some bullshit motivational shit that wasn't any bit true and I just felt like I needed to do it to feel better and live a different life. I've been feeling like absolute human trash for so long its been hard to remember before I was so fucked up.

I have a lot of "reasons" I'm depressed and anxiety-ridden, big one was schools. I switched schools maybe 4 or 5 times in the past 5 or 6 years. I'm again going to a new school in September and it has probably opened my eyes that its none of my reasons I just feel like shit for nothing. I don't want to say my family is fucked up, yeah me and my sibling's fight but its normal. I have no reason at this point. The bullying hasn't affected me because I've been through it before about 5 times with new dickheads each time. I just feel like shit constantly and I'm so sick of it. Going to therapy every week for the past few years but with corona, it told me that it hasn't been working one bit since I felt the exact same during the lockdown. 

Came to this sub for two reasons,

1. I really want to get shit off my chest, it been hard to talk to anyone about this its really really hard.

2.  I know its really fuckin stupid and cringe but I don't feel right after making that post and I wanted to apologize if anyone actually saw the post it was absolutely stupid I ignored the rules completely it was retarded.

I have no clue what to do next or what I'm even doing right now but I'm just so fucking sick of this.
