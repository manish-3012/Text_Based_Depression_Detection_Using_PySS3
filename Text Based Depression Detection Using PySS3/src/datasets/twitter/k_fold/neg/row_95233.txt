Why bother continuing life?I am such a failure at life. I'm just a huge fuck up. It tears me apart to know I have no willpower to do anything to fix myself. 

I'm 18/m, failing out of college. Only my freshman year. Don't know what to do. Starting to become an alcoholic. Never had a girl nor kissed one. A huge social reject. I mean, why would anyone like a black, ugly, fat fuck like me. It also doesn't help that I live in the south and I'm attracted to girls of other races. Go figure.

My parents constantly tell me how proud they are of me. It's hard to tell them about my shortcomings. I'm a fraud. My parents are getting up in age (60s) and I'm disappointing or at least I feel like it. I'm on antidepressant meds now as well as sleep aid but I'm abusing it. I can't get my shit straight. I'm just really tired of everything. 

There's a lot more, but I think at this point, we'd all agree the world would be better off without this worthless scum.
