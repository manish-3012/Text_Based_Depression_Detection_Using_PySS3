Not sure what to doTl;dr: I am stressed by academics and pained by matters surrounding my ex-girlfriend. While I am too scared to actually attempt suicide, carrying on with life seems hard, and I don't know what to do.

I am having trouble, because I sometimes feel as though I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I ama college student, and It may sound really silly, but I am very stressed and scared about academics. I have this fear that I will not do well on my exams, etc., and yet I am scared/completely turned off by the thought of studying and putting in the effort so as to decrease my chances of failure. 

So there is that on one end.

On the other end, I am dealing with sadness and nostalgia about my ex-girlfriend, who I broke up with a few months ago and have more recently decided to stop communication with (so as to allow ourselves to move on). Still, I get moments of doubt about whether maybe I want to get back together with her. I miss the comfort of having her. But I know that being in a relationship with her will not solve my academic stress. So while it hurts to admit, I don't think that getting back together with her is right.

So I have these two sources of pain--academics and the matters surrounding my ex--that are making it seem hard to carry on. I am too scared to actually attempt committing suicide, but again, I don't want to carry on.
