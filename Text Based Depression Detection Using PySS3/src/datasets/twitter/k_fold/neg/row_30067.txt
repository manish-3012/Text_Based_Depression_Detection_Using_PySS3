How would you celebrate the anniversary of your failed suicide attempt?Today marks 3 years since my last suicide attempt. I'm in a much better place now &amp; I'd like to make this a yearly celebration for myself. How would you celebrate your life on the anniversary of a day you were going to kill yourself?
