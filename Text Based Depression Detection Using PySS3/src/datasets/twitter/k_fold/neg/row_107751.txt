Can someone please message my friend after Iâ€™m dead?Iâ€™m not looking to be convinced to liveâ€”Iâ€™ve exhausted my options and this is the best one. I just feel bad texting my friend right before it happens because I know him and heâ€™ll think he could have stopped me. Is there anyone I can message right before I go that wouldnâ€™t mind messaging him on facebook or texting him to let him know Iâ€™m gone? Iâ€™ll be out of smack on Thursday so itâ€™ll most likely be around then. 

Thank you sm
