Hating myself and losing myselfMy life should be awesome...my parents really had it tough...my mom and my dad were abused as children....I mean they've given me all they can...I'm just tired of having to live and be caught in a loop....I'm good at school when I focus...I've I focus....I am tall strong and I shouldn't be so f---d  in the head....I have this addiction...and it's screwing with my head...The only three people besides my parent's that I trusted stabbed me in the back and I can't do this shit anymore...I know I won't kill myself consciously...but....I can't take this...I have nightmares almost every night....I feel scared in the dark (and I'm 15)....I can't be alone otherwise I feel scared....I'm screw up....I tell my parents a little bit...just so I don't scare them...but addiction to...The Internet(u know what I mean) I can't do this anymore...I want to live...
I wish I could just be free from my stupid unnecessary mental "issues" I should be well balanced emotionally....is know one thing a nd that is that I have a second chance but I relapsed ever since my closest friends stabbed me on the back
...I stopped when I met them but afterwards......This isn't a urgent message....I don't want to talk...if any of u have similar problems, just say....i just needed to vent...and I guess the www is not the safest...but atleast I don't have to trust anyone and be hurt....I'm sorry for my sadass story...but I needed to say this....to someone at least....If any of u REALLY need help...remember that sometimes u gotta just fight for what u love and need..but don't do it on your own...It will screw u up...I guess that's a little hypocritical of me...but I might as well help someone with my stupid life....I just hope I can end my addiction and just be free once and for all
Edit: my "friends" were the only people other than a sibling that I trusted...th both stabbed me in the back...All for money....I feel like I shouldn't even be so distraught...I mean rejection is normal...but I don't experience rejection cause I'm home schooled
