Had my first genuine suicidal thought in over a yearI wake up in the morning and I just want to die. All day the only thing I can think about is how much I hate myself. The last 2.5 years of my life have been hell. I genuinely did not know it was possible for a human to suffer this much. I canâ€™t talk to anyone professionally. I canâ€™t afford therapy, my mom doesnâ€™t understand why I think I need it, and the last time I talked to the suicide hotline, they doxxed me and had the police kidnap me because I got angry at the woman on the other end for making an insulting insinuation about my family, they threw me in a psychiatric hospital, and all that did was make me afraid of the medical industry. I barely graduated high school and every time I try to go to college, I just canâ€™t fucking handle it, either because Iâ€™m distracted by the stress Iâ€™m in 24/7 or because I have a learning disability and in the end, nothing they can do within the regulations of the system will help me. I can barely get a job because Iâ€™m utterly useless as a person. I lost over a year of my life to depression, suicide attempts, and pills that did nothing for me, and even now that Iâ€™m technically â€œcuredâ€, I wonder why the fuck it matters because I sure as hell donâ€™t feel happy. Am I supposed to feel grateful that the scars on my body arenâ€™t visible at a glance anymore? At the end of 2018 I left an abusive sexual relationship and suffered for it all throughout 2019. I really, really wanted to stay silent but I was terrified into coming forward because I feared not doing so would mean that I would be isolated until no one would listen to me and someone else would get hurt. For a year Iâ€™ve had to relive the experience over and over and over again because it turned into a big deal and I guess I dug my own damn grave. Iâ€™ve lost friends, Iâ€™ve been harassed, Iâ€™ve been called a liar and an attention seeker by more people than I can count. Iâ€™m ashamed to think of how the environment I was in encouraged me to be unsafely promiscuous and so openly sexual that I was like a different person. Iâ€™m probably never going to be able to have sex again because I literally have no idea what a healthy relationship looks like. Sometimes I hear the couple who live below me screaming at each other and banging furniture and I force myself to put my ear to the floor until theyâ€™re done so that I can be sure that theyâ€™re both alive by the end of the day. Before I started living here, I lived with a roommate who drilled it into my head that I was an ugly, annoying bitch who had to go on a strict diet immediately because when we finally met, he decided I wasnâ€™t attractive after all. It fucked up my view of my body. I just canâ€™t be happy no matter what I do. One thing after another and IT NEVER ENDS. I wouldnâ€™t be shocked if I become an alcoholic again once I hit 21. It hurts to think. It just hurts to think.
