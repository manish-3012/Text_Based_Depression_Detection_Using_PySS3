There is no PointWhy even stick around to watch the world descend further into chaos? I wish I had killed myself over 10 years ago. 
The helplessness of knowing there are children whose homes are being destroyed as I post this, caught in a war zone and scarred for life. Innocence corrupted for absolutely no discernible reason. Politicians that lie through their teeth and arbitrary systems that favour the fortunate and punish the disadvantaged. 
I wake up every single day and dread it. I dread knowing that we are on a rock, slowly suffocating from human activity, and there are arguments being thrown around - sometimes violently - about how best to operate on said rock. Itâ€™s madness. Everybody just goes about their day without being crippled by hundreds and thousands of negative thoughts. 

You know, I listened to everybody who told me it would â€œget betterâ€, knowing this was a false promise as the universe does as it will, impervious of our wishes. You can work a billion times harder than the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, down to the bone even, and youâ€™re compensated a pittance that you must use to sustain your existence in a stressed-out state. Itâ€™s like we moved on from hunter-gatherer, then agrarian lifestyles, and nothing has really changed. Yes, we donâ€™t have to go out and scout for basic needs, but we do need to slave away *somewhere* in order to acquire the resources needed to stay alive. 

This existential dread has plagued me since I could understand it with any sort of cognisance. I donâ€™t want to pretend things will be okay, or that weâ€™re not headed for human extinction at a rapidly accelerating pace. 

Please kill me.
