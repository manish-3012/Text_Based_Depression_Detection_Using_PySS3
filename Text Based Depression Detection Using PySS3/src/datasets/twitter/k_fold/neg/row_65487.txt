My wife moved out &amp; divorced me (told me via text, no explanation). The business we spent our life savings on is ruined. Nothing is worth all the effort of rebuilding my life.I had everything I wanted, everything I had spent decades working toward. For a few glorious months, the future I dreamed of was in my hands. Then, out of nowhere, it all fell apart. I just. Want. To die. And I can't talk to anyone about it, they freak out when I even tell them I'm depressed enough to not see a real future. I tried telling several people who I trusted to suppose me... And they fucking abandoned me. There are people who say they care... And I want to reach out... But... I don't want them to feel responsible. 

If they had any clue, they might stop me. And I don't want them to. I just want time enough to build up the nerve to overcome this stupid fucking survival instinct. I have been researching suicide methods, and I think I've come up with a plan I can "live with" haha. Now I just... *Sigh* I'm almost glad I'm running out of reasons to feel anything any more. I am almost ready. I don't fear death any more. I have started to yearn for it. 

I just want to die.
