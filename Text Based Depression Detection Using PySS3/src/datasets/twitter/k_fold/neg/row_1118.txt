GoodbyeI'm going to buy a rope tomorrow and wait until Tuesday night to hang myself. I'm going to write a few suicide notes for my parents and wife. Hopefully it hurts my parents but I honestly doubt that it will. I'm completely done with this life and it can't be worse at least I'll be in a better place whether it's heaven or hell.
