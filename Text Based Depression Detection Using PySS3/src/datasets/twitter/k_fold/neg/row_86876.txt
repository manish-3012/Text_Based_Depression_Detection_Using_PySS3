I'm finally done.In about an hour I am going to finally go through with ending my life. Recently, I have fucked a lot of things up and honestly...I don't want to fix them. So I'm ending it. 

I realized that I don't want to fix something in order for it to break again. It hurts too much and I can feel my body wanting to die too. I keep telling myself if I kill myself now, my afterlife will be reliving my happiest memories and just that. That is what I want to believe and I think I've deluded myself into thinking it's true.

But I'm okay, this makes me calm and I hope I'll be happy soon.
