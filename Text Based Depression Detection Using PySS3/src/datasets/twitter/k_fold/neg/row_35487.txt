im patheticIm a burden to my mum and my family and the only way I can see it stopping is if i die but even the i dont want my death to burden them

Im 20 and im incapable of doing so many things on my own because of mental illness and ive been in and out of therapy since i was 12 and im still fucking like this and im over it 

Iâ€™ll never be normal and like other people my age and ive missed out on so much itâ€™s pathetic. i havnt had a friend in 6 years and ive kind of accepted that im probably never going to have one 

Im so dependant of others its just a matter of time until my family have enough of me and finally kick me out and then ill inevitably kill myself
