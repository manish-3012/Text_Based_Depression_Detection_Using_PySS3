This pandemic is my best chance.Today, I realized how convenient it would be to get COVID-19 and hopefully die from it. I wouldn't have to face life anymore but my family and others around me would never know I was troubled. I had this moment where I was the surest I have ever been that I would rather be dead than continue with this pitiful existence.  It's a little sad that my mood actually improved  imagining the virus giving me  a way out. It was the  weirdest case of optimism ever. I used to just hope for road accidents and things like that but it feels like I'm more likely to get this virus considering the growth rate. 

I wonder how I became this person. Instead of dying, I wish I could go back years ago to a time I was confident and happy and then make different choices with the benefit of hindsight.
