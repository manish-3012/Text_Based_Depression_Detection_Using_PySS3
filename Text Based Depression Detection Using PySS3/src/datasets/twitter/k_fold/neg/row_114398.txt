If I died right now no one would find me for weeks.I really want to kill myself. Somehow, despite my best intentions I have attempted and failed out of three colleges. I can't hold down a job because any minimum wage thing where I have to deal with the assholes and perverts of the general public gets unbearable to me after about a year. I have a hairstyling license, but I can't hold down a job with that either because I am so shitty and undisciplined. I'm almost 30 but my parents have to pay my rent and bills because I can't get it together right now. I feel like when I do get it together I can only juggle everything for so long until it all come crashing down and I have to start over. over and over. My stepdad is a good guy but never calls me and i'm pretty sure secretly despises the person i've grown up into almost more than I do. My mom pays for everything and buys me all this great stuff and I am still short and snippy with her when I've had a bad day. My boyfriend brings up what a waste of space i've become every time we fight and even though he apologizes I can tell deep down he means it. I don't have any friends anymore. I either push them away so they don't have to deal with my messy self or they see the red flags and bail. Also, I am going to have a cyst removed from my lady parts in a week and a half so they can do a biopsy. I almost hope it's cancer. I feel like a deserve it. If I died my family wouldn't have to continually pay my way through life. Everyone would be better off or unfazed if I just killed myself right now. The only thing stopping me is that my dog is here. I don't want him to have to be alone, worried, or hungry for that long. Sometimes I think about just taking a bunch of pills, but on days where I have really let the people I love down I almost feel like I deserve a painful death. That I'm so stupid and worthless that I've somehow avoided the darwin-esque brutal end I truly deserve. I feel like I deserve punishment. How can I become a person of value? How can I even delusionally hope for that after all the times I failed? Please help me reddit!
