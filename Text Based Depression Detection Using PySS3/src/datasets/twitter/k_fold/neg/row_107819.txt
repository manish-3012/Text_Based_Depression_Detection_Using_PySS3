How do I tell someone that I've reaffirmed the decision to die and will be doing it soon?I haven't been answering her calls or texts because I'm trying to figure out how to tell her. She thinks I'm going to go in to a psychiatric facility for 28 days and then go stay with her. I'm not. I'm done. There is no hope, nothing I could build for myself in the future would be worth the further suffering it would require to attain and maintain it. I'm in constant severe physical pain, constant severe emotional pain as well. I love my cats but I know that when they're rehomed they will be okay, they'll be out of my mother's hoarding house and they'll be with people who will be able to do more for them. They'll live in homes where they don't have to be confined to specific areas when they can't be watched for fear of something falling and crushing them. They'll be safe. Nothing is keeping me here and the fact that when the police speak to my mental health workers they will end up asking my family about the abuse - it is too tempting. Even though I'm certain they will lie and pretend they have done nothing to me over the years, they'll have no choice but to consider it internally at the least. That's the closest thing to revenge I'll ever get and living isn't worth giving that up. So how do I tell my friend? I'm sure she'll try to intervene some way or convince me to keep going but I need her to understand it is the only possible outcome at this point.
