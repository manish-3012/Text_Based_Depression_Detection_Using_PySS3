Would this be considered a downward spiral?I had social issues ever since I began school. No close friends for longer than 8 months for some reason. Like the more a person gets to know me, the less interested they are. I can never gain respect due to interpersonal interactions, which makes work painful. Speaking of work, not even McDonald's wanted to hire me after interview. I can't do well in school anymore since it feels like my antianxiety medicine drops my IQ. I put in my resignation that morning, yet my dad texts me saying he had cancer and what matters is graduating. My heart sunk. I would love to graduate, but I haven't even told him I can't keep failing like I do. Also my only friend in the state who is also my ex, decided to move on and abandon me. I can't talk to my family about anything since they're "old school" about it. Therapy doesn't seem to help. I just want to numb myself permanently. I often wish I was mute, because it seems like I don't ever say the right thing.
