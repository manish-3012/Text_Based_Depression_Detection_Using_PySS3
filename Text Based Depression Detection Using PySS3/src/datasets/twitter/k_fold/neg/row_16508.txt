Iâ€™ve spent a quarter of my life suicidal and day by day just wonâ€™t cut it anymore.I allready have very little enjoyment jn my life and am mostly just trying to pacify myself. I may mor maynot be transgender wich is something my gf would not be okay with if i was. And just that conflict all-ready wrecks me, since sheâ€™s quire literally the only person I care about. Further more I just keep hurting her and treating her in a way she doesnâ€™t deserve to. And I feel like i might actually be transgender and to be sure i think iâ€™m going to have to break up with her. And since sheâ€™s the one reason I havenâ€™t killed myself, Iâ€™m not sure how iâ€™ll be able to manage leaving her, even if itâ€™s on my own accord. Iâ€™ve allready lived a full and fuffiling life expecially according to my age. And i feel like the only future things Iâ€™ll be missing is pain, since joy, as of now, is a foreign concept to me.
