I'm ready to give upMy life has had a pattern for years. Ebb and flow. Get settled, lose everything.
Get settled, lose everything.

It's coming again. I can't find any way out. I can't find any hope. The government has basically made it impossible for me to even try and use what limited resources there are.

In two weeks I'll have nothing. Again. I'd rather be nothing. I'm too tired to go through this all again. 

There's no point to living when you never pass a certain point. When you never feel safe.
