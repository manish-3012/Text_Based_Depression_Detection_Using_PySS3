This Community is All I HaveI (26/F) recently came home from the hospital after spending one day in the ER and five days in the Behavioral Health Unit for trying to committ suicide. I almost succeeded, but I made a phone call to my mom (which I don't remember because I was so drugged out on Advil and alcohol), and she was able to get an ambulance to me in time. Anyways, I'm living with my parents now. Whenever I have a bad day, raise my voice even a little, etc my mom tells me to, "Stop acting crazy, stop being manic, stop being a bipolar bitch." I have PTSD, chronic depression, Major Depression Disorder, and Seasonal Affective Disorder. She has no idea how much this bothers me. Why would she say that to me. Seriously. How does she justify saying that? Because I spent six days in a behavioral health unit? That was one of the worst experiences of my life, and I'm constantly reminded of it when she says these things. It just hurts. She's my mom, and she's supposed to be there for me and help me through this. Right? I'm all alone, and now I don't feel comfortable even talking to my mom. This community is all I have, thanks for being there for me everyone.
