Is suicide by self starvation better than slitting wrists?I don't know which one should I choose as a method to commit suicide. I have free will to starve myself but is slitting better option? Also I can overdose with pills but it won't guarantee me a sure death. I'll end up being saved and which one is the least painful from this listed feminine suicide methods? Slitting = I don't have a balls to do it, If I don't cut deep I end up having paralyzed arm, If I cut deep I'll die in 2 hours but it's sure death, I'll experience shock, and heart attack or failure whatever. Overdosing= the death isn't guaranteed, I can end up being saved Starvation= takes longer but I'll have to go to school in 10 days but I can't even show myself at school, but if I'm sure that it would be less painful method than I'll go to school and wait 31 days without eating just drinking water then finally I'll die? What should I do? Also you're delusional if you say don't commit suicide but I know most of you will say that. No matter what you're going to say I'm sure that I want to die and that's why I'm writting this because the table of suicide methods doesn't show real agony of suicide methods. Also I'm 15 that's why I have no balls to cut that deep to hit artery. Don't sympathize me for being 15 years old PLEASE FKIN DON'T. I can't think about more serious suicide methods.
