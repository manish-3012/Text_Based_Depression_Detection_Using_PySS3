I'm not doing so wellI need help. I tried helping myself and I feel worse than ever. I recently moved to a new city and started a clean slate. The only problem is I feel worse. No one cares, here or back home. I never get any calls saying that I am missed. I see everyone living life happily and normally without me confirming that I wasnt a factor. I feel worse than ever and am contemplating just ending it. 

It sounds selfish that the reason is because no one will miss me, but I am not happy and if I am not making anyone else happy why am i here. I'm not sure why I am posting this, maybe it is for verification to not do it, or for a reason to do it, but I feel like no one gives a shit about me.
