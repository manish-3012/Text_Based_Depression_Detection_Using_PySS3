&gt;insert whiny attention grabbing title here&lt;Failed school, failed college, can't get a job, had my driver lessons delayed by a year because my family are too miserable to pay for them which only means another year of inducing more stress and anxiety over not being able to pass it. Also just lost my best friend over some petty bullshit and now our friendship's completely ruined. He meant everything to me, when i was not dealing with my family's bullshit he'd be there to remind me that i at least i have something to be grateful for in my pathetic excuse for a life but nope i fucked it up like everything else and now i'm all alone with zero friends which as sad as that fucking sounds, it just gives me all the more fuel to go ahead and end my shit life so at least that's a plus. Already have some plans set in motion and i'm hellbent on following through with them. Not that anyone cares anyway, i'm a fucking idiot and i'll be reduced to nothing more than a statistic soon so whatever. Life is fucking pointless asf when you have a mental illness
