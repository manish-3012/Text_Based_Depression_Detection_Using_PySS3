Hi AgainHi again.

It's funny that I always turn to this subreddit to post to when I've hit another wall.

I have a job now that by all accounts is an "adult" job. I don't want to say too much about this. But it depresses me for reasons I can't disclose other than I'm very bad at it, and nobody knows how bad I actually am at it. 

They'll find out, though. Secretly being bad at a job is the worst feeling, because you know that eventually, the other shoe will drop.

I have a partner, and I love them. But I feel so lonely still. I want them to give me support in ways that they can't understand. I keep saying "if I die" to them in casual conversations. I really mean "when I die." At least I think I do. I've been posting here for years now. Everyone who sees that is probably rolling their eyes into the back of their heads.

"But you've hung on for this long!"

Yup, and my life has improved. You were all correct. But the feelings are just getting worse and worse. 

Things get better. Feelings don't change. Maybe they can. Maybe they can't. I have no idea, I'm not a doctor, and I can't afford to speak to one anymore.

But without medicine, the illness just festers. It runs healthy tissue and taints the ones you love.

That's what sickness does, right? Depression is like a contagion, I think. So many more people are sad. So many more people than ever before.

We keep inventing things, but we can't even fix social issues. I used to care about politics, education, the youth. 

I just don't care anymore, because there is no solution.

No solutions exist for me. No solutions exist for the world.

I'll see you all next year.
