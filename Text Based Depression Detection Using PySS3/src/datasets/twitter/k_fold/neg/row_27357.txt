this world is fucked upi created a new account to remain anonymous. this all began on my 9th birthday. i got my presents and played with my friends. then i remember that my report card was about to come home in a letter from my school stating that because of my misbehavior (hitting and kicking kids), i was suspended for three days (the maximum amount for a **school** to give out **NOT** the district). let me explain before i am called a bully. i am autistic and have adhd. i have since grown out of my adhd a bit. anyway, at school i was made fun of for my autism. every time i went on the bus i had to just let them hit me. the day before my birthday, this kid (we will call him Jim) hit my friend (we will call him Bob). jim was about to come back and snap me in the jaw, but i kicked him as hard as i could in the nuts. he went crying to the bus driver, pointed to me and i literally said "oh shit." The bus driver stopped the bus, came back to where i was sitting and took my flip phone (my parents gave it to me just in case something went wrong at the house because they couldnt be home when i was), then hit me in the stomach so i hit him back and tried to defend myself. my parents asked where my phone was when i got home and i said "i lost it" because i knew they would not be happy, and i didnt want to tell them about the situation on the bus, being almost my birthday and all. so the get the letter and i tell them the story, but they didnt listen to me. i had to deal with this situation on the bus for 4 years (until i went to high school). everything was fine until august 2015. my dad got angry about something (idk he wouldnt tell me) and i said "was it jenny(my step-mom)." apparently he took offense to this then pushed me down the stairs. every day he is trying and trying to make my life hell such as saying he lost my homework (we have a system so i could keep up with stuff that we made in the 5th grade when i was failing) then me finding it under the coach. he has done more then this but i need answers. i am crying myself to sleep at night. i just wanna end this all cause the only family i have is my mom, and my dad wont let my mom take me to her apartment. i miss her. im pissed, im depressed, i am every emotion but happy. god end me. **EDIT: i mustered the courage to call 1-800-SUICIDE. they suggested i keep a journal until i go to college. i plan to press charges, but i just really want to have family. the only family i have is on my dads side. the family on my moms side does exist, but they are a bad influence. they do drugs and i have never been that kind of person. also heres more info about me... i am 17, sophomohre (held back for all that homework my dad hid) and i am on the autism spectrum for asperger's syndrome. more info on aspergers [here.](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergers_Syndrome)
