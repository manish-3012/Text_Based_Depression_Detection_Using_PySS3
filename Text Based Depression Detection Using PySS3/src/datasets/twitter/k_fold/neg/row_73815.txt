Will i be punished if i end it? Why do we have to be hostages?Ive been researching alot lately about near death experiences in suicide cases, and tbh they seem comforting. Knowing ill have peace once i end it all, the problem is I KNOW my mom will be devastaded, and my brother act like a douche, he will be useless in helping my mom cope... What can i do? I dont wanna live, i cant see people and family relatives around me are getting married, happy lives, children, working and having success while im still left behind, broke, alone, void and getting older, i just want to live in my dreams where im eternally driving in gorgeous sea coast highways, flying high with misterious vision and sunset in the horizon...

I cant cope with this reality, and the fact that i love my mom soo much is taking me hostage, i cant end it but im suffering...
