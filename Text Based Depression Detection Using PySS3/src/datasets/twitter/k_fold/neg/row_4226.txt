Why shouldn't I kill myself?If there's nothing you can do, or want to do, and if there's nothing that brings you real enjoyment: why continue living? 

I have never really enjoyed life. Everything has felt wrong in some shape or form as long as I can remember. Just pretty much an endless string of humiliation and failure from the very start, or not even trying ... Or wanting to try.

Why would you continue doing that? "*Live the life you want to live. You only do it once. Don't waste it.*". There is nothing whatsoever that I want, I have already wasted it. It's just more humilitation and failure waiting around the corner. I feel like I'm  working towards an embarrasing life in utter poverty and misery, maybe even homelessness. Yet I can't bring myself to care?
