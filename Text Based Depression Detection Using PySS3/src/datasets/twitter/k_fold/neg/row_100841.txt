Nobody gives two fucks about me or my health. Nobody ever answers me. Doctors won't help me. I'm unheard and unwanted.I was admitted to hospital 5 times from January 2014-March 2014. They kept discharging me before I was ready, so I kept ending up back in the emergency room. Anyway, after the inpatient stays, I was doing pretty good until October. I still ended up in the ER a few times throughout this time, but I felt decent overall. 

Then, in October I completely relapsed. I became agoraphobic, anxious, nauseated daily, cycling from depressed to normal to happy, and this is how I am now. 

My GP refuses to prescribe meds or do anything. He's pretty much useless for me. 

The psychiatrist I used to see says I am unwilling and don't want to get better. WTF? I assume he is saying this due to my missed appointments with my counselor(BECAUSE of my agoraphobia) 

I'm banned from the hospital. I'm allowed to go to the emergency room, but I will NEVER be inpatient again. They say i'm "dependent". I assume my ex psychiatrist made this happen. So, I can't even go there for help.

There is nothing for me anymore. Theres one hospital in town, and only a few psychiatrists in town. A psychologist is 200 dollars per hour. The wait lists for any free service is 10+ months. I can't leave my house. I'm always nauseated and/or in pain. I just can't do it anymore. Jesus help me.

Please let my poor soul into heaven christ. Fucking dammit why are doctors so stupid? 

This is it.

I've gotten more mental health information and more self help techniques from the internet than I have EVER gotten from any counselor or doctor. 

Fuck you Vancouver Island, and fuck your health "services". You've driven me, and i'm sure many others, to suicide.
