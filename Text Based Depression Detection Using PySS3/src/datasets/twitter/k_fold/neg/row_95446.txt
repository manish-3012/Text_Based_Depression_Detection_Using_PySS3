What would you do?So yeah. Brutal honesty. This is absolutely fucked. I am sitting here writing this while drinking a pint of Bacardi. 

Every day I take a stimulant drug to operate and combat ADHD, unsure if I even have to do this, but it feels good, and I'm an addict. But then I drink caffeine to give me a better high (??) I also smoke cigarettes the whole time because they feel better when I'm up and I'm addicted, I think. Basically I'm always on top of the world for a few hours, maybe half a day at best. I'm super happy and write about it alot. And then I CRASH. ALWAYS. BAD.

So then we get to the evening. I'm crashing and unhappy. So I drink inhuman amounts of alcohol. This either results in me being passed out, or being too anxious to actually sleep. In this case I take sleeping medication to make that happen.

So basically. I wake up, consume a Stimulant, drink Caffeine, then take some Anti-Anxiety Pills to stabilize and relax, Drink Alcohol in the evening to cool off, smoke Marijuana afterwards sometimes to slow down, then always take a Sleeping Pill to pass out. EVERY DAY YO. ???

I work in between all of this and everything seems OK for now. But yo. I can't continue to do this long term.

The reason for this post is that my soul is collapsing entirely. Unsure if I'll make it through this week.

This is all every day for maybe a year. I'm losing it. I don't feel like a person anymore. Unsure who I am even talking to at this point but I just need to say this to whoever wants to care even a bit. 

I need help.

Any comment is welcome, negative or positive, I just am unsure what to do. I didn't fully describe this well, but fuck it I think I said what was necessary. 

Unsure. 

What would you do if you were in this situation?

Thanks.
