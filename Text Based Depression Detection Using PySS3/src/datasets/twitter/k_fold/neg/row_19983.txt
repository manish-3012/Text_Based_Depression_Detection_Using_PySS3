Should i end it now soon, or wait 6 months until i try my first psychedlics?1. Everyday is a hard mess, and the only reason why i am still around to type this, is because in 6 months i will get a job, and get psychedelics from the DW.

2. No point of waiting

Whenever i feel like i should end it, but not exactly suicidal, just a crappy life, and childhood ended, i do bot know what to just do with being feeling less.

Psychedelic i deeply believe will help, but can someone just tell me just 6 months left, and i will feel alive?
