Tired of constantly feeling aloneI'm so tired of feeling alone. I'm heart feels so empty and I'm extremely tired of feeling this way. I have nothing and no one. I don't even have the courage to kill myself. I'm such a useless coward. So now I'm just stuck in limbo hoping that everyday I wake up I finally have the courage to do it.
