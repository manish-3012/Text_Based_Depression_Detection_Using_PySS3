I wanna kill myself because of schoolSo I'm 14 and in 8th grade and I wanna die
So for some backstory: I've always been an okay student. I've only gotten A's in like 2 subjects, in others I usually passed with C's or E's. I didn't have many friends but I was on everyones good side, my absolute best friend went to another school but that's fine, we hung out on weekends. I attented every lesson, ate lunch everyday, respected my teachers, and despite being shy I tried to raise my hand and answer questions. I also kept my hands off my phone most of the time. Everything was good. Then when I started 6th grade it started to get worse. I still had all my friends and my family life was normal, but I felt slightly sadder than before, and less motivated. I started to be late more and halfway through the year I stopped eating lunch. I was also getting distracted way easier and started using my phone more. I still did my best though, although my best abilities had decreased some. In 7th grade, it really just crashed down. For no reason I stopped attending certain classes, specifically math and art. Did I mention I never really liked math anyways? Naturally, I started failing in these subjects. Of course this was dumb but I just kept skipping more and more classes, eventually I stopped going altogether. I've always been a night owl but I started taking it to the next level: I fell asleep at like 7, the time I was supposed to wake up. Nowadays my sleep schedule changes every week. I barely go to school anymore. I'm failing every subject. My brother is calling me lazy, my parents are understandably dissapointed in me. The only friends I have are my online friends who I honestly owe my life to, I love them like I love my mom. Sometimes my classmates ask where I am and I just say I'm sick. I know they don't believe it but wtf should I say anyways
Yeah I think that wraps it up, my life is going downhill and I'm not doing anything. Please help
