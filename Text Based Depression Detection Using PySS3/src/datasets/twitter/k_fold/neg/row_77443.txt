Tour of pleasuresYes my favorite movie is Scent of a woman. 
My last couple days before my birth/death day I want to go see something amazing nature or other wise, eat at a fancy restaurant, go for a long drive in my pickup I absolutely love. Talk to my brother for a and then Iâ€™m gonna go to a nice quiet spot turn on my location so theyâ€™ll know where to look and when the sun starts to rise on my bday I will blow my brains out.
