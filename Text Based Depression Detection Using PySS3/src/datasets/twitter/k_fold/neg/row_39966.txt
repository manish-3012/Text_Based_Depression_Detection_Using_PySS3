I know nothing is going to get betterEverything in my life is horrible. My anxiety, my stress, and my depression gets worse every single day. People tell me "things will get better" but obviously things are not. God seems to be telling me to commit suicide by some of the shadows I see being in the shape of the knife, making me mistake a text message a friend sent me for a suicidal threat, and committing suicide in my dreams. I've tried it but decided not to in real life. I thought I deserved to live a full life, but I regret that option now and I think I'm about to commit suicide soon. I've gone through this type of pain for years. My parents hate me, I have no friends to talk to, and if I do have any conversation with anyone my anger issues work up and they start hating me like the rest. A lot of people can't even relate to what I've gone through and just say random words they think is "helpful." But I'm already done with life by now. I just need to die, it's my only escape from this hell hole.
