My friend will commit suicide on the 18th of August (Results day in the UK). How do I prevent her from doing it?She's been officially diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder last week Thursday. She told me and only me that she has planned it on results day no matter what the result she gets for her exam. She told me her method, it's by taking an excess of medication.  It's not about the exam results. It's been a lot of things. She has been bullied by her former friends. They've called her a lot of things like she should be ashamed of calling herself religious when she has a boyfriend etc. Her parents are quite strict with her, they think she has a boyfriend and if they find out it's not good news. She hasn't been eating well either. She's lost a lost of weight. She does see a psychiatrist but I don't know if it's helping or not. I don't know what to do. I'm going to call 999 on that day but I don't know what else to do. Please help me. I'm not trolling or anything. She has told me "I don't want to deal with this anymore" "I'm so done" etc.
