piti'm in a pit, a pit so deep that no matter my strength or shear will, i'll never escape this pit.

all the times people would walk this ground that they should have tread lightly on, they hurt the ground. this ground has been slowly sinking. this ground was the path that was never meant to be taken. but was

over time, the path had become obvious, causing others to walk this path. but this path was on important ground. so many people walk this path. the path was like a scar on the arm. a deep scar. and the ground there became a hole, and the people there had covered and hid the hole, as so i wouldn't get upset. i fell into the hole and i cannot get out.

the hole only gets deeper. with no way out. the dirt in this hole is dull and lifeless. it provides nothing. so why stay in it?
