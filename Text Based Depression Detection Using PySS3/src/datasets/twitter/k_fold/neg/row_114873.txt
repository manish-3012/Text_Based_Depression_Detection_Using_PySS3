this is it reddit.im done. i've failed at everything i've ever done. i have not eaten since yesterday morning. my dogs have no food. they looking helplessly at me as i sit here and type this. I dont have anything to give them. i'm tired of this. sick and tired. 

i've been thinking about this for a while. my boss called me into his office today and fired me. 

i am broke and starving. i have nothing to feed my dogs. i have nothing to feed myself. i have nothing. i do not know anyone well enough to ask for money.

this is one i don't think i can dig myself out of. 

i'm going to make the decision soon.
