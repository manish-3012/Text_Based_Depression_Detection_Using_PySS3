I want to drink cyanideI am ultra sensitive to correction and criticism, unfortunately I come from a family that loves to deliver it. I wonder when I'll be perfect enough for my parents to shut their mouths. I think of all my personal negative traits then death seems like a good option. I'm too embarrassed to reveal this to my family. My father didn't believe I was bipolar for years and thought it was an attention seeking tactic. I often wish I were perfect. My life doesn't seem worth while until I reach perfection.
