I need an out.Hello. Iâ€™ve been silently crying in my hotel room for the past hour now. Iâ€™ve been looking at savings accounts, credit cards, dorms at my college, and full time jobs in my area to get my mind off of things.. but itâ€™s not really working and I know Iâ€™m at a breaking point so I need to get this off my chest.

I donâ€™t know when I can actually do this, but I need to move out of my parents house immediately. Iâ€™m 19 about to turn 20 next month, and some things have happened recently thatâ€™s forced my family and I out of our house. Itâ€™s currently being fixed but I donâ€™t think I can stand staying there too much longer, namely because of my mother.

I donâ€™t have a car or a license yet, but Iâ€™m desperately trying to get one before my birthday. Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™m going to pay for one since Iâ€™m a student and can only really work twice a week but I need to figure it out. I canâ€™t stay in my parents place. I canâ€™t be anywhere near my mother. Itâ€™s a constant stress, constant screaming everyday, constant freaking out, constant irrational behavior.

I hate being around her. I hate when she talks to me. I hate her lack of need to even take a second to listen and consider other people.

Last night I and the family member Iâ€™m sharing a room with are hungry, so that prompts us to ask her to take us somewhere to get something to eat. Mind you, I live in a place that almost requires a car to get anywhere, and being that weâ€™ve already been displaced, are staying in a hotel, and have had to spend over $1500-2000 in two days alone, we werenâ€™t looking to go through the hassle of extra money involving Delivery. (Looks like now we need to but anyway) I ask my mother several times if sheâ€™s going to take us to get something to eat.   Instead of informing anyone that sheâ€™s actually going out with her friends, she blows up and starts bitching about how everybody relies on her to get anything done. This is hours directly after everyoneâ€™s In the car talking about what we want for dinner that night. Her reply then was â€œok we can do that.â€ Now itâ€™s â€œyouâ€™re all grown adults. Why do I need to drive you anywhere? Donâ€™t you understand that I need a breather? I was just displaced.â€

We all live in the same house as her. Weâ€™ve all been displaced. Sheâ€™s the only one in the house with a car, so I understand the frustration of having to drive people everywhere but given the situation, Iâ€™m not sure I can wrap my head around why we had to take the brunt of her anger being that weâ€™ve ALL been going through hell these past few days. Not just her. Also, how is anyone supposed to know that youâ€™re actually going out if you donâ€™t tell them first? Were we supposed to know telepathically? Was I supposed to know better than to ask my own mother to clarify that she wasnâ€™t going to take me anywhere to pick up food?

This morning Iâ€™m eating breakfast with my mother in the lobby and she exclaims that nobodyâ€™s paying for her gas money, nobody considers how she feels, and that she doesnâ€™t understand why she needs to explain to everybody where she was going last night. That resulted in a huge fight with her this morning and thus led me to where Iâ€™m at now.

I was going to originally post this in AITA yesterday but Iâ€™m so far past that.

I could go on and on, I could write two long posts alone about her but Iâ€™m too tired for that.

Iâ€™ve been emotionally tired for years now and the constant depression is getting to be too much. Usually when I get myself into a deep depression I get suicidal. Itâ€™s weird typing it out like that, since itâ€™s the sort of thing I think about everyday, but itâ€™s more of a serious thing when I get into these ruts.

I donâ€™t know my way out right now, Not really. It seems like the only choice I have is to drop out of school and get a full time job. I donâ€™t want to do that but I really donâ€™t see any other options. My college dorms are too expensive and if I canâ€™t afford to pay for that, I donâ€™t think I can afford to get a roommate at an apartment outside of that.

Friends arenâ€™t an option. Other family members arenâ€™t an option.

I feel like Iâ€™m trapped. My depression is going to get worse this weekend. I know that for a fact. 

I just.. I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know anymore, I just donâ€™t know.
