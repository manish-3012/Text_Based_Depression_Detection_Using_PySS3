I don't think it's worth it anymoreI don't think living is worth it for me. What's the point? What's the meaning of all this suffering? There's a light at the end of the tunnel? Not for me, no.

 "It'll all get better". It's been years and I'm still suffering from crippling depression (and two types at that!), anxiety, BPD and more. I've lived through losing my dad at a young age, dropping out twice even though I'm smart, losing friends, being constantly backstabbed, having my digestive system go to shit, getting headaches every fucking day, not being able to read / write / watch movies or even fucking playing video games. How the fuck am I supposed to unwind and relax when the only stimuli is stress and I have no means of relaxing?

Tried all kinds of medication, therapists, meditation and every thing. I'm exhausted. Don't tell me "it'll be worth the pain" because NOTHING in this world is worth the pain I'm going through. Don't tell me there's a God. Don't tell me there's hope.
