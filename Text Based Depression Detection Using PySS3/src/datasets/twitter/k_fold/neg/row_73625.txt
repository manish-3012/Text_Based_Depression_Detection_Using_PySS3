FMLI first tried to kill myself at 12, and at 27 I have spent more of my life suicidal than not. I have felt particularly depressed that past 4 months. Tonight I  realised that there is literally nothing that I'm living for. I'm with my husband and two best friends, and yet if i had a knife in my hand i would not be sure whether I would use it.
