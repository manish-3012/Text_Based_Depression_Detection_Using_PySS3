Trapped in a vicious, never ending cycle for the past 14 years14 years.

I've dealt with this for 14 years now. One of my earliest memories was writing a letter apologizing for wanting to disappear but not knowing how in 2nd grade. 14 years of voices constantly telling you that you don't matter, you're too dumb and too ugly and too mean and too awkward and you just don't hold any value, and this would be a better world without you.

Sometimes it gets better. A ray of light, a warm hand, a peal of laughter that stills time and all seems well. But slip up a bit, see a slight frown, hell even get a compliment, and the voices become overpowering. 14 years of conditioning triumphs in the end.

So you're stuck in this vicious cycle of ups and downs for the past 14 years up til now. Seasons of believing that things are finally looking up and making active steps to a better future, and even more seasons of getting worse and worse and worse until you finally hit rock bottom. You unravel to be the hollow, soulless pit and you don't realize how much it's been eating away chunk by agonizing chunk your entire life. 

I'm tired. I want to go to sleep and stop hurting other people. They think I'm doing this for me. They don't understand--I'm doing this for them. It's always been about protecting them. To keep them away from me. They think I'm gonna get better. Do I really have the means to? Will 14 years of constant torture and having to wake up knowing the fact that I'll never amount to anything really just go away like that? I'm confused. I don't know anymore. I'm done with my mind swinging back and forth like a pendulum. I just want to end it all. I just want to end it all.
