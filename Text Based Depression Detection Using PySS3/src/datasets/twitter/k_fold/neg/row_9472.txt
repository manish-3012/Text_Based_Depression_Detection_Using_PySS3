Why does everything seem to go the wrong way for me?Title.

I'm waiting for university reassessment results atm. The results come out in about 21 days.

If I fail this reassessment, I'll have to repeat the year. I fear that the unit teacher hates me because I argued against their decision in the first exam.

I failed the first exam due to some minor technical difficulties. If it weren't for that difficulty, I would have gotten 90%+ in that exam. The technical difficulty is easy to circumvent, but despite that I still failed.

I argued and argued against that decision. I revised my ass for that first exam. And yet I still failed.

Now because of this minor technical issue, I have to deal with the stress of results day again, I have to continue paying rent despite not knowing my academic condition, I have to prepare for university and simultaneously prepare not to go. I'm stuck in a limbo. 

I don't even think the reassessment exam went that well in all honesty, despite how hard I revised prior.

I'm hoping for the best. I wish I could do something.
