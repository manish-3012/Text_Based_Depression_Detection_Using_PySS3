I hate looking at myself and I want to end itI just finished my sophomore year of high school. Last night I went to this fancy dinner to celebrate with my friends and they took pictures. When I agreed to go with them, I was expecting a mellow get together. I wanted to have fun and celebrate the end of the school year. I recently had got in a really bad argument with one of my closest guy friends (that was highly gossiped about)  and I wasn't feeling to great about the whole social thing, but just like the rest of my life, I pushed myself to make appearances just to stay popular. Today, pictures we took at the dinner were posted on instagram and it was just a flood of self hatred. I was looking at my face and realizing a 16 year old alcoholic privileged white girl with nothing to offer. Everyone hates me and I know it-- my family thinks I'm a failure and my friends hate talking with me. Every time I look at myself I get the same feeling of dissapointment and nothing will make it go away. I've thought a lot about death this last year because two people attempted to kill me and I honestly don't think anyone would miss me if I died because no one cared then. If I was gone my mom could move out of this fucking horrible city and travel. The only reason we live here is so I can go to a stupid private school. I'm tired of dealing with everything and having no one t talk to.
