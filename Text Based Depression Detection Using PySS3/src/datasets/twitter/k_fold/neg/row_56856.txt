Can you give me actual facts which will make me reconsider ending myself?29, male, no drive to live, can barely get out of bed. Some facts about me:
- fact: I have no friends 
- fact: I have no hobbies or talent 
- fact: I spend holidays alone
- fact: when I try to talk to people, people avoid me
- fact: when I try to talk to the opposite sex, I'm met with an expression of disgust 
- fact: when I invite people to go out, they don't answer
- fact: when I ask people how they've been, they ghost me
- fact: I have no degree, career, education or any job. And even if there were, I wouldn't care anyway. 
- fact: I'm bored with life and I'll be better off dead. 

Can you state a fact that would make me reconsider? Backed by actual evidence, not positive thinking. Because positive thinking doesn't keep me warm at night.
