I'm gonna put 60lbs weights on my neck, go to sleep and just die soonMy life is completely destroyed. I broke up with the only girl I saw an actual future with. We kept in contact, but things completely broke down, I blocked her, I regret it but she won't speak to me. I hate her so fucking much right now. I wish I never met her.

I'm sick as a dog, they took so much blood and even had me scrape shit from my toilet for days, to test for diseases. Because I put so much energy into my relationship, and because of quarantine, I'm pretty cut off from people in general, and the ones I still talk with try to help, but I just space out and have miniature panic attacks.

I'm a weightlifter. I have decent weights at home, just for lazy days. I'm gonna put a blanket over myself, place the weights over my throat and fall asleep. No mess, I'll have peace. I'm done looking for a bright side
