What's the point of holding on?It's the same shit all over again and again. Every day spent being too numb to feel anything. Every night spent drinking and feeling too much and crying.


I've been stuck for too long. Any progress I make I end up messing up anyway. Been in this rut for many years. I may get better for a little while, but I end up in the rut every time. Mom is always bitching about it, saying how I'm not doing anything to help myself. I did try, for a while. She took away the one thing that was helping. And now, I suppose, she's right. I've stopped trying. All I do is drink and feel sorry for myself.


All everyone says is that I shouldn't kill myself because of how the people around me would feel. But I'm so sick of that. I've stopped caring about that.  Why should their emotions matter? Why should I suffer just so they don't have to be ~sad~ that I'm gone?


The one light I had in my life is rotting away six feet under. With him, things were always manageable, almost happy. Without him, things are like before, only worse. And today marks exactly one month since he killed himself.


There really is no point to anything anymore.


I just need to get shitfaced enough to finally have the courage to off myself. Shouldn't be too hard.
