Im doneIm tired of all im done my parents didn't care about me at all.... All they want for me is good grades which i did all my best to meet their expectations but they don't see how hard i work for that they can't even Congrats me or anything all they see is the mistakes i did they didn't see all of the good things all i heard from them is my mistake always i cant endure this anymore i rather die than live with this pathetic toxic family I bet they don't even care if i die or disappear my internet friends cared about me more than my family...... I just wanted to be happy
