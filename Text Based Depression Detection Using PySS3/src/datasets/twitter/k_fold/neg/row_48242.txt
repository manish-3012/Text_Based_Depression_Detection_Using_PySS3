I'm going to be alone foreverHello I'm 25 Im still in college because I got held back a few years due to not feeling motivated to do anything, I struggle to get out of the house mostly because I have 0 to no self confidence I am a background friend, I can't seem to connect with anyone I never been with a girl, no one seemed interested in me there's always someone better, never went on a date or kissed a girl. I also know that I'm never going to be anyone in life, going to end up with a horrible job for my entire life, I still live with my parents but I know that when they're gone I'll 100% will kill myself there's nothing in this world that makes me want to keep going I feel so alone and detached with everyone that at some points I don't even feel human at this point my only anchor are my parents.
