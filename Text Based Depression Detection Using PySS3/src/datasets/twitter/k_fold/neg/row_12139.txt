I don't even know what to do anymoreMy life has went downhill since February 2018. Yeah, 9 months from now. Back in the day, I used to be a happy go lucky guy, who spent his time joking about everything and making a lot of friends in order to have fun. But even with that point of view, I realized I never truly experienced happiness.

And, when I realized that, along with all the bad things that were happening to me, I realized I didn't have any reasons left to live. And that was 9 months ago. Nowadays, it still is the case, unfortunately.

I have huge problems related to love. I get attached too quickly on what should just be dumb crushes. I was in love with my best friend for 14 months, and she never returned my feelings. Then, I fell in love with that girl who ended up dating one of my best friends 3 weeks ago. And now? I feel like I still have feelings for my best friend. And that's killing me inside.

During those 9 months of depression, I've attempted suicide 4 times. Once in April, one day before my birthday, once in June, once in July and one last time 5 days ago. I feel like my body is crumbling.

I also scar my body as a way to cope with my sadness, to prevent myself from killing myself, maybe? Yeah, that seems accurate.

But I feel like I won't be able to hold on. I feel like I will not survive 2018. I feel like I will never know 2019.

And I feel like I might kill myself tonight.
