Drunk high and suicidal. What's fucking newDoesn't matter what I say anymore, the reality will always be the same. I've wanted to die for 6 years now, since I was about 15, and I wish I would've just done it way back then. Absolutely nothing good has happened since then. People (including a whole lot of you) say "Just wait! You can't possibly kill yourself now!" but I've given it

So. Much. Fucking. Time.

I've specifically said with the rope around my neck ready to go alright. I'm gonna give it 2 whole years for things to get better and if (more like when) they don't improve then I'll finally kill myself. That 2 year date? November 19th 2019. I was too much of a scared little bitch then to kill myself but as always things only get worse and I wish I would've, just like I wish I would've killed myself in like 2013.

Doesn't matter. Most of all no "help" will ever help. I've seen the therapists, tried the meds, done all the bullshit things they tell you to do (meditate, journal, exercise, rub your stomach and pat your head) and none of it has done a goddamn thing. I've been getting "treatment" for 5-6 years now and nothing has done a damn thing. Just wasted thousands of dollars and who knows how many hours of bullshit time with therapists who couldn't care less.

It's time, I'm fucking done my life is ruined. This shit is never gonna get better alright? It just won't. I have PERMANENTLY ruined my life and that's that. I can't go back in time. Why would I choose to live a horrible life when I can choose death, where I feel absolutely nothing because I don't exist?

The noose is tied and ready, it has been for a couple years now waiting for me to get the guts to actually fucking use it. So yeah, let me just blast myself with drugs and rant on reddit until I finally do that.
