Life is not nice at allYou get moments of happiness, but that's all they are, momentary happiness that goes away as soon as it came and then you are left living inside your mind with all your demons and all I want to do is to shut them up, I want to stop it now, I'm tired. The moment I thought I had found happiness and I could see some light, the universe decided I had enough and now it's all gone, and I'm tired of crying myself to sleep every night. I want to stop, I want to end it here and I wish I had the tools to do it right now but I'm a failure even at killing myself. I'm just tired...
