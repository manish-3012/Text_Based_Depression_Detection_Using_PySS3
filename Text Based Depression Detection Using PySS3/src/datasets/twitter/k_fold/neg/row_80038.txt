I can't sleep because I'm fantasizing about my deathI've been depressed for about 10 years (my whole adult life) and I'm so tired, I don't wanna do this anymore. I know I won't kill myself because it would be too painful for the people I love, but sometimes I wish it wasn't such a big deal. Why can't someone just choose to check out? Like quitting a game you don't wanna play anymore or something, you know?
