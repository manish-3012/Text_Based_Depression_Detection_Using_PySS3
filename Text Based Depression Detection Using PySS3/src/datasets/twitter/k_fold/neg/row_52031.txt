I think I need helpI'm not sure how to start this post off. I don't know if I'm suicidal, but I think about how I could end my life everyday. I know how I would do it. I don't have the guts to actually pull through and do it, but I know how I would kill myself if I could. I always have it on my mind. I don't want to hurt my family, but I am suffering. I am alone. I am tired of this thing we call life. It's hard. I don't know what to do. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live. I'm honestly scared.
