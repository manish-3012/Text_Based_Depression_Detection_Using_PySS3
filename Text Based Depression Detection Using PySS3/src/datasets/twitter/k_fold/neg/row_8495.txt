I donâ€™t even feel safe here anymoreIn an earlier post I had a person encouraging me to go through with my suicide plans I had in the fall. I guess that confirms that there really is no reason to stay alive. I feel like I have no space to talk about anything I am struggling with. I drive away everyone by isolating myself. I am very paranoid about other people in public. I always assume I am a huge burden to others and that I should die. What happened in my earlier post just pushes me to want to kill myself and escape this world even more.

I am seriously one mental breakdown away from going through with my plans and finding a spot to commit suicide this fall. I am so fucking sick of having to hide behind a mask everyday only to get ridiculed the very SECOND I take the mask off.
