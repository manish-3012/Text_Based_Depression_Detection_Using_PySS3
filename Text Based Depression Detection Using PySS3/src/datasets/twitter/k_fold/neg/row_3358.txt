Haha I'm here againI'm here again
Someone convinced me that when they say they want me to stay is that it's at least a bit true.
But what do I do now? Do i just wait to die? 

I guess that's not the only reason I'm staying.
My family adopted this kitten off the street months ago but they neglected it for a while only keeping it in a cage all day. So, I decided to let it out and move it to my room. She used to be a rowdy one but I've tamed her, she also tamed me in the process. She'd know when I'm feeling this way, heck she's kneading my back now as I type this. This sounds like a shallow reason to stay but it's all I've got. I want to disappear not die but at the moment the only way to disappear is death. 

I'm also starting to feel guilty that I talk about my suicidal tendencies with this one person too much and that it might get to them so there's that.

I don't want to die but i don't want to stay either.
