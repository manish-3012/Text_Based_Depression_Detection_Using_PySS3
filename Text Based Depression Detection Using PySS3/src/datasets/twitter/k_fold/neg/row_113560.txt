I thought a job would help.They said it would give me purpose, improve my self esteem, and that contact with people would make me feel better. But I just wanna fucking die even more now because I have to get up early and spend 9 hours a day doing shit that I fucking hate with people I don't even like. Nothing makes it better. I still wanna die and I always will. Fuck this
