Beginning of the endI didn't even realise it's gotten to this point until it's too late. Every day I say less and less to the people around me. I dont want it to be like this, I try, I fucking try but it feels like no one wants to talk to me, like I just annoy everyone around me. The few friends I have never speak to me. Most of my messages are left on read or if I try to make plans nothing happens. I know they all have jobs, I don't take it personally, I understand. It just hurts...I feel so fucking alone. My girlfriend and I hardly ever speak, she never seems interested in any conversation, she always seems angry, our conversations are always blunt and brief.

I feel like I have no purpose anymore. The only joy I get out of life is the times where I used to laugh with people, where I made people happy, where people wanted to talk to me. No one ever makes the first contact with me, my parents never want to talk to me, I fucking hate being back here. I can't talk about how I'm feeling, because I feel like no one cares, so why would I talk about this?

Every day I just want to end it all, I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to hurt anymore, I don't want to be alone anymore. I just want to fucking die, I hate the life I have.

I just want my friends back, I want to feel loved by my own family again, I want to be in the honeymoon phase again...I fucking miss feeling a sense of purpose.
