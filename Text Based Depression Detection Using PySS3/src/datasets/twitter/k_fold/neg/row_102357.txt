Life is fine, I just want to dieMarried to a wonderful man, who loves me almost unconditionally. Secure job and paying off our home fine. I know I have family and friends who love and care for me. I know suicide will be hard on them and thats one of the biggest reasons I haven't gone through with it. Ive reasoned though that eventually they will be able to move on. The other reason is I dont know how. I've thought of and researched how to I just don't know how to enact it without someone I love, finding me. I just have this pain within myself.  A worthlessness. No one knows. I put on a very good facade. It would be very shocking bc I'm very happy go lucky and a bit of a "fuck it" kind of female. I dont know if im looking for support or this is just a step i need to take and putting it out there. There's not really anything anyone can respond with to this. I just wanted to put it out there. I want to die.
