Another week gone by.Here, at the close of another week. Nothing changes, I'm still a pretty hot mess of a person. Another weekend comes, another reminder of just how alone I am. Another day of worship, another chance for my father to reinforce his belief that I'm not real, just a delusion of the devil that destroyed his son. Another step closer to my inevitable fate, to die alone. I'm just thinking about how long my suffering needs to last.
