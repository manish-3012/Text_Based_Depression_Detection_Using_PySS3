Would gladly off myself should the opportunity comeWish I had means to do it. I mean, I do but itâ€™s not a way I want to take. I just wanna go out and not make an impact. Disappear even. Iâ€™ve stopped myself from killing myself for years now just for my family, but at what point am I living for them and not me? Itâ€™s not like I belong alive, itâ€™s not like I have some purpose. I mean fuck Iâ€™m a waste of space.
