What a spectacular failure.I am a failure, because no-one loves me, my parents don't think I do enough, my friends leave me, and I keep failing at basic tasks.

I did well in school. I had exams coming up. I was about to go on a holiday. I was about to start in my first job. 

But I don't feel like life is worth the effort I put in just to never have any gratification from it.

I used to talk to two people who kept motivating me and keeping me from my dark thoughts. Then they left. Either because I was stressing or not worth it.

I bought a rope from a reputable wholesale dealer. It is sturdy enough for a ship so it out to do good around my neck. I will go now soon. 8am my local time, so in 6 hours. Then no-one is home and the forrest might still be dark

I'm sorry to those I disappointed. I'm sorry to those I was rude to. I know life is meaningless but I still did poorly.
