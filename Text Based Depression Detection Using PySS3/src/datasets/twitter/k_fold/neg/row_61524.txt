?so recently I've thought about just slitting my wrist and taking a bath. not really to kill myself but just to see how it feels once i want to. i dont wanna go through pain when/if i eventually attempt. i want it to be quick and relatively painless.
if i were to go through with this...would that be an attempt? or am I just being stupid.
