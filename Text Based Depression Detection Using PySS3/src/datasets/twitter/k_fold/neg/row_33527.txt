It hurts.Idk wat my problem is. I heard when ur happy after being suicidal, ur at highest risk of killing urself. Ive been kinda happy the past little bit, but I still cut (I cut myself badly last night, its still bleeding). I still hate myself. I still think about killing myself. 

I feel like my 'friends' only r my friends cuz theyre worried ill hurt myself if they leave. I dont think anyone likes me anymore. I can tell by the way they respond to me now. Its out of exhaustion, not friendship. 

I was gunna go to the hospital this weekend, out of town so no1 knows me. I just sleep n cry all the time. I dont do anything, and dont care to. 

This hurts too much. 

Edit: 

I think Im having a panic attack. I just thought bout the hospital and being checked in and one of my 'friends' and Im losing my shit. I need this to end. :'(
