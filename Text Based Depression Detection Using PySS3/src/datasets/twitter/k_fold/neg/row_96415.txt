Too functional, too rationalMy suicidal thoughts, which have been constantly present with me for the past six years, and they have lately been at the forefront of my mind, as well as increasing in intensity. Because of this, I have been building up my nerves to go through with the act.

On Sunday, I made two deep bilateral cuts on my forearms. The day after that, I did the same thing. And the day after that, I made deep cuts on my legs as well as reopening the wounds on my forearms. Yesterday, I took all that was left of my prescription meds (no one knows about this).

On Sunday and Wednesday, a friend brought me to the hospital. This friend, as well as another friend of mine, wholeheartedly believe that I should be admitted to the psych unit. Each time I spoke with a psychiatrist, the same conclusion would come up: I'm smart, insightful, functional, and rational. I get discharged every time, to my friends' chagrin.

Honestly, I don't really care that much that I get discharged. What I do feel is ashamed of having been there in the first place. After all, if the psychiatrists are so quick to pick out these supposed qualities of mine, I should be able to fix all of this and move on with life, but I can't. I feel like a failure, like I've outlived my usefulness. 

That's why I'm typing this. Yesterday, I took all those pills. I knew it wouldn't be enough to kill me, but I was hoping it might have been. Maybe liver failure will catch up with me later, since that wasn't my first overdose. I'm not sure what will happen today, but I won't make any promises. I stopped doing that a long time ago.
