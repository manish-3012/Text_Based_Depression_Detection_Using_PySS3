Nothing lasts forever.Some people argue that life is valuable by virtue that it is impermanent, and that's inherently what gives it its worth. Therefore because it will end, every moment is made special, so we should enjoy our time while we have it. And that would work, in theory, if we were allowed to realize our dreams and lead our best lives, but that is hardly ever the case. Most of us are barely scraping by, forced to do things we abhor, leading a sad and empty existence full of yearning and trauma and mental anguish, simply prolonging our suffering while biding our time until death. 

Instead, I posit that everything we do is pointless because it *doesn't* last forever, and nothing we can achieve in this life ultimately matters in the grand scheme of things. We're essentially just treading water until our time is up. In 100 years, this generation and the next will be gone and forgotten; barely a footnote in the pages of history.

I know this is the standard nihilist rhetoric, but it's fueled so much of my life philosophy. Why commit to anything if we don't know the future, or how much time we have left? Why continue suffering when we know it won't get better?

Nothing means anything and everything is meaningless. And once we're dead and gone, life will continue on without us, regardless.
