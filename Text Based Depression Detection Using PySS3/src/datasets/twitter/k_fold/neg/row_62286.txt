I have no attachment to life and I'm okay with that.Does anyone else feel this way? I'm currently in that state where I'm not actively trying to kill myself and I'm okay with continuing life, which is more than I can say for all of the past years of my life. But if I were to die in some freak accident shortly or so, I'd just be alright with it.

I'm starting to think my default state is just this. And the weird thing is, I'm fine with accepting that. I know my friends aren't, my family isn't, and they all still think I'm sick and pathetic and need more treatment and need to keep getting better. Everyone still wishes for the day I'll be normal and healthy and will finally have a disease-free, happy mind that loves being alive. That day will never come.

But I think that's okay. I feel okay. And I'm tired of being told that my thinking is unacceptable and that I have to be corrected. Is it possible that some people are just meant to be like me?
