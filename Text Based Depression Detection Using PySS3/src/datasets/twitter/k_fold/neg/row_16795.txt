So I'm here.Some people may remember that a while ago I was on here saying that I was giving myself a kind of sell by date; a date that I had to live until, past that point I can end it any time. Now, I don't think I can reach it. 

I've been attending therapy once a week for the past few months, I'm seeing someone to put me on meds in a weekish and I'm only feeling worse about myself. My friends are getting more and more worried about me but I just lie to them more about self harm and eating which makes me feel worse and it's an endless cycle. 

I don't know what to do any more. I think I'm going to reduce my sell by date to one month.
