Iâ€™m tired of feeling sadI just feel sad all the time. I refuse to act because i love my family and friends too much. But iâ€™m really struggling to keep going. Every day i wake up and just think about it until i have to get up. Often i donâ€™t even get out of bed and just think about it all day wishing i could fall back asleep. Iâ€™m missing classes and crying every day. How can i fix this when iâ€™m not allowed to do something about it. My family couldnâ€™t handle it. I canâ€™t do this to them, right? I donâ€™t know what to do.
