VentingSomeone gave me contact info for a counselor who I'll see in a week. This will be my first time ever doing something like this. Idk what to expect.  I also dont know if I can make it that long. 

The past few days have been crazy. I'm venting here because I need to write about it but I cant write to anyone I actually know. 

I've had suicidal phases come and go my entire life. But this is something new. It feels so real and so unreal at the same time. Twice this weekend I was extremely close to ending it. I was able to stop myself, obviously. In the moment it felt like the literal only thing I could do was end my life. The first time that I came close was Friday night. I am not an angry person but all of this anger came from nowhere. I felt so violent and it was overwhelming. And even a little scary. The second time, I was just almost in a fog. I walked to the edge of a really long pier where people take boats out and was there for a long time, ready to jump in. 

When I'm in the moment it feels so unavoidable. I dont know how I didn't do it. But when I'm out of that moment - it feels like it was exaggerated, like I made up those feelings, like I wasnt *really* as close to killing myself as it felt. 

And I dont feel like I can make it through the week. Even though I have some good moments each day, on the whole every day feels darker than the day before it. 

I'm really trying but sometimes I dont even know if I want to feel better - or if I can. Just waiting for something to push me over the edge.
