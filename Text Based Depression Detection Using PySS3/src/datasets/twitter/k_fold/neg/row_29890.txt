I feel toxic.The title says it. I am bad for people. I cheated on a girl I'vebarely been dating for 2 months who doesn't deserve a shit boyfriend like me, with a friend that I have unhealthy romantic feelings for. It's unfair and hurtful and wrong to both of them. All I do is hurt people around me. There's so much more I want to say, and maybe I'll edit this and update it in the morning, I'm tired. But i know I want to die and it's taking all of the very little energy I have to not go grab my gun and kill myself because of this sadness. It's crushing me.
