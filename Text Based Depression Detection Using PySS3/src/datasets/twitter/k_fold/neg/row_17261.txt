i dont understandi never intend to self sabotage or just sabotage anything in general but i always fuck up i just dont understand why... then i get hit with the anxiety of people want to leave me because i keep fucking up, no matter how big or small the issue was.. because they are already done with me.. i'm trying my best.. why is it so hard.. why am i always fucking up.. i just want an answer... i pray everyday.. does God not love me.. i dont want to die but im so tired of living.. trying my best and nothing ever works...... and its all my fault.. how does a person live in guilt.. its so hard.. im afraid to have another panic attack.. i hate it..
