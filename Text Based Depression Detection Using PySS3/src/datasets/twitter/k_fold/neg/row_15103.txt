I want to cryJust like the post is named I want to cry. I canâ€™t stop myself from feeling like utter shit all fucking day. I want to hang myself but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m too much of a disappointment to even do that. All of my friends turned on me a while back and I tried to reconnect. The one who I stood up to for another friend apparently just spun it into a glory thing for him. He drove me to an attempt at ending myself and he made himself look good off it. He cherry picked things and posted them to make him seem mature and make me seem petty and mean spirited. All I feel is just self hatred and just depression. I donâ€™t have people to turn to and Iâ€™m not even gonna bother letting anyone know when I try to overdose again. I thought I was over everything but seeing how no one cared just fucking cuts me deeper than I ever could cut myself. Iâ€™m going to try again but I needed to vocalize this. Like give myself a form of justification. And if He ends up reading this, fuck you if I get it right this time itâ€™s on your hands. -Annabelle.
Sorry if this inconveniences anyone.
