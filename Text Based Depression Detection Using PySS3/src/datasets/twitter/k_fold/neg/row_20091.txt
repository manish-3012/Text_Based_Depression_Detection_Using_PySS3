My partner told me to kill myself.Beginning of last year I was dealing with the trauma of my past and after talking with police, realizing I would never be able to find justice for what happend to me. I was incredibly sick and suicidal.

My partner egged me on while I tried to commit suicide. He screamed at me I should just die alone, take those fucking pills and just get it over and done with and stormed out of the house to let me die alone.

He ended up calling an ambulance while driving away, came back and kept berating me while they tried to get me into the ambulance.

The next day he came to the hospital, where i was in emergency and apologized, but after everything he said, I just can't believe him.

I have brought this up again with him more recently and he sticks by what he said.

Everyday I think about what happend. Everyday I battle these thoughts and remember how sincre he was when he told me to die and get out of his life.

I can't get this out of my head. I will never be able to get what he said out of my mind.

I just want to get rid of this burden on him and just be done with it. I want to be done with this fucking world and have some fucking peace.
