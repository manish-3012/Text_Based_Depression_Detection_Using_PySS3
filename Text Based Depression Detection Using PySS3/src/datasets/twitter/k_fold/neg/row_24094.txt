Rant--You ever just have those moments where you hate your own body. Growing up I never imagined that there could be so many ways for you to hate your own body. I hate my mind for always forgetting things that I should remember, for reacting to things badly, for making the decisions it has made, for freezing up when it should have screamed. I had my face for its lack of aesthetics, for the steady flow of tears it streams, for the way it lacks to show how i feel inside. I hate my body cause of the unattractive stomach pouch, for the way my boobs sag, for how my thighs touch one another, but I also hate it for the unwanted attention it brought, the unwanted force it brought upon me.
I hate showering because it reminds me, 
I hate seeing myself in the mirror cause that also reminds me. 
I hate touching myself cause that also reminds me. 
I hate going out for fun because that reminds me.
 I hate myself so much so that I live in this constant dread making myself go on and on despite the pain from all those reminders.
