Back from the hospitalHey reddit,

Just got back from the hospital.... I walked out of my house towards a bridge tonight but when I got up there I thought about it for about 30 minutes and just decided to go to the hospital instead.

Here's to hoping I made the right choice! Seeing a psych sometime in the next two weeks or so. 

I'm kind of just confused as to how I'm supposed to go from here.... I think I'm happy about my choice but I don't know how or even if I'm supposed to express it.

edit: Thanks for the comments so far. gonna go sleep but ill definitively check up in the morning.
