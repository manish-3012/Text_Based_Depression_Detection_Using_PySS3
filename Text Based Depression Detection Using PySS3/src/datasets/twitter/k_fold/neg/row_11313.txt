Bipolar, Controlling Family, Intense EmotionsI am at the end of my rope. This subreddit is horrible, and I don't know what to do. All of my life i've bottled up my feelings, I've pushed myself away from people, I feel so different. I am so different from other people. All I ever want is to be alone, and that's what I am, but I still can't get away.

There's NOTHING wrong in my life, I'm not ugly, I'm not stupid, I have a job, I have money, I have a boyfriend, but I CAN'T TAKE IT. I suffer everyday. Somedays I feel so good, but it's not worth the days I look at myself and hate myself.

When I was a kid I had a rough childhood. I had relatively controlling step father and a dad that was never around. And I don't know I try not to blame his on my childhood but I mean I know my childhood is a huge part of the reason I suffer. 

I was always so different, and I feel like as a child I suffered a lot. I cried every night as a child and I joined the military to get away. I'm so scared now I don't even call my mom or my grandparents anymore. Not even my friends back home and I don't know why.

Everyone experiences break ups and losing friends but for me they are true tragedies and I lost my only best friend because she told me all I wanted was attention and she didn't understand, she won't speak with me anymore.

I'm crying so hard all I have is my boyfriend. And I just want to end it all. I don't know why I feel this way but I don't know what to do or how to get help. I've been on so many medications and they've made me put on so much weight. I've went to being underweight to being obese within a year. I've tried therapy and I just bottle everything up. I don't know what to do.

I feel so intense and horrible and ashamed.
