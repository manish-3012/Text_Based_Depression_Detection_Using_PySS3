what kind of world do we live inI dropped out of school, a couple years back. Been shuffling depression, anxiety (the usual) back a long time. - The thing I dont fucking understand is, theres no space for people like me. We are in the year of 2019 and I can't even be valued as a proper citizen since I dropped out of school, and fell into a worse mental state. The military doesnt want me, nobody wants to fucking hire me and im fading until I eventually break. I'm getting close to that point, well atleast I say so. I can't even be honest about how much I want to kill myself because then I lose my drivers lisence, my cell phone etc. THEY PUNISH YOU FOR TRYING TO GET HELP. Fuck this. Not sure if Im allowed to vent on here but atleast I get to write this down.   
In the country I live in, i'm getting thrown on social benefits instead of getting actual help. I dont fucking need tax money, I need a fucking hand into the world- but Im being kept in this place, losing my mind a little bit more each day
