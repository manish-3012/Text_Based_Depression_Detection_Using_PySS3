Would like some advice I guessI'm a 20 year old guy and i go to a good college, grew up in a good area and had pretty much all i could ask for which just makes things harder. A little while back my ex broke up with me and that really messed me up. I really wanted to commit suicide but could never really bring myself to it completely. Instead i started cutting myself. Shoulders, chest, legs, a little on my forearm. Nothing was very deep at all, in fact most of the cuts didn't leave scars. But there was one cut that was much deeper than the rest which actually scared me out of suicide. 

A lot of my friends know how i was depressed but i don't think anybody knows exactly how bad it was/is for me. I'm starting to hang out with a lot of people now but I'm not exactly happy. In fact I feel like I like a girl but she is my ex's freshman roommate which causes me to think a lot of things. First off I don't think I am in any capacity to be in a relationship, i don't want to drag my depression into another person's life. Which makes me feel like maybe I'm not allowed to be happy. Because of this most days, i just wish something bad would happen to me. I feel like if i knew i had some incurable disease i would be so much happier.

I have no real hobbies or interests, I am not exactly excited by any of my classes or my major. I am not the most outgoing person in the world so it isn't really that easy for me to meet new people, which can be a bummer since all of the people i hang out with are friends with my ex, and probably closer to her than to me. 

I guess what I am looking for here are a couple of things. I thought maybe telling somebody all of this would help get a load of my chest even if i am telling people who most likely don't know me and most likely never will. Also if anybody knows of any hobby that is cheap, and fun/interesting that i could get myself into i think that may help out. Right now the only thing that makes me feel good is music, lots of loud electronic music. And yea i do like this girl but i'm pretty sure nothing will ever come of it and maybe i just need somebody to tell me that or say otherwise but i just need a second opinion.

Thanks.
