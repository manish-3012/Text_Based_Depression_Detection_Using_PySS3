TrappedI dont want to fight this anymore. I'm so tired. I've had all the help you can get for depression but essentially I end up battling depression. I've had it a long time now. I'm exhausted.  My mind is exhausted . I'm worn out trying to make things better. I hate my life. It is always full of stress. No matter how hard i try it never gets better. I always end up battling with my thoughts.  I have two kids. I don't want to ruin their lives.  I know being motherless messed up mine. I was also raised by a very very religious man. If I kill myself I will go to hell he has taught me.  So I have major fear. I just want to be free.
