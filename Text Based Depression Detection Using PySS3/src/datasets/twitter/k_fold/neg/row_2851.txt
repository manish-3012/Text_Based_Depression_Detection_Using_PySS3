Iâ€™ve reached my limitHonestly Iâ€™m sorry to say but Iâ€™m officially done with life, Iâ€™ve hit my limit and Iâ€™ve decided to give up. I really thought I could fight this but I canâ€™t Iâ€™m nothing but a weak piece of shit who should of died a long time ago, now I donâ€™t want your cries of pitty telling me â€œNo.â€ â€œplease donâ€™t go.â€ Because honestly itâ€™s not going to stop me. My life has been nothing but small ups and very fucking hard downs and for 17 years of my life itâ€™s only gotten bad and about 10 years ago it had gotten worse, I ended up getting depression and Iâ€™ve been suffering with it ever since. Iâ€™m so sick and tired of waking up everyday thinking and hoping something good would come my way only to be greeted with broken dreams and a really rough and shitty week. Then I start being nothing but a burden not only to my friends but my boyfriend, me constantly being a fucking dick existing just to ruin their days making their lives worse always stressing them out and causing nothing but trouble. Everyday I wish that someday Iâ€™d just fucking drop dead just so I can leave everything behind and I wouldnâ€™t be a waste of time or space anymore 
The more I think about it would I really be missed or is it the pitty people will feel because they felt bad. You know what who gives a fuck Iâ€™m done Iâ€™m honestly fucking done. Fuck my life it sucks
