I cannot believe it's gone this far.It used to be soo good in life... it all ended after the age of 13. Now i'm 15 and all suicidal and got death plans in few months. I just cannot believe i'm already like this.
My childhood ended... i feel so dead now.

I actually say this to myself a lot... "i cannot believe it's gone this far" it's sad i have to leave the world in few months. Reason because of school harder and court, and summer school half my summer, etc. 

I really just wish i could've  have my childhood back... were school was funner and easier.

I'll probably make a few posts, before my death... i feel like there is nothing much now to posts after doing it for few months.

I just seriously miss the past:(  what's death like anyways...?
