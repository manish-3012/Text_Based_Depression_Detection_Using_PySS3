I have been thinking about ending it a lotRecently, Iâ€™ve really been thinking about how nice it would be to die and escape life. Itâ€™s been really bad the past few days, but tonight I set a tiny goal for myself to do a certain number of pushups. This really helped me even if itâ€™s just a momentary reprieve. I just wrote down what I was feeling and didnâ€™t let myself leave until I was done. Iâ€™m sure this wonâ€™t work for everyone but hopefully someone can see this and be able to find some control and feel something. I hope anyone out there struggling gets some relief. You have worth and you matter.
