SuicideI saw a long field of grass the other day, and I thought about how it seemingly goes on forever, and ever, and I wasn't scared at all, in fact I embraced it. I used to always fear eternity, I don't anymore. I used to want love,l Ike it was only thing worth living for, but I don't think that love is real anymore, and even if it came I could never recognize it, or even tell the difference between it and something terrible. I just don't want to exist, I ve thought about what I could do with my life, all the good things are dreams, and all the bad things are too much to handle, especially considering I was born unable to deal with even the slightest bad, I'm just not equipped for the amount of suffering life wants me to endure. I'm not afraid of death, and I kind of just want to see, even if it is infinite darkness, I don't think I would mind that. I don't like it here, I don't fit in anywhere on this earth, I'm ready to go somewhere else, and I'm not even saying this while sad, I'm in a clear mind, and I still want to go. I am so confused.
