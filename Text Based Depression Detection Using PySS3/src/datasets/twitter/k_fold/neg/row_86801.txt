HelpSorry I'm on mobile. 
I'm having a bit of a breakdown. I know I won't do anything but I feel lost. 
My mom died a couple years ago totally alone. I haven't even been told what actually killed her. She was in terrible health as an alcoholic for years and I pretty much stopped seeing her up to her death. 
Everything is flashing in front of me and I don't know how to handle it.

Please help. I'm bawling and don't want to trouble those in my life like I have in the past. I know it just distresses them
