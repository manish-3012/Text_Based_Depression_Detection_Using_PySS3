Out of ideasI am currently diagnosed with Bipolar I with psychotic features, PTSD, and Borderline Personality Disorder.

I am really tired of trying. I feel so empty and numb. No amount of therapy or medication has worked for me. 

I post in /r/depression and all the related subreddits on another account, probably about 50 posts overall. I rarely get a comment or two.

I honestly donâ€™t think anyone cares. My boyfriend, my therapist...well, thatâ€™s it. I donâ€™t talk to my family. I donâ€™t have any friends.

I feel so lost and alone. I try to be productive but nothing is fulfilling. I canâ€™t find a job. I just sit and stare at the wall all day.


I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be normal. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m typing this. I donâ€™t think anyone cares. 

I wish I had the energy and motivation to kill myself.
