I have an overwhelming urge to shoot myself in my right temple.Ive been thinking about it for a long time, as we all have. I have come to the conclusion that a cannot and will not ever kill myself via hanging, ive tried to deprive myself of air and it just drives me insane. Its anxiety overdrive. However, I am coming off of a large dose of dxm(as i do daily) and i know for a fact that there is a pistol in the other room in the closet. The urge that is washing over me is almost unbearable. Just a few feet. I dont want my Grandparents to have to see my brains splattered all over their apartment though. So im at an impass, what do you guys think?
