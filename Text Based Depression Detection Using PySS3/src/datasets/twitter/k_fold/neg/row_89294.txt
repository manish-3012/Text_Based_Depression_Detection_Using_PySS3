I'm never going to amount to anything all I do Is mess up I can't even poop right, I'm a failure in every sense of the word and I have absolutely nothing to live forAll I want is to be a father someday, all I ever wanted since I was a kid was to help some one grow up, to be looked up to by somebody and now look at me, I'm fat, disgusting, no one is ever going to look up to me. I'll never have a child because no body ever wants to talk to me, I don't have a job I don't have friends how am I supposed to keep on living when nothing goes my way there's no motivation to get up in the morning and no motivation to go to sleep in endlessly passing out from exhaustion and waking up in a cold sweat from dreams I don't remember. 

I just wanted a simple happy life and I can't even have that.
