Something miraculous (or merely a coincidence) just happened, so I decide to stick around for a while.Earlier today I was filled with desperation and pretty determined that I must hang myself before midnight because all the worst things I can't handle comes to me all at once -- a big fight bwtween my toxic parents, mother's raging and screaming hurting my brain and nerves, drunk af father kept verbally abusing me all night, school sended a message that I'm about to get kicked out.
When I was searching on the youtube for the songs I'm going to listen to during hanging, I found that the MIT professor Gilbert Strang's newest course has just been uploaded about half an hour ago. I'm a big fan of him. Doesn't make me any less suicidal at all, but still feel like to finish all these lecture videos before death. So that's something what just happened.
