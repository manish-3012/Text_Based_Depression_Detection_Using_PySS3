I feel like I'm in agony and I have nothing left to lean on.Up until recently, this past year felt like it was the best time of my life. I met someone and we both knew that the other was the one and we made eachother feel like we can take on the whole world. Then something clicked and the relationship became two-way emotional abuse over the course of several months as one by one I lost several loved ones over the course of that time. Everything went from bliss to hell. We decided to break up as a means to get some space and hopefully get back together, but whenever I see the pictures and the letters just the stress alone is asphyxiating and I keep forcing myself not to pull her back. But not long before, I ended up buying her a promise ring on impulse. And now I feel absolutely horrible.

I tried talking to a psych and I can never quite get the important bits out. Even now some things are being omitted. My mind freezes whenever I think about them. We're both making eachother suffer. I wanna let her get better and she still wants to be with me, but she isn't completely certain she'll come back. 

Up until I met her I was just making up excuses for living because I didn't really care to. I kept it up for several years and then when she came everything was just good. I didn't know I was in love until it kicked me in the face. We were pretty much best friends for 6 months. More than anything I felt like I was meant to just be a husband and just be with her.

The more I shut my brain of to not think about it, the more I gravitate towards ending it. The only things keeping me is that if I go through with it, I know she will find out and she will have that weight to carry through her whole life, and that suicide is the only permanent thing and there's still the chance of her coming back. But that makes it hurt even more.

I wanna die but I don't wanna die. Help me.
