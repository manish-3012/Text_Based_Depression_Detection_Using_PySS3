Running out of excuses to keep on trucking...I fucking hate being suicidal, I can't sleep, when I can sleep I don't want to get out of bed. I'm desperately lonely but the shit sense of self worth makes it more than incredibly difficult to find even a trace of friendship. I know that if shit was going better, I might feel better, but I want to die so terribly that it makes me not care about doing well, so I dig myself into a hole, then in moments of lucidity I realize how much I've fucked up which makes me want to die even more, I'm sure you see the cycle. And as of tonight I really am only seeing one definitive way out, and I'm running out of excuses to not pull the trigger. Sorry to rant, really just trying to bounce thought off something, or someone.
