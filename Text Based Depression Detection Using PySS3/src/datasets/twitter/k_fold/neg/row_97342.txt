I hate too much.I hate how it's seen as selfish to kill yourself. The only reasons that lead me to believe a suicide is selfish is if responsibilities are being abandoned. This is where I start disagreeing with people because it seems most people feel that friends have a responsibility to keep each other alive or something. What's selfish about getting off of a ride earlier than the other participants? What's selfish is controlling how long someone else is alive for, you can't handle the ramifications of losing someone due to your unhealthy level of attachment so you feel it's wrong for another person to control the only thing they can and should be allowed to control: their life.

I hate how I fiend for attention but feel terrible when I get even just a bit. I hate how I don't allow myself to be loved. I hate how fake, bitter, shallow, empty, worthless, and every synonym attached to each of those words I feel. When I feel love, happy, accepted, it's only for a small amount of time. I try to hold onto it, but the tighter I hold the faster it slips away which is why most times I try not to think about it. I hate how much I think. I hate too much. I love a lot of things but myself isn't one of those things. I love people, friends, family but that doesn't feel real to me. My friends tell me they love me, they hug me, but it just feels like a dance that everyone knows the steps to. We're all just doing a fucking stupid dance and I don't feel like dancing anymore.
