It's taken me months to get to herebut I've finally built up the courage to make the post.

I'm a pedophile. I hate this fact, I hate myself, and I hate everyone like me. I've searched online for some kind of cure, some kind of way to get away from this, but I can't find a solution to the problem. 

The truth is, I don't trust myself to be in complete control for the rest of my life, and I don't trust therapists to not have me sectioned and ruin my life for reaching out. I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do because nobody has ever told me, and I can't ask.
