Not sure where else to go with this...This is my last cry for help, I guess. I don't want to worry anyone. I've put them through enough. 
My life in summary, if at all possible... I'm homeless. Wrecked my car that I was living in. Social services took my son away. I lost my job. I have no family. No friends. I had to steal food to eat today. And I could handle all of it, everything, until I lost my kid. It feels like someone ripped my lungs out and told me to keep breathing.
I have a rope and a place to hang myself. I'm going to post my suicide note to my website and then to Facebook, and then immediately hang myself. I don't want anyone to rush in and save me. 
And maybe I'm just posting this now because I don't want to be alone right now...
