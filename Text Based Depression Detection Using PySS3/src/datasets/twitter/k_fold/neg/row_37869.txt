I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.Iâ€™ve never really been mentally well. My life has been filled with a lot of pain... I tried to fill that void with romantic love. Eventually I got into a serious relationship and he asked me to marry him. We did move really fast, with us living together just within the first 2 months and then getting engaged shortly after. After the engagement we argued constantly. A lot of it was due to me acting out of insecurity, fear, unhealthy mental status, etc. But he also played a part in it. When we had good moments they were the best. The bad moments were just outweighing the good significantly.

Fast forward to almost two years later. We have moved to a new state together.  He decided to break up with me about two months ago. Itâ€™s felt like my life has fallen apart. Iâ€™ve never lived on my own so we are trying to keep living together. We signed a new lease way before the breakup, so we move in to another place together next week. Itâ€™s been incredibly hard. He ended things because he through our relationship was toxic, heâ€™s unsure about his sexuality, and he doesnâ€™t want a high level of commitment with really anyone. I keep asking him if heâ€™s seeing other people because Iâ€™m terrified of it. He has a trip down to his hometown next month and I expressed Iâ€™m scared that he would find someone else. He told me â€œso what if I doâ€. I canâ€™t believe that someone who I thought loved me so much is doing this to me. I feel like Iâ€™m being punished.

Being around him feel like itâ€™s killing me, I feel like a loser since Iâ€™m so behind in life (finishing college/adulting/being able to drive), my supper group is pretty small in this new state, I feel like Iâ€™m a disappointment to my family, etc.

I just donâ€™t want to hurt anymore. Whatâ€™s the point of sticking around when you feel so unloved and unwanted? Iâ€™m just a waste of space. No one ever wants to keep loving me because Iâ€™m so broken. Itâ€™s better if I stop living.
