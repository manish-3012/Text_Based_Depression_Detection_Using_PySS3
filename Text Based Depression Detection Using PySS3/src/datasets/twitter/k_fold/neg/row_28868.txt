I donâ€™t know anymoreI donâ€™t why Iâ€™m posting here. I donâ€™t know. I just want to die?? Like nothing is worth anymore. Whenever something good happens I always ruin it.

All my friends leave me. My mum is trying but she doesnâ€™t know that a lot of her words and actions just make me feel worse. No matter much but I try to explain things to her.

My brain doesnâ€™t work. My rooms a mess. My lifeâ€™s a mess I feel like a waste of oxygen. I feel like thereâ€™s no point in living. 

So many things are going wrong and Iâ€™m praying and itâ€™s like theyâ€™re just getting worse worse worse and Iâ€™m starting to get really fidgety. Sleep isnâ€™t an escape for me anymore I get nightmares. And Can never sleep at night any more. I cry a lot. Iâ€™m starting to see things in the corner of my eyes.

Everyone around me is so much better and more talented than me. 

I want to act when I graduate next year but we all know thatâ€™s never going to happen.
