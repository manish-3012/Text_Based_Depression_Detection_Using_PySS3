I tried to kill myselfI tried hanging myself on boxing Day, went through all the steps just because I can't deal with my family, anyway I strung myself up and hung for a few minutes felt the lights going out and was relieved but I never went unconscious I just kept hanging I ended up untying myself and I am still so confused and I don't know what to do
