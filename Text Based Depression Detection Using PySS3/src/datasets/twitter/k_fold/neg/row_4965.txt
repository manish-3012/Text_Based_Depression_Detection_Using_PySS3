In a dark place right now. Help, please.Hi. I am an international student in the US. I came all the way from Russia and I am a freshman. 

First semester I felt the happiest I have ever felt in my life. I met a lot of great people, made amazing friends, whom I am still extremely close with. Everything was right: school was great, I had fun with people I really liked and I wrote a lot of music.

This semester everything is completely opposite. I barely go to classes, because I don't get anything out of them, I haven't met new people in a while, I have been constantly a complete asshole to my friends and family (I don't know why I am like that) and I am in a complete creative block.

I have had suicidal thoughts for several months now, but I never seriously thought about it. Recently, a guy from college has committed suicide, and I thought "he can, why can't I?".

Music has been the only thing I could put my negative emotions into, but now that does not work. I keep upsetting people around me and people that care about me.

I do not know why I should still be breathing.
