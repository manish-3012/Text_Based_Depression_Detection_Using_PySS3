I don't feel okIt hurts. Everything. All I feel is a growing frustration. Imagine holding a boiling pot of water. You can't drop it because it'll just be worse once it hits the ground and spills all over your feet so you bare through it the pain getting intense and all you can do is scream as you try to find a place to put it. That's where I've been for a while now. It just keeps getting more and more intense and I can't find a way to release it. 

I can see the edge growing closer and closer and its getting harder to not just jump off. I went hunting today and I spent a large portion of the time staring at the gun and crying talking myself in and out of it.
