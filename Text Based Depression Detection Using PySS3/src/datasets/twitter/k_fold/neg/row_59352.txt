August 3, 2015I'm going to do it.  I have a trip coming up the week prior to this and it will be to say goodbye to a very dear friend.  She won't know my plans, no one will.   When I get back, that's it, no more fighting, no more trying.   I'm tired of trying and fighting.  Some people weren't meant for this world.  That's all there is to it.  The pain I feel deep down inside,  so deep it makes me sob and shake, that's the pain I cannot take anymore.  Oh god
  If there was a god and it was a just one, I'd have been taken out of this pain long ago!  Why does the world feel like it's always out to make me suffer, make me make myself suffer.  Fuck.  I don't know.  I'm so tired.  No.  You can try every pill on the market but my core being is destroyed, cracked, flawed so deeply it can never be fused back together with meds, therapy, what have you.  There is no joy in this world.  I am a terrible mother and an insufferable wife.  I avoid them as much as possible to shield them from my poison.  So I will suffer as silently as possible for the next two weeks, then i will go on my trip, then I will be done.  I don't even care if anyone reads this.  It's out there, it's done, it's off of me for the moment.  Ever since starting therapy and medication back in February everything has only gotten worse, not to mention more expensive.   My poor husband is trying to figure out how to pay ER bills, inpatient stay bill, therapy fees with insurance that doesn't cover DICK.  I'm barely able to work part time at a place where a 3 hour shift makes me pop as many Valium just to stop from bawling the whole time.  I really can't do this anymore.  My 401K from my previous job should help them once I'm gone, pay off bills, get started with their new life without me.  Trust me, I've thought this through and it is the only way.  I can't, and I can't make them live this way anymore.  Now to hold out till the end of the month.  Just holding on by a thread here...
