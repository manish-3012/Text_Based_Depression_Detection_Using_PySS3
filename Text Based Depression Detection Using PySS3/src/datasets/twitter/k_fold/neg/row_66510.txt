I need some helpThe overwelming sense of doom is just too much today. I dont think i want to kill myself butbi feel like im dying. Im sonsure im going to die im suffocating and it makes me panic. I feeel lile i have invosible hands around my mouth and neck. What do you do when youre stuck in the overwhelming sense of dread? Il try anything but i just cant think straight, and im just finding it so hard to live right now. Just being is unbearable, i just hate this feeling i cant eat i cant sleep i cant even lie down silently, i just dont know what tondo with myself its easier if i just kill myself even tho i dont want to, just i dont know what tondo about this feeling im helpless
