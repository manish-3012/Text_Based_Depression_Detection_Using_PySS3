Tired.
I am 19 years old and suffering from depression. This is something that has been off and on for the last six years of my life. Iâ€™ve seen multiple therapists and been on different medications. For a while I thought things were going to be better. I was briefly hospitalized at 16 after attempting to kill myself. As it stands currently I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing with my life.I still live with my parents. I have a fantastic and understanding relationship with my family. My parents helped me through the most difficult part of my life. My boyfriend of two years helped me through a mild abuse of pills and pushed for me to go through therapy. I realize that a lot of my life is great but it doesnâ€™t stop the feelings. The love I feel often feels like nothing. 

To get the point I think I need more professional help. I take pills sometimes. I often wake up vomiting in the middle of the night. I cry everyday driving home from work. I canâ€™t keep myself awake for more than 20 minutes after getting home. All I want is to die.  i dont think I can do this anymore. The guilt is overbearing. I am afraid of an empty future. I am a liar. I canâ€™t make the words come out of my mouth. I canâ€™t say it. I want to much to crawl into a river and drown. To swerve my car into oncoming traffic. I guess I donâ€™t really want advice. People donâ€™t seem very active in this sub so Iâ€™m not expecting a life saving revelation. I just want to be honest for once in my life. One time before I die. I donâ€™t expect myself to be alive for much longer. I donâ€™t expect my will to hold out. Last time was pills. This time will probably be the same. So feminine, I know. I hope my parents and boyfriend donâ€™t hate me. I hope eventually they can come to forgive me. 

If you read this thank you.
