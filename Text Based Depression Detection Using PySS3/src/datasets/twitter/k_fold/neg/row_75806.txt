Only living for my family then again I want to give up on them but just can'tEver since 7th grade when I first failed it I thought to myself ima be nobody and till freshman year I was always suicidal and didn't think I'd be anything or graduate but over all or high school it got better I went from 1.6gpa to a 3.4 pretty much but as I graduated over a year ago I feel as if ima be no body and went back into my old ways and  I never believed in myself even as a kid and that now my expectations are so high that I dont feel like I'll ever be good for my family and I've been thinking about dying over the past few months that if I just end it I'll finally be free of living up to everyone expectations and I was a heavy pill popper for 3 years and stopped my sophomore year
