Mental Disorder Soup And No FriendsI have been dealing with anxiety, autism, depression, and paranoid schizophrenia. I am a mess, and my life started to go downhill as soon as I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. 

I feel like I am a waste of oxygen who sits in her room all day talking to people on the internet. I have no friends. My siblings have friends that are more important than me, and I fucked up my relationship with my sister, because of my fucking stupid ass spirit guides that I used to talk about and draw all the fucking time (I am a New Ager, and looking upon this makes me feel embarrassed) and puff the magical dragon (my cousin who I used to talk to that caused my relationship with my sister to fall apart. He is also mentally unstable (Bi polar) and fed my schizophrenic thoughts that people were after me)

I don't know if my relationship with my sister (one of my only true friends) is falling apart, because that's what it feels like. She and my brother both talk to friends more than me, and I don't know why, probably because they are teenagers and that's probably why. 

I also am 19 F and still a virgin. I have never kissed any guy at all. I am above average (7.5 from 1 - 10) in looks, but I have a hard time talking to and making relationship with guys, because I don't know how to talk to people. I am still in college and it hurts me to see these really hot guys walking around, who are probably single and don't want to have an autistic crazy girl as a girlfriend. 

I also don't have a job. I am trying to get a job, but finding someone that will hire me is hard. I think that if I get a job, I will feel that I will mean something, but I don't. No one wants me to be an employee either. 

I also try to do chores around my house and work on my hygiene, but it's no use. Nobody wants me. I could be smelly and dirty, and no one will notice that I am there, and my relationship with my mom will still be shit no matter how many chores I do.

I don't know what to do. I have tried every coping skill in existence, and nothing is helping. I called the local suicide hotline, and they were able to talk to me for like maybe 40 minutes. I am alone in my room right now, and I have like no friends to talk to, but I am afraid to talk to people about my problem because I feel like I'm toxic and an emotional vampire.

I also have a therapist that I go to, but I see her every other week.
