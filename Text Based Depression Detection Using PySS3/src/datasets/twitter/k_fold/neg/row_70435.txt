Please helpI want to kill myself and I donâ€™t know how to say it other than that at this point. I feel no connection with not one person in this world, all I do is work and stay home bc I have no friends/family who I connect with. I feel my life is on idle or every time Iâ€™m happy everything crashes. I need to depend on myself for my happiness but I canâ€™t when Iâ€™m in this hole so deep I donâ€™t know how to get out. Please help. Someone..anyone..how do I get out of this whole?
