It's becoming easier and I'm not sure how to feel about thisThe more I fear for my life and hate who I am as a person, the easier it's starting to seem to take it. It's not a constant state for me, more something that comes and goes, but it came to me today and it felt easier in a sense. Everyone is so much better at life than I'll be, and I feel pathetic compared to others. Everyday proves to me to continues to build up to more loneliness for me in the future.

I'm tired of running after things and people. I'm tired of having to accept what I can get even when it's never what I wanted. I'm tired of the dishonesty of people, and my own dishonesty when I pretend to be happy but the reality is that I'm scared. I need a break, but I'll never get it. I need someone to be here with me and promise me they'll always be here no matter what.
