SW, I come here everyday...I just don't know anymore. I feel like suicide is inevitable for me now, I just can't stop thinking about it.

For some reason, I can't forgive myself for being a fool in the past and blowing key opportunities. I've pushed away all of my friends and anyone else who ever cared about me--leaving me alone. And I've lost the ability to make new ones. Part of me thinks I'm trying to punish myself for being such a shithead all my life. To my family and friends... 

I wasted my life, but I take full responsibility. My question is, how do I get my affairs in order? I need to leave a note (especially for my mom, since I'm her only child)... (that especially bothers me because she's a nurse in a nursing home and I always vowed that I couldn't let her spend her whole life in one after working there her whole life). And leave some advice for my younger brother... I don't know, i'm rambling again. 

Can someone who's dealt with a suicide help me?
