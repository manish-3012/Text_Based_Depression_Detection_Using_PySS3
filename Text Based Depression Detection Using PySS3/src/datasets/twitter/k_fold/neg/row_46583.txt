Is suicide selfish?I don't know. I mean I would really like to kill myself. But I know that at least my parents would be hurt. I don't think someone else would mind too much, but I think my mother and father wouldn't get over it. Idk, I guess I wouldn't want to do it to them. But somehow it's all I can think about lately.
