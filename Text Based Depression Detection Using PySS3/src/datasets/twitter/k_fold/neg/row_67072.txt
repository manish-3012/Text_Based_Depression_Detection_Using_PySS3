Is this a messageI try to concentrate on living life happily but i have ptsd and this shit literally makes me wanna die, like you have a shit and traumatic effects every fucking second and not to think about it but everytime it doesnt work it is like hell, you think something that you dont even want to think but your body keeps you thinking about it. Guys i cant express myself how i really feel but everytime i think about God to keeps me safe , even i start to get hypertansion due to this, when i want to live longer my body says like â€œno you dont have this choice â€œ when i pray God , i cry evertime because god is the only thing can help me, i experienced that if you have a ptsd nobody helps you get through it i dont know maybe  i dont have much time to live in this world maybe this disease is a message to me i really dont know..
