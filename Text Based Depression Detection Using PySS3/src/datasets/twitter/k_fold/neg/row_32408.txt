Even sleep isnt fun anymoreIts 3:25. I usually like sleep because its an escape. But now it isnt. I dont remember my dreams, i have trouble falling asleep, i am not tired. 
What do i even do with my life anymore? 
My life is sleep-centered. I go about my entire day trying to get back to bed. I dont go to bed as soon as i get home, i rarely nap during the day, but sleep is the part of the day i look forward to. But now it's just dull. So now i hate being awake and being asleep
