Itâ€™s your fault im deadIf my parents find this Iâ€™m sorry. Itâ€™s not your fault. She broke me, and I could never heal. She was happier. She canâ€™t come to my funeral. I love you guys, and Joshua can have my car, and you guys have money in the bank. Sell the rest of my stuff. Donâ€™t leave a trace. Bruh the stuff in my room that she gave me. Iâ€™m done. I love you. See you when you get here.
