OK to go to police station if suicidal?I am helping a loved one put together a [safety plan](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/learn/safety.aspx). Unfortunately there are no hospitals with emergency rooms near her, but she does live very close to a police station. Would it be a good idea for her to go to the police station if she feels suicidal? To me this seems fine, theoretically the police would just keep her safe and transport her to an ER? But are there any reasons this wouldn't be a good idea? (e.g., might she get charged for the transport to the ER? might she have to sit in the waiting room for 4 hours before getting help or transport?)
