They say men are 4 times more likely to commit suicide. I've tired at least twice.The way I look at it, its all statistics really, that I have a 1/2 a chance to actually man up and do it. Beings I've tired twice now. Once putting a shot gun in my mouth, and the other in the military trying to force someone to shoot me after taking a shit ton of pill. I clearly got my stomach pumped. I'm so tired of everything I deal with. I know everyone has their problems. I understand that every struggle is different for people. I try not to bitch to my friends, I'm tired of everything. Every morning. I deal with the delima of wanting to wake up and deal with the world. I'm so tired.
