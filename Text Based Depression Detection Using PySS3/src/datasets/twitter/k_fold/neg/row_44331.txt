Here I am.  I'm all alone. 
No friends left. 
No family that will speak to me. 
No community.

I'm alone. Totally alone. 

I hate myself. I don't mean just a little. I mean, I truly can't stand living with myself everyday. I can't take this. 

People need other people. But apparently, I'm too much of a bitch. 

Any niceness towards me is a front. 
"You're a joke."

"You're easy."

"You're a bitch."

"You're a dork."

"You have no friends."

"That's why no one likes you."

"You're mean."

I get no love. 

I can't take care of myself.

My life has no direction. 

I've been in this depression for two years straight. Medication only made me crazier and it was at that point I lost all of my friends.

I have nothing to live for. 

I'll never be pretty enough. I'll never be smart enough. I'll always have this disease. 

I'm ready to end it. No one would find me. And honestly, I don't think anyone would be hurt. That's what stopped me before. Now, I don't need to worry about that because they all hate me. Good riddance, they'll say. 

This weekend, I think I'll do it.
