Did I make the right choice?So my ex and I broke up about 2 months ago. It was really bad she said I was super manipulative and emotionally abusive yet never gave any evidence to support it. She talks to people who are friends with me saying they shouldnâ€™t be because I ruined her life. She always tells people Iâ€™m unfit to be in a relationship. I asked her again recently for the last time what it was I did wrong and again she gave me a vague answer and I told her to tell me specifically how I was manipulative and emotionally abusive and again vague answer with no actual evidence. When I was with her I made a book for her it was 500 pages long and every page had something different on it, artwork, quotes, photos and how much I loved her and what she meant to me. Her friend who is also my friend went over to her house and took it since it was hidden away in her closet out of sight and has given it to me. I burned it this afternoon and posted it on Snapchat. I wanted people to know Iâ€™m over it and Iâ€™m over her and I am but what she told me I had caused her to go through that night just still gets to me. And idk if I made the right choice here
