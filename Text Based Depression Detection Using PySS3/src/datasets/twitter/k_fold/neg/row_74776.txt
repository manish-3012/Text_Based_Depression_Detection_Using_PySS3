What to do when your on the edgeSo with Thanksgiving tomorrow this is probably the worst time for this happened. For the last few months I have been keeping myself busy to blunt my emotions. Namely with respect to the emotions of the grieving process regarding my father who has a terminal lung condition.

After several therapy sessions it was decided that it was best for me to express my emotions - however as I expected it wouldn't be received well. I was blame for being sad and unhappy and it triggered long standing suicidal ideation. I even half assed tried to hang myself. 

Having missed several important meetings and my evening classes due to my mental state I don't know what to do anymore.

I went to my emergency medication supply and took 800mg of lithium and 300mg of seroquel so that I can avoid an inconvient experience in the psych ward. I don't know what tomorrow will bring and it scared me beyond belief. For several months I know I need to check myself in but it would create long term problems that will only make my life more difficult. I have been waiting for January to come so I can admit myself but each day has made January seem to far away.

I don't know what to do.
