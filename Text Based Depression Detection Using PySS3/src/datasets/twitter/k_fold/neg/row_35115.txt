Please convince me not to.This past Tuesday, I made what I now realize is a huge mistake by getting an IUD inserted. Ever since then, I've been in horrible amounts of pain, off and on, though I'm a total pain wuss, so it's very possible that a normal woman would be able to tolerate it. The pain that I've been in has also caused my anxiety to go crazy, mostly due to the fact that I've been confined to my bed, since the pain tends to get worse if I stand up for too long. My increased anxiety, in turn, has stressed out my parents (who I live with) who have anxiety disorders themselves. And I love my parents more than anything, so seeing them stressed out makes me hate myself and blame myself for this whole damned thing. My parents were actually against me getting the IUD, and I wish I had listened to them. 

I have talked to my gynecologist about the pain I've been in, and she's prescribed me Tylenol with Codeine (I can't take Motrin, Advil, or Aleve due to my acid reflux), but that still doesn't help the pain much. My gynecologist refuses to take the damned thing out, though, which makes me feel like a prisoner to it. (She seems to think that I should just wait out the horrible pain, which just really makes me resent her.)

At this point, I really just want to kill myself, both to end the IUD pain and to spare my parents the stress of having to deal with my neediness and anxiousness. But at the same time, I know that'd devastate them.
