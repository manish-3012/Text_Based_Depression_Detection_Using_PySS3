Itâ€™s been a long ride, but itâ€™s time.I have spent most of my life dealing with depression and meds. But, iâ€™m tired of it. Whether itâ€™s the dizzy spells on one medicine or the blackouts on another. When i combine that with the fact i am 40 and have no kids and a job i couldnâ€™t care less about along with my recent breakup. I canâ€™t even fake wanting to get up jn the morning. Iâ€™ve already finished my suicide note and will be doing it tomorrow.
