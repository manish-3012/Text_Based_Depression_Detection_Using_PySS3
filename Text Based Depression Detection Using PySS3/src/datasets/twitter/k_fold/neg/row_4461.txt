So, about my National Suicide Hotline...Guys, I'm desperately feeling like shit, and I know I'm supposed to get help...but what the fuck am I supposed to do when calling my country's suicide hotline only gets me an automated "wrong number" voice message?

I'm not truly suicidal at the moment. Just *really* need someone to talk to given the current unbearable amount of pain, tiredness, anxiety and stress am in.
