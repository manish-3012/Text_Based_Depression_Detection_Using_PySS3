Pls help, completely delusional out of nowhereSince August I've felt like I am supposed to die, it is terrible. This feeling like a part of me is done living and thoughts of me doing it actually scares me so bad. I am not diagnosed but I think my thoughts might be similar to many of yours. I really dont want to commit suicide but it is really hard to stay alive like that. My whole identity is shattered by my thinking habit. My mind is totally out of control and will never function normally again.

It is HORRIBLE, I have nightmares and my reality and world perception is so dark.
