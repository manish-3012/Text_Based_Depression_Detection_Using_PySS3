Page from the diary/journal whatever the fuck you want to call itStarting to feel so empty again. Dead inside. Taking Prozac makes me feel empty too, but with no feelings. Itâ€™s hard to explain. I had no emotions, really felt like I was just going through the â€œemotionsâ€, but not actually feeling it in my soul. At least when your not taking it Iâ€™m feeling something. Feeling sad is better than feeling nothing at all. 
Again and again itâ€™s the same story. Why do I keep doing this to myself? I go through every motion to be â€œnormalâ€ I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s normal. Being happy is normal. Those moments where you connect to someone? To yourself? To nature? To life? 
Iâ€™ve been disconnected for so long. As long as I can remember, what do I have? All these questions and the answer lies in the black hole. 
I love life. I love every single bit of it. I think the most beautiful thing I know and so blessed to have. To be able to have all the gifts I have. Iâ€™m grateful for my breath, my vision, touch, heart, thoughts. Everything. Even the bad and ugly. We are given all of this. Are we?
I donâ€™t fit in with any crowd of people I know of, at least I havenâ€™t found them yet. You usually hear tumblr people saying that, but no I donâ€™t even fit in their. How is it I donâ€™t even fit in with the weirdos? Mind me I think theyâ€™re awesome. So intelligent and creative and open minded and hearted. The best people. Tumblr is where youâ€™ll find someone you hate and someone youâ€™ll love. But youâ€™ll definitely find weird, which is good. 
Then you have the athletics, ya kinda have to slide into that perfectly for that to work.  Then the books people. The social butterflies, I swear I can get random cases of severe social anxiety. And other times Iâ€™m a boss ass bitch. The natureâ€™s people, I LOVE THE OUTDOORS. But not as much as the people who do love em. Musicâ™¡ greatest gift to live for. I can go from dirty rap to sweet classical and be so in love with both of them. I like every kind of music. I donâ€™t discrimate. Then the art, I can stare at a painting for hours if I can, art is truly art. Cultures- I wish I can live a 1000 more expensive years just to learn more.
Yet through all of that who am I?  Where would you put me in? Who do I talk to or meet for  someone to understand me and accept me?
No friends and absent family, I lay here alone writing this piece for my eyes and thoughts only. Is this a moral of the story writing?  Idk itâ€™s whatever the fuck it is. 
Iâ€™m on a tightrope running, standing still, crying, laughing, emotionless. Trying to understand the world below me. Watching everyone else lives go by ever so beautifully.  
Iâ€™m perplexed.
