Confused about what my GF did.So last night we are sitting on the couch, and she says she wants to talk to me about something, but I have to promise not to get mad. Just a little bit of backstory: The last few years I haven't been feeling like myself. I recently started seeing a therapist, and bought a journal to write down how I'm feeling when I'm upset.

The journal was mainly meant for venting and to put my thoughts down on paper. It kind of helps. I never really hid it, but trusted she wouldn't look thru it. Anyways, last night she says she was looking for computer paper earlier in the day, and found my journal, and read some of it. I have had some suicidal thoughts in the past, but I never acted on them. It's more or less a feeling like I wouldn't be upset if I died, but I don't think I have the balls to do it myself. I never told anyone this. I always just wrote it in the journal. I think part of me wanted her to read it so I could talk to someone about how I've been feeling. 

So yeah she was freaked out, I just sat there kind of numb and didn't say anything. She made me promise I wouldn't ever do anything to hurt myself, but we both know that was forced. Basically I feel like I don't matter now more than ever. At the time, I wasn't upset with her for looking thru it, but as the day goes on, I find myself getting more angry that she did that. What pisses me off is that the computer paper story was a lie. I filled it up the other day, and even if it was empty, the paper is nowhere near my journal. She went thru it on her own free will. She wants me to make a doctor's appointment so I can get set up to see a specialist, but I don't really want to do that. I want to get better, but I don't want to talk to anyone about this. I'd rather just remain anonymous about the whole thing. I'm pretty embarrassed by it.
