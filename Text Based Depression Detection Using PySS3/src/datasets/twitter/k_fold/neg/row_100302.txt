I did not sign up for life.I donâ€™t care about living. There are good days and bad days, but in general I just donâ€™t have the will to live. I donâ€™t have any passion that keeps me going, and I donâ€™t even think itâ€™s because Iâ€™m depressed. Itâ€™s easy to put in effort when you look forward to whatâ€™s next. I donâ€™t have anything to look forward to. 
When I was with my ex bf I that was the first time I imagined the future. I image growing old with him, in my 50s, in my 60s.. before I met him, Iâ€™ve always wanted my life to end at 30. 
He just left me. Like people said, itâ€™s not the end of the world. You have a life before you met your partner. 
I am 28.
