Things are badIt's so trivial to complain about my job when other people have it so much worse but my job is making me absolutely miserable. I took two weeks of mental  health leave and it doesn't feel like much help. On Tuesday I go back and I already dread it. I want to die. I don't want to do this anymore. I have no hope. The world feels like it's already over and there's nothing left to do but die along with it. I don't know what to do. 

I made this throw away account. Because I don't know what to do. I just don't. Nothing feels like it helps. I want to quit my job just because I feel trapped there. But things are so uncertain. I'm afraid of losing my therapist. But I've considered getting drunk just to go to work. Just to deal with it all. 

I have nobody or nothing to fall back on. I just have ground to hit. I'm really feeling desperate tonight. I don't know if my life can improve.
