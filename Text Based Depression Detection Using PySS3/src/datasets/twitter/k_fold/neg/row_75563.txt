It's Just that everything seems so meaningless, so why do i Need a job? For most of my Life i've been single (and yea, 26 still Virgin) and the only relations i had were abusive ones... The kind in which She keeps the leash and you must Obey, or nothing...

Honestly, if i'd love to keep sleeping Forever and be done with everything
