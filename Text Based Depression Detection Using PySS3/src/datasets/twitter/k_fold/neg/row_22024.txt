Iâ€™m literally procrastinating killing myself. I might die from the irony before I actually pick up a gun.Pretty much everything in my life was looking up for a while, until my best friend stopped talking to me, my grades plummeted and a bunch of other stupid meaningless shit happened. Iâ€™m only in high school, and Iâ€™m painfully aware that most of the trivial bullshit that bothers me right now wonâ€™t hold any significance in a few years, yet despite this, Iâ€™m still pretty much locked in on my decision to kill myself. I have no motivation to try in school anymore and I lost almost all of my friends during COVID. Iâ€™ve been emotionally isolated for 6 months and there is nobody to blame but myself. I kinda wish I was ignorant enough to be an incel and blame my loneliness on society but Iâ€™m sure that Iâ€™m the problem, since I just refuse to talk to people. I used to be scared to kill myself, as I assumed the obligation to keep my parents content, but honestly I canâ€™t be bothered anymore. If I want to leave, I wonâ€™t let others stop me. Thereâ€™s a lot I could do to help myself but I honestly canâ€™t be bothered. I have raised the white flag. I surrender. The only thing left is to stand up, grab the shotty from my closet, and Cobain the fuck out of myself, but Iâ€™m procrastinating doing so like I would a project in school. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll do it, but Iâ€™ll get around to it. Iâ€™m not sure if it means I donâ€™t actually want to die, as if I really wanted to die I would just do so. Iâ€™m not particularly scared of death, so I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s stopping me. Ironic, huh?
