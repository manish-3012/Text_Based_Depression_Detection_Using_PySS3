Want To Tell SomeoneThrowaway account for obvious reasons. 17F, for context.

I've been feeling suicidal off and on since May 2015. Last September I told my mom, who reacted unhelpfully ("Well who will babysit your siblings?"). She did take me to a therapist, but instead of acknowledging the hurtful things she says to me, she claimed that I was suicidal because of something my grandparents said 5 years earlier. I was an emotional wreck at that point, and went along with it.

I saw the therapist one more time, but that was still with my mom in the room.

Since then, I've claimed to be fine, even as recently as yesterday. I had a depression screening before a doctor's appointment. I lied on every question.

A few weeks ago I kinda-sorta tried to kill myself (half-hearted attempt, gave up the second I felt uncomfortable).

Today I felt a lot worse. I have a plan, the means to do it, and the only thing stopping me is my religion. Hey, any reason is a good reason.

I am aware that this is bad, and that I need to inform my parents that this has been ongoing, but I'm not sure how to break it. I can't just walk up and say, "Hey, I'm suicidal. How about the weather, huh?"

Any tips for bringing it up?
