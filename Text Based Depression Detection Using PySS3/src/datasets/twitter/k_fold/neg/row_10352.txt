Close to itKind of a Tldr: I donâ€™t think anybody understands how my brain processes information and what Iâ€™m going through on the daily. My life is actually worthless (no joke, Iâ€™m a college dropout and have actually 0 friends) and im such a lazy bitch that the thought of going to work by itself (not job specific, working in general) makes me immediately suicidal
My girlfriend loves me and I /think/ I love her back, but sheâ€™s the only person I really trust to talk to when Iâ€™m suicidal. The problem is that she always turns the discussion into â€œif you kill yourself im going to kill myselfâ€ which I think has literally utterly killed (no pun intended) my liking of her. I know I shouldnâ€™t rely on her just standing her ground and listening, but Iâ€™m scared of therapy and have seen too many ward horror stories to admit myself to one. 
This feeling hasnâ€™t gone away. Iâ€™m applying for my gun license soon, better safe than sorry. Iâ€™d rather be fully dead than somehow worse off and brain dead for the rest of my life. Maybe not my last post, well have to see how easy it is to acquire a gun. If I hit another depressive rut im planning on ghosting my gf (were long distance rn) and hanging myself if I donâ€™t have a gun by then.
