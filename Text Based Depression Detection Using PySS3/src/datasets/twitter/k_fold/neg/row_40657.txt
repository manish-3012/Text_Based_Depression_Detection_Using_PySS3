I am trans and have no friends and seem to have to other optionsDuring this pandemic there is no way to make IRL friends and it is killing me. I am drunk right now but I just got off of a 3 year alcohol binge where I had 20+ drinks every single day. Now I am more sober but I alienated all my friends in that time. I have no way to make friends right now and I am on the verge of killing myself, I probably will tonight, because there seems to be no hope. I am trans but not far enough along on hormones that I want to present femme all the time and I worry that new friends will ostracize me after I come out in a few months as a girl. There are not trans groups near me that are meeting IRL. Literally WTF am I supposed to do there is no one around to support me. Suicide feels like the only option because it will probably be years before someone will love me enough to talk to me.
