I never thought that getting drunk would save my life.I'm an alcoholic. I never wanted to admit that, but it's true, and tonight the unthinkable happened...

For the past few months, I've really been feeling a bit. A bit too much if you ask me and lately, it's really been getting to me. I've been feeling so ashamed of the kind of person I am and I've been feeling very worthless as well. I genuinely didn't want to live anymore and decided that I'd kill myself this week. I came up with this extreme plan (that honestly would've worked) and promised myself that tonight would be the night, so long as I got drunk. 

After getting drunk, I wasn't motivated anymore and I, for the first time in a long time, decided to live...

I decided to live.

And I am, for the moment.

I decided to live because I was scared, and I was scared of what would happen to my pets. They are really one of the only reasons I'm alive.

I don't know how I'll feel once I'm sober, but tonight hit me quite hard. Harder than I expected it to. Fingers crossed that I'll decide to ditch all plans of suicide once sober. I doubt it, but it's worth a shot to have some hope at least.

Oh boy, I'm going to regret getting THIS drunk later. At least I'm alive to regret it though!

Enough self pity for tonight... Good night everyone. And stay strong... You never know what may happen and change your mind.
