I've been teetering for a month now and I feel like it's time.I give myself 24 hours every day to try to not feel like this. I think this is my last 24 hours. Today was the icing on the cake and it sucks because I can't even bring the words up to explain the situation I'm in. I just hate my life, I hate myself and i want everyone to hate me.

I tried talking to the suicide hotline today and they really seemed like they didn't give a shit. I can't even cry anymore I'm just blank inside. Please I need someone to talk me out of this.
