Why shouldn't I attempt suicide?I don't know what I'm asking.
I want to know how to kill myself so that it looks accidental. I want a fool proof way. I'm not asking for ways, for I also don't want to. I don't know what I want. I just want to leave this world, leave this place, leave my head, NOW, any which way. I slipped up and bought razors today. and I really want to use them. I don't see why not. I've stopped using them before, although I've continued slipping up constantly with self harm in other ways, but nothing major, and, I want to use NOW. And I hate feeling so alone.
