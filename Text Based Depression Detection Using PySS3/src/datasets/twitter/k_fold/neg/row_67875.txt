I'm done.I don't what too do anymore, I was molested as a child, I was physically and mentally abused. Now I'm constantly depressed and in pain (got a back injury while being beat). My fiance and mother won't tall about it with me, I brought it up to my fiance and she said really do we have to do this now? I'm just sooooo done, I don't know what to do I don't want to live but I care too much for my family.


I just dont think I'm built for this world.
