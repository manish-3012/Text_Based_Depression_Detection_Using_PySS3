Everything that is wrong with me is my fault. It's my fault for not trying harder. it's my fault for wanting death more than a better life.I have no one to blame but myself for not caring about getting better anymore. it's my fault for wanting death more than a better life. it's my fault.

 i'm the lazy one. i'm the stupid one. i'm the childish one, even though i'm not a child. it's my fault for being lazy and stupid and chilidhs and not caring about getting better, just caring about dying. im' a terrible person and deserve every bit of my own suffering. it's my fault. i don't dessserve the release of death.

i'm so sorry. please, i'm only asking death. please just let me die. it's all i'm alsking, and i can't make mysel die...i can't control that. i can't stop god/universe from making me live. all i can do is beg for death.

i give up. whatever. i hope i die tonight. if not, maybe god/ujnverse will let me succeed in my plan. 

i'm sorry. i'm a stupid lazy person. it's my fault. i'm sorry.
