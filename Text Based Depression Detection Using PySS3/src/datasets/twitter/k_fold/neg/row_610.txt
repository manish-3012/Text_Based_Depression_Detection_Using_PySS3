I am not sure what I expect out of sharing this.
  Anytime I have reached out in a moment of deep despair to our community through the various subs all the beautiful people rush forward and try to help which I appreciate immensely.  However, even if I am alleviated of the pain of my existential issues, the issues themselves remain.  So I have found myself in a moment with less emotional intensity and may be better equipped to rationally examine this.  I have been VERY careful not to discuss this with most people because I fear disrupting their foundation upon which all the good things rest (ideals, dreams, goals...etc).  If I am to progress past this low point in my life, I absolutely need to approach the issue from all angles here.  I am not great with structuring these things sometimes, so please forgive me.

  Of all the lingering elements from my past that still bother me, the foremost amongst these is my endless source of **self-loathing** and my issues being invested in this world, in this life.  While discovering I was trans finally gave me what I needed for decades, the knowledge of what I am, everyone is aware that 'it can get worse before it gets better'.  I rode most of these waves rather well, I believe, considering all that has to be unpacked, disposed off and the healing that must occur.  But I think these two things I mentioned keep coming back to bother me.  

  How can I stop hating myself (if I even should!)?  I have felt this and fed this since middle school, about twenty years ago.  While life has occasionally distracted me from this omnipresent fact, this is part of the poison that seeps into the well.  I have tried creating positive feedback loops with proper self-talk and productivity, revising my mental narrative and outright ignoring those thoughts and feelings and focusing elsewhere.  I have seen therapists and I am familiar with their tools.  But this is DEEP and implacable.

  Next, as with many of us on this path, I managed to **survive by escaping** this world.  For me that meant graphic novels, standard novels, gaming and eventually substances.  Some people think I am strong, but I only managed to endure by being mindful of putting one foot in front of the other while dreaming of other worlds, of another life.  Now, even when I try, I struggle to engage with this life.  And by that I mean to really feel invested, to DESIRE to work on something and improve something, to have the hope of any success.  I have always felt like I have been a person that just 'was not there'.  

(Warning for others that are older, harsh thoughts for my age ahead)

All of this is exacerbated by getting older.  Its a feeling like waking up from a coma in a house that is literally falling apart around me.  Having to struggle to get my life on track fighting with the momentum it has taken on and maintaining (without any hope of actually improving really) my body and appearance is just devastating.  I was better of not caring at all.  Who is out there for me?  What is there at all at this point?  Acceptance?  Surrender?  Just making it through and surviving?  Those sound like compensation prizes, like an achievement worth little to no value.  I have focused on goals, ran upon the hedonic treadmill, and behind every thought is...**why?**  My moment basking in the warmth of my trans epiphany has faded, and I am left with the harsh reality of picking up whatever pieces I can find and seeing their value.  And for me, I see none.  

I am weak, I am afraid, and I am a burden to my family and friends.  I have broken hearts when I was lost and made so many mistakes.  I just want rest, please....I just want to not be me anymore.  I do not think kind sentiments will do much anymore.  

Thank you for reading,
