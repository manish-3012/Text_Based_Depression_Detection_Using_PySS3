I keep thinking someone or something is going to save me.What a stupid idea. No one is going to save me. People donâ€™t understand why i canâ€™t reach out for help. When youâ€™ve been like this for so long, and when you feel like such a burden,  you feel like you should just be able to deal with it. Iâ€™ve asked for help. Been through the dramatics of it all. Yet I always end up in the same place. Feeling like a fucking dead (wo)man walking. Half zombie/half dead, lots of apathy and disconnect. I hate myself.
