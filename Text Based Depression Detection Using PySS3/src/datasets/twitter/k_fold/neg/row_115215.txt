Anxious to go back to university, feeling suicidalHi I posted here recently about how I don't want to go back to uni as I will be doing a new degree in September and I'd rather work.
Sadly I haven't gotten a job and the one job I was offered had to be retracted due to the election coming up (UK). Now, I really don't want to go back to uni and I feel my suicidal thoughts already drifting back.

My mum just reassured me that it will be ok, but also remarked how different I am. It breaks my heart to hear this.
