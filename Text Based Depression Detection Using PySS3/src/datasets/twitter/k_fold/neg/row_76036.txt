I just want a reason to live , maybe one day .
I just want a reason to live.

Thereâ€™s nothing I enjoy here. 

Thereâ€™s no one that needs me here. 

Thereâ€™s nothing I want to live for Iâ€™m only alive because I canâ€™t let my sisters suffer so much.

Not one day goes by where i wish I never woke up.

Maybe one day Iâ€™ll want to wake up.

Maybe one day Iâ€™ll have a reason to live.

Maybe one day Iâ€™ll be happy.
