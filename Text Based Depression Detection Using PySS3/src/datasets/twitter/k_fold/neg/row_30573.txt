Completely Disassociated from life, no actual reason to live that has any significanceWhat to do when it doesn't matter if your happy or sad or miserable, loved etc just tired of living? Life is so mundane unintressing and time is relative to the one experiencing it so whether I grow old and die or kill my self makes no difference in the end. I know there's no after life and even if there was I would be fine in hell I would actually prefer it there. Just uninterested in participating in this world not for negative reasons more like boredom plus the fact I've always hated my parents for even creating me. Not like I don't enjoy things or have good memories more like cool I came and saw and now I'm bored and wish to move on and rest eternally. Any ideas on similar feelings. And before you tell me I have so much to live for and shit dont sell me that or the emotional side "think of the pain you will cause" not like it will actually matter once our sun dies and our planet stops existing my friendsand familywill all get over it and any pain I cause woulddisappear after their deaths. Emotions are petty and meaningless. Anyways just wondering how many of you feel this was and any idea on good ways to end it all. Been thinking about overdosing on heroin laced with fentanyl on a beach watching a sunset kinda my fantasy been dreaming of it for yrs.
