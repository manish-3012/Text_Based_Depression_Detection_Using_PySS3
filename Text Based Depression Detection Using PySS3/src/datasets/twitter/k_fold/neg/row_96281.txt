Unapproachable parentsI've been trying so hard the past month to improve my life in lots of different aspects whether it's hygiene, my diet, how I think, how I interact with others, etc, but the same suicidal thoughts remain.

I sit in my room trying my hardest to distract my mind, and when I need help with something naturally I try and talk to my mother about it. Every time I attempt to talk to her or ask a simple question she either shuts me down entirely and dismisses it or answers my questions with more questions I can't answer. I struggle with speaking and sometimes I just freeze/tear up, so I have all these thoughts and feelings I want to express but they're trapped inside of my head. I want to call her an inconsiderate unapproachable bitch but I don't do that. I want to shout as loud as possible and run my fist through a wall but I don't do that either. I sit here and stew forever. I'm growing to despise my family the more time passes. They're even more dull and boring than I am with my depression. I want to magically make a big stack of money appear in front of me, move far away and not speak to them ever again or for a very long time at least. 

I want to smash my head against a wall until I forget who I am or until I die. I want to tie a noose and hang there asphyxiating. I want everything to go black as I go unconscious forever.

And then I slap myself in my face as hard as I can with both hands to snap myself out of those thoughts and I carry on trying to better myself. I'm crying so hard as I write this. Why won't it stop, please help.
