I wish I could talk to professionals without having the cops called on me/involuntarily hospitalized.This is the literal reason I refuse to get help. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized. Iâ€™ve had the cops called on me. It doesnâ€™t fucking help. I canâ€™t even honestly talk to a therapist without fear of this.

Why the hell am I held against my will when I express how I feel? It just makes it worse.
