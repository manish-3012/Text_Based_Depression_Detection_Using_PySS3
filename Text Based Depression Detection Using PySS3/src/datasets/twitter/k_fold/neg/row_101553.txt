Iâ€™m tiredI gave up a long time ago, I stopped doing homework and going to classes (dropped out of a public school and tried doing online classes). i couldnâ€™t even finish high school, iâ€™m 19 and a half and still havenâ€™t finished high school. i hate how selfish i am, and how badly i want attention right now. i want to reach out to anyone who cares about me but i donâ€™t want them to worry either. iâ€™ve been thinking about dying, last night was the worst of it, i tried thinking to a higher power and asking if they could forgive me for all the shitty things iâ€™ve done and let me be done with everything now without causing my family and friends pain. i thought of ways i could do it. i havenâ€™t worked in a long time and all i do is play video games and watch anime. i donâ€™t want to provide for myself, i donâ€™t wanna work or live alone. i canâ€™t figure out how to love other people romantically and iâ€™m tired of being alone in that sense. i donâ€™t see a point in continuing, in trying, in working or trying to do school, in anything 

i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m asking for or why iâ€™m here other than wanting attention so i can get these feelings out, sorry if i disturb or upset anyone with this
