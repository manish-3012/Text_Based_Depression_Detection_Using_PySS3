Do you believe in miracle after death2 years ago , i survived my suicide attempt after went through the worst year of my life . I thought my my life will get better , my anger will calm down , my saddest will fade . But it didn't , the longer i lives the more i feel angry , more saddest , it never gone . After seeing the people who one fight with me now turn they back on me , i just can't take it anymore , everyone in my life betrayed me . I just hope that i'm going die soon or someday i'm gonna piss off someone enough in hope that they are going to kill me . I rather die than live in agony like this , i do believe in happiness afterlife ( i don't believe in heaven or hell , but still i believe in something else , something different )
