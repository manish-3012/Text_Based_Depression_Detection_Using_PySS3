Fuck this world and its liesI did everything right. In high school I got involved in extracurriculars, earned a 4.2 gpa, volunteered and went to a really good school in a very difficult stem field. I changed majors to another STEM field and struggled a bit first but eventually started doing what I am suppose to do: getting internship experience, getting involved on hands on engineering clubs, getting a leadership position, and maintaining a decent GPA. Even getting all that was an uphill battle with all of its competition. 

Now I am back at home rotting away while my friends both in high school and college are doing well. It seems like anything less than a perfect performance on an interview means I won't make it to the next step. It sucks going through 4 interviews with the same company only to have some picture perfect candidate swoop in and take it. 3 months and I don't have anything solid. 

Yes even people who dropped out of college are doing well, because they either had the right people vouch for them, have excellent sales skills or just simply lived in the right location. Conventional wisdom says they won't become successful but it seems like I would've done better by simply working my way up or focusing on becoming one of the popular kids than doing the right thing. 

I'm so afraid of missing out on my 20s.
