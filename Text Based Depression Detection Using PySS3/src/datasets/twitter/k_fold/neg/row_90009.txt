Please help meGirlfriend just ended things. We were on a break for the summer and she came back. She lead me to believe weâ€™d continue dating after summer, but just told me itâ€™s over. It seems so trivial to you guys because you hear this shit everyday, but I have never felt this way about anyone or felt like this after things have ended. Iâ€™m halfway through a bottle of Jameson and I feel like my heart has been ripped out. My world is falling apart and Iâ€™m scared. Sheâ€˜s all Iâ€™ve been thinking about the last few months and the thought of being with her again has kept me going, but she ended things over text. Iâ€™m graduating college this year and am now completely doubting everything Iâ€™ve ever done. Iâ€™m freaking out. Please help me.
