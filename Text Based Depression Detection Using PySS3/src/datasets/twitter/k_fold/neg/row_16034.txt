Not going to survive summerQuarantine is killing me. I can't see anyone. I'm so touch starved and horny all the time. I just want to drown in the river where I live. Everytime people say, "It gets better.", it just gets so much worse. I don't want to live like this. I hate the U.S., but I can't escape.
