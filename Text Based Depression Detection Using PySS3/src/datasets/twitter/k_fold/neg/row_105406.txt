Tired.I'm not even sure what I'm doing here... I've been suicidal before, and I've lived with suicidal thoughts for, hell, at least a decade now. I'm tired of the drugs and the therapy and the struggle... I'm not out, not yet. I've got big things on the horizon, but I just don't see the point. I'm bored with everything. Listless. Drift from room to room in my apartment, go out in the cold night and walk around looking for something, anything that'll light a spark in me again. Haven't found it, beginning to doubt I will. I used to write, real prose writing... now I sit at my computer and instead of working on my novel or just playing around with words, I plink away about meaningless drivel, trite bullshit. Suicide... it'd be easy. So, so easy... tempting. The few people with whom I am close, they'd be hurt; sure. But I think they'd understand, too. It's not like they won't see it coming either, it's obvious to anyone with eyes that I'm just not myself lately. Maybe it's the recent break up, I don't know... all I know is, I can't keep living like this. I'd honestly rather die. Is that so wrong?
