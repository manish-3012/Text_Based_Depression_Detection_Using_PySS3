idea of suicide is soothing to meI dont know if I even should post it here. All i know is, that the fact i might as well be gone in just a few hours is soothing. There wouldnt be any more pain, no problems, nothing troubling. No more sadness. No one would even notice for quite some time. And after a while, if they would notice, they would be fine again. Happier, even. No one needs me anymore, not since my dog died, not really. I might just ease it a little bit for others, and join my dog today. Maybe it will be better this way. I know how. And I know that this time, there might be no one to stop me. So, this might be my good byes. I loved you all.
