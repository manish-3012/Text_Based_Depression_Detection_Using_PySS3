Called Local Crisis Line as Last Resort - Rude OperatorSo as a last resort, I called a local crisis line here. And after waiting 45 min. the operator answered. She sounded super annoyed and bored. I explained my situation to her and all she said was "uh-huh" a lot. Then when I stopped talking, silence. And she then said "well, if you ever need us, we're here." Then she hung up. Just wow.
