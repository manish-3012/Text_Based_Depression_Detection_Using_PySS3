My therapist treats me like a kidEvery time I go to a therapy session I just end up feeling shittier than when I first got there. I feel as if my therapist doesn't treat my problems with respect.

 Instead of talking about my trauma and finding out how it effects me and my view of the world, I have to literally color in pages on things I feel confident about and fill in worksheets about how to talk in "I" statements and "how hormones effect your mood". I already know all of that shit, and I feel like I'm in a kindergarten class and the teacher is trying to explain to me that "other kids have feelings too". 

I try to talk about my father's refusal to treat me as an individual with my own thoughts and opinions, and her response is "have you tried telling him that??" No shit Karen! what do you think I've been doing for my entire life? But the very problem causes itself (he doesn't see me as an individual &gt; I try to tell him I feel disrespected &gt; he doesn't care because he doesn't see me as an individual). 

I try to talk about my hygiene issues and my apathy towards taking care of myself because of my self loathing and suicidal thoughts, she replies "you know you need to shower, right???" OF FUCKING COURSE I KNOW THAT?! does she think I'm secretly five?? I feel like I have a better grasp on all of my problems then the fucking trained professional does. What's even the point of showing up to sessions?

What's worse about this is I don't have the opportunity to switch to another therapist because I literally can't afford it (I don't have any health insurance; I'm currently in an optional pay program). This also brings up a lot of other problems, like the fact I've had to switch therapists 3-4 times and I can't get close enough to any of them to feel emotionally comfortable with talking about deeper issues. 

All of this bullshit makes me feel like no one can truly understand me and I should just give up trying to explain and off myself already
