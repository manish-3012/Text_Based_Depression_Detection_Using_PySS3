Feeling pathetic and pointlessI read the "No More Mr. Niceguy" yesterday and installed Tinder in the morning. Bad idea! Feeling suicidal again. Whats the point of living when you are never good enough? Some women liked me but they were all settled with pets, hobbies, apartements and social life. I'm still figuring out the apartement side. 

The book made it clear for me that women have always loved me, but also found me to be pathetic and weak. I took their advice very litterally and closeted my sexuality ("dont objectify women" == "dont express sexuality to any woman at all"). Be nice and kind and dont be like the bad men. I became pathetic, and raveled in it for so long. It was easy and like being a child.  

I posted a picture on instagram where I was sad looking. Got a couple of likes and realized I have one friend. 

I'm entering middle age and I think in a couple of years time I will be a suicide statistic. I'm one of these failed men that never lived up to anyones expectations, even less so my own. I have almost no sexual experience, no capital, no education. I have a job and a home, which I guess is more than some. However I come from a middle class socially where family life is central and the downfall to here has been a long and depressing journey with a lot of humiliation. I dont fit in there anymore. I dont have a family of my own. Every step I have taken in life I have messed up and taken one step closer to poverty and loneliness. Its like all the women around me are walking a upward staircase and I'm walking on a downward one. The system is simply built like this. 

After years of therapy, I still dont know what I like, who I am, how to behave like a man. Its like I learn nothing. I'm a void that exists in a vacuum.
