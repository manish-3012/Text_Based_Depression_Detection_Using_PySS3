Maybe tonightI was holding on for my mom. I couldn't do it to her. But then she did something really shitty, a v2 of the thing that gave me depression in the first place almost seven years ago, and I don't feel like I have to hang on for her any more.

I got a photography assignment today. For a week, use only a disposable camera. No digital photos. Then the prof will get the photos developed and the students will each write a paper about the experience. I think it would be an interesting art project--everything Airbag saw on their last day, up until the rooftop door. I could make it like a tour of my home. The place I go to get quiet, the pets and people I live with, my favorite classroom, the touristy campus photos, the place I get hot chocolate. I don't know if those photos would ever be shared with anyone, but they'd be there. My prof might like them.

On the other hand, I kind of want to graduate. But if I'm dead I can't regret ending it can I? I'm going to have depression for the rest of my life. This is maybe my best shot to end it without being crushed by the guilt of hurting my mom.

But my friends. They'll be sad. But they have each other, right? They'll be okay. I'm just worried about the guilt I'll leave them with. My mom, of course, will know that what she did was the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't know how she'll live with it. I love her still, and I don't think she's a bad person, and I don't even consider this to be her fault, but she will blame herself and I wish she wouldn't. My friends, some of whom have noticed something is up with me today, might wish they'd done more when really they've done all they can. Maybe that's projection. Maybe I just know I'd blame myself if one of my friends did this.

Sorry for the rambling. I'm deciding whether to finish my assignment or just pack up my room and start writing notes.
