Would my mother care if i died?For years i have been thinking about killing myself but every time i try something stops me i don't know what it is but i always fail.

My mom is an alcoholic and has been for years but she has been sober as far as i know since she got pregnant my little brother is almost 2 months old and i love him so much even though i live with my dad because she lied and told him i pulled a knife on her.

She has told me many times that i should just kill myself already because no one wants me anyway she even once told me that she wished she could bash my head in with a hammer.

My dad always made me feel better though he is always there for me when i need him but....

Should i just die.

My sister tells me i should too.

I just wonder if anyone other then my dad would care.
