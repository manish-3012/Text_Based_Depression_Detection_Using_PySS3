I should not be hereBut I am,I have no right to be here,i have money and a loving family,i am selfish,prideful,a liar and so on.I am a bad person.I am lonely,only got 1 friend ,i have to use this fake persona to keep him. However that is not the only reason i'm here,i am used to being lonely,since my childhood really,i don't like it,but i have adapted to it.
The real reason is that life seems so meaningless to me,i have lost all motivations,i have life deciding exams in a few months,didn't study at all,what exactly am i supposed to be fighting for?To make my family proud?I have already disappointed them so many times and frankly i don't care anymore.For a nice little future?Just so i can die one day as an old person in some cold hospital room?That's not my idea of life.
I did like some people,i think i even loved a girl once,of course they didn't like me back.
At one point i decided to turn my life around,i am going to the gym for 2 years now,i have studied hard,i have really tried.But i only lost acquaintances since i started this change.
So I am here,a long long time ago i was like you people,i wanted to save others from the depths of depression,I did talk to people to telling them how life is worth it,it did work for some.But looking back,i realize how much of an hypocrite i was .
In the end i will never understand how it seems so easy for others to live,to be happy,to have friends,why is it so natural for them?
I am to tired to try anymore.The best part of the day is when i sleep,when my consciousnesses shuts down.So..that's that.
