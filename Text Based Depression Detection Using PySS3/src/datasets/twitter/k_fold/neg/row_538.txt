No future. What now?I'm just so lost right now. 

I grew up in a poor family. My sister just found that she can't afford to go to University. So, to put her through, my dad is going to mortgage the house so he can pay for it. But that leaves none for me to go to University, or collage. 

I can't go to school. I have to move out the day I graduate (I'm graduating this year), but I don't have any money at all. I'm not allowed to get a job during school, and I've been trying to get a job all summer but no one will hire me. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. When I finish high school I'm on out the street. No job, no money, no place to stay. I can't go to collage. What am I supposed to do? I don't want to kill myself, but it seems like the only way out. I'm lost.
