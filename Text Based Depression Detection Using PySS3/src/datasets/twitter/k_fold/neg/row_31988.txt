Putting my plan in motionIâ€™ve been depressed for almost 2 years now. Been in a on and off relationship for the past 4 years. The woman I love left me and has since blocked me on everything and wonâ€™t respond to any of my messages. She finally broke things off completely because I admitted that I wanted to kill myself because of the pain I carry from us being apart. She told me that she couldnâ€™t deal with my manipulation anymore. Playing her feelings. But I wasnâ€™t trying too. I was being honest with my feelings. Now after 5 months of no contact I just canâ€™t handle it anymore. I feel despair and like a failure for losing her. Iâ€™m 27, down to 90lbs, and can barely look at myself in the mirror without being disgusted with myself. Since the beginning of the year I lost her, my job, my car, my apartment and now Iâ€™m living with my parents again. Iâ€™ve tried medication, going to in patient facilities and talking to my parents but I just canâ€™t see the light. So I finally decided to sell anything of value I have and put that money towards getting a gun. Iâ€™m currently in the process of selling things to get enough money. Iâ€™ve found sites like armslist and texasguntrader that have listings for guns where you can meet up with someone to buy kinda Craigslist style. Once I get the gun I plan on going somewhere peaceful outside and enjoy my last moments starring at the stars. My depression is so bad that my dad told me heâ€™s going to buy me another car but I donâ€™t even want it. Iâ€™m hoping I can carry out my plan before he wastes the money. I could win the lottery with the damn mega ball and cash option and still wouldnâ€™t make me crack a smile or see a glimmer of hope. Iâ€™m old enough to realize that material things wonâ€™t give me happiness but rather the connections I have with others. But the only connection I care about having is with my ex. I wanted to marry her, buy us a house, and have children together. But I lost her and know sheâ€™s never coming back to me ever again. I just want the pain I have in my heart and mind to go away. Iâ€™ve tried before to get over her and I already know that Iâ€™m not able to. I hope sheâ€™s happy and has a life that sheâ€™s always dreamed of. Sheâ€™s a great woman and so beautiful inside and out. Hopefully wherever I go after this I can watch over her and be her guardian angel.
