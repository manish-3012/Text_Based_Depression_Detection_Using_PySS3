hey..No one's really going to read nor care about this probably, but I'm really, really depressed.. I keep getting the urge to cry. The tears are just sitting there, waiting. I just.. I dunno.. I feel like everyone would actually be better off without me? And I know that may sound clichÃ© or something everyone says when they're suicidal, haha. But I truly feel that this is true -- deep in my gut. I'm just socially inept and I don't have much going for myself. Nothing special about me. No reason to stay around, you know..? I don't know.. I'm sorry if I'm being annoying, I just.. I'm sorry..
