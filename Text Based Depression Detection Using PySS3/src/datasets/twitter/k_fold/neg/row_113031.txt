At the bus stopFirst off I would like to address the elephant in the room, I am fully aware that posting here is a sign of uncertainty and all that jazz. And yet earlier standing with a foot on the steps of the bus felt really good, one more step and that would be me, but I didn't. Not right then, maybe I had some bullshit idea that I want to hear my girlfriend tell me she loves me one more time, maybe my best friend who I lost a month or so ago is up there waiting to kick my ass for being an idiot (she did that a lot and saved my life in the process a few times), maybe I'm worried that it'll take a few days or more for people to notice I'm gone and so no one will know that my dogs and cats are hungry inside the house or maybe it's simply that I always pictured the bus to my final destination being inviting and warm like the cat bus from Totoro not one from a scrap heap that's dirty and beaten up. I don't want my last memory to be of the smell of my own shit. 

And yet, the bus is still there. I cannot tell it to go away, because next time I might be brave and put both feet on its worn floor. I feel bad about the lives and loves that I'll be leaving in my wake, and maybe if I was a better person by even a fraction I'd stay for them, I'd endure the mood swings and the craziness for them so that they wouldn't feel the pain. I'm really not that good of a person. 

This feeling might not even last, maybe in an hours time I'll be so hyper I need scrapped of the ceiling, maybe the energy that lets me even contemplate moving at all will disappear and I'll be left alone with just the voices and the darkness. That's the thing I don't know and it drives me mad, my episodes are getting worse and more intense with a propensity for a unique and fun combination of any and all moods. I can't be bothered with it anymore. There is so much that is good and beautiful and magical in my life but somehow eventually bipolar always finds a way to destroy it. 

Well fuck you bipolar, I know that for me to exist you have to tag along but it works both ways once I'm gone you will cease to be too.
