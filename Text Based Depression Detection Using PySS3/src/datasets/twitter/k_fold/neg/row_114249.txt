I'm Absolutely PatheticMe on Thursday: Literally believing this would be my last day and barely being talked out of suicide by my therapist.

Me Everyday Since Thursday: Hoping I die and never wake up. Being extremely disappointed when I wake up every morning.

Me Today: Obsessively checking the news on the coronavirus and doomsday prepping, scared of my loved ones and I getting sick and possibly dying.

Literally, what is wrong with me? It's just like pain. I only want pain when I'm the one in control of it. I only want death if I'm in control of it. I'm so fucked up in the head, it's not even funny.
