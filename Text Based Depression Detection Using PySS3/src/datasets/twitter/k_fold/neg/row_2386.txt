Why do I even try? It only makes things worse.Every time I go out of my way to do something it ends up biting me in the ass. If I help someone, it never helps them. If I try to help myself, it only makes my situation worse. I can apply this to anything I do in my life and I donâ€™t understand why. I just donâ€™t see the point in trying if itâ€™s only going to get worse. Iâ€™m just venting but I wonder if Iâ€™ll ever be able to get the outcome that Iâ€™m trying to get.
