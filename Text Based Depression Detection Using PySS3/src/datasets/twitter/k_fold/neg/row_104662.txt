I don't think I want to get betterI was having a conversation with my friend yesterday about depression, and she asked "If you knew that life could be possible for you, no drawbacks or bad side effects, would you want that life?", and it made me realize that I don't know what I want, and I don't even know if I want to escape the current state of my life. So that was fun
