Having a reason to stay alive hurts really bad sometimesThis might be kinda a long post so apologies in advance. I just really donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m feeling right now or how to describe it.

I feel like Iâ€™ve been *this* close to doing it for a really long time. Actively planning my death gave me the most determination I can remember having. I was honestly weirdly proud of my work, that I knew that this would almost certainly kill me, without too much discomfort, etc. Hell, I wrote a script to send out suicide note emails to people on a time delay that I could cancel if I backed out or fucked up, so nobody could try to save me or whatever. But, itâ€™s kinda all done. I honestly canâ€™t think of anything thatâ€™s reasonably likely to happen that would keep me from dying. I have everything I need except one bit that Iâ€™m waiting to buy to prevent myself from doing it on impulse. The issue is that one of those emails I need to send is to someone I donâ€™t think I know how to say goodbye to.

So, my partner is an absolutely amazing human being and I really love them. They also happen to be the only person I actually think would care if I died. I really donâ€™t want to let them down. Also I know that theyâ€™re also not doing great on the will to live front either, and so I donâ€™t know if this is an arrogant assumption but I just really donâ€™t want this to turn into them also doing it when I go. They need to be ok, and I donâ€™t know how to ensure that. But I really need to figure it out. 

I know itâ€™s a bit dumb to complain about having a reason to live when thereâ€™s so many people here who feel they donâ€™t have any, so Iâ€™m sorry about that. And I know it probably makes me a pretty shit person to still really want to go through with it even knowing what it could do to one of the few truly kind people on this planet. I just hate that this is going to end up hurting people, since avoiding that was pretty much the whole reason for doing it in the first place. I donâ€™t know how to make this situation better.
