DelimaI donâ€™t have a dad and my mom is a narcissist. She kept me from everyone growing up. Never really took care of me besides surface needs but took any opportunity she could to punish me. Sheâ€™s also extremely religious. Thatâ€™s where she seeks her power and control over others. So when I came out to her as a lesbian in middle school(technically I was catfished by someone at my church as a cruel joke and outed)... this was perfect for my mother. It began a really deep long painful emotional cycle. I have no one. No family. No friends. I went back into the closet to protect myself and came out again at 16. At 18 I was kicked out for being gay. I lived in my car for 3 months and Iâ€™ve always had a steady job since 16, but I had no credit. I was/am completely alone. I fought my way onto my feet landing really great jobs and thinking through things. Everything was great until 22. I just couldnâ€™t do it anymore. I was â€œsuccessfulâ€ enough for a 22 y/o. I wanted to go to college but I couldnâ€™t afford to as I had to quickly begin providing for myself with no support. Some people say they have no support and really they feel like they have no support. I genuinely have nothing. I was working as a claims adjuster for an insurance company making $55,000 /year. Salary but working +50 hrs a week. I couldnâ€™t do it anymore. I stoped wanting to live. My life feels so empty.. I went through a horrible breakup, lost everything and my only option was to beg my grandmother to stay with her. She isnâ€™t a narcissist but she is extremely damaged, selfish and not a nice person. She sees none of it and all hell breaks loose having a normal, relaxed, â€œI feel/I think/ I believeâ€ conversation with her. As anything that she doesnâ€™t agree with is seen as combative, wrong and treated with hostility. Iâ€™m an adult. I have been for a long time. Iâ€™m forced to be here. I have no healthcare, I want to kill myself so badly. I also donâ€™t want to kill myself but there is genuinely no way out. People suck. Iâ€™m too nice and people constantly use me. I feel like an abused dog with no hope. Iâ€™m not an idiot. Iâ€™ve done a lot of good things but I have nothing. I have no one. Iâ€™m so sick of the cliche â€œcall a helplineâ€ or â€œIâ€™m here for youâ€ or a bullshit  â€œsee a therapistâ€. Iâ€™m 23 and alone. What the hell am I supposed to do. Iâ€™ve lost everything. Every single thing. This is not a joke. I have proof. Itâ€™s so much deeper than what I can  even fit into this post. I have no option. I canâ€™t be here anymore. I donâ€™t want to go to a mental hospital. I have real external problems. Iâ€™ve always been nice and smart and just fucking trying. Iâ€™m too alone, Iâ€™m too angry, Iâ€™m too screwed. Iâ€™m so so so fucking tired. I canâ€™t put into words how badly Iâ€™m hurting. I have to get out of here. I have to get out of this body. No one even knows me. I just wanted to live.
