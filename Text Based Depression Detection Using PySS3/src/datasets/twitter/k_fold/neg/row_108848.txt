I hate realityI want to be happy just once before I die. I want to do something epic I've never had the guts to do, I want to travel somewhere really beautiful just by myself, I want to talk to random people I meet. It just frustrates me that I can't do that as a minor and I don't think I can endure the years until I can. I can't even get myself to break free from the unimportant things that makes me unhappy right now, and I have this ideal vision of how I want to live but I can't fulfill that at least until I'm an adult and I keep doubting that even then I might not be able to do that. I can't accept reality and I'm so alone, I want to live but I despise my life right now and I'm tempted to give up.
