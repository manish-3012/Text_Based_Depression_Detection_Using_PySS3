Feel like I'm just making the pain last longer this wayHello, I've been depressed for years, recently I also freak out randomly, which makes my life considerably nicer as you can imagine. I've been considering killing myself, I was very upset before but now I feel so calm. I've been to a hospital before, been on meds etc. I thought about getting to a hospital or some kind of a program (not sure if there are even any for people like me in my country). But I don't know how to do that (there's a bunch of telephone numbers but I just don't know what to say who to approach) and also I've been there before and it was just pointless, I don't know why I still look for it sometimes or hope for it. Anyways, I feel like my life is just pain all the time, even when everything is fine from the side it's just shit inside, all this pain, I regret I haven't done it earlier, I could've saved myself and others so much pain. I don't think I can be helped at this point. Not sure about anything. Just keep playing the scene of hanging myself in my head over and over and it seems very appealing at the moment.
