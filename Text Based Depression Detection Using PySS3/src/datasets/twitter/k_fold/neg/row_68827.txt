Its just natural order, not gods willI will die. I tryed living but everything just gets fucked up and its always my fault. I cant do anything i always need help i just wanted to do it my self but i fuck up i try to concentrate but i fuck up. Dont beat my self up? some one has too. I dont know how to live my own life, I need nothing, but im hurting inside by how pathetic my life was, how i said ill try and it eathier didnt work or backfired on me. It was never great maybe one year of my life is kinda worth remembering but happiness will never come to me i do not remember the feeling i just wanted to love sombody but i cant feel love nor someone else's love, I can not feel connection with sombody i have no friends because i do not know how to talk, how to have a conversation.

I always said suicide is the way to go if shit hits the fan, and shit been hitting the fan for six years now its time to uphold my word. Dreaming hurts, Thinking hurts. I do not wish to die but i feel as if its just natural to go out. Dreaming about feelings just pains me. Life flew pass at least life that i was waiting for has longed passed. Hope keeps me going hope i will be better so i could take care of sombody that is going thru the exact same feelings &amp; emotions so i can help them and support them with all my might, but these are just piped up dreams and dreams are becoming Smaller &amp; Samller for each day, each year, each month that passes me by. I do not want to live cause my plan is in ruins but what plan am i talking about... everything about me makes me sick

I haven't felt like a proper man in six years, i do nothing all day, Just do. Just do. I should of died long ago my mind been corrupted for so long, that I do not know myself nor wish to know my self anymore i wish for simple things. I am a simpile man but everything starts on complicated and ends  with a land slide. I do not know whats best for me.
