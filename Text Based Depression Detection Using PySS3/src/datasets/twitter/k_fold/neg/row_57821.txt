whats the pointi cant believe i tricked myself into thinking any of my friends even remotely cared about me. like its kinda funny. ive never been good at being friends with anyone because as soon as i start to do well my mental health turns to shit and i cut everyone off. like i keep thinking my friends just hate me but who can blame them lmao. im such a shitty person idk why anyone even tries anymore. think i have a good fucking life and i still scream at my parents and put them through so much stuff. its just selfish that im to scared to actually just kill myself for once. it would just be better if i stopped talking up space and breath. i contribute jack shit to the world. there is literally nothing good coming from my sorry fucking life
