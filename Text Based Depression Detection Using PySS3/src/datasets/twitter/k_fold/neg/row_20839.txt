They just throw me away. Every. Single. Night.Recently in an effort to combat my mental instability and reoccurring suicidal ideation, I reach out to my local suicide hotline. Iâ€™m not talking the text line or call service but the online chat. 
For 5 nights in a row Iâ€™ve reached out and Iâ€™ve been stuck waiting for four hours. Every night I call it quits and continue my impulsive drug habits because either their system is timing out and not telling me, or there is so many people and not enough workers.
Last night I was able to get through to the NSPL chat page but no person joined the chat. I did it twice and no one joined. Tonight when I got on there was 50 people. I made it to 26 and it stayed at 26 for a good 45minutes. Then I exited my window and retried. Currently I am up in the line with 7 people ahead of me. Itâ€™s been like that for about 30 minutes. 

Besides me trying to get help and support the only way I can confidentially anymore I am finally over it. I am finally over life.
Struggling with everything from staying out of the mental hospital to just plain keeping my emotions in check. Everything is current and goes deeper. The only thing left is to say goodbye. Tonight I am leaving and they might find me, they might not. This is no longer a â€˜cry for helpâ€™. This is it.
