iâ€™m terrified all of the time and it feels impossible to live with.im 17 and i suffer from debilitating social anxiety and i keep making plans to end it because over the years iâ€™ve only gotten worse and worse and lately i feel like iâ€™m always a day away from rock bottom, my current method and plan is for the end of this week. my mum, the angel that she is, has always tried to help me but i feel like iâ€™m just burdening her. she shouldnâ€™t have to look after a son that should be moving out of the house. After a recent conversation though, iâ€™ve had hope for the first time in a long time and iâ€™m thinking of telling her how bad things really are to try to work something out. would that be bad and selfish of me? should i just keep things to myself? sorry if i sound bad or weird iâ€™m really bad at talking and words
