Listen to the baby cryHey guys! I'm feeling particularly pouty and mopey today. I whined on this subreddit over a year ago about wanting to die, and I'm still here, alive. You can check out my most recent post to see my latest string of problems, but the tl;dr version is that my first romantic interest in my 27 years of life is on a 15-year-old and I can't focus on anything else. 

Right now, I'm the saddest and most depressed that I have ever been in my life. I just want a good, easy way to get that permanent sleep that I have wanted for so long. The exit bag seems to be the best solution, but I think I want something I can easily procure tonight. Any suggestions?
