Researching methods has become a coping skillBeen dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety...today I'm more anxious than I've been in awhile, kept waking in cold sweats, stomach is in knots, hands shake unless I have a task...

Anyways, I've found that researching suicide methods helps me calm. I've always thought that I will commit suicide, that's the way I'll die because of my deep history with depression. This week I realized 
a) I'm not going to obtain a firearm!
b) I don't have the guts to hang myself (besides, I keep hearing failure stories on that)
c) I don't have the guts to jump in front of a train or cause a car accident

so that leaves me with poisoning/overdose, so researching that stuff....I had set a death date of June 16, but I don't know if I'll be able to obtain what is needed....I still think that if things don't get better, I'll be motivated to obtain what I need to fall asleep forever this year before I turn 35....
