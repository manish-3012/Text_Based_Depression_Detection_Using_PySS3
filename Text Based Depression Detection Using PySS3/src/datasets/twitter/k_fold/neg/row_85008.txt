Killing myself is the only way to protect those around meIâ€™m an 18 year old male, and mentally ill. I have severe anxiety, anger issues, and OCD with constant intrusive thoughts. Sometimes I pity myself and wonder why all of this stuff happened to me. Other times I tell myself to just suck it up and deal with it. Last year, in my junior year of high school, all of my pent up feelings erupted during an argument with my mother over school grades. I impulsively shouted that I wanted to kill her, and knocked her down to the ground. Luckily, my brother was near, so he ran over and tackled me to stop myself. I tried to run upstairs and grab a gun, in order to shoot myself to stop myself from harming anyone else. Truth be told, I donâ€™t know if I actually wanted to kill myself. It didnâ€™t matter, as my family ran upstairs and stopped me. Afterward, I was taken to the mental hospital for a week. It was the only time in my life that I had ever felt â€œnormalâ€ around others, and adjusting back to regular life was hard. Itâ€™s been a year, and I still think about the whole incident monthly. A part of me wants to just end my life so that I canâ€™t ever hurt anyone again. I just need some direction, and to not feel so alone and full of guilt.

TLDR: I physically hurt someone close to me, and now I want to end my life to prevent it from happening again.
