The End(Suicide letter to my best friend)Well, I don't know how exactly to tell you this so I guess I'll just say it.

Eric, next weekend I'm going to kill myself. I'm not going anywhere in life. Everyone thinks I'm a failure and it's true I am. I'm never going to succeed in life. I'm Canadian therefore I cannot do anything in America. My grades are shit which means I'm never going to be accepted into a Canadian University let alone any school at all. What the fuck am I going to do?!

No one will want to marry me because I'm stupid. I mean look, you didn't even want me.

I'm bitchy, dramatic, annoying, ugly, fat, short, and stupid. No matter what these things will never change.

Eric you're a very smart guy. You will go far in life. You put your mind to something and you don't let anything get in your way. I wish I had those skills. You get along with everyone you meet. I have never heard anyone say anything bad about you. Thats also a great quality to have.

I truly and sincerely appologize for all the shit and nuisance I caused you. I'm sure before you met me your life was just fine. I can only imagine that now your life must be pretty awesome.

When I die, I just want you to remember all the good memories and times we shared together.

Well, guess this is goodbye. I'll miss you.
