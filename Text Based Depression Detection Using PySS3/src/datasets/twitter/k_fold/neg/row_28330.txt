I'm considering suicide againYesterday it just occurred to me that i still have the option of suicide. I never stopped wanting to kill myself but i put the idea out of my mind because of shit like, "so and so will be sad" you guys know what i mean. Nothing special happened yesterday just the usual shitty day and the usual shit mood but for whatever reason it just popped into my head that i can do it. And since then ive actually started to feel a little better having the option of suicide, not happy but a little comforted. I figured enough is enough. I feel like people only care if you kill yourself because they dont want to feel guilty or whatever which i cant blame them for feeling that way. And be honest with yourself if i or some other stranger on the internet killed themself would you care? And i dont mean the superficial kind of care that you put on your face for everyone but would you honestly, care from the core of your heart? Even genuine friends or people you thought would care would forget about us in a few days. Anyways thanks for listening i just needed to vent a little. Dont really want to talk it out right now but i appreciate those of you willing to do so.
