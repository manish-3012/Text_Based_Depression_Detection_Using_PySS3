I WILL NEVER HAVE A GIRLFRIEND! And that's honestly the only thing that I am really sticking around for... **TRIGGER WARNING! (genuine warning, I know some people have aversions on here)**

Yknow man,

Everyday in this rotten world I always ask myself what's there to look forward to. What thing in this world has meaning. What thing is worth staying here for?

I could care less about money or material possession. I wouldn't even really care about having any snake friends if I was able to find any. Maybe it's because I'm a teenage 17-year-old boy, but the only thing I really want in this world is a significant other. All I want is love and sex with just one person. But I'm afraid that the goal is unobtainable

Quick disclaimer; **I'm not trying to convert people or preach an Idea, I'm just venting.**

I'm sick of seeing people both online and irl acknowledge that they will die alone, but then brush it off with some backhanded false wholesomeness by thinking that everything will be okay in the end.

Because It won't be.

In the back of my head I always thought that if you are over the age of 16 (I'm 17) and are still a virgin, then you will likely stay that way forever.

That claim seems outrageous to anyone (me included) at first glance, but the more I've researched and pondered over it the more I'm slowly starting to believe it.

First, there's the population. The assumption that the number of men and women are equal in population is far from true. In the USA, about 61% of the population is male, and 72% of immigrants are also male. In China and India, Men out number women by being over 70% of the population due to the birth laws and abortions.

There simply isn't enough women for all men, meaning that a lot of us will be completely overshadowed. I think I might be one of those people.

Not only that, but OkCupid studies have shown that women would rather date a man who has many wives and isn't ugly, than a man who is faithful but is ugly. This means that of the select few who could potentially have girlfriends, most of them will be abandoned in favor of men who have multiple partners and juggle tons of wives, girlfriends, and so on. This is called Hypergamy. It's a sociopolitical trend that encourages women to be more promiscuous and hypersexual, making them mentally conditioned to only be attracted to the top 5 to 10 percent of the overwhelmingly large male population. 

If you do all the math, the sheer likelyhood of someone who is a genetically inferior beta average-looking male (myself) ever having a partner at all is virtually impossible. This to me is pure fact. Women hate you if you aren't a model or e-boy. I wish I was trolling. This is all actually real.

But lets just theoretically say that I can get a girlfriend and am still a virgin, maybe I'm not even a 10/10 and I'm just above average (all theoretical). I am probably still fucked.

By the age of 18 I feel like (I might be mistaken!) most women have had sex with at least 10-20 men before, even if she says she hasn't. And I also presume that once she has had a taste of men that are genetically superior to me, then she can never be satisfied with someone like me. She might friend me, might enjoy spending time with me, maybe even date me, but she will never truly love me because she has no desire to reproduce with me. She never will.

No matter what empty inspirational wholesome garbage people will spew, I will die alone.

Some of you may read this and try to insult or badger me on what I'm saying in an attempt to shout me down so that other people can continue living a lie. You have the power to ignore this post. Chances are nobody will see this anyway. I didn't strike first!

Genetics are the only thing that dictate whether you will ever get to experience love, the one thing in this rotten world that is actually real. It's the only thing that isn't material fake monetary garbage, it is real and eternal, and you can never have it because you were born a genetically inferior man.

Let's just call it here. I've said way more then what needed to be said.

Once the paper is crumbled up, it can't be perfect again.

To all of you lonely people doomed to a life of misery and plastic temporary pleasures, I guess I can say I absolve you in a twisted way

Does anyone have any advice or proof that all this shit isn't true? I really need it.
