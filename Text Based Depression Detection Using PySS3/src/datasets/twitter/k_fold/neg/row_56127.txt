The relief I felt when I realised I could do it.I've been on meds for years now with a family that built its foundation on lies. I've given up my dreams because they weren't 'practical' and I can't even read a book anymore because what's the point. I was trying to make some sort of a future by looking into a field I had marginal interest in, when the coronavirus struck. Now I'm stuck at home with my parents, who welcomed me home by telling me to prepare for the arrival of my brother, my biggest abuser and the reason I've had a victim's mentality and got picked on everywhere I went. I went online and searched for a final solution, and saw that some chemicals I'll need for it are readily available where I am. I never felt the kind of relief I felt when I saw that. Never felt so good, so peaceful. I used to care about loved ones, but that doesn't seem so important anymore. I don't know what I'm trying to say. This is my first message here. I'm not superstitious, but maybe all of this is a sign.
