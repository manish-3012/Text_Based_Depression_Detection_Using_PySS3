Is life really worth it?I keep asking myself this question.  I have no ambitions to do anything with my life.  I know it's going no where.  I graduated college, but now am working a job I could have gotten right out of high school - so my degree is rather useless.  I have no skills or talents.

I have to find a place to live by the end of the month - but I can't find the motivation to do it.  I keep wondering if life is worth everything.  I'm on the verge of making all the needed preparations to kill myself tomorrow.  I find myself more motivated to do that than to find a place to live and move.  I just don't think there's anything worth it in life to continue.
