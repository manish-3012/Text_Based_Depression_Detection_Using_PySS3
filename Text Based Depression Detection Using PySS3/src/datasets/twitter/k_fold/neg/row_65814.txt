I don't know what to do with myself at this point.I'm 14 years old and I'm a male. If that makes a difference or not I don't know. Over the past year I've noticed more and more depression in me. I've never been to the doctor for it, because I'm afraid of what my parents would say if I told them. Probably laugh it off. My 18 year old brother has depression, OCD, ADD, and a mental disability from drugs. Anyways, recently my life has been going downhill and I'm depressed most of the time out of the week. The only thing that cheers me up is my SO. I know I'm only 14 but she's that special person to me. It's been nearly 8 months and that's a lot longer than most high school relationships, so I'm proud. She's literally everything I live for...and the reason I'm alive. She has depression too and we help each other as much as we can. If I didn't have her, I probably would of killed myself by now. I have a total of maybe 5 friends, and I feel like my family hates me. Like they don't even love me. I hide in the safety of my room because it's always something with me when I'm around them. Just this morning, 10 minutes after I woke up, my mom barged in screaming at me because I was an inconvience to her. I try to do good in school, but it's hard when there's no one to talk to...when there's a group project and you're that one kid who sits in the corner doing it by himself. Today I took one of my knives (I'm a collector) and scraped it against my skin. Not enough to bleed, but enough to leave that white, painful line. I just want to slit my throat and end this curse they call life. I would of, but my SO is just too much to lose...I don't know what to do...
