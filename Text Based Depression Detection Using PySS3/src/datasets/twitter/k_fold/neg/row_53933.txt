My girlfriend..So I'm really worried about my girlfriend.
I knew she had a history of depression, she's seen 6 different counsellors and been on anti-depressants for over a year. But lately things have changed, she's given up, she hates her job, but can't quit because she needs the money. She has no friends. She hates all of her family, the main cause, as she lives with her really big family and has breakdowns every day. Who offer no support, don't care and quite frankly bully her. I feel like I'm the only one supporting her and it's dragging me down too.

I don't know what to do, she's called various hotlines but refuses help and I'm so worried that she's going to end it when the things she says.

What do I do.
