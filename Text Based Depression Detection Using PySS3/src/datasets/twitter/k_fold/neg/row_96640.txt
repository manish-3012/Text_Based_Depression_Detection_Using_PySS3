Alone need help.I'm 26 m.

Lost the girl I was going to marry.

Hate my job.

Live at home. Can't afford anything.

I have no friends.

Always told I'm not what other people want. Friends and gf's.

I've been like this before and reached out to others but it never works out.

Bullied my whole life.

I see no path.

Gym doesn't help.

Always been depressed and feel worthless.

I don't care anymore about anything.

I just want it to end.
