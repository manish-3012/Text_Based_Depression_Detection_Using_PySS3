I called the dreaded hotline todayHave had an epicly difficult month and it all came to a head today with some very bad news I won't bore everyone with -

It was either make the call, check into hospital, or exit stage left, if you catch my drift... No other ideas; I was seriously unable to cope or stop thinking about how to get off the damn planet. 

I called, full of trepidation, and I hear a lot of horror stories from people, but I want to say that my experience was mostly positive. 

The woman I spoke with was incredibly kind, very calm, and she listened intently even though I was a total basket case. 

She didn't send anyone to my house to haul me off somewhere and lock me up. She gave me some resources and told me to call back if I couldn't get those resources in place on my own. She asked me to promise to do this; and to be safe or go to the hospital and I was able to give her my word on that and mean it, which is something I'm grateful for. 

She was there for me. I wish I could thank her more for what she does. It is very important, taxing work that most people could never ever do. 

I just wanted to share. This place is awesome but sometimes you need more help. It's ok. 

I made it through the day. It was an awful mess of a day. I really hate some of the things that happened recently. I feel helpless and scared, but slightly less suicidal. 

Maybe tomorrow will be different. I hope so. 

Thank you all for fighting your own fights one more day. We are not alone guys. Never alone.
