Donâ€™t want to be here, didnâ€™t opt in to do life (23f)I donâ€™t want to do life anymore, and hate that I was cast into this game without choice. My anxiety and depression get worse, and my burden is unfair and too heavy for another to carry. I punch my stomach repeatedly as a form of self punishment for mistakes and failures. Itâ€™s a vicious cycle. I want to opt out of this.
