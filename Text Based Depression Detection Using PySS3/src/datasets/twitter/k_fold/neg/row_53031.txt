Going to shitMe, 24 old year Environmental Engineer trying to find job.

No jobs for me, everything must be 3 years experience.

Parents on birthday, they fight till my lil sis cry

My friends, my very last friend, abandon me to some random girl and left me to root.

I cannot take it anymore.

I know life isn't easy, and I wanna travel and see amazing thing

But it looks like I can't because I'm very poor and lonely.

The only thing I want tonight is to get home and find something to end it all
