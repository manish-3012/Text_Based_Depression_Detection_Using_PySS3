I made my own life worthlessMy whole life, even as a child, everyone in my family perceived me as gifted. I was always the best at everything, trying to impress my parents and everyone else, having the best grades in class and learning new things very quickly.

Now I just feel like a shade of myself.

Everyday I feel awful, I have to listen to my parents yelling at my younger siblings, I don't have any hobbies (because I feel like if I'm not instantly good at it, I'm never gonna get better), I don't have any goals in my life, I don't take care of myself, my grades are getting worse and every time I hear my parents talk behind my back saying that I'm a failure, I just fucking cry.

I've lost my goals.

I'll never be better.

Because I don't try to.

I'm scared of the future, I fear of what happens after death, all these awful thoughts are always in my head, screaming

The only thing that makes me forget about it all are videogames, but because of that now I'm an addicted piece of shit, stuck in his own shithole forever

And I don't want to talk about it with my family or close friends, because they'll either laugh at me or be dissappointed in me even more

I've thought about killing myself countless times to at least make my parents happy for the one last time, but i always wuss out. I'm too much of a failure to even do one thing right

And It's not even about the feeling of death

I just don't want to exist
