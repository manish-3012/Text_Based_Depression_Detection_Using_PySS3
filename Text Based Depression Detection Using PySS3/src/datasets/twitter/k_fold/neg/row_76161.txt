Kind of want to dieAll my life, I've had it drilled into my head that having a disability makes you worthless. 

I have ADHD, and as hard as I try, I am lazy, or underachieving, whatever. 

My 504 plan was ignored and not accommodated at my high school, so I lost my scholarship and my place at university because I did poorly in school. I tried to get my accommodations, but no one cared, so I failed. 

I ended up having to work and go to the worst community college in the area, where I couldn't get classes because it was too impacted. So, I've dropped out because I can't get classes. 

Now I'm doing an EMT course, and I plan on working full time next year. But I won't be making enough to pay rent or feed myself, so I'm likely going to be homeless. Though I need to take care of my dog and make sure she's fed and safe, and I wouldn't know how to do that at a shelter. 

I know that I will be insanely poor, and I will maybe never be able to retire. But I am terrified that I will have to give away my dog. I love her more than anything on the planet, and I really don't know what I'd do without her. 

I don't know how I will be able to feed myself or what I'm going to do. I am really depressed because my options are so limited for living. I don't really have any friends, so I don't know how to find someone to live with, but I'd need a lot of people to make a livable rent, and I don't think I know that many people. 

I'm depressed, but I can't afford therapy. Or medication. 

Fuck whoever said that money can't buy happiness. Tell that to a homeless person. 

I just feel so bleak. I don't know if I want to go on in life. There's nothing aside from my dog keeping me going.
