Boring. Always bitchy. No fun for anybody.I had days I thought it was all good. I have been noticing that I dance to music at the grocery store and in elevators lately. Been making up songs when I drive. Just feeling so invincible. It's all fake. I just thought that because I'm about to finish school second in my class meant I was contributing to life. I was so wrong. My dad has been paying my rent for years. He doesn't deserve the stress. He is a great person. He had a shitty life. It's not fair. My mom helps me eat sometimes even though she is struggling with money. I've been into metaphysics for years and it used to help. Let face it, I'm a leech. I've done nothing but take away from everyone and destroy other people's happiness. I didn't do it on purpose. Everything I did I thought I was doing something to help somebody else. Trying to fulfill expectations and always failing. I hike a lot and mountain bike. I only ever smile when I'm alone in nature. I don't want to be a burden any more. I don't want anyone to clean me up. I don't want to waste any more time or resources. I'm gonna go hike out into the deep woods today. I'm hoping to find a good 60-80 foot drop somewhere. I would at least be useful as good for the wildlife. Maybe in some sort of way, it'll be some kind of redemption for taking so much away from the universe and never giving anything back. My degree was in veterinary medicine so it works in a way. I might not do it today, but something about just finding the spot is driving me to keep going. Just gonna feel it out. See how it goes. Might be today; might be tomorrow. I just know that the longer I stick around the more I'm going to cause needless suffering. I dunno. What a waste.
