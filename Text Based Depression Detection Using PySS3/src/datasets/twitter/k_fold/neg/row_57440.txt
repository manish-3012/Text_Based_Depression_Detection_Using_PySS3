I Don't Know Why I Should Keep On LivingHello.

This is my first time posting here. I'll just get to the point, I guess.

I'm tired of living. My life is like a prison. I'm tormented. I feel like I was never supposed to be born.

I live in a family headed by emotionally abusive parents. I can't take it anymore. I can't cope with the bullying. It never stops. I have to fight so hard for basic things like respect and appreciation. People are full of (unhelpful) suggestions for how to deal with the situation, but when things get tough, no one is around to help. No one fights for me. There's no one to call or cry to in the middle of the night. I feel alone.

Why should I stay alive? I feel like there's nothing to live for. Things never get better. The longer I stay alive, is the longer I suffer.
