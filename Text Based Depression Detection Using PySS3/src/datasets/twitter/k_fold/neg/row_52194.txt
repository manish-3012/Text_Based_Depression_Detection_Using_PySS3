Request: opinions from people in their 20's  

I have two sons in their late 20â€™s. Iâ€™m their dad. Iâ€™m 60. I have good relationships with them both. I love them very much. They are both independent and on their own and no longer need me.

Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™ve lived a full life and I'm just done. The will to continue life is gone. Iâ€™m old. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m alone. I did what I was here in this life to do: raised my boys. Iâ€™ve done and seen all the things I care to do or see. Iâ€™m ready to go. 

Iâ€™ve been fortunate in that I have substantial assets. Rather than fritter those away doing things I donâ€™t care about over many years, Iâ€™d rather my boys have the money so they can realize some of their own dreams. That would make me extremely happy. 

I know most of you are on this thread because you want to kill yourselves. But if you donâ€™t mind, Iâ€™d like your opinion and thoughts please on what Iâ€™ve described above. Maybe you can assume for a minute that you have a Dad that you know is suffering and youâ€™ll be glad his suffering has ended. AND he left you a million dollars with the expressed wish that you use it to build your own life, a life that has meaning to you. 

What do you think?

Thanks in advance.
