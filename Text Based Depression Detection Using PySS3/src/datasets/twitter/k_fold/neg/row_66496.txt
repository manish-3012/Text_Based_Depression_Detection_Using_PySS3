How to Cope with Feeling WorthlessFeeling worthless because I feel like Iâ€™m pretty unattractive (no pun attended). Thereâ€™s a girl. Thereâ€™s always a girl and I feel like Iâ€™m not enough for her. â€œLife is a beauty pageantâ€ and Iâ€™m not sure how to function without having confidence in myself. Iâ€™m 25 now, but was diagnosed with clinical depression at 15. Itâ€™s gotten better over the years, but I always come back to not feeling like itâ€™s worth living if Iâ€™m just constantly disappointing people by not being what they would like me to be, feeling like my best isnâ€™t good enough for other people, feeling like Iâ€™m being dismissed and rejected or that my existence just doesnâ€™t matter to other people because my cheek bones are high enough for them or whatever other bullshit, superficial reasons people have for making others feel like shit in comparison. I donâ€™t want to exist in a place where my worth is measured by my physical beauty because I know Iâ€™ll just be worthless. Never free to just feel comfortable in my own skin.

How do you cope with this? Do you just accept it? Do you ignore it? Forget about it? Did you find someone you love who truly appreciates you regardless? Iâ€™m having trouble finding the motivation to keep going when I could just give up and not have to worry about spending thousand of dollars on plastic surgery or steroids just to impress people I donâ€™t even like.

Please share your experiences with this and any thoughts about it. God, or whatever, knows we canâ€™t have this kind of conversation anywhere else in society and get to be honest about it.
