Philosophy about bullshit adviceI would like to go over my interpretation of some of the advice that I get everyday. Advice that doesn't only fail to work, but drives me further towards the abyss.

"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."

In some circumstances it is a permanent problem. Atleast relevant to the temporary trait of a human life.

"You have so much to live for."

There are things to live for. I acknowledge that. However, the things are never enough. Knowing that makes it more depressing to try.

"Just try something new. Escape from &lt;problem\&gt;."

My problem is not external. It lives within. New things are similar to what I have tried. Every action helping some, but never enough.

"If you have wanted to die so long, why haven't you?"

One of the worst things to say, for it incites action. I haven't died because of my attempts failing.

"Just change you outlook and cheer up."

Another of the worst things to say. If it was that easy, there wouldn't be any suicides.

"There are other people in worse conditions."

Guilt trip? Really? Fuck off.

"Coping skills"

Why cope when you can end the suffering?

And any hospitalizations are worse for you. You expect me to get better when you take away my chance to do the few things I like?

Pretty much all of these can be dispelled with a little logic. And they end up causing worse results.
