Why don't parents care?Me again, Still alive I guess but my parents are becoming a major issue.  
We have 4 cupboards with food in, 3 are locked,   
I'm "not allowed" to eat things in the fridge,  
She asked me to make her a drink, I was busy in a heist in GTA which she saw so I said "Not right now, I'm a tad busy" If she had waited 5 minutes I would of been able to, Her response was, "Fine I'll do it myself"   
She then told her boyfriend who she thinks is my role model (he isn't he's a lazy fuck and does fuckall apart from go to work, come home and play music loudly) I am left to do things, such as, Cleaning the house, Washing up, I've started to abandon them due to my depression which they just scream at me more, Anyway They had a go at me because I "refused" to make her a drink, It was a question not a demand, I can say no. I just lost it and walked off, after her boyfriend said "If you do fuck all you don't get fed" my simple response was "fine by me, but not by any child services," She told me not to walk off, And that she couldn't handle me, so my response to that was, "You know what I can't handle you, None of our family can, Why the fuck do you think they left us after your antics back in france" (She complained so fucking much her dad told her to grow up)   


Idk who's the fault here, ME or HER.
