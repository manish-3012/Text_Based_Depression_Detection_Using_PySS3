My family makes me want to kill myselfThis is a really hard time of year for me because of all the holidays, which means that I have to spend more time with my family. I have a really long history of problems with my family. This includes my grandmother having an affair behind my grandfather's back, my family mistreating my 95 year old great grandfather, and just generally a lot of conflict that doesn't really get solved and creates a lot of tension. I also just feel like I can't relax around them and being around them so much doesn't come with the same loving and relaxing vibe as say being around my friends does.

As a result, I avoid my family as much as I can. I usually hang out with my friends or just stay home by myself. I'm in a really weird spot though because I currently live with my dad (I'm at community college), and he generally gives me a lot of freedom and respects that I'm an adult, but he always gives me crap about not wanting to be around the family. He always wants to know why I don't want to go (which is fair), but I know that if I tell him how suicidal and anxious my family makes me feel he'll brush it off as silly or just say "well it's your family so too bad." (I've tried to talk to my dad about my mental illness before and it never turns out in a supportive way). 

Thanksgiving is coming up, and my dad really wants me to go even though I already said no, and he said we'll talk about it later, but wtf am I supposed to tell him? I could be honest, but it just might make him really mad and make me feel even worse. 

I just feel really suicidal and frustrated right now. I always run away from my problems because I don't want to confront them. I know that makes me cowardly but I'm hurting a lot and don't have a ton of support to solve what I'm going through. I always have fantasies about running away and my own funeral and "getting back at my family" for how crappy they always make me feel. I hate this feeling of being trapped.
