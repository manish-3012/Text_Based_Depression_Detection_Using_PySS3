Someone please stop meJust wanted to say thanks reddit for these last final hours, made me smile a couple times. But Iâ€™ve made my decision and Iâ€™m scared. I thinks itâ€™s my time to give up thereâ€™s no point anymore. These drugs are so messed up and Iâ€™ll let them take me out, I wish someone can talk me out of this but i think itâ€™s a done deal.
