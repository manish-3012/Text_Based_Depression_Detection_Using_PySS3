Suicidal employee possibly facing terminationI am a partner in a small business (3 partners and an office manager).  Our manager last night got blackout drunk and "cut herself up on her arms and legs".  She is missing work today and tomorrow.

She has expressed that she suffers from depression.  And I would classify her as an alcoholic.

My two partners seem to be leaning towards firing her.  One isn't satisfied by her performance (in reality his girlfriend doesn't like her) and one just would rather not pay and do the management duties for himself for get an intern.  I have always been more than satisfied with her performance, and we have become decent friends.

My question is this:  If I get outvoted (which seems likely) and we end up firing her, how do we handle that?  And if we *don't* end up firing her, how do I handle that?
