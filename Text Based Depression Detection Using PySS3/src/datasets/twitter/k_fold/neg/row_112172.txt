My ex-girlfriend just said that she wanted to kill herselfMy ex and I were in a relationship from 2010 to 2015. I consider those years to be the best of my life, and she's maybe the best girlfriend I ever had. She always be the one with a big smile on her face everyday...

We broke up a couple months after her father died of a heart attack. Her smile never really came back.  
Since then we're not talking that much. She moved country 4000 miles away from me. Not even 5 texts a year.

She came back to live in our native country this year, and we met for lunch in june. I know she has problems, the death of her father is one, depression, but she also struggle to find a job overseas, a place to live, etc. But she seems okay.

In our country we are quarantined since October. So I tried texting her to know how things were doing. I had zero texts back in almost 3 weeks, she's ghosting me.

Yesterday I was pissed off and I text her more to confront her about the ghosting. She finally answers, she was also really pissed off that I insist so much to talk to her.

But one part of the text just made me cry all evening and night :  
"Since august, I want to die. I will never do it by respect for my family but this is real".

Those words just fucked me up. This makes me so sad that somebody like her can feel like that. She knows the consequences of death... I mean I was there with her family when her father died. I was even there when her little sister tried to kill herself in 2015.  
I just don't know what to do, or say. I can't fonction properly since I read those words.  
I want to call her this weekend, but I don't even know what to say.
