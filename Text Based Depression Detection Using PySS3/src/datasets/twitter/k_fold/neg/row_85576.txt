I want to go to sleep and never wake up.I am just tired, I have caused all my problems in life, and the worst part is I'm just too lazy to do anything about them. I lie in bed literally all day doing fuck all with my life. School is coming up, I am probably going to go in for a week and never go in for the rest of the year. My parents are emotionally maniptulive people who make zero attempts to help me. 

I just feel like ending it all will be like going to sleep.
