Feel like I'm in a prison inside my own headAll I think about is either suicide or my bleak and miserable future if I keep living. Like wtf am I doing with my life? Why prolong the inevitable? Suicide to me is the one beacon of light I have left and death is the only cure. I truly believe in this shit and yet I can't believe I have reached the point of no return. If I keep living what good would that do for me? I'm running on fumes and I'm finding it harder each day to find a reason to stay when there are none. I've looked and I'm still looking but I literally don't enjoy life. Then what's the point if you don't enjoy it then? Keep living a miserable existence just for the sake of it? Fuck that, all I think about is death and how it would end this shit storm once and for all. No more problems, no more people, no more surviving, no more worries, no more complaining, and especially NO MORE YOU. Ah what I wouldn't give death will be like the ultimate nap time it will erase this life of pain and shit and I'm glad I won't remember anything of it. Nothing more. I feel like I'm in a prison inside my own head and I want out goddamnit, please just please let me die, that is all I want now and that only compounds me to be more pathetic wallowing in self pity. My only retirement plan is either a rope or lead or probably both. I'm begging for it to just end it already just fucking end it goddamnit is all I think about. I'm not meant to be here, I don't belong, I feel like an alien inside my own body and I just want to crawl out of it so badly. Is my life experiences truly the epitome of human existence? Is this really all there is to life? More pointless suffering with very brief moments of clarity? Holy fuck I'm screwed.
