witnessed an accidenttoday I witnessed a car accident right in front of me (the person was ok, no injuries) but after leave the scene, I couldnâ€™t stop wishing I couldâ€™ve been in that accident and died. I might be quiet about it but I really want to die. 
Itâ€™s not really much to talk about but I had to let it out.
