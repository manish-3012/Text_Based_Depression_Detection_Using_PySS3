My whole life has been ruined by one thingWhen i was younger i had a really really botched circumcision, I am 16 now and i live in the UK where it is very uncommon, Iâ€™m scared of my own dick and i am so ashamed, I donâ€™t want anyone to see it. What makes it really upsetting for me, is because i try hard making myself the best version of myself, going to the gym 4-5 times a week, frequently getting a haircut, taking care of myself, but whats the point? Iâ€™ve got a dick that no girl would go near, i just want to be happy but I canâ€™t when my dick is how it is. I give up on trying hard physically and educationally when my life has been ruined just from one thing that I didnâ€™t even consent to. People may say how its not a big deal but i dont think people understand how much damage this has done to me mentally, i just want to be normal, have a non botched dick how nature intended, Iâ€™ll never have a good sex life, or be confident in a relationship, i might as well give up.
