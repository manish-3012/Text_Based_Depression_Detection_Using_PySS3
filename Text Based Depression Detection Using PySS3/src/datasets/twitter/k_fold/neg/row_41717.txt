I need some advice. (Warning, a little long)Hello r/SuicideWatch, I need some help. Now it's not for me I am not contemplating suicide. But a friend of mine is, now this is gonna sound odd. But she says she will kill herself if she can't make her boyfriend happy. She is 17 going on 18 in November if that helps. She also says she would kill herself if he broke up with her. He is unaware of this though I'd love to tell him but I have no way of contacting him since he has no facebook and I don't have his cell phone number. Last year she said she was contemplating suicide because she was torn between her boyfriend at the time and an ex. She always talks about to me about how unhappy she is being with him so I suggested leaving him but she said that she loved him too much to do so. They have been dating since January I think. So please guys I need some advice on what I should say to her to stop having these suicidal thoughts I am trying my best to be a supportive friend but honestly she even leaves me befuddled sometimes any advice would be helpful.
