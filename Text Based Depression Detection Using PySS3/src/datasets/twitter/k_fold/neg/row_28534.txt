this is the third time my medication has stopped working.i honestly can't do this anymore. i have been on 16+ different antidepressants. there isn't much to try anymore. thanks to a genetic mutation i am immune to most of them anyway. and now the stuff that worked for the past year has stopped working as well.

i can't go through another round of this hope to despair cycle.

i am so exhausted. i am so unhappy.
i can't stop crying.
