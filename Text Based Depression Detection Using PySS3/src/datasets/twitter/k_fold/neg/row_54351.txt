Stuck between suicide and hopeI'm pretty tired of always going through these ups and downs. Some days I feel like I may actually be happy one day. Then I get low like today and wonder if it's worth it? Is it really worth living going through these super depressed, angry, anxious phases just to get out of it temporarily?  I procrastinate like crazy because I just don't care enough anymore. Plus I struggle to make friends, never had a gf and I'm 26. Tbh I don't even know if I want to have a gf anymore. I don't even know what I want in life anymore. I've wasted so much time with my porn addiction. I'm studying something that doesn't interest me much. 

Now I'm not here for sympathy, I know lots of my pain was caused by me. You can argue that I had a shitty childhood, but I'm an adult now and could've made better decisions. I am where I am because of my decisions. So only I can change my situation. But yeah, I'm planning on ending it all 31 December if I don't see any improvements. My plan is to journal, meditate, take cold showers, exercise, eat good, no porn and minimizing internet time. This gives me 42 days of a pure lifestyle. If life still sucks after the 42 days I'm done. Peace
