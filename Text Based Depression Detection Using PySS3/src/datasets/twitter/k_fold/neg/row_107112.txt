Soon to be homeless, family are all rabid Trump supporters, I will die before crawling back to them for helpI have no idea how much longer I have, but it's soon. My roommate got a new girlfriend, and apparently he's planning on abandoning me while our Rent is severely behind. This past year I've had to pay *all* of the bills, all he had to worry about was food, his half of the rent, and payments on the car we both share. He got behind on the car payments, and pur Rent is fucked up because one month, he decided to spend *my half* of the rent on whatever, while nothing went towards the rent. We've been in a hole ever since, and now I'm about to be responsible for all of it, and might not even have a car to get to work.  
  
My whole family went insane, even advocating for wholesale slaughter of all BLM protestors because "they are the evil in this world, and we are the pure, good, decent people". They are stuck so far up Trumps ass, it's impossible for them to actually hear him speak, or see his actions. Their minds are made up and nothing will change that, the racism just runs too deep. Regardless of who wins, America will implode after the election. If my only option is to move back with one of them, Suicide will truly become the best option.  
  
Oh, and on top of all that, I probably have Diabetes. Even if I get tested, what the fuck is that going to Help? I have no way to pay for the medicine, so the result will be the same: slow painful Diabetes death, or Suicide.   
  
Oh well. It's been a long time coming, and there's no reason someone like me should have existed in the first place. I was a massive mistake. In a sane and just world, my 14 year old mother would have gotten an Abortion after her affair with a married 30ish year old man. I will finally correct that mistake some time in the next few months. I already have my chosen method ready to go, just waiting for the right time I guess
