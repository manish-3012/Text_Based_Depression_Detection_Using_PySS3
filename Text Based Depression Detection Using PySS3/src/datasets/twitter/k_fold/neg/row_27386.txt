Nothing leftThereâ€™s nothing left for me here. My family and friends just tolerate me â€” they donâ€™t enjoy my company. I hate existing and having to have a job and try everyday. I just want to sleep and eat and drink and walk around the town all day for the rest of my life. I donâ€™t want to go to school or build a career. People are too mean and angry and I donâ€™t like them. I donâ€™t like anything about life and I get so agitated so quickly that I shut down and refuse to do anything. I self-sabotage myself all the time by throwing out important things that I need or lashing out on people that care about me or for no reason. Iâ€™ve lost almost all of my good friends this way. I canâ€™t talk to my family and I canâ€™t speak to my friends that I have because they are dealing with the same stuff and it triggers them. Iâ€™m alone. I donâ€™t want anything and I donâ€™t want to try. I hate this.
