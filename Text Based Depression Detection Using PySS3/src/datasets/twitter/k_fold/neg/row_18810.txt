im fucking done.Can people stop telling me everything's gonna be okay? I fucking hate being alive. Everything is going to shit. I fucked up school. My family is so dysfunctional and I hate it. I have NO ONE to talk to about any of this. And talking to strangers online doesn't help. All I can do to get out of this is to kill myself. And don't even try to tell my not to. It's the only way for me to ever be happy again. I'm getting more and more impulsive thoughts to do it and it's hard not to listen to it. I won't ever have to be sad again.
