I hate who I amIâ€™m sorry, I donâ€™t want to waste anyoneâ€™s time, but I donâ€™t know where else to turn. 

Iâ€™ve never been any good at anything. Genuinely. Iâ€™ve tried and tried at so many things but have just never succeeded. Iâ€™ve always been bullied, all through my school days. Iâ€™m 32 now, and whilst not bullied anymore, all I think is that Iâ€™m a failure and let everyone down around me.

My partner is amazing. Sheâ€™s driven, beautiful, talks about our future etc, but she never seems to appreciate the here and now. Iâ€™ve never felt so taken for granted, and I literally put everything into our relationship, but sheâ€™s completely oblivious to anything and just completely blasÃ© about everything. 

Iâ€™m generally a happy, positive person, and no one knows I feel this way. I donâ€™t know who I can talk to, and Iâ€™m coming closer and closer to ending it, purely to make everyoneâ€™s life around me better.
