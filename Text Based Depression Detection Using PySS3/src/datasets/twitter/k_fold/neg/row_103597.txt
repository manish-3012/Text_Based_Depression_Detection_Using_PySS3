Life just isn't enjoyable anymore.To give an introduction, I'm 14 currently a freshman but lately I just feel odd, it started with me just not enjoying my music anymore and decided to branch out to new types which didn't work out, I still loved my music I just oddly enough didn't enjoy to hear it. Then it went to my video games, I usually play a good amount and find out really fun but lately I've just played the games I never get bored of and I'm not bored of them it's just I don't enjoy it as much or at all anymore, I know it isn't because it's repetitive beacause I tried branching out and taking a break which didn't work either. 


Then it moved on to my social life, in school I used to enjoy talking to friends now I've become with more self doubt and keep thinking they aren't listening to me when I'm talking, then it developed where I just don't enjoy talking to my friends as much, it feels like the my social battery drains extremely quickly about 30 minutes and then I just don't enjoy it. 

To clarify, I'm not suicidal or have been diagnosed with depression or anxiety so I don't feel as if those are the cause.
