Low pointI'm at a real low point in my life. I've never felt this bad for this long. I had a major depressive episode last year which completely derailed my life. I lost my job and had to move home, which I hate,  from a city that I loved. I can't get over this loss. I got my heart broken pretty badly and I'm still a wreck over it. I have gained a bunch of weight and isolated myself from my friends to the point where I'm not sure if I even have friends anymore. Ive tried therapy, medications. Nothing seems to stick. I can't break through this wall of regret and pain. It's a literal wall I can't get over. I've had walls in the past and I've always been able to climb them, but this one is too big. I feel like life from this point on is just destined to be a duller shade. I've lost something in myself that I can't seem to get back. I'm not actively suicidal, but I've been creeping on this sub for months. I've finally had a bad enough day that I decided to make a post of my own. I was so so happy one year ago, and then I was robbed of my perfect life because of depression. I am reminded constantly of the good times and it makes pangs in my chest. I'm just having a hard time seeing a way things will get back to daylight again.
