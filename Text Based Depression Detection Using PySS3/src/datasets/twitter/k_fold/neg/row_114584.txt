I don't know how to cope.My car has broken down on my way to my psychiatrist. I needed this appointment, I needed it with all that I am. I rang up shaking just before, and explained what happened. The receptionist is very nice. I asked if there was anyway I could reschedule to be seen later today somehow, or before my next appointment next week, and she said there is no unfortunately no availability. I don't know how I'm going to genuinely survive till then :'(
