Iâ€™m such a piece of shit I donâ€™t even deserve to be alive anymoreIâ€™m 18 and Iâ€™ve never accomplished anything. I have a license but I canâ€™t drive for shit, Iâ€™ve had one job Iâ€™ve only held for a week. Iâ€™m not good at anything. Iâ€™m a drug addict. And I have no motivation to do anything. Iâ€™m truly just a waste of air. The only reason Iâ€™m still here is bc my mom would be sad if I wasnâ€™t. Iâ€™m so tired of living just to spare other people from dealing with a death. I canâ€™t take this anymore. Everyone thinks Iâ€™m happy and fine but I want to die so fucking bad. This is just never ending. I donâ€™t even know what to do with myself anymore Iâ€™m losing my mind
