I feel so guilty when people I love sufferEven when itâ€™s nothing to do with me. I feel so guilty because I feel sad with them. Like some selfish piece of shit that has to make everything about themself.

Especially when it does have to do with me. Not even anything Iâ€™ve done wrong. Theyâ€™re probably better off without me they would stop suffering if I left.
