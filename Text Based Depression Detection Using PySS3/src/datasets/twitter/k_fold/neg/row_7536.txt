I no longer want to kill myself and I hate it.There are a lot of posts like this, but I just wanted to get this out of my system. Sorry about formatting on mobile, english is bad because Iâ€™m stupid, etc etc

So recently I was spurred on by looking at posts on this sub and decided to finally reach out to a close friend and tell them about how Iâ€™m thinking of killing myself. We talked for a while and it was nice to finally tell someone about it.

Well at least it would be if I werenâ€™t constantly feeling like a fake. The only rock solid parts of my personality which arenâ€™t manufactured to a certain degree are video games and manga. And I hate myself for one of those. And before this month the third defining trait of me was my suicidal thoughts and urges.

But now that is gone so what if my friend thinks I was just lying for attention? I canâ€™t blame them, maybe I was just making up stuff in my head for attention. I never even attempted suicide so was I really even suicidal?  

It just feels so unnatural to be unhappy with the thought of me dead, before Iâ€™ve ranged from lusting for death(or at least no longer being alive) to apathetic about my life/death. Itâ€™s about 7+ years since I felt that my life was good, which is a lot considering my fairly young age.

All I can really conclude this with is that I now know even less about what I am. And as much as I hate myself I canâ€™t bring myself to fucking try and kill myself. And this is probably the wrong sub but I donâ€™t know any of the other subs for this stuff, I donâ€™t really mind if I get blocked.
