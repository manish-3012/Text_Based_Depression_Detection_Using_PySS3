My heart is breaking over and over again.It's the symbolism, the meaning of the cutting. A physical manifestation of rejection. Action, a statement which nothing else can more profoundly state. When I'm in nature. Its... I know, irrational... its like I can hear her calling for her daughter. Why do *I* hear it?! I must answer the great mother. I must reach peaceland. Even if it kills me, I want these fucking things gone so I can be closer to who I am in spirit. The blood is me making my devotion real.

I should have been different, very different. There is no cosmic justice. I'm desperate to. Cutting my genitals is the only expression of my non-maleness I have. I need to not be male. I'd do anything to not be AMAB. Gender validation would only carry me so far. There is only some healing, no complete recovery. Sell my soul to Satan? you got it. Convert to christainity or whatever religion? you got it. Participate in a genocide? you got it. Kill my parents?... maybe. 

I've got at most 20 months to live. The healthcare system doesn't give a fuck about human life. It's just yet another profit driven machine for its share holders. Just like the government its a business. They don't care how much pain they cause. They don't care if I or anyone else is dying. The only reason they act, is to further their business interests. It just happens to be the case that forever indebted little workers lives are occasionally worth saving. Humanity is just a ROI computation to them.
