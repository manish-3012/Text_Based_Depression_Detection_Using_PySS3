I want to quit.I just lost the woman who I thought/wanted to be with forever. Im doing horrible in school, the only friends I have are alcoholics. I hate being sober, im not addicted to anything in articular just the feeling of not being sober. She left me because i would talk to girls online when i was bored and intoxicated. Im an idiot, I know. She retaliated be sleeping with my friend on my couch while I slept. Ive always been depressed, it was a strain on her, but she held me together she kept me from doing the bad things i wanted to do. She took my cats too. I just want someone to talk to.
