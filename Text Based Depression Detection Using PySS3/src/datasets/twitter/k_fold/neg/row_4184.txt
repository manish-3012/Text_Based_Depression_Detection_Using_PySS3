Good newsSo I was working tonight, didn't get invited to any Halloween parties, I dont have any friends. All my family did stuff but I had nothing. I was going to go home and possibly self harm, since I dont work tomorrow I could hide it. However a co-worker invited me over, we just watched TV but that was the first time in my life I felt like a person...

I wish this could happen more... It felt great
