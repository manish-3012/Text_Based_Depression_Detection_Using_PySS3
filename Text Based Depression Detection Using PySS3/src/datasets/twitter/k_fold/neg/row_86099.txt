You are the reasonMy life sucks and will probably suck in the future, but from now on I will spend every second trying to be better. I probably sound arrogant and stupid, but that's because I am, and you certainly hate me. I don't know anything about you, except that you are beautiful every time. Life is meaningless anyways, even more if I'm an idiot.
