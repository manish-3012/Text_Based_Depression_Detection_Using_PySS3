I am an utter failure of a human beingI'm a goddamn looser. A piece of worthless trash. I have no skills and no will to learn anything worth learning. I don't give a shit about trying anymore. I look at all the success stories people have where they had to fail for years until they were successful, and I become suicidally depressed. I'm already a loser with no solid identity, interests, or sufficient knowledge of the world around me. I completely and utterly wasted the past 21 years of my life and I do not intend to make up for the lost time. I am no man. I am a worthless, pot-smoking failure with no goals and no motivation or dedication to make goals and follow through with them. On top of all the shit that makes me shitty, I have had crippling depression and anxiety for years and probably fucked up my brain when I had a really, really bad trip on mushrooms. I'm paranoid, lazy, and socially awkward. Doing productive things bring me no pleasure and I am totally lost as to what I'm going to do in order to survive this world as an adult. I have no fulfilling social ties. I've failed at school and at this point am too stupid to do schoolwork literally at all. I take everything people say to me personally. I have no talents or natural abilities. I have no direction and I'm too weak to find it. I'm also too weak to seek help because my ego cannot handle accepting that I am this shitty of a person, so absooutely pathetic that I've become who I am today. There is no helping me. I have zero thoughts for ny future and I have no interest in it or building a life for myself that could be respectable. I am not able to adapt. If I somehow couldn't come home to my parents or they died and I REALLY had to fend for myself, I'd kill myself right then and there because I am not ready or able to build myself up in a way that I'd survive. I have barely any sense of humor. I'm uncultured as fuck and stupid in general. I have nothing. I'm going to end it all with a shotgun blast to the head. I care about my family and I know it would effect them but let's fucking face it thet woukd be able to keep on keeping on in life perfectly fine. Nobody is actually depending on me. They's just be sad and I'd earn my eternity in hell for all my sloth and petulenc, and self-doubt that ultimately prevents me from doing anything with my life. I have no real friends to speak of and anyone who consuders me a frienf would get over if quicker than my family for sure. I can't fucking talk to people. I'm done learning. I'm done trying. I'm so fucking done with thus goddamn life and I sure as fuck am not planting my tree for it to grow. That shit should have been planted 21 years ago. Maybe then I wouldn't be a huge, selfish, immature piece of shit.
