I attempted suicide this week and am now terrified of myselfFor the past year or so, I have been struggling with depression and cutting myself whenever I feel overwhelmed but this Wednesday I went over the edge. Since I'm a senior in college and trying desperately hard to make sure I graduate, I have felt more stress than usual. Like instead of cutting every now and then I do it at least once week and I even took to pulling my hair out because I couldn't find anything sufficient to hurt myself with. Well, Wednesday something happened that set me behind two weeks and I lost it. I immediately felt so overwhelmed that I needed to check out and so I tried to asphyxiate myself. If I hadn't been able to untie the rope I would have died. And now for the past two days I've just been thinking "What if?" and feeling so terribly guilty and terrified at myself and what I would have made my family, specifically my mother, go through. 

I'm going to counseling Tuesday (that was the soonest I can get an appointment), but before then what can I do to help ease the terror and guilt?
