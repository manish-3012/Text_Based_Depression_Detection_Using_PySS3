God Iâ€™m tiredI want to die so bad but I know it will hurt horribly and I might fail, I wish I could just leave, I hope there is an afterlife with everything I want and itâ€™s perfect. People are so damn mean here. I just donâ€™t like it I live in constant stress. Does anyone know the easiest way to go?
