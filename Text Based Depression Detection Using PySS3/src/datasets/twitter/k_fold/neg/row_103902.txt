Everyone leaves and I'm thinking about hanging myself.So in the last few months everything has gone to hell still in high school losing motivation to do anything. I've always preferred being online with gamers like me but nowadays I'm sad and lonely in both reality and the Internet.

I have made very good friends with good people but each person leaves I have no clue why maybe because my sadness brings them down but I don't mean for it to happen. I met this really good guy a few days ago and he interested me and we got along then today he just had a go at me although he said he'd never judge me or do that at all. 

A lot of people have been leaving me and I feel empty and alone, I want to end it all. I have no motivation to live or nothing to live for. If I can cope I plan to kill myself on my birthday which is in October.
