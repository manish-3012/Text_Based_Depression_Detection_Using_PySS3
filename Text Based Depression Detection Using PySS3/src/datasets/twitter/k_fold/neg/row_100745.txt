Sometimes I wished my little sister didn't exist so that I could just do itEverything I do ends up in a failure. Every time I want to try something new or fun, it gets obliterated by my relatives. Every single decision I plan to make ends up worse than I could possibly imagine. I hate how the tides always end up against me; It's impossible to live here. I don't have any friends or people to talk to; I'm always overshadowed by my parents or my two brothers. I have nothing special in me. There has been many occasions were I just wanted to end it all but I keep imagining a future were my little sister is sad all the time, blaming herself thanks to my selfishness. She's the only one who really just cares about my well-being and stuff, she gives me company. She's just great, I honestly don't think I deserve her as a sibling. 
There was one time when she just saw me writing a small story in my laptop and the next day she wrote a 20 page book (with drawings) about my supposed backstory and later gave it to me with a hug.
Man, sometimes I wish she didn't exist, she's making it too hard for me. 
On the side note, I don't know how to communicate or express myself; I heard the last words of two individuals and it didn't very well. I hate that I'm always the one to blame, to make fun of, the end of the joke. I just wished more people I know were like my sister; full of life to share with others. I am trying nonetheless, but I keep failing. I want to be better for her, but I'm just.....tired...of failing. At everything.  I'm sorry.
