Took the thingsLast night I got a 100 count bottle of equate max strength and had around 20. Everyone says its excrutiating, but to be completely honest it was the most at peace I've been, at least initially. I expected it to be so much worse. There wasn't alot of pain. There was vomit but not alot, and I was very very stumbly to the point where I knocked over my chair, ran into things, had problems trying to reach out in front of me. My hands felt heavier than concrete. I had blood spilling out and staining my face. I have yet to go to the hospital but I will
