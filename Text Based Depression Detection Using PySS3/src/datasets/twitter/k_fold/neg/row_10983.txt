I am weakBut, besides that wanna know what annoys me. All these community serving karma posts that are so greatful for this site saying how much better they are and how they beat suicide and what not. People don't go to the cancer ward after there last round of chemo to show off there hair. Good for you denying what you know to be true. Not everyone is as guillable.
