If I test positive I'm going to kill myselfI'm going to get tested for HIV tomorrow. I have engaged in risky behaviour before and I know I'm high risk as a gay male, but I've never had any of the symptoms and have never even thought about HIV testing for more than a few days at a time.

It just sucks that one week before the most major exam of my life my brain suddenly goes into panic mode about whether I have HIV. I havent been able to concentrate on revision for the past few days and I know testing negative is the only thing that can get me back into the zone, but I'm scared at the same time that I'll test positive and won't be able to pull through my exams.

If I do test positive everything will be over. I've always dreamt of studying overseas in university, but the country I want to study in has mandatory physical examinations that have HIV as a criteria to pass. If I get HIV I cant get any scholarships, I can't work in government and foreign service as I've always wanted to, and overall the life I've always wanted for myself will come crashing down before me.

I'm scared. I'm scared of testing positive, and I'm scared of death. But I realise that if I am actually positive death is actually the better option for me.
