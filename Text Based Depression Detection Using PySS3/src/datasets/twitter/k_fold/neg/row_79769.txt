The next morningSo uh yea woke up from an unsuccesful OD and still feel like dying. It's weird how people say that the next day should make you reconcider but all I want to do is die. My body aches more than ever before and my stomach is hurting like a mofo. I wanted to just apologize and thank you guys for the chatting we did and things. I should start writing letters now, last night I didn't and I feel like people deserve explanations. I'm sorry.
