I just want to be happy. Everyone always says to me that they want me to be happy, but what they're really saying is, "I want you to make **me** happy." Because as soon as I get the idea in my head to be happy, they attack. I just want to be happy. When was the last time I was happy? I could tell you a million times when I was happy, but all those times were fake because in my head I knew, I knew that it was fake. I couldn't even begin to explain how and why I'm so unhappy. It's always been there with me. Always in my chest pushing against my rib cage, hurting, not letting me forget my true feelings. It hurts from the time I wake up to the time I finally fall asleep at night. It's there when I'm smiling or screaming in pain for it to stop. It's my lover and protector. I don't think I could live without it. It's the only thing I feel, and if I let it go what would be left? I'd be an empty shell, a zombie if you may. I can't let it go. It keeps me alive. It keeps me fighting. It makes me who I am. I've tried everything to get rid of it. They say, "no. you didn't try hard enough." But just because you didn't succeed at your goal and you fail doesn't mean you didn't do all that you could. Sometimes you just can't win, so you have to accept the fact that you have a ticking time bomb inside of you. I know it's going to blow sometime and I'm going to go with it. I can feel it. I know. My daily life is just imaginary. The words I say and the things I do never happened. The only thing that's real is my terrible friend. It's not such a bad friend actually.. it's been with me through everything. Through the good and the bad, through thick and thin..
Together 'till the end.
'Till death do us part.
