Why does it hurt why does the game get so difficultSo If this is a simulation .. wheres the reset ? ..
The game said make em blind ,albino , black and lgbtq ... and lets give em a brother too with a disability that you gotta take care of ? Nah too easy ... letâ€™s add on a toxic family where both parties are in the wrong but both are boomers so they wonâ€™t admit when they wrong .. so it just leads to a toxic family relationship...  and sprink some favoritism with step children...  misogyny , and homophobia also a Dash racism  also having  regression as a taboo topic be the way youâ€™ve felt like you learned how to cope ?
