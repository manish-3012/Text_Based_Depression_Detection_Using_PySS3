Iâ€™m doneHonestly idk how much longer I can do this. Iâ€™ve got whatever undiagnosed mental illness thatâ€™s clearly causing me to self medicate w drugs on top of depression and anxiety. It just sucks living my whole 20 years of life like this. On top of that I was sexually abused as a kid. Then I was in a mentally and physically abuse and toxic relationship from ages 15-19 thatâ€™s really sucked. 

Iâ€™m a people pleaser. I basically bleed myself dry for everyone. I give and I give and I love too hard. And no one really does that for me. I can genuinely say if I died people would get over it quick and itâ€™s my own fault for isolating.  If it helps I suspect I have adhd and or bpd. But idk for sure. All I know is my dopamine is out of whack. 

I just wanna get high and stop feeling I canâ€™t find any drugs and itâ€™s partially a good thing bc I know if I do Iâ€™m going to go on a bender and end the bender with milling myself. But one day I will find some and get my wish. 

And I know Iâ€™m young and I have my whole life ahead of me. And I know Iâ€™m not perfect. But I deserve to be happy. I deserve to be loved. Why have all my relationships been toxic and abusive? Why does my brain work the way it does? 
Why did I deserve any of that? :( &lt;/3

I genuinely just want to die. I donâ€™t wanna do it anymore thereâ€™s no reason. How can I even bring a kid into this world itâ€™s so rough man. Iâ€™m too sensitive for this world I just wanna hide away and never come out. 

I honestly donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going with this I just needed to vent and now Iâ€™m crying. Iâ€™m sorry if any of yâ€™all look down on drugs. I donâ€™t wanna so drugs. I wanted to be a happy successful surgeon. But I ducked up. And Iâ€™m so sad. And now the only way I can feel something other than sad is with chemicals /: feel like thatâ€™s no way to live. Iâ€™m tired of it. And  Iâ€™m done/: Iâ€™ll b gone soon. As soon as I can get what I need I guess. 

I donâ€™t even know how to say good bye to my family. I donâ€™t even know if I should leave a note. I donâ€™t want them to think I died from drugs bc it would look like an accidental overdose if I donâ€™t leave  a note. But idk whatâ€™s worse, overdose or suicide. Idk I gotta stop typing Iâ€™m not making any sense Iâ€™m exhausted. 

Um if you read this Iâ€™m sorry it was all over the place. If you have any advice that would be really great. I donâ€™t really know like advice on what but if you have anything helpful and not mean to say that would be nice bc I canâ€™t handle mean rn :( thanks friends
