i just need someone to talk to.been struggling with severe depression and anxiety for the past several years. living in an abusive family situation was the root cause of it all, but even though i fled home and started what i hoped would be a new life for myself in another state the pain has only lessened, not gone entirely away. sometimes (like right now) i still get so low i have difficulty functioning and it makes it hard to believe that anything i've done has been worth the effort.

my closest friends also have a lot on their plate and are (justifiably) not very emotionally available when things get really bad like this, but then i feel like i have no one to reach out to. been crying uselessly in bed for the past hour instead of getting ready for work tomorrow because i don't have the energy to do much else. i'd just really like some company and reassurance i guess.
