I know money isn't a reason to end it. But i feel that what money represents is reason enoughSo i lost all my money, life savings, retirement, everything, gambling in the stock market. Yeah it's completely my fault and it was stupid and that's a discussion for another time.

What i really want to discuss is that i don't want to start over and rebuild my finances. It was horrendously arduous and painful couple of decades of hard work and sacrifice to make that amount. There were years of suffering, pain and loneliness having to make choices and putting money and security ahead of irresponsible frivolity. 

(ironic that i would lose it all due an epically irresponsible decision, POS).

The thought of having to rebuild and do it all AGAIN is too much. I don't have that youthful drive and optimism anymore. It's not the money really that bothers me, it's what it represented. All those years put into it. All that pain and suffering.... and ultimately, it was for nothing. 

Why would anyone want to go through that **again**?

Even if this time around I am responsible enough to keep it all, i still don't want to do it again. The very thought of having to spend another couple of decades being the world's bitch makes me sick, even more sick than what i felt when i actually lost my money.

I'm tired.
