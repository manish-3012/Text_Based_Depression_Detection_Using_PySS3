I have no friends, no life, please help meI haven't left my room since I graduated high school, it's been months. I'm scared to go outside. I barely talked to anyone during my last year of school, I knew this was coming. I have no job, no goals, no aspirations, not going to college. I'm no one. This is embarrassing, I can't even get a job I'm so paranoid, I have nothing. I used to live on the streets but I kept getting assaulted, I really want to go back, but I fear getting attacked again or worse. My dad let me come live with him and his girlfriend and I feel fucking pathetic. I'm a failure, how did it get so bad? I need to kill myself, my parents are wasting their time and money on me. People scare me, I can't connect with anyone, this isn't a life anyone wants to live. Please help me, this life can't go on. I'm so scared to go out and do anything. Why aren't my parents doing anything? I don't know, they just ignore me, I think they know there's nothing they can do. I know I'm an embarrassment to them, they didn't invite me to their wedding. I just want to kill myself, out in the woods where no one will find my body. I'm such an embarrassment. Why am I such a failure. I'm so pathetic. Everyone I went to school with is going to find out I committed suicide somehow and no one will be surprised. I don't remember a day in my life ever wanting to be alive, but at least on the streets I felt somewhat normal. What the fuck do I do? I'm a faulty person, I really need to get rid of myself.
