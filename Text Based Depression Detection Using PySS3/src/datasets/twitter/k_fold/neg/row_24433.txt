AlcoholYesterday i chugged a whole 75 cl  vodka bottle. 
I got very drunk and started crying alot. I then started cutting my arm. I fell and hit my head on the floor. Then puking all over my carpet. I dont know what to do. Should i see a therapist. Should i end it all? Im so confused. This is the second time this happend. My mom said i shouldve died the first time.  I have nothing to live for. The pain never ends.  I wont cry. Pain will always be an aspect of my life. What to do oh what to do
