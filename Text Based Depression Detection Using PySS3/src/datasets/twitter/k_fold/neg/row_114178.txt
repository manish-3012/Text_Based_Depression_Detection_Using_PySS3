I wrote a note just in case I decide to actually go through with itFriends and Family

I want you to know that none of this was your fault. Iâ€™ve always been scared to do it because I donâ€™t want to hurt you. I really hope that this doesnâ€™t traumatize you. You have to understand that everything is the fault of my brainâ€™s inability to release the right hormones to make me happy. 

To my mom, youâ€™re the best thing in this entire world and I never told you that, because Iâ€™m an idiot. But I have always appreciated you and loved you more than anything on earth. Please please do not give up on things, I donâ€™t want that. 

To my friends, Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t keep going. You all were incredibly supportive and loving, I truly could not have asked for better friends. [friends names], I appreciate and love you all. [ex bf name], this wasnâ€™t your fault, I have had depression and anxiety for years now, I donâ€™t want you to put this on yourself. Youâ€™re awesome and deserve everything good. 

All the money I have saved, not much I know, goes to my momâ€™s retirement fund. My belongings can be sold or anyone can have them, but remember what Marie Kondo says: â€œonly keep it if it sparks joy!â€ 

My life hasnâ€™t sparked joy for myself in a long time. So Iâ€™m not gonna keep it.
