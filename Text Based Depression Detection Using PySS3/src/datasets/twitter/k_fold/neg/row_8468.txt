I can't talk to anyone. They will try to stop me.I don't know when; but I'm going to kill myself. I can't live with myself anymore. I tried getting help a few months ago but things are worse than ever. Medication hasn't helped in the slightest, and therapy just leaves me more confused than I was before. I feel so disconnected from everything. I am constantly focusing on my pain and I feel that I won't be able to hold it in any longer. I know my friends and family would do whatever they could to help, but I don't want help anymore. I just want it to end.
