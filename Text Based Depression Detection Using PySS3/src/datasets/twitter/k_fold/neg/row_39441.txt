Need help26, single father. I desperately feel I'm in need of mental health intervention. Not feeling suicidal, but definitely feel an increased urge for incredibly risky behaviour/potential self-harm. 

Medical history, been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety for about ten years. On and off different meds, consistently on for about two years now. 

I mean to seek help. The catch is I don't have really anybody to watch my son while I seek it. I don't want to take him to the hospital with me in fear they'll take him because I'm not stable. I don't know what to do. Any advice would help.

Reposting here because while I don't feel suicidal now, I have history of attempting it. I don't want my son to find me like that.
