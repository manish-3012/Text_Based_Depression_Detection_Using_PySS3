Why can't I just fucking do it?I've wanted to for 11months and I've tried once before, but my fucking fear of death kicked in on the 2nd pill. I just want to end everything so fucking bad. I've got a knife next to me and I want to slit my wrists but I just fucking cant. I am so fucking pathetic arent I?

Im tired of life and I just wish I never existed.

I'll just be another teen suicide anyway no one cares.
