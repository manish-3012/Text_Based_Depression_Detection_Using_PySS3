My parents have high expectations for me and my future but I just wanna end my life.I have so much pressure on,my parents want me to get into a good uni and move town find a good job and make good money,They donâ€™t understand that I canâ€™t even get out of bed,I cant stop sleeping for 13 hours,I canâ€™t learn to get into a good uni because my memory is so bad and I am not mentally stable at all,Iâ€™m only 16 but it hurts so bad, I dont feel like myself anymore and the only thing I think about for every each second that passes is suicide.This is a cry for help but no one seems to listen and believe me,they think Iâ€™m just lazy,I wish theyâ€™d just understand,that being still alive is the only thing I have in control right now,till i get out of control and stop breathing..
