Just turned 21, and seriously considering ending it. I've been depressed for a while now, just a lot of minor things that I guess I've been holding in for year, just added up to one big mess in my head and I can stop thinking about killing myself. I've been a somewhat functioning alcoholic for a while now, and that's usually what I used to stop my thoughts, but now it just Inhances my depression and sends me in to rages where I don't remember self harming. I'm in the military where it's kind of hard to find a good outlet to talk to someone, because as soon as you bring up being depressed they send you to the psych and higher ups think you're just trying to get out of duty. But the way I have it planned out in my head is that I'm just going to get as drunk as possible, lock my barracks door and hang myself in my closet. I just don't see a point in prolonging the inevitable. Sorry for the grammar, I'm using my phone
