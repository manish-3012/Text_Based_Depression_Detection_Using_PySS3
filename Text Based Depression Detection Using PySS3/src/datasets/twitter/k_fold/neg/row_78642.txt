It's been seven years.The first time I tried killing my self was seven years ago today. I was out drinking with friends at one of their houses, and we had a massive falling out. The feeling of losing my friends, combined with all the other terrible feelings I had over the course of eighteen years at that point just was too much. Like I had wanted to do so for a while, and it just felt like the time. I tried hanging myself in my friend's closet but they stopped me. 

I remember going to the hospital, my parents being notified, my mom getting there as fast as she could. Everyone looked so sad, so surprised that this could happen. It hurt a lot because no one noticed before. At the time of me posting this I remember that I was sitting in with a psychiatrist who was telling me I had to go to a hospital for a while because I was a danger to myself. I kept begging and pleading for that not to be the case. I ended up spending a week alone, in a place where the was no doors, everyone watching me, and I couldn't have shoes, or a belt, or anything to hurt myself. I got cigarettes that I had at break once a day, and I don't remember eating really. I think there was spaghetti once but I kinda blocked a lot out. 

Last night I had a really bad flashback to this, I guess it was a lot more traumatic than I first thought. I feel like I'm still really broken, I'm not sure how to fix it. I wish I wasn't. I feel like people still don't notice either and that hurts. I was told numerous times that because I tried it once I'm some percentage more likely to try it again, and I do feel like people walk on eggshells with me over it but like no one asks really, or seems to care why or what the feelings are. 

Idk. I'm not sure what this post is about. I'm just screaming into the void again
