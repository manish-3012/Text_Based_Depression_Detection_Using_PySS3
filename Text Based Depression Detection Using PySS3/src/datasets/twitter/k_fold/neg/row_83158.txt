Keeping the ideaI don't get on my dad. Hes very passive aggressive and its mainly just me who has issues with him. 
We argue ten times a day, I think I've had enough. I never have been getting on with him. 

He ignores me when I say good morning to him. So I stored some glass, in case I feel like dying. I don't know how much worse it will get. 

I keep these items, because I can't trust being alive. 
I'm always watching programmes that laugh about death, skulls, but I'm dealing with grief a ton this year. I'm losing a ton of hope.
