Flowers for AlgernonI just read this book. It's made me feel angry and sad. I cried several times while reading this book. I feel that I can relate to the main character after his surgery as he starts to look at everyone in a bad light. And it's not completely irrational too. I dont know. It's hard living. I'll keep moving on, but I thought maybe if somebody here read the book, I can have a discussion about it. It's made me think a lot more recently and I've sad thoughts now.
