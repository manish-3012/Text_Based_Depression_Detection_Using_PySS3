I need help with my future brother in lawIâ€™m not sure what to do or how to handle the situation but my fiancÃ©â€™s brother lives with us and he happened to leave a like notebook downstairs in the family room and I opened it thinking it was my fiancÃ©â€™s calendar book. It wasnâ€™t and it had a couple pages of him talking about suicide and just ending it all but wonâ€™t do it because of funeral costs... He recently broke up with his long term girlfriend( like 2 months ago) so he has been really down about that, me and his sister have been there for him as best we can but after reading that idk what to do or how to talk to him about it. I almost feel like he wanted us to read it so he can get help but I donâ€™t want to make him feel like we invaded his privacy. What can I do to talk to him about it and try to help him. I need to talk to him soon about it and try to help him find the correct help he needs.
