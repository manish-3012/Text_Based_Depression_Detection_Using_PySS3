I'm not sure what to think, my mind isn't clear about this at allI've always fantasized about suicide in one way or another, in the same kind of way I believe a lot of people do, you know, you wonder who'll show up at your funeral, what will people think, will anybody miss you, will people be sad? Those sorts of thoughts. 

But I never wanted to do it. Mostly. I love life, and in my most clear-minded moments I fully realize to what extent I love its facets, how amazing it can be and how precious it is. But I also sometimes get huge bouts of depression which hit me right in the proverbial nuts, brain-wise and I seem not to care about anything. I've been to a psychologist, though the session was fairly unsuccessful with me not being able to really explain to her how I feel because she just kept changing the topic somehow and placing these pointless tests like "Would you buy your friend a new watch if you borrowed his and broke it?" above anything else. The resulting diagnosis was that I just spend too much time on the PC and far too little in nature, which is correct to some extent, apart from the fact that for the most part I rarely even have time for being anywhere else except maybe work or outside with friends that I enjoy being with. She skipped entirely the parts where I told her I have huge issues with me constantly doing these physical tics that I can't seem to shake off permanently, and when I mentioned my parents split up (which messed me up more than I thought it would, looking back now almost a year later, mostly because my dad just did a complete 180 in my mind) she didn't even blink. I just felt uncomfortable and had this feeling that maybe I'm just a fucking pussy and should get over it but I fucking can't so fuck you ms. psychologist. 

I've always had a prejudice about mental illnesses, mainly thinking that you *can* power through them, with the right mindset, and I'm still convinced about that, I just really, *really* don't have any mental energy to do that anymore. I lost the will for social interactions, school (which really, really fucked me up, it's in the back of my head constantly and I want to scream every time I'm reminded about how next to nothing I actually did in these last two years, considering additionally that I paused for two years as well) and recently, even life.

I've read an anecdote comparing suiciders with those people who jump of a burning building, and it's a pretty solid comparison. Again, I'm still kinda unsure whether or not I'm just a hypochondriac and hear about a mental illness and manage to squeeze it in my head and *live* it, but I'm pretty sure this negativity is almost palpable, so I've almost dismissed that theory. A couple of days back, I just spent a whole day just moping around. But not just regular moping, *power* moping. I moped and moped so much that at one moment I just closed a chat I was having, disconnected, and just sat in the kitchen for an hour and half. I didn't eat the whole day and decided to go for a long walk just to get out of the house, and the negativity in my head was overwhelming. I didn't even want to think about anything, I just wanted to stop thinking at all. Nothing had an appeal anymore and it was so real I was scared out of my mind when I "sobered" up a little, later in the evening. 

Part of the reason why I spent that day power moping was that my mom asked me to come to visit my dad for a small barbecue for May Day, and I realized I haven't actually seen him in half a year and I didn't even want to. He did some things also which kinda shocked me, and he acted weird, but.. It's still my dad. And I just wanted to erase him. Additionally, my mom called me afterwards if I was coming and it all sounded just so depressing. It was just her, him and some worker my dad basically uses as a substitute for his son (which my mom even pointed out at one time, for some fucking reason). I don't even know whether I was sad, or angry, or what the cause might even be: perhaps the realization I haven't seen him for a long time? Or the depressing image of just them three sitting there alone (usually there are a lot of people at these gatherings)? Or the fact that I told her I'd come visit and just sat on the kitchen floor not knowing what to do? Or maybe that I was replaced with some guy who's much more interested in the same things my dad is and much more dilligent than I can be? I guess most people would be hurt by that fact but I just don't... feel it. I should be burning with rage, or distraught with sadness, but I just don't feel anything at all. And *that* sucks. 

It happens a lot, with these mood swings that I am either very angry with something or in a really depressed mind state and in the next moment, for reasons mostly unknown, be it a song that plays, a person I meet, an event that happens I just change. Just like that. For no reason. That angers me a lot as well. 

After reading this, I realize a lot of it can be miscontrued by anybody else who is not me, so take all this with a grain of salt. It's not as bleak as it may sound, and the things I mentioned are not the main parts of my everyday life, I left out many a great deal of things, but it does give an insight into my deluded and recently predominantly negative mind. 

I started writing just to see actually what I'm going on about in my mind. The main reason is basically that I spent a whole day with the most negative mindset I ever could imagine, just wanting a disconnect button, just wanting to die a little bit.

I was shocked by this recent negative turn of events in my mind and I worry that in a bout of anger, sadness, or any powerful emotion I might inch closer to this black hole slowly forming in the centre of my psyche, slowly tearing my mental fabric apart and consuming the pieces with its vast, cold appendages. 

In the end I don't even know whether or not I want to suicide. What do I think? Where do I go from here? 

One thing I'd also like to add that for a huge part of my life, I've always had problems of forming a solid mental structure about something. I could always change my perception of something as easy thinking it. I never know what to think about something and a situation could have a thousand valid positions and outcomes. When I was a kid, I had this imaginary alternate world, in which I was omnipotent, and it was technology-themed. And one of the first thing that I did was I "wrote" a piece of code or software that allowed me to erase a turn of events in my mind and form some new event, that goes in the way that I want it to go. Sort of like a quicksave button for mental processes (before I even knew what quicksave was). And I guess this sort of thinking led me to being able to have many different and conflicting views on a certain situation. And not being able to hold a firm belief or position about something or other. But not in the sense of people persuading me about their positions easily, but just being unsure of which position or train of thought I should take about it. And it's always been a huge hindrance for me, mentally. On the outside, I've always managed to take one choice, be strict about it, and even help other people overcome their insecurities. If something has to be done, I'll think of any way it can be done well and efficiently. I'll help people with the slight holdup they might have about doing something, help them feel better about themselves, but I could never do it for me. 

I'm not sure you (the reader) are understanding me properly, and I currently have no way of being more concise (other than completely rewriting it maybe), but I sure hope you get me. Once again, take it with a grain of salt, I may be missing a vital information here or there. I may even sound odd and autistic (sorry that I use this term, but it best describe what I'm trying to convey) , but I've always had a well adjusted life and in some ways even better than other people. Where some people may have social drawbacks (I have tons of friends some of which are the most popular people around and they can't even fucking speak for themselves) I'd help them with it.  But my main drawback is that I've never felt I'm doing the right thing. Every time I speak about anything that has any importance and I'm met with some resistance I always back away. I know this sounds conflicting with what I just said, but the situations and topics at hand are vastly different. I've just never believed that I'm actually accepted in society and that people might actually like me, either. I've had problems with my self-image since elementary school, which has largely influenced that thought.

I'm branching off here way far away, so I'll stop with this before it gets out of control. Basically this whole text needs a rewrite, but this isn't why I wrote this. Even if nobody has anything to say to me, at least I'll have some of my thoughts in black on white. At least it will be a huge help if I ever decide to form a better construct of thoughs about myself or this situation. 

Overall, I'm just very negative lately and I wish for it to stop and for my mind to clear. I had a bad experience with a psychologist, and I guess I should just try again, this time with someone else. The psychologist did mention that I might want to seek counsel at a psychotherapist about my thoughts, and I'm getting an appointment next week.

I just wanted to tell someone that I'm horribly, horribly depressed lately and that these days of bleakness are really fucking hard to keep up with. And I don't even know why this is happening. I just want it to stop. And I don't want suicide to be the way to do it.
