Donâ€™t care anymoreSo I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ft0o97/guilt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) the other day, about feeling guilty about wanting to commit in these times. Just wanted to come back and clarify that I donâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™m just gonna do it.
