I really want to end it, but am afraid of being selfishi really want to die. i'm going through an awful breakup, and my ex seems to be handling everything perfect, like the time we spent together meant nothing. i have struggled with depression all my life, but when i started dating him things got a lot better. i hadn't cut myself once during our relationship. now that it's over, my leg is already covered in cuts again. i'm not coping with this well at all. i wrote out letters for everyone important to me for if i go through with it. i just feel so so selfish. my dad lost his mom not even a year ago, and my best friend lost her dad also less than a year ago (she's 19, I just turned 20 last week). I'm really struggling with what to do. I don't want to be in pain anymore. But I know it'll hurt quite a few people. Does anyone have any advice?
