My Final ThoughtsNot expecting to be read, merely going through the motions: (i would write it down on paper and burn it after but thatâ€™s melodramatic and i dont have paper to write on)

Tonight feels right but iâ€™m still confused &amp; frustrated... after months of fantasising about my death and making preparations more than once i want to get a few things in order and end it tonight yet i feel as if i still need closure.... 

iâ€™m not sure if im feeling this because iâ€™ve always believed itâ€™s an act of weakness. iâ€™ve always had a strong will, &amp; mental fortitude... iâ€™m emotionally thick skinned, Always seeking to listen, advise / support others without feeling burdened or troubled by it yet all i can think of is dying the last few months since breaking up with my gf. We were together a couple of yrs and living together. I loved her, accepted her as my family and would of given my life for her yet she wont even say goodbye... since we broke up i spent the last few Months not sleeping more than a couple hrs a night when I only sleep through sheer exhaustion &amp; even then i am disturbed by whatever paranormal presences is in this apartment. I have no energy left after spending hours at work pretending to be okay and helping others.
I have no desire to live anymore.

since me and my gf broke up we canâ€™t speak as she doesnâ€™t reply to me which i may be why iâ€™m confused about my decision. i want her to acknowledge my thoughts / feelings, that way i can find closure in our time together. Without this i feel iâ€™ll be ending everything prematurely and this leaves me unsettled. I plan to go out as comfortably as possible but this just deprives me of a peaceful end and i really wish to die knowing my thoughts are as clear as possible.

While i will spend my next few hours getting things in order and boxing off other less significant loose ends it seems i will have to become contempt with a less than perfect ending.
