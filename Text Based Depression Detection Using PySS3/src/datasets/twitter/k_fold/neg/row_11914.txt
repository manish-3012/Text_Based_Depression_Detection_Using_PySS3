My life is chaosHey guys, Iâ€™ve never posted on here before but here goes. Iâ€™m a 16 nearly 17 year old boy, my parents are dead, all of my relatives are dead. I have cancer and a neurological disease. I had an abusive ex who used to cut me who has destroyed all my friendships. I donâ€™t leave my room because my foster parents hit me. I have thought about suicide for about 3 years now. I think todayâ€™s the day.
