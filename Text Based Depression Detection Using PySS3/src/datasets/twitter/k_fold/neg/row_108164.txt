Its hard.I've been dealing with emotional abuse for the past 5 or so years from a member of my family, and its been the most goddamn difficult thing I've ever dealt with. I've tried to end my life twice with this being the third time. This was the closest I actually got to killing myself, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. After stepping away from the belt, I checked my phone to see my phone blown to hell with messages from my girlfriend and my friends. It truly made me feel cared.  My fear is that the future won't be so bright and I'll relapse again. What should I do?
