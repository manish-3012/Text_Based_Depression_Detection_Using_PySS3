how to overcome this???been 1 week  since i finished 1st semster on college and now we have like 1 month break before 2nd semester
but all i do is staying at home all day.... my suicidal thoughts/anxiety/depression are getting worse and worse day by day since i feel so lonely and i think iam gonna explode till we start 2nd semester.... is anyone in the same situation as me??
(sry for my grammar)
