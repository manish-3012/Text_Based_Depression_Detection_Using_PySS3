wanting to die over immense guiltI never thought I could be suicidal, until my father's death last week. It wasn't the death that drove me suicidal, but the fact that I insisted on treatment when the doctors recommended just letting him go peaceful. For this my father suffered unimaginable pain for over a week. He was immobile and unable to speak, so I didn't realize, or rather, didn't want to believe that he was in such great pain. I was hoping for a miracle, and price of chasing it is too hefty. I will never be the same person again; there's no way a wound this deep can heal. The only option left is suicide
