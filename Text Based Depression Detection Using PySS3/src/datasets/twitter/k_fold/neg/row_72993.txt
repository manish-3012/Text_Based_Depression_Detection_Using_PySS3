I'm almost done cleaningI moved in to this place three years ago next month. A few months in a good friend took her own life. I swore I wouldn't do it until my place was clean so my family wouldn't have to deal with anything. It's been in a state of terrible mess ever since. A few weeks ago I started cleaning and feeling better. I have only about 6 hours of deep cleaning left and my place will be as clean as it was the day I moved in. But 2 weeks ago another friend died in suspicious circumstances. And my mom caused me to become nearly 4 thousand dollars in debt. That's a huge amount to ne considering I'm on disability. And my neighbours heard me crying and are all acting weird around me. And now all that's left to do is clean for 6 hours. My entire body hurts but I want to get it done before the weekend is over. 

I have been deeply depressed and hapless for over half of my life. I want peace
