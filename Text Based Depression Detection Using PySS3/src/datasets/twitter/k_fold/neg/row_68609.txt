Why should I exist?I was never supposed to be born in the first place and my biological mother wanted to abort me so I shouldn't be on this earth in the first place. And now 18 years later shit hasn't gotten any better and I just want out. I want the pain of being a disappointment and a failure to stop. I want to walk in front of a moving car tonight to get it to stop.
