My roommate is addicted to drugs and very depressed suddenly he started to tell he is going to suicide this week. How can i HELP him?He is my roommate we both study engineering but he has never given any midterms or even go to class. He tells me he is sometimes depressed and stressed. He stays in bed all day listening to suicide boys, and he seems to have no friends here. I encourage him to get up and try to make him go to his class, but he always says no. He said he is going to suicide tomorrow but didn't go into detail. About  a week ago he said he is going to Halloween party(which i think he is just saying to cover his suicide) and said to me "Can you tell my Teachers that i am sick" I said okay. But i thought he was really gonna do it because when teachers see absent student they try to call the student if failed, they will call their parents.  Or maybe he is joking about suicide.But i must prevent this shit from happening. However i need your help redditors.

TL;DR: just the title
