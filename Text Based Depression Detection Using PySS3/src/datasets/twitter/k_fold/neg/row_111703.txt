Plz Donâ€™t. Not Today.Donâ€™t kill yourself today

Because your Netflix trial still has a week left

Donâ€™t kill yourself today

Because no one else will finish off the chicken in the fridge

Donâ€™t kill yourself today

Because I know for a fact that Starbucks is releasing a new Frappuccino sometime next month

Yes, your mother will miss you

Yes your bully will make a sappy Facebook post about how what a a wonderful person you were

And yes

Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem

You know that

Youâ€™ve known that

Everyone and anyone has been shoving that down your throat since they first learned what the word suicide meant

So donâ€™t kill yourself

Until you finish your shampoo and conditioner at the same time

Donâ€™t kill yourself

Until Doctor Who is finally cancelled

Donâ€™t kill yourself

Until you tell someone your best pasta recipe 

Donâ€™t kill yourself 

Because I will keep coming up with reasons for you not to

And I need you

To hear all of them

Donâ€™t kill yourself

I love you

Youâ€™re important

Itâ€™s a bad day

Not a bad life

There is more to this

The world will keep spinning on its axis without you

But

Think of all the sunrises youâ€™d miss

I know this sounds pointless

But when youâ€™re sitting in front of everything deadly you own

Revising your goodbyes

There will be too much darkness 

To see anything else

But this is not about seeing anything else

This is about turning off the lights

This is about finding the bed instead of the noose

This is about giving yourself one more day

Even if it takes ten thousand of those

One more morningâ€™s

Until

â€œI canâ€™t wait for tomorrowâ€

This is about staying alive

Because thereâ€™s gonna be a new Marvel movie

No one should miss that

This is about staying alive

Because the future is coming 

And itâ€™s ready for you

I donâ€™ t need you to see it

I just need you to believe you can make it 

Until then
