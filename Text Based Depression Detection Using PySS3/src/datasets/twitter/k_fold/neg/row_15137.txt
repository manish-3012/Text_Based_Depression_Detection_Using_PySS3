listeningI'm a high student, female.

I know people have bigger problems then me. My sister is stressed because of her job and breakup, my mom is going through midlife crisis, my friends are having family problems. I shouldn't bother them with my problems.

My friends have their own lives, when they have issues, I listen. 

When my mom or my sister has issues, I listen.

When I have problems, one person listens.

I do.

I wake up, and wish I didn't. I go to shower, and listen to myself insult my stomach. I look in the mirror, I listen to myself cry over my face. I listen to myself struggle over my hair. I get dressed, I listen to myself insult my figure, I listen to myself cry as I carve the word fat repeatedly into my thigh. I listen as I cry over the scars on my stomach, that read 'ugly'. I listen to people saying I am ugly, that I look like a child. I listen to my mother say I look pudgy, I listen to my sister complain about how she looks awful, when I listen to everyone talk about how gorgeous she is, and why aren't I like her? I listen to my family and friends telling me its hormones. I listen to my mom saying she won't take me to a therapist. I listen to them when they say its a phase, I'll grow out of it. I've listened to myself crying myself to sleep for 2 years. 

I've wanted to listen to my inner cowardice. I've wanted to listen to my heart, my selfish, awful heart.

I know people have bigger, more important issues.

I know I'm being selfish.

I know how sad people would be when I'm gone.

I know how much better I'd feel dead.
