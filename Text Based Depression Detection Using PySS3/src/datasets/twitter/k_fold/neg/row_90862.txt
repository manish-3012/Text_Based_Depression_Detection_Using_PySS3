Just wish i could go to sleep and never wake up againHonestly I dont even want to die, as the thought of dying scares the shit out of me, i just wanna not live anymore. I keep on losing any sort of reason on waking up and living and no one seems to care making my life a slow but certain ride into complete insanity. This shouldnt even be considered living anymore, it's just surviving
