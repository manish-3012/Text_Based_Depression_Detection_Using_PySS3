If you wanna listen hear what I have to say but if you donâ€™t wanna hear itâ€™s okay I understandIâ€™m just here to vent honestly Iâ€™m just so tired of being ugly. And I know that sounds Cliche and all but itâ€™s honestly true. Iâ€™m so god damn insecure that it would be hard for me to even look in the mirror. A lot of girls say Iâ€™m cute or wtv and that Iâ€™m not ugly. But I think theyâ€™re lying. Two kids called me ugly like a month ago and let me tell you... that really fucking hurt. Like it really did. I wish I didnâ€™t care what people thought of  me but unfortunately I do care. I wish I could show you guys what I look like so then you guys can form your opinions on me but I canâ€™t do that for obvious reasons. But Iâ€™ll describe myself to you guys. So Iâ€™m 6 foot very slim I have curly hair Iâ€™m puertorican Iâ€™m a guy Iâ€™m 17 years old a lot of people say my teeth. are really straight which they are not trying to toot my own horn. or anything in fact people actually accuse me of having dentures cus of how straight my teeth are. so i guess thatâ€™s a good thing about my appearance. I have brown eyes a lot of people say I have long eyelashes which I think theyâ€™re sort of long I guess I have acne. which sucks but Iâ€™m actually using like acne products to handle that problem. so yeah Iâ€™m sorry if you guys didnâ€™t want to read this. but I just wanted to vent to someone.
