LonelinessI can't believe this life can be so goddamn lonely. I have an internet, phone, computer with videogames and all, but regardless of these things I am alone as hell. I could have a lot of friends and gf if I just wouldn't be so empty and depressed piece of s**t inside. I broke everything including myself so no one left around me to help.
Why do I not end it all? There is no rational reason to be living this miserable, pointless life.

Just another reason to make this happen. Thank you for that you guys exist, so I can sound off instead of be talking to myself alone in my empty room.
