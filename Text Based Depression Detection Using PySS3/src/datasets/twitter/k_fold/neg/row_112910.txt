Struggling to find a single good thing about my lifeI donâ€™t have a family, only a small handful of friends (more acquaintances than anything), my partner literally hates and avoids me, Iâ€™m paid just enough to only survive, Iâ€™m unattractive and not greatly intelligent, I literally feel like a waste of oxygen and organs. I donâ€™t know how to be better. I donâ€™t know how to be deserving of attention or concern. I have tried so hard but Iâ€™m still a giant piece of shit and Iâ€™ll never be good. How do I keep going when I donâ€™t deserve to be alive? When no one wants me? Why canâ€™t I just be normal?
