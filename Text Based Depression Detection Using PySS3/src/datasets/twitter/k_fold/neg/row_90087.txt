Update on my last post on this sub RedditI was sent to a mental hospital and was there for a good 8 days and honestly it was the best decision I made in my life. I got better meds to help with my mental health issues, I made friends that I am going to hang with, I got into a good eating habit, I realized I'm loved by those around me and I have a better way of living by working out, doing yoga, going outside and doing hobbies I enjoy.


The hospital experience over all was good but wasn't a picnic, I had a lot of time to reflect how I got to that point which was very helpful. I don't really know if many care but I'm doing better and sometimes it's ok to get help.


Y'all matter, even if you don't think you don't, you do.
