Life just isnâ€™t enjoyableI donâ€™t mean when Iâ€™m at the lowest of the lows and I have stress and lots of work any no support. Even in good times in my life, it just isnâ€™t that enjoyable. Whenever I get time to relax, I just donâ€™t have fun. Whenever I get a relief from depression, I still donâ€™t feel good. Life is mediocre at best, shitty the rest of the time. Nothing just seems worth it. People seem to just have some inherent value in life and only waive that when people are in shitty circumstances. I just donâ€™t see it. I just donâ€™t like any of this.
