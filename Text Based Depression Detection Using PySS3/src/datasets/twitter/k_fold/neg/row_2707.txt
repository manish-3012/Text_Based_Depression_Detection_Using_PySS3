Hate me life! I'm trash!I'm 26years name is kially. I tried killing myself 2years ago but I was saved by a guy who saw me hanging from the tree. Since then to now I've been fighting the urge. I hate my life it's just trash, I failed everyone around me. It seems I cant do anything right! I broke as hell but I'm trying to make my life better. I dont do drugs although it crossed my mind many times as people says it takes the pain away. I use to cut myself but I stop. I have no friends so I dont really have anyone to talk with. I dont tell my parents anything cause it seems people dont understand how hard this is. It's all a joke! I fake my happiness around people cause I can't stand the condescending talking of who I should be. The truth is I dont think I'll live to see the end of this year, this shit is getting worst. I sleep 1hour every night and stay in a corner all day. I pray to ever God I know and even went do far as asking Satan just take my pain cause. Like if God is real why make things this hard! I've said what makes my life hard cause I just don't want to say. But before I take my life before this year is up I'll try and do one thing! make my little happy for once after I see her smile I'll end it I swear. Shes better of not having me around her shes the only person I could truly say I love. I'm toxic and just a bad influence. Anyways just want to get that out
