one person i thought i could trustabout 8 years ago i was cleaning public lavatory which is normal, not fun but it's work that has value and satisfaction. The worst biohazards were blood and poop smeared on the cubicle walls, ( I'm a female so I clean the ladies toilet)

but then there was this one time i cleaned the handicap toilet, and there was a used condom and childrens books in there as well as porno magazines and I had only seen an middle age man and a younger kid come through earlier that day, otherwise I didn't see any kids around because it was school hours. 

I tried to not think about it for years even though gnawing in my mind i knew it was remnants of pedophilia i saw 

i didn't do anything, i didn't report it i didn't tell anyone 

i tried to kill myself after i quit the job the next week 

it failed and i moved on but routinely that image has haunted me, and for the past few months it has been burnt onto my retinas. 

I only want to kill myself to get it out of my mind, i thought about lobotomy, i started banging my head against the wall everytime the flashbacks come back 

my bestfriend since we were babies was raped by her dad when she was a todler 

i only found out about it 8 years ago too. I only realise now that those might have been what contributed to my suicide attempt 

i waited this long, thought i was a success story, pushed each day made it to the next 

but i don't think i can make it anymore

i want it to end so desperately
