Tired and defeatedI was formally diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder at the age of 9. Since then, my life has generally been plagued by severe emotional ups and downs that have been exacerbated by certain familial events, and just a general chemical imbalance in my brain. I have been on antidepressants in the past, but am not currently on them. I am 21 now. My depression and anxiety now stem from my own guilt for being unable to do anything about this shit world, and from the dissolution of a year and half relationship (my first relationship). I have one suicide attempt under my belt, and this morning I woke up with a fucking panic attack. I am scared of what I am going to do to myself. I feel fairly useless, worthless, helpless, undeserving, and defeated.
