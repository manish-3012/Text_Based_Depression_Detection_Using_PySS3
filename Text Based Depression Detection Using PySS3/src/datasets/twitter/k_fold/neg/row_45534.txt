I think im gonna kill myself tonightMy girlfriend cheated on me. I am probably gonna fail high-school because I missed 200 class period with her. I don't want to live anymore. I haven't felt happy with my life in a couple of years now and I don't know what else to do. I've tried improving myself and my environment. I don't know what to. I have my hunting rifle next to me so I doubt I'll post anymore on my account. I just want to say thank you to the reddit community and all my friends that supported me for so long. Thanks
