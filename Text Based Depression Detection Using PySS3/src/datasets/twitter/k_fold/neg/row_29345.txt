Ending it soonNot that I expect any strangers to actually care, but I felt like I should tell someone that I plan to take my life this weekend. Not like I have any real friends to tell. Not even going to tell my parents. I'm sure they'll be sad momentarily but I'll be forgotten soon enough, just like anybody else who kills themselves. I know all the reasons not to. It's cowardly, a permanent solution to a temporary problem, blah blah who gives a fuck. They don't come close to outweighing the reasons to. Not even leaving a note b/c I don't have anything positive to say. Nobody is around so it might be weeks before anyone notices.....
