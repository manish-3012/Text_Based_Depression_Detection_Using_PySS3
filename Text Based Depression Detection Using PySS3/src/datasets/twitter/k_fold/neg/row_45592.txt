EmptyTried to commit suicide a few days ago
Ended up throwing everything up
Have no one to talk to or support me
Dunno where my boyfriend is at, atm
Wishing the pills worked
Legs covered in scratches and cuts 
Everything is spinning 
Canâ€™t bother to stay awake anymore
Refuse to eat 
Sleep just gets worse
Mental health gets worse
Canâ€™t get help
Just wants to be held 
Just wants physical love and attention
Just wants their life to be normal
Wants everything to go back the way it was
Losing themselves
Losing others 
Losing the will to live 

&gt; Accepted the way things are
