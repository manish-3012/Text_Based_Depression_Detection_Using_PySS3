I did so much suicide attempts in 2019I am looking back at it and I see only hospital. I did suicide attempts by overdose of medication (a loooot) (anxiolytics and neuroleptics) by cuttinh my arms and by throwing up myself on the subway (the last one and the biggest one). I am still alive and thatâ€™s a miracle. Life wants me. I hope you read this post and find hope.
