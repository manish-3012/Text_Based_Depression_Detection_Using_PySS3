Just came here to leave a weight of my chest since i will kill myself tommorrow before 8 AM GMT+1Hello guys, not sure on how to start this post but let me tell you first that i'm not a native english speaker, I actually live in Switzerland and talk French 95% of my time. So don't be too bothered if there are some mistakes on my post.

Anyway i came here today because i intend to kill myself by tommorrow's morning and wanted to see if i could find any solution to remedy to my sempiternal depression. Not like i think there's any out here but who knows, but i figured talking about it with strangers could at least let me Lighten a bit my heart.

So let's just start introducing myself, I'm a male of 28 years old with no degrees or certifications of any kinds except the obligatory school ones you get at the end of it wich are pretty mediocre anyway. 

I tried two apprenticeships, first as an automated machines operator and second one as an IT Worker (not sure for the direct translations sorry), wich i logically failed lamentably. In case of the first one it was because i contracted epilepsy as for the second one because of my depression i just gave up at the last year. Sure i know it's not totally my fault in the first case but i'm the one to blame for not trying to go all the way to the end in case of the second one. 

I'm actually working as an independent with my father in the solar protection domain (shutters, blinds and others) for 3 years now, normally supposed to help in any way but more specifically concerning accounting and IT related works and that's where it becomes awful but i'll explain it later.

I always suffered of depression perhaps not as pronounced before as it is now and always had this way of feeling like this life thing is just a chore, like i shouldn't be invested in it and should just try to seem normal and do normal things.

I always had this sensation of being spectator of my own life and seeing myself taking all the wrong choices knowingly without stopping myself, like not having any actual impact on what i'm doing, just constantly being passive, choosing the easy way and taking the blunt of all the repercussions without caring as if it wasn't me on the other end of it.

By a miracle (or curse depending on your point of view) i was always able to come back to the surface and try to act like a living being for a bit more time and that's largely due to my parents always having my back. after my second apprenticeship i was willing to kill myself but i instead got to a therapist who just couldn't reason with me just like the others i had in my life. and i honestly talked about all these problems with everyone i know, explaining that i just deserve to finish homeless to be less of a burden for the people i love. I was right to think of this, i'm the scum of the earh.

Coincidentally, my father was fired because of his secretary who tried to make him pass for a sexual abuser, problem who turned out to be false since she already tried the same thing on other workplaces without any success for her except the fact that my father was now jobless. We came to the agreement to try and go independent with the last bit of money we had, now it's been 3 years and he is working like a madman since then (he's a work-addict so that doesn't help). This was alway a bad idea (no hope of ever gaining money to survive more than this considering the amount of work need and the state of this market) and i knew it but like always i never sayed anything, i just spent my time seeing my own fall.

I on the other hand has been just pretending to aid him, all i did was make believe for the most part. I hate myself every second that pass for this and again i see myself not acting and resolving things at the last second every single time without being able to slap myself into react. Now we are on the verge of bankruptcy with multiples prosecutions in the making. I'm a fraud and i just don't deserve to live.

So now guys tell me exactly what hope i have and what should be my drive to continue living this joke of life. I sincerely want to see a solution but i highly doubt it exists.

Anyway first of all thanks for your attention and your answers, i just needed to talk about it.
