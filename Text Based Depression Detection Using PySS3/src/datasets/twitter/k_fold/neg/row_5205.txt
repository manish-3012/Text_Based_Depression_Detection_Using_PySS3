life in decay"graduated" with a cs degree three years ago, I was hoping to get a job and be independent, so I can get some help for my condition

had to go to hospital for suicide plans, got my condition force fed to me everyday by hospital staff... awful.. can't disclose, I know how they treat people like me

Learned very quickly that I'm not qualified for anything, after getting a retail job, it became clear to me that I would start to fail to keep up with expectations, left while on good terms. Couldn't work full time without freaking out and cutting myself. Can't start on therapy again because of insurance issues, which I need in order to look for work again (required for job seeking help).

There's no escaping my parents, there's no getting access to any treatment, I'm trapped, the only way out is death or 14 hour shifts, no life, no friends, no family just endless exploitation or severe suffering shortly followed by death on the streets. Just existing a "comfortable" cage.

Just everyone force feeding me my deformity. It's so hard interacting with people, they're so super toxic. Why?! It must be me, I'm a terrible person, perhaps this what I deserve, though I'd argue I deserve far worse.

thanks for listening
