I've had two very serious suicide attempts in the past three weeks. About to have another. Give me some reasons to stay alive.I posted about my first attempt in r/confession. You can find it in my history if you want to see it.

The next attempt has left me likely needing surgery to repair serious tendon damage to my arm.

I hate that I failed. I don't want to fail again. I have everything I need to go through with it this time, and after the last time, it doesn't seem like it will be as difficult as I thought.

What is there to enjoy in life? A good bowl of macaroni and cheese? Seeing who the next president is going to be? Watching the season finale of Dexter?

My friends and family have left me feeling pretty alone and abandoned. I really just have myself, and I can't figure out where else to go from here. I'm just getting myself ready to do it again right now, and this time without failing.

I don't really want to be saved. I don't think I can be. I don't  want to be committed, I'm in therapy and on meds and that's as far as I'm willing to go. 

I've been told that the way the mind processes physical pain, neurologically, is the same way as the mind processes emotional pain. And I've been feeling for a long time like I've just had my legs cut off, or something else horribly painful.

I guess I just want to hear things from people before it's over.
