i dont know what to do anymore.this is the second time i got in an argument with a friend in the past year. my friend said that im a nobody and im the weirdest person out of everyone in the group. all this happened in front of my friends too. so apparently im a weird loner who is a nobody. these are the only friends i have in california and i moved out here with them from ohio.  my self esteem was always low, can never talk to girls, never got respect from people unless they are using me. and now this. i dont know what to do anymore, i really want to end it.
