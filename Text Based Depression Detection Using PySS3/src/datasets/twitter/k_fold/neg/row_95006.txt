Brother is threatening self harm and suicide. Me family and I are unsure how to proceed on getting him help.My brother is currently living with me. If he isn't living with me, he lives with my mother. He refuses to get a job, uses our utilities, and lives off of our food. His car is about to be repossessed AGAIN, and he refuses to work and support himself. I am 22 and my brother is 26.

Any time we urge him to help out and get a job or even do chores to help out around the house, he threatens to harm himself or kill himself. He already DOES cut himself with knives. I have hidden every single sharp objects in my house. Yet, he still finds something or a new object that isn't hidden. He has multiple deep cuts on his face, arms, and legs.

We are unsure how to proceed from here. Anytime we bring something up to help, he threatens suicide or self harm. I am afraid I'm going to come home one day after work and find his body. He is not on drugs or alcohol. He just sleeps all day and plays video games.

If someone needs more info, please feel free to ask. Any ideas?
