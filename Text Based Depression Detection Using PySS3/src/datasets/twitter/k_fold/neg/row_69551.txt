i donâ€™t even fucking know anymore
So hereâ€™s how it goes.

Iâ€™ve been depressed now for about three years (Iâ€™m currently 17) due to an uncaring family and money issues. My parents got fucked over by someone who was stealing money from their accounts and a couple of other people, but yet that made it seem like it was my fucking fault. So Iâ€™ve worked at a job to help them pay bills and shit soo that they donâ€™t take our house. They owe me now $10000 but not once has both of them said thank you. And this has fucked me.

Iâ€™ve seen psychiatrists over the years because of this, but they all just tell me the same thing, â€œFocus on what makes you happy.â€ Well the thing is nothing makes me fucking happy anymore.

Been thinking about killing myself on and off, even tried it once by hanging and failed. I just feel soo fucking empty and alone. Nothing about my life matters at this point anymore. Fuck school. Fuck family. Fuck friends. Fuck life. The only people I thought cared about me are too busy to even acknowledge that I even exist anymore. 

Had a couple of relationships over these years which helped a little bit, but even then they just eventually felt stupid. Tried my shot at a girl today who Iâ€™d thought liked me back. But no, she was just using me. Like everyone else in this shitty world. 

So right now Iâ€™m sitting in the dark with a bottle of rum and am will probably be dead by tomorrow morning.

Goodbye
