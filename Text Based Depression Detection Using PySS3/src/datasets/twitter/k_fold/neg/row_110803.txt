I was raped and I'm not dealing wellIt's been over a month and I can't take it. It's all I think about all the time and I don't want to talk to my friends about it because I know how hard it is on them but I also am afraid to be alone I don't want to be left alone because if I'm not focusing for one second.... It's all I can think about. He was my best friend, I trusted him. I'm so alone. I just want someone to hug me and tell me it's okay but it never will be. I just want this all over.
