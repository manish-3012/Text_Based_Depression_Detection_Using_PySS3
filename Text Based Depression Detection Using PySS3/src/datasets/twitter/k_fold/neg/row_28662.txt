Yea I don't see myself pullin thru thisI've gotten to the point where I've made peace with dying. The truth is at my core I am dead and I've been that way for a long time. All that remains are these personas used to mask this void. Fuck I've had a good run at least. I gave it my best shot but its time to call it. The hardest part is the guilt of leaving the ones I got left behind. I hope I can find some way to leave closure.
