I just want to fall out of existence and have nobody be sad about it. That's about it really. See, before my birth, nobody asked me if I wanted a life. This is because of the obvious practical implications. At the point in my life where it can be said that I was first able to consider my existence properly, it was already too late. I have already become tangled in a net of people who care. Their purest wishes, for which I cannot fault them, coerce me into a life that I do not want. For if they were to stop caring, and if I could put myself where nobody would have the distress of discovering my body, I would not even hesitate.

And there is anger, because I do not want a life. I do not want to put in the effort that it would take to process myself through therapy and become a functional human being. I am not saying that it is impossible for me to be happy. I feel that if I were to co operate with such entities, and have us work together to fix myself, I would likely become happy and productive. What I am actually saying is that I do not want it. I do not want to improve myself, nor do I want to cause distress. Given that I am not willing to compromise on my wishes, there can be no movement in this. I am angry like a trapped beast, because that is what I am. So I am angry only at myself. My pitiful, weak, ridiculous self. Maybe that is the cruellest trick fate has dealt me. The weakness, neither to improve myself nor to end myself. Simply to be here as a...

...COMPLETE ASS.

But those handful of people who I have spoken to seem to think that the medical profession has some answer. They seem to think that, if I went to a doctor, they would change my mind. No, I'd have to co operate, I'd have to want to change, and I do not. All I want is something that is impossible. All I want is to fall out of existence and have nobody be sad about it.
