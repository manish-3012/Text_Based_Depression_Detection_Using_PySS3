Life could be niceThatâ€˜s the worst to me, to know that it could be different. 

I would say i try my best, but somehow it getâ€˜s worse. Rotting alive... becoming weirder and weirder... my thoughts becoming darker. 

Idk what would be the best to improve myself... every decision i make ends in faillure and my situation has become worse.
