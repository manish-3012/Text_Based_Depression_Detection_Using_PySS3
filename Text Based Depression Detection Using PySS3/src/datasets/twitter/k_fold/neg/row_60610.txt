Custody battleI've fought for custody of my daughter in Wisconsin for over a year against my drug addict/dealing ex wife. I gave the police all I had on her and nothing has been done. I'm done. Can't do it anymore. I'm going to leave some items in a lock box to be given to my daughter when she turns 18 and hopefully she'll understand then
