I don't belong anywhereI'm sitting here with my family and I just realized that I don't belong here. I don't belong anywhere. My friends. My family. There's nothing there. There's not a reason to stay. There's no point. I'm just trying not to cry. When I die I don't think I'll be remembered for very long.
