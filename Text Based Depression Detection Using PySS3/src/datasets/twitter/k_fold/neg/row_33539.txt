how do I cope.If you saw my post on Suicide Bereavement, well hello. I am sad to see that we both ended up in the same place. so yeah, my girlfriend killed herself and I really truly felt like I could be strong. I just relapsed and I don't see any point in living. My parents are thinking about putting me into a mental hospital, but I don't think that's going to help with anything. I know that she's dead, but the thought that if I die, I could see her again, is way too tempting. So if I die, thank you for reading my story. I love you.
