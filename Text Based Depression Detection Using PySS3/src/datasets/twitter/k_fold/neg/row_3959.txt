DiginatasI realize that my life is as about as good as it gets.  Only wealthy elite people matter.  I think I'm a waste of resources.  Life is okay.  I have it pretty good.  Too many diagnosis that are getting worse.  I will never get into a top school or have a high paying job.  Much like my growth plate chart, the doctor predicted I wouldn't grow over 5'1" wallah he was right.  A world renowned professor said I was dumb.
