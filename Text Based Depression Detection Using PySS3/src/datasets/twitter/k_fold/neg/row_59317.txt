What do I doI'm currently 17, I don't go to college or have a job although I was about to start searching. I'm called Anthony. I have a girlfriend of over 2 years, she was the only person I could ever talk to about how I felt, we've started drifting and I don't know what to do, I think she's going to leave me and I'm not sure I'll be able to cope without her. Life just seems pointless to me, she was angry and understandably frustrated that I did nothing all day while she was working hard at college, she told me not to come see her until I have a job. Now she won't respond to my messages either. I'm scared of being without her, I'm shaking and I feel ill to my stomach, I don't want to live a life she isn't in. I don't know what to do. I'm so alone.
