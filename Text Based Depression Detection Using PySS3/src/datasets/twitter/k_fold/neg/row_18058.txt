Hey guys i just wanted to say...that i have been feeling like a piece of shit and i don't really know where to go. Currently I am attending college and it's messing me up big time. I can't cope with the stress and I have been unwillingly distancing myself from friends and family. I have been struggeling with suicidal thoughts for almost 10 years now and i just feel like a shell. I just want to drop out for a year and try to get myself together again but my parents strongly disagree. I don't really know waht i expect writing this but i guess I just want somebody to know how I feel.
