Not sure if Iâ€™m pregnant but if I am I will kill myself.No one probably will care but I thought it might help to reach out. So I am a 16 year old female. I am missed my period. I honestly donâ€™t understand how itâ€™spossibke because he didnâ€™t get any semen in me ( so he says). If I am pregnant I canâ€™t go to my parents, do idk how Iâ€™ll even have the abortion. I am already stressed enough in school as Iâ€™m in an academic magnet program that I hate. I honestly just hate my life and Iâ€™m looking for a way out. Maybe the pregnancy will be that. Iâ€™ve been depressed since Iâ€™ve been 12 and off and on suicidal for a long time. I was planning on killing myself by 15, and I feel like maybe I shouldâ€™ve . Life hasnâ€™t gotten any better and if this how Iâ€™m going to feel for the rest of my life Iâ€™d rather die .
