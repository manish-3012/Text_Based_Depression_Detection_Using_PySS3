I'm sorryTo my parents, I've been lying about college. I've been faking my grades, I'm not attending classes anymore. I wish I could say this to you, but this has been going on for more than half a year already. I completely gave up because I couldn't handle the pressure anymore, stepping inside a classroom clouds me with anxiety, every time I walk up to class, I'll cry and immediately wipe my tears away because everyone might think I'm going crazy...but I guess I already am. 

I'm worthless. I'm wasting everyone's time, my parents' money, and they're hoping on nothing. I'm not gonna be successful, mom, dad. I'm sorry. I want to thank you for always trying your hardest to raise me though. I love you guys. I'm sorry I've become a failure. At least, you won't have to put up with me, right? 

To my friends, thank you for understanding my mood swings. Thank you for being there, and being friends with someone like me. I wish I could've done better, been someone better, but I'm already tired trying to keep up appearances. 

I hope my method works smoothly. I don't wanna be a burden anymore.
