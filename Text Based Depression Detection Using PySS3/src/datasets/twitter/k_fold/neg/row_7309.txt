*Insert Generic Title Here*Blah blah I want to die, blah blah I've tried everything, blah blah I'm tired of it all. You, reader, know the drill.

The only thing keeping me around is the idea that the pain I feel could be transferred to others. I'd rather hurt myself than hurt others. So how do I keep those others from getting hurt? It's not difficult to keep the mess down, but people will be people and will cry about it for a year or two.

I've already started being as much of an ass as possible to everyone. It's been difficult, but it seems to be working. People that used to like me have stopped bothering to try and start communication, family doesn't talk to me at all anymore, etc etc. Is this enough? Goal is to not have anyone attend my funeral, because none of them cared, and therefore none of them will be hurt.

Any ideas?
