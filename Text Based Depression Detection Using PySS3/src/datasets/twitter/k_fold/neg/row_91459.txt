You win.Up until today, for the past few weeks I've been feeling okay. Not thinking about suicide, death, anything. My family fixed that. A few months ago I said if things weren't better by August 22nd, I'd kill myself. No reason for that date. 


I know now, experiencing this now, that I won't be able to go through it again. I can't handle feeling this way. They tortured me to death and, maybe, I'll finally find some sort of peace.


Just a couple more days. It's weird how easily things can become fucked up.
