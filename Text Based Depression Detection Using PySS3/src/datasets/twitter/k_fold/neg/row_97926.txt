It's only getting worse for me as time goes on.I've fucked up big time plenty of times in my life. I've tried hotlines, medicines, and hospitals, and yet I still feel the need to kill myself whenever something minorly upsetting comes up at any time. School makes me want to die, talking with my parents makes me want to die, even thinking about anything even remotely bad or embarrassing I've ever done makes me want to die.

Usually I'd talk to someone I know, but my parents would only send me back to an asylum via police escort after an incredibly uncomfortable interrogation by all of them. I'd talk to some people I know via steam (gaming program/market/social media), but they would shrug it off. I'd also talk with my best friend, but I've made him believe that I'm a useless liar, and by the way he reacted, I feel as if I've lost him for good.

So now I'm left with nobody to help me, these thoughts plaguing my mind, and a finished note right beside my monitor as I'm typing this. I'm barely holding on anymore and i'm ready to end this suffering.

Goodbye.
