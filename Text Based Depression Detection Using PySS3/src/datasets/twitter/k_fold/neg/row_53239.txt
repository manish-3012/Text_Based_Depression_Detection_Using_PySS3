Why am I hereHey everyone,
I shouldnâ€™t be in this position. Iâ€™m embarrassed to be in this position. Iâ€™m a white man that comes from an upper class background. No one understands that I could feel depressed. That I could feel suicidal. The thing is I am. Iâ€™ve felt suicidal for the past couple of months. I know I would never act on my feelings, I have had these feelings every second of every day for a while.
Everyday I feel that I am not in control. The best way I could describe it is that I feel like billy pilgrim in the book slaughter house 9. 
My parents are both successful. As you can imagine they put a lot of pressure on me to do well. This year my grades suck. And as a result of this Iâ€™ve started to eat more to combat the stress. Me eating more than makes me depressed for being a fat ass and then I just eat more to feel better. This is the reason why I gained 20 pounds this year. 

I know this badly written, I just wanted to get me thoughts down and vent.

Thanks guys!
