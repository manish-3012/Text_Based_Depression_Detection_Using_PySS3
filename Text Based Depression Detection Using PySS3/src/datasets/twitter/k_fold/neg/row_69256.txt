How do you guys feel less dead inside?I've got a rough home life, almost no friends and a world of shit going on currently including bad grades and I've been feeling like I'm going to break lately. I've tried therapists, and psychologists, but it never really ends up working out. I've tried talking to the few people I trust about my issues but they will either bring the conversation back to themselves \*cough mom\* or they just sit there and don't say anything back to me. I know I should get outside more, And I've been trying to, but its really hard to keep pushing myself away from self harm and depression, I just feel really void and empty and i want to try to make myself better before I screw my life up any further than I already have.
