so I want to do this ... Is it weird or okay ?I haven't told anyone about my depression that much cause i dont want the loved ones to worry about me. i decided that i wanna take control of my life or at least give it a try, could things get any worser ?

I want to do something every day so i decided from today i am gonna post on here saying day 1 accomplished things and then Day 2 accomplished things and so on..... 

this anonymity gives me some kind of strength to express my feelings, emotions and something about that i would never express in a room bunch of strangers or with the loved ones. 

I know, that some of you might think i am crazy or weird, but for some reason I am not afraid or worried about that. at this point of life if i am gonna say fuck everything  then it includes getting the fuck out of depression too. 

If you any of you want to join me in this little change, please do, it would make feel great as well inspired to accomplish more things. I am gonna include my failures and success of the day as well. 

Thank You for supporting me in advance!
