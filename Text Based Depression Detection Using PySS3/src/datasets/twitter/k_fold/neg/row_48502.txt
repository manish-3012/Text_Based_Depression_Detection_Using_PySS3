I'm only here out of spiteI've been wanting to kill myself for about 3 months now but the only reason I haven't is just to spite my dad.

I've been hiding the fact I'm a non-binary lesbian from my parents for about a year now but things happened about 4 months ago that have me feeling so desperate to get away from home that about a month of it a started cytting. 

2 months ago my parents found out about both things and kicked me out of the house. As I was leaving my dad yelled "hope you finally kill yourself now"

That just crushed me so badly that I wanted to jump off a tall building, the only reason I didn't is because my dad said he hoped I would. 
For the past two months or so I've been wanting to kill myself and I the temptation keeps getting worse.

I've been living at a friend's house since I can't go home. They know about the sexuality and gender but not the cutting or suicidal mindset. 

I've tied the noose so many times but everytime I'm about to do it the spiteful voice im the back of my head says "you're only doing what he wants you, proving him right in the process"

I still haven't said anything to my friend and I really don't want to. I know they would get a therapist or something involved and I really don't want that.

I can't keep this up though. The spiteful voice is getting quieter everyday and I may just do it soon.
