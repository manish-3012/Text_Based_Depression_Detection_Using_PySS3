I feel like i don't fit the world anymoreSince I've had my head concussion 3 years or so ago, I struggle a lot with this feeling. It permeates everything. My career, peers, family, past times.

Everything I used to enjoy quickly becomes boring and tedious when I try to enjoy myself or take a break. I feel like I can't really relate to anyone anymore. Like I'm constantly faced with this feeling of being misunderstood.

My marriage has been destroyed, I feel like I've let my children down by being a father that is sort of not present.

I've been very lucky and fortunate in my life, despite growing up abuser and stuff. But after I got a concussion, I struggle to exist here.

Today I was in an IM session with a friend in another state and just out of the blue, asked him opinions on different methods of suicide. I have been trying different depression drugs, therapies, nothing shakes this feeling. 

Like I'm just not meant to be here. That the world doesn't fit anymore. I can't figure out how to shake this feeling. I don't see any path forward anymore.
