I'm tired of holding onMy life is actually not so bad, I've got a few good friends, my aunt that loves me dearly and would do anything for me, I'm seeing a therapist and a doctor but I'm just so damn tired.

I messed up this summer, been in and out of the psych ward, suicide attempts, treated my ex terrible, pushed people away but I can't anymore, I'm so bloody tired, I just want to cut and bleed and not wake up. I wish I wasn't this tired, but I can't do it anymore.
