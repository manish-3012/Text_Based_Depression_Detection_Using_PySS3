Life is not for meIâ€™m tired, tired of everything

I have always been social failure, I always wanted some friends but I could never get fully on it, I have always struggled with ADHD, I have done impulsive decisions, isolated myself multiple times since a kid, and never got social cues at all.

I always wanted a normal life, but I canâ€™t never get it, I donâ€™t know how to flirt, or how to do a friend, I have tried, read, tried again and fail.

The only fiends that I have made itâ€™s because of my lack of social skill I have been a clown, but Iâ€™m tired of that shit, I have been doing that all my life, but never get close to anyone.

I donâ€™t listen people, donâ€™t have an active listening, I interrump them so I donâ€™t talk, I changed topic fastly and donâ€™t know how to get through.

I suffered bullying for 3 years, and have never feel good with myself since kid.

My father has treat me like shit, my mom has overprotected me, I was raped 3 times as a child, I canâ€™t read a book because I unfocus so easy.

I met 2 girls by tinder last year, we hanged out but now theyâ€™re both bored of me (not a surprise), one cheated me and the other one realized how bored I am

All my conversations trying to be with a girl finish on 2 or 4 words, and also with everyone by chat.

Alcohol wasnâ€™t for me, weed gave me some hope as I was chill and made some â€˜fiendsâ€™ but I was again on the same boat.

I tried LSD for 5 months and I was happy, itâ€™s how I maintain these 2 girls, but I had to do it frequently since the â€˜happyâ€™ effect on me remained just for a few days, I went into a psychosis and now I cannot do any psychedelic anymore.



I canâ€™t think in another shit that isnâ€™t kill myself, I donâ€™t like watching movies anymore or playing video games I donâ€™t feel pleasure.

I have today an appointment with a psychiatrist, I will tell him about my ADHD so I can treat it and see if with adderall at least I can start doing something with my life and understand people, this is my last hope
