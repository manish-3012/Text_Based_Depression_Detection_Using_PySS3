I donâ€™t know anymoreI donâ€™t really know how to start this or what to say because I have so much on my mind and it never stops racing. But if anyone reads this I am from Australia I am 19 year old male a young duck to many people out there. This is just a back so if the person I have left the responsibility to find my body fails to do so and at the same time I can let people know my story.
I was never a mentally strong person this is not my first attempt but I beg this will be my last.


reason why I am here is because on Sunday the 21st at 8:33 pm a train will run my skill over crushing. You can guess the rest I have been to the location many l of times scouting it out seeing when the trains run. the girl that I have asked to report my body to my parents. I believe she wonâ€™t so I just want someone out there to know I guess. The reason why I am ending it is because I just donâ€™t fit in anymore I have goon from town to town traveling at my own expenses been working from the age of 12 I have spent so long looking for place to fit in after 6 years of traveling around Australia I still havenâ€™t found what I am looking for and I donâ€™t believe I will ever find it now so this is just me giving up I have returned to my home town and will soon start a new journey just not in this world 

Thanks for letting me share
