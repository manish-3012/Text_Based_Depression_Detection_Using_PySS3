My Girlfriend says she's lost hope.I want to help her so badly. She's been struggling for a long time, crying most nights as I hold her in my arms. She said she no longer sees a future, that everything is just waiting until she gives up. 

She says she's never had any passions, and that she's only really alive for me and her mom. I'm trying everything I can to help her, but no matter what I cook her or give her or tell her or do for her she only feels happiness for but fleeting moments.

She's not been happy for months, she finds every day monotonous even when I change things around. She doesn't get any pleasure from going out or staying in or playing games.

She always tells me that she doesn't see why she should finish Uni, and I tell her that's fine - if she wants to leave, sure. But she finds that pointless, too. I don't want to ever come home to her corpse.

The scariest thing she told me is that the reason she doesn't do spontaneous suicide is solely that she doesn't have a suicide note written. I'm trying to do new things with her all the time but nothing seems to work.

Please help me save her.
