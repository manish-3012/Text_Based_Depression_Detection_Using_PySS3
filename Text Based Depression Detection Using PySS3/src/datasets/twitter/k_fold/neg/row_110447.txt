Am I the only one who cares too much?Title makes me sound narcissistic, but I have to get this out. The pain is too much to bear.

I've always been too sensitive for my own good. I cry too easily, and I feel emotions which are very, VERY intense. I cry or get amped up and angry when I listen to music or read a book. I have trouble with news of violence and death because I feel very bad. When someone tells me about their problems I tend to have stronger reactions than the person experiencing them. Of course, I keep it in control in public, but sometimes I can't hold it, and I cry like I've never cried before.

I've been with a lot of friends who have had a lot of problems, and I've always been invested in them (so they say), more than the person involved. I've had to go to counseling once because I myself broke down when trying to help a suicidal friend, while he recovered so easily and so fast. Of course, I'm happy for him... But it makes me wonder whether I care too much.

Even when we're a group, when one speaks out about their problems, everyone seems to feign concern, but I always go to the edge of bawling like a kid. Even when no one is bothered about this, not even the person with the problem...

My parents don't like this attitude of mine, so they try to stop me from socialising at times.

Everyone I see is so calm, but they have so many problems. They don't care about their own problems, leave alone those of others. If they are calm, then why am I drowning in their inner storm?

I've already been suicidal from a young age, and this makes it so much worse. I feel the pain of others as my own. Even worse, I can't help people despite this "gift", and it makes me want to die even more. I'm totally useless, good for nothing.

And I can't even die because people will be sad.

If I could just be "lifted" from this world...
