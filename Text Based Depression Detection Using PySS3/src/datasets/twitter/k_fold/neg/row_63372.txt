I just donâ€™t have the strength anymore.Iâ€™ve been on anti psychotic drugs for 8 years and I canâ€™t go on like this anymore. My heart is a twisted mess. I feel so ill. Why isnâ€™t there an easier way to die. I guess God wants us all to live or he wouldnâ€™t of made suicide so difficult. I believe in God and I believe in astrology, the transits of time, so Iâ€™ll hold on for a day when life becomes easier for me, like I know it will get easier for you too.
