My husbandI'm sorry long-term-redditors, I'm a newb and just signed up to post here. =(

I don't know what to do.. I'm in so much pain right now.
Basically my husband and I had an argument about 2 weeks ago..
that our life-work balance isn't right and he feels that work is too important for me.
Today I couldn't meet him for lunch (and yes, it's my fault... 
although the nature of my work is very strict 
I could have argued with my boss,
but I am too weak to tell my boss I'll leave for half an hour..
i can't stand up to people or shout to get my point across).

Got home from work an hour ago. 
My husband just texted me saying he wont be back for the weekend.
I call him and he says he is disappointed and he doesn't know if he still wants to remain married to me. We are too different and he will think 
about it.

He won't tell me where he'll stay and doesn't know when he'll be back - maybe in a week. 
Maybe. He has his passport I have the keys - "all sorted".

I'm so sad and scared. I don't know what to do. I don't have his parents number. I'm scared he will do anything fatal. 

At the same time I can't take losing him.
My whole world is falling apart. I'm so scared he wont come back or wants divorce.
(We have only been married since March)

I don't know anyone close enough (non of my friends are), to talk to.
My mum is in another country and even so.. I just cant call her.
I feel so ashamed. I'm such a failure.

I have sleeping pills and think I should just knock myself out.
I cant stand being awake. I feel like I can't get through this.
Thank you ='(

Most of all I don't want him to get hurt or hurt him self.
fFeeling so anxious hoping that he is safe.
I love him with all my heart.

I'm sorry this might not be as serious as other problems on here.
I'm sorry. I'm a noob If I postet this in the wrong, please ignore.
