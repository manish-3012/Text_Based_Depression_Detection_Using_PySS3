i was gonna kill myself then i didn't but now i want to againfrom about june to january i was sleeping until five every day, and when i woke up all i could think about was nicotine and overdosing on ambien or oxycontin. for the last four months i've been living at my mom's, trying to work my way into living a normal life again. then i met this girl. it's like, i like her, and she says she likes me, but honestly, i feel like she's just playing me. i text her to hang out and she says maybe (or similar meaningless ambiguous response) but i haven't seen her for awhile and i'm starting to think that "maybe" just means "no, but i don't feel like confronting this situation i have helped create". i guess... i'm not going to kill myself. it just feels nice to say it. thoughts appreciated.
