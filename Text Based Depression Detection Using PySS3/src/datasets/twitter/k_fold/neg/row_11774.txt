I'm so sick of destroying everyone around meMy boyfriend is the most amazing guy in the world. I love him with all my heart. He's always generous and kind, but I'm not. And I always avoid and hurt him when I'm feeling suicidal. It's never his fault. But this darkness inside me is getting to him. I can feel it. He always helps me, but this is just too much for anyone to handle. I get it. I haven't been myself lately either. I feel like I can't control myself. I snap at people. I'm rude. I don't want to, but it just happens. I wish there was a way I could just go away without hurting the few people who still love me. It's not even that I don't think I can change, I just don't think it's worth it. I'm a recent grad, have always been an overachiever but there's just nothing else I want to do in this world. 

Also, I have no one else to talk to, so here I am. Thank you for providing a space for people like me to vent.
