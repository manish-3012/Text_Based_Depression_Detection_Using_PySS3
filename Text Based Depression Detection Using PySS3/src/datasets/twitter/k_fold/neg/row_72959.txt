Golden Gate Bridge or Shooting Range?I canâ€™t get a gun because Iâ€™ve been involuntarily hospitalized before, so it comes down to these two.

1, travel to SF for the bridge &amp; jump
2. Build rapport with a range, learn about guns, &amp; go regularly until I get the hang of it. 

Which would be more successful? Both has its pros and cons. Bridge may result in drowning death if the impact doesnâ€™t kill, and range may go bad if I miss my brainstem. 

Any insight is appreciated.
