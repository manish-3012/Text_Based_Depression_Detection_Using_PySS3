Former suicidal peep looking for genuine help.So I found myself here following someone who reached out on a local reddit. Yes, a little stalkerish, Iâ€™m sorry. What a perfect community to ask what it is you think would help if someone was to reach out? Please feel safe and unjudged, I have been there. One size does not fit all! 
Keep fighting the fight, it can be so worth it! (Some days are still absolutely shite!, but I see them as that now, just shite days)
