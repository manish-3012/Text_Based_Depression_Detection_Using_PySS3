I want to kill myself but I'm here...I have an apartment that only costs 120 $ monthly but I can't afford it. I starve daily, work a job 12+ hours. Was kicked out of older jobs because I'm 17. Now I just work in a cafe. I'm sick of life. Have no family. No dad. My friends think they should help with money but I reject. I am tired. I am sick of life. BUT IM AFRAID TO DIE. IM HOPING THERES ANOTHER WAY. IF THERES ANYONE OUT THERE PLEASE TELL ME IF THERE IS A WAY. I am desperately asking for something I can't find. All my skills are useless where I live.
