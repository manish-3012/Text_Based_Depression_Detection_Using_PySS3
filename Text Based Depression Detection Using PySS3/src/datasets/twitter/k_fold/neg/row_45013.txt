I feel like running away from everythingI am serious. I think Iâ€™m gonna go for a walk in the middle of the night while my parents are asleep and never come back. I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™d go, I just want to walk away from everything and disappear. Maybe youâ€™re going to see a missing person poster with my picture and name in a day or two.
