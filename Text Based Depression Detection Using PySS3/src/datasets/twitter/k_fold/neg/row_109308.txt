Being a suicidal single mom fucking sucksIâ€™m back in this dark hole that I keep ending up in and I hate it. 

I hate it because I want to die and I canâ€™t because I couldnâ€™t do that to my son. I would feel bad for doing it in general but he makes it so I just absolutely can not bring myself to do it. I love him so much, he is my entire reason for living. 

People say I should live for myself because I have my whole life ahead of me but I donâ€™t even care about that. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m cut out for life. Iâ€™m weak and emotional and too soft for this world. 

I keep taking my sons father back because I love him so much as well. They are my happiness. He always leaves me or I get worn down by his emotional invalidation and leave him but Iâ€™m the only one left hurting. I know Iâ€™m stupid for repeating this cycle and this only makes me feel more worthless and self loathing but god damn it.. I just want my family back together again. Heâ€™s always okay though, no matter how hard I try or how much of myself I give to him Iâ€™m nothing worth looking back at. This makes me feel like Iâ€™m unlovable, like Iâ€™ll never be enough. 

Iâ€™m lonely. I have loving friends that I donâ€™t even feel that I deserve because their attempts to comfort me do nearly nothing. Iâ€™ve given up on dating because nobody feels as good to be with as my ex (when things are good, that is) and Iâ€™m tired of lying to myself and saying Iâ€™ve moved on. I always end up dating somebody, realizing I just want my ex, and then breaking their heart. I donâ€™t want to keep doing that to people and I havenâ€™t met anybody that really interested me in over two years anyways. 

Iâ€™d like to include that this isnâ€™t my constant obsession, the loneliness that is. Iâ€™m actually more of an introvert. I have hobbies and dreams and goals for my future. I try so hard to take care of myself and keep myself out of this hole I keep falling in but every time I end up back here it makes me feel more helpless. Like, will I ever just be strong like everyone else? Why is it so hard for me to keep my serotonin from being depleted? 

Itâ€™s been a couple years since Iâ€™ve felt this low. I thought I was past this, I thought I had figure it out and I was better. Iâ€™m even going to school for psychology because I want to help people like my find healthy, non prescription alternatives to a better state of mind. Now that Iâ€™m back here I question if Iâ€™m even good enough to do that. 


To anybody that reads this, thank you. I guess I just needed a place to get this all out where people might understand what itâ€™s like. I feel like a slave to depression and I just want to feel like Iâ€™m in control of my emotions again.
