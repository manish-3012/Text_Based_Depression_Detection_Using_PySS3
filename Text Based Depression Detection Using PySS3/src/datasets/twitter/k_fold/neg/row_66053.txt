Suicidal everydayEvery single day seems is the same, mundane day and I'm sick of existing. Once I wake up, I think about dying. I can't sit in silence without thinking about death. Once I'm not occupied with a distraction like video games or talking with friends, I immediately think about mortality. It's so mentally exhausting to be like this and it's overwhelmingly difficult to even do homework because of my mind preoccupied with constant graphic imagery of the different ways I can kill myself.

But I'm scared to die and that frustrates me because I want to end my life without any second thoughts. That would be so much easier for me and everyone. Also, it's not like it's going to get better for me.
