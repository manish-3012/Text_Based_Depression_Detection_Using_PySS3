I might kill myself if I fail UniversityI have 3 exams in 20 days. My depression is fucking killing me and fucking up my work ethic. Please don't tell me that university isn't the only path to success or such...I've tried so many jobs and career fields and this is the one I love the most. If I can't make it I will slit my own wrists.
