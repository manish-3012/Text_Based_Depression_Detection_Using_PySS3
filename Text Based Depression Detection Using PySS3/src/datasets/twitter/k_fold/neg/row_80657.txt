Trying this againI have tried everything to stop my suicidal thoughts and impulses. I tried killing myself, intensive therapy, medication, self harm, drinking, drugs, mindfulness, meditations. (All at different points). Nothing worked.

I am trying an active, healthy lifestyle. I am really trying. I only started a few days ago but iâ€™m exercising and eating well. I am going to try and do this everyday (excluding rest days) and hope that this works. So far i still feel like absolute shit.

I am running out of hope, I pray this works. I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore.
