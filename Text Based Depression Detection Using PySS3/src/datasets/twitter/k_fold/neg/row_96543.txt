I can't do this shitI just want to be done. I feel alone, tired, worthless, and trapped. I am constantly haunted by my failures everywhere I go, whether it be the girls I liked, the pets I've owned and couldn't keep alive, or the friends I thought I made.

All I see is failure. And to be honest, I probably deserve it. But I don't see trying getting me anywhere. It won't find me love. It won't bring Spyro back. It won't help me find sincere friends. And even if it did, I'm still tired 

I. Just. Want. To. Die.

I know none of you all will tell me a method because it's against the sub rules, but I just want a way out. I shouldn't, I should try and stick around for my remaining pets and family, but I just don't want to. Even still breathing is exhausting, I can't escape mind.

I want to not exist. This life was not made for me, it was made for people who know how to live.
