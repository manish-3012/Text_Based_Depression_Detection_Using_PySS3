I want to live for another week maybe two, but not any longer than absolutely necessaryThere is only one thing in my life that isn't meaningless or terrible, my girlfriend. We are in a serious long distance relationship since a little more than one year, but we have never seen each other in person. I literally fuck up everything in my life. My contact with her started out very casual and I made some terrible mistakes. Mistakes that I probably won't be able to fix and that she won't be able to forgive me for. She doesn't know about any of them, but I have to tell her if I want there to be any chance of us actually being together.

I hate practically everything about my life and myself. I have very seriously considered killing myself for the last few months since I just keep becoming more and more depressed.

My possible life with her is the only thing I have to look forward to. I think I will be able to survive until I can get professional help if she does forgive me, but she probably won't. 

I obviously can't tell her that. I can't risk causing her to think I committed suicide. She doesn't know anyone who lives close to me, so all I have to do is stick around a little after it's clear that there is no way that she can forgive me to avoid that risk. I am not sure if I can do that completely on my own ...
