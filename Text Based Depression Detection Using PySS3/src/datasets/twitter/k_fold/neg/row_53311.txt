Is it normal?I have noticed that I'm the person who always get asked when others need help, and others are asked far less than me.

I have a theory... And it says that, once people see you as a general provider, they won't see you as a potential friend, but instead, just a classmate.

If I were to stop sending links to people, helping them with their homework I would be free of the people pleasing curse... But at exchange, they could hate me, making my depression even worse than usual...
