I'm 29 and my father still tries to control every aspect of my life.The only thing he cares about is money. Greedy son of a bitch. He tries to control what I do for work based on what makes the most money. Not what I want to do with my life. I haven't gotten anywhere career wise because he becomes a roadblock every time I get traction with something enjoyable.

I decided to sell my house and move away, but he snuck the house into his name, and his compensation for that is that he will dictate every aspect of the new house I get so it's "a financially sound investment". I don't want an investment, I want a fucking home.

The reason I want to kill myself is because he controls my life. He cannot control my death.
