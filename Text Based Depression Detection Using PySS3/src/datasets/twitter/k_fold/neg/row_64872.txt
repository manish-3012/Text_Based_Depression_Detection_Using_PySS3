Leaving as few problems as possibleI've been thinking about what would happen after I went like what problems that I have would be left for my family to deal with. I want to make it at as few as possible but I am trying to hurry things along. I'm pretty positive that the credit card debt I have will become their problem so I know I should take care of that. Outside of that though, I don't really provide much for them but I am on the lease and the power and internet is in my name. Should I just leave the account info for them to have so they can switch to a different person when they're ready to? I don't have anything else to my name like I don't have a car and we all rent an apartment together and stuff. I don't owe any student loans since I never went to school so I don't think the government will come after them. If I pay off my credit card debt, leave the important account information for them, and close everything else, will they mostly be free of having to deal with things that I should have? Or do I even have to do that?
