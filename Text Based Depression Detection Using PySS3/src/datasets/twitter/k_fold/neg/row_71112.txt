There's not a single human being in this whole world who wants me, so why shouldn't I do it?I'm an ugly girl and I'm also broke and perpetually sad. I try hard to be kind, but that's the bare minimum so I don't expect anything. It's tough going through life knowing that you'll never be loved. It hurts a lot. All I do is lie in bed and cry most days. 

I don't have any reasons not to do it.
