Moar updates, and  a thank youSup /r/sw. Just wanted to say that I feel a bit better today. I realize that in certain situations, I tend to blow things out of proportion, in my head. There are certain things that people do that trigger me, and when that happens if I don't stop myself I can end up spiraling pretty badly. I realized in my last therapy session that often my reactions to things are more because I am triggered and less because of the actual thing that was said or done.

Anyway, I've been posting a lot lately, and I've gotten some really kind responses from people, so I also wanted to say thank you. I may not be very good at accepting help in the moment, but believe me that doesn't mean I don't appreciate it.
