Really tired of myself and life at this pointI am just straight up tired with myself and just life in general. I'm 19 years old but it already feels like I got nothing to lose, I fuck up everything I come in contact with. When someone reaches out to me I just hurt them even though I would never mean to. My emotions just go up and down, up and down and it is getting really hard to deal with it. if something good happens it's almost like a switch flips on and I'm depressed, just like that. And I just low key begin to get so frustrated by it, I feels like I just can't enjoy life. I just want to stay in my room and sleep forever so I feel nothing and won't be a bother to anyone. Sometimes I think I'm better off dead tbh. I'm trying to hold on but man, it is ever so difficult and I don't see this ending any time soon. Fuck everything
