It doesn't seem like there is any reason to be alive.Being alive just feels more trouble than it is worth.  I think that if wasn't around anymore it'd be better for everybody.  Sure it may cause some people pain for a while but I think that me being around will cause more pain in the long run.  Who wants to be around somebody who is miserable?  Who wants to feel like they can't help their child/sibling/partner?  It must be horrible and if I wasn't around those feelings would eventually go away.  These feelings come and go but each time they come back it feels worse and I just think that one day I won't be able to deal with feeling like this anymore.
