I'm probably going to get a lot of hate for thisbut can we stop romanticizing suicide here?

All I see posts that say "I feel suicidal" and comments that go "I feel you. Me too. I might end my life soon"

I don't understand how that helps anybody. Knowing someone else feels that suicide is an ACTUAL option, and constantly hearing people justify it in this subreddit will do nothing but encourage you to kill yourself.

It used to be that this subreddit had people who were actively watching out for others who seemed to be suicidal, and providing genuine advice, now it seems that if you are suicidal and you're on this subreddit, there's no worse place to be.
