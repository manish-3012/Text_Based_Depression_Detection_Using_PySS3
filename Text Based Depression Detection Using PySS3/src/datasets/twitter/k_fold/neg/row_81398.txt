I need a distractionIâ€™m crawling out of my skin. Iâ€™m sad and way too awake and having a (mostly rare) reaction to Xanax where itâ€™s amplifying anxiety, it feels like. I want to be 17 again so I can sneak out of home and do a drugs and fuck and blow off stream and none of it really mattered. I didnâ€™t agree to any of this....life....; get it?
Feels like Iâ€™m trying to play a video game I suck at, just have no excuse for even trying to playing lol
