Question for christiansI am curious to whether there is any verses that specifically say that we will go to hell if we commit suicide. I dont think Jesus would cast us to hell for a sin, since he kinda died on the cross to cover those. I kind of already have my answer but I am just curious as to your thoughts before I end my time slot in this miserable world. And be able to finally be happy, worshiping Him everyday for eternity.
