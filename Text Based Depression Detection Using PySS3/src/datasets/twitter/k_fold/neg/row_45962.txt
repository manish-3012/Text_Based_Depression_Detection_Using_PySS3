I'm lostI'm 15 F and I have no friends, not even one person I'm a bit close to (except my family, but I'm not really close to anyone here either) and I feel like I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my life. When I'm surrounded with other people at school I feel like I'm just being awkward, not talking to anyone, and even if someone talks to me I just wanna be alone because I'm afraid my awkwardness will mess up all my interactions. Sometimes the only two solutions I see are either totally isolating myself from the society or suicide. But I know I don't wanna die I just want a solution to my problems.
