I've wanted to kill myself recentlyI met the love of my life 4 years ago roughly and recently we got distant and I told her I don't love her anymore I don't know why this happened to me but I've always been scared at the thought of suicide but now it's just a thing I'm trying to figure a way to let my family be happy about the life I lived I've felt empty recently but once I dropped things off I felt even more empty and I feel like a fuckboy because I liked another person when I thought I loved her and I am not mentally alright but I'm not sure if I should kill myself or not thank you for reading it probably doesent make sense and I don't know if this is the right sub but sorry for wasting time out of your day.
