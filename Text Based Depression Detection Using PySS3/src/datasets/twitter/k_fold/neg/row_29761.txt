Really not sure what to do? /:I genuinely want to die, most of the time.  


but that qualifier is there. MOST of the time. SOME of the time, my life is fun. I like when my friends have a good time. I like when I make people smile with what I do (music). I like teaching. Etc etc.  


Idk. I'm so confused. I have come so close to doing \*something\* at some various points  before. I'm not seeking attention. Honest. I'm just confused. I don't like life. I don't like ME. But I am all I know. I love all I know, but I HATE "me...."
