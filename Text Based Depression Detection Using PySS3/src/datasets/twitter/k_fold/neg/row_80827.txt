Nothing to live forI honestly can't remember a time when I thought my life was worth living. I remember thinking when I was younger all I wanted to do when I grew up was move far away from everyone else, then I remember when I first thought about killing myself around age 9. Nothing since then has made me think life's worth living. I've had 2 relationships, ever since the first one ended I've never stopped wanting to die. My life now is just work and come home, go to bed and do it again, at weekends I don't leave the house except to buy food. I have no friends and I know I'll never find a woman who wants to be with me, the vast majority would balk at being with a man like me, and I can barely function socially at all, let alone make a woman think I'm sexy, or a good partner, they have so many options nowadays there's no way they'd legitemately pick someone like me.
