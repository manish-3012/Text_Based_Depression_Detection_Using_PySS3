My lifePeople will find this very weird but I really dont care. I have nothing to live for in my life I hate school I hate my family my dad is an addict that us always gone (luckily) but when he is here all he does is yell scream and threaten us. My only "friend" is a dick to me all the time so I never talk to him and my moms gets mad at me for being "reclusive" if I could I would lay in my room all day and listen to music. 1 of the 2 things that keeps me going music and my cousin my cousin is the only person is my life that genuinely cares about me but she lives 5 hours away from me and I dont get to see her much. I am a freshman in highschool and when people tell me to think about my future the only thing I can think of is suicide. I dought I will live past my birthday (may 13th) the last thing I want to do is tell my cousin I love her and I'm sorry. I want to see her 1 last time before I go. I just want to run off into nature and die nothing else just nature and music I want it to be painless but I dont know how I will do that it will all be over eventually I guess
