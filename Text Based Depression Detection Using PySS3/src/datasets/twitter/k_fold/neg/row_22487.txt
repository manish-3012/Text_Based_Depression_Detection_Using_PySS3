how I wish I were dead.This is a grand waste. The only thing that could make me feel better is cash. I'm unemployed, super depressed, health issues, lonlieness, etc. I hate living. Hate it absolutely through and through. I'll be so glad when I'm gone. I can't believe how long life lasts, does it ever end, or just seem to go on for ever?
Planet earth is a hellhole, polluted, expensive, mean-ass shitty fucking planet that's getting worse by the day. I feel sorry for me and every one else on it, especially young people that will have to deal with the fallout from the greed of rampant capitalism.  I feel so sorry for children. Imagine how shitty this planet will be when they get old. Not only should I be dead, but mother earth would be so much better off if all us idiot polluting humans were six feet under, then we could nourish the earth instead of raping it.
