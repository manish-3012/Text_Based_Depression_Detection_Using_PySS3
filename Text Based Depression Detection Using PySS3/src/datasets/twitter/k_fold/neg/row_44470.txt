I Feel So AloneMy anxiety and depression are out of hand again. I know I have some beautiful pets and an amazing boyfriend, but I feel so alone. Besides them, I have nobody. No friends. My family is so out of touch with me. My mental health has been spiraling but I dont want to tell my boyfriend. I'm too scared. I find myself thinking about killing myself, but I dont want to. I dont know what to do.
