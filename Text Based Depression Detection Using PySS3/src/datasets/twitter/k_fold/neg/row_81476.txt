how do i fix my life? im so lonely.ever since quarantine started i've been so alone. the last time i talked to one of my friends face to face was in May for my birthday and that was a brief 3 minutes, she only came to drop off a gift. then in june i graduated high school and celebrated it with no one because no one cares to hang out with me, and ever since then i've had zero human contact aside from people on the internet and talking to my mom. 

i don't have a car (or a license lol) so im stuck at home and there's literally nothing to do here. i'm not currently attending college and i don't know when i'll ever get the motivation to apply. as for jobs i don't know what places would even hire a high school graduate with no experience and severe social anxiety.

i tried getting a therapist to see if that would help motivate me to get my life going and it didn't really help. phone call therapy sucks. i even tried taking antidepressant meds too and my body had such a horrible reaction to it, i got a ton of symptoms and i almost passed out from what the meds were doing to my body.

i just don't know what to do, i feel like shit all the time and i don't really think the life im in now is worth living. aside from my loneliness i'm insecure about EVERYTHING, and every single fucking thing in my life makes me anxious. if i find something that genuinely makes me happy my brain finds a way to make me anxious about it and hate it. i hate my life.
