I don't know how to last another week.I don't want to give intricate details, so I'll be brief:

* Right now, I could disappear and absolutely nobody would notice. Not an obvious suicide, necessarily, but if I smashed my phone and left the country without any notice, nobody, not "friends" who treat me like shit, not family who doesn't love me back, *nobody*, would notice.
* Every single day feels like the life is being drained out of me. School is shit. Everything I do outside of school is shit, even stuff I used to love. I can't find anything that makes me happy. Hell, even stuff I still love makes me feel like crap cause my "friends" make fun of me for not being good enough at it or too broke to buy better equipment.
* I'm so emotionally damaged from the various relationships I've had and the meaningless hookups that I can't imagine ever trusting someone ever again. I wouldn't know how.
* I've struggled with suicide in the past since I have bipolar disorder, but so that I don't feel like I'm being a burden to everyone around me, I say that I've overcome it and that I'm not suicidal anymore, and for a good while, I actually wasn't. That is a lie now. Every single day, I have to pretend like I'm fine when I am absolutely fucking not. If I ever told any of my friends, they would call me a fucking pussy, or a bitch, or a faggot, or something else like that.

I live for the weekend so that I can sleep in long enough to the point where it feels just a little bit like death.

i don't even care what advice you give at this point, honestly. i just want another human being to hear me.
