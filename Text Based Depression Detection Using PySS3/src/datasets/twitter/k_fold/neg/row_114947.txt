I'm well off, moving into a new rental and taking a break from work. So why the hell do I go to sleep every night with thoughts of self mutilation and suicide?I wouldn't say the title is quite correct. I put pressure on myself to do the right thing given a context, and be a better person. And when I fail, holy crap it hits hard. Today I had an appointment to pass my motorbike theory and I turned up at the wrong centre. No problem. Re-book right? Sure thing. But the whole way back I was thinking along the lines of "What's the fucking use. Exit bag time". 

Now, at the moment it's relatively easy to dispel this thought after a bit of moping (I might be understating that). Why am I posting here then? Because this is happening more and more often. With errors which have smaller negative consequences. Fucked up a cup of tea? Yep, end it all. And I'd rather understand what's happening before the emotion of the suggestion becomes so strong that I take action. 

Now this particular train of thought happens when I perceive I've done something wrong. At least this is rooted in something real and can be fixed with a change in attitude. Not that I know _how_ to go about doing that. 

The more worrying aspect is a particular thought that pops up perhaps 5 or 6 times a week. Just a random "Cut your genitals off!" More of an impression than words. This isn't rooted in anything real and has no relation to what I'm doing at the time. And this _has_ been occurring more recently as well. 

The important thing here is that I don't identify at all with these thoughts. I'm a reasonably well balanced individual with a culturally varied background and I think that I'm a likeable person. I _like_ me too!

Why am I posting here? I've stopped in every now and then and it seems to me that you guys are the community that may have some of the methods for getting out the hole learned the hard way. Let me know if I should post somewhere else.
