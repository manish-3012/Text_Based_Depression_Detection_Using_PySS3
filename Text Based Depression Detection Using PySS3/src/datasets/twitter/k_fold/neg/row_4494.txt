Stop me if you think that you've heard this one _x000D_
before.Right now, I'm trying to decide how I feel.  
Either I need to check myself into a mental health care facility ASAP, or I need to go somewhere private and secluded and opt out completely, or I'm pathetic and scared and lazy and I need to shut up and get over it and go stretch a smile on and go eat with other people and then hold the smile in place for Black Friday.  
I don't want to be here right now.  I haven't wanted to be "here" for a while, but right now my fight or flight response is kicking in and I think I may do something severe.  I should have just quit, either last Friday or today, but I backed down, despite the hundreds of subvocal rehearsals I've done.  I just CAN'T DEAL WITH PEOPLE.  I don't want to go out at all tomorrow, and I sure as hell don't want to be in a store on Friday.  Maybe I should just carry a razorblade in my jeans so that when I reach the boiling point I can just slip it out and open my forearms right there.  I wish I had some whiskey...I think I have some Everclear left in the fridge.  I haven't even spoken to my family in two or three weeks...I can't remember.  I know I'm not alone, I just don't feel like anyone can really help me.

ADDENDUM:  I didn't go out for Thanksgiving.  My partner was understanding, even though he wanted me to be with him.  I microwaved something and then slept most of the day.  My sister called to see how I was doing...both she and my mother said that I sounded funny and kept asking if I was OK.  My mother is on oxygen and kept saying she wants to see me.
