I just want to feel happy for once in my lifeI don't know what to say but my life is and feels like crap i have rarely ever felt happiness in my life but when i do it only lasts for a few seconds. Today it just got worse and i got in a crash and now the feeling just is there now i don't know what to do anymore i really just want to feel something other than sadness
