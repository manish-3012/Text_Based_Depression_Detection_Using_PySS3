Good byeI think it's time to end it. I'm not looking for advice or help or whatever I just need to get these feelings out before I do. I cant live like this anymore, due to covid I lost my apartment and job, very prior to that I hit rock bottom drinking and wrecked my car, on top of that my ex fiance (whom I am still very in love with) started fucking the guy I thought was my best friend. I truly feel like I have no one, and I'm not happy or complacent at the least, unless I am Intoxicated, and that's no way to live. I'm ready
