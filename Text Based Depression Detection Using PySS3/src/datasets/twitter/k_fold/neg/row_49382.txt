I suppose itâ€™s meant to beToday I asked X out. I know, big step forward. But, it feels that whenever I take a step forward, iâ€™m forced to take three steps back mentally. I asked her on a date- â€˜It: Chapter 2â€™. She loves horror films. She declined, and said we should go in a group. Thatâ€™s a smart way of rejection, to be honest. Very courteous. Sheâ€™s probably had experience in letting people down gently, pretty girl that she is. I know other people have fancied her, so maybe she has used those lines before.

Of course, with the rejection, comes my inevitable defence mechanism- dislike. I already think like that in parts. â€˜She detests me, thinks sheâ€™s too cool, thinks Iâ€™m not as special as herâ€™. Itâ€™s ridiculous; what a difference a day makes, eh? Iâ€™m determined not to let it get as bad as it was with Y. I completely cut her out of my life, leaving her friendless. 

Maybe Iâ€™m just not meant to date. Maybe thatâ€™s the way Iâ€™ve been made, poisonous to the touch, and ultimately unlikable to warn people off. Maybe I should just fuck around. Iâ€™m adamant that Iâ€™d be useable, if thatâ€™s all.

So itâ€™s at least nice to have closure, know that Xâ€™s not interested after months of (one-sided) pining. I modelled a personality that I thought sheâ€™d like, dammit! Watched her shows, her movies, listened to her music. Itâ€™s despicable how obsessed I became. And now thereâ€™s just a void until I latch onto the next person. Itâ€™s positively parasitic. Iâ€™m like a ghost that has to possess a living person, no power or face of my own. Poor me. Poor X.

I fit everything she did to my own narrative. I read so much into all those little â€˜signsâ€™. I feel pathetic. I am pathetic.
