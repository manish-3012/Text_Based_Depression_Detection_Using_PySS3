The letter I wish I was brave enough to send my loved onesIâ€™m going to kill myself after work tonight. Iâ€™ve been preparing my letter for a week now, but I canâ€™t bring myself to send it, so Iâ€™m dropping it here. Not sure what compelled me to. Maybe itâ€™s one last cry for help. 

Dear Mum, Dad, and everyone. 

Iâ€™m sorry that I killed myself. Iâ€™m sorry if you start to feel like this is your fault. I wish I could say something to take away the pain, but I know thatâ€™s likely impossible for you right now. In this letter, I want to say why it happened, because I lived so long in silent suffering. 

Iâ€™ve killed myself because I have nothing. Everything has been stolen from me. 

Depression stole my relationship with you guys from me. I remember how much fun my mates and I used to have, and now look at how it was in the end. I was too broken to even speak. I didnâ€™t have any self esteem whatsoever and I could see how my silence weighed us down. You deserved better. 

My job stole my dignity. I couldnâ€™t support myself when they cut my hours, but honestly that feels like my fault for being autistic and unable to adapt to regular work. Now what do I do, I spend my time doing sex work. I should have worked harder at fixing myself but I didnâ€™t. 

I guess I just wish I could have said all of this when I was alive. I wish I could admit it, and I hope hearing it provides at least some context for why I did what I did. Never in my life did I want to be diagnosed with autism, or be a prostitute, or lose my connection with those I love, but it happened to me. It happened and it was fair. I couldnâ€™t take looking at myself in the mirror and I couldnâ€™t stand therapy. How does a girl like me stand in the mirror and say affirmations to myself? How can I do the things that I do and tell myself Iâ€™m worth it? 

I canâ€™t, I couldnâ€™t. 

I love you guys. You kept me here for as long as I could stand it. But Iâ€™m the end, seeing how my depression was hurting you was enough to make me realise there was no hope for me. Iâ€™m just sorry I couldnâ€™t have done more to help you all .

Love, 



Thatâ€™s it Iâ€™m sorry if this is a bannable post. I guess Iâ€™m just lost and was using a default for one final push for guidance
