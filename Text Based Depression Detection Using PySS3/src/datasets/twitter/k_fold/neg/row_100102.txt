I feel like my life is not worth livingNow, before I say anything, I know I might sound egotistic. I try not to be that way, but some things I just do/say without realizing it. Also, I am not suicidal, at least not yet. To start, I see all these successful people around the world. Whether that success is due to good looks, athleticism, inherited wealth, or etc, I just cannot stand the fact that those people get to live wonderful lives and I cannot. I just cannot stand it. Beautiful girlfriends, mansions, million-dollar salaries. What did they do to get all those, and what did I do to not get there? I am particularly jealous of athletes. Yes, I am envious and jealous. People might say those athletes got to where they are by working hard with a lot of sacrifices made. But look, those people did not get there entirely on their own. A 5-year old kid did not just suddenly pick up a hockey stick or a soccer ball and started playing. It was their parents who made them do it. Most famous athletes come from an athletes' family. Steph Curry's dad was an NBA player. Kobe Bryant's dad was an NBA player. The media make it look like they got to where they are on their own through hard work and dedication. No, it was hard work, dedication, PLUS resources to having elite coaches since young, nutritional help, genetics, and etc. (Now I am not saying that there are no successful people who really started from the bottom, and I really respect their hustle and determination) In conclusion, I just think I cannot ever be happy knowing that there are people living like that on the other side of the fence. Therefore, I feel like my life is not worth living.
