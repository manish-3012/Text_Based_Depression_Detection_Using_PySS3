My life is just one sick joke and I canâ€™t keep going.Where to begin? 5 months ago the love of my life left me. She left me a month before our wedding. My mom spent a bunch of money on wedding deposits. She was engaged to my future step dad and they planned on having their wedding a little after my wedding. 

Well get this sick joke, because my mom didnâ€™t want to lose out on $3000 spent in wedding deposits so she and my step dad got married at the place I was supposed to have my wedding at! Imagine having to watch someone you love get married at the place you were supposed too and being reminded what you lost. 

Meanwhile my ex fiancÃ©e ran off and started a new life without me. She didnâ€™t even give me a reason why she left me. I donâ€™t even remember the day she broke up with me because it was so traumatic. Iâ€™m still heartbroken and I feel like Iâ€™ll never find love again. 

I had to move back home because I couldnâ€™t afford to live on my own. I still canâ€™t find a place to live no matter how hard I try. 

Iâ€™m failing my classes in school. 

I went out on a date last night and it was a fucking disaster. My date bailed and I was later sexually assaulted by someone at a bar. 

People keep telling me it gets better but does it really get better? Do we just tell ourselves this because we all know life fucking sucks, itâ€™s a fucking joke and we know deep down itâ€™s never going to get better. 

Iâ€™m done fighting, I canâ€™t keep going. Life isnâ€™t going to get any better and Iâ€™m ready to end it all. All I feel is pain and I just want it to end. We all die in the end anyways so why does it matter? Iâ€™ll just be another number and forgotten about.
