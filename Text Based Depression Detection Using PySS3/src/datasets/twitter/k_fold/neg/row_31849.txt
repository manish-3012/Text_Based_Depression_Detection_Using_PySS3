I think its time to take that last long walk into the desert.Hello all,
I am at my end. This past weekend, I was going through my stacks of copied Job applications (I copy or print out everyone I do) and realized I have applied for 226 (I counted) jobs in the last 18 months without ever hearing back from one of them (despite repeated attempts at calling them and sending emails to HR departments). Friday while filling out an app at a local fast food chain (which will remain nameless to avoid any possible legal problems, but it rhymes with bubway) I was given an impromptu interview, and 90 seconds in the manager looks at me, asks if I'm for real, and basically tells me I'm Unemployable?!? I do find this hard to believe but after so much time of nothing I'm feeling that my time is over. 
I guess I should give a little information about myself now, I'm an overweight male in my later mid 30's, with little family (no wife, girlfriend or kids I'm one of the ForeverAlone) no real friends, I have a Bachelors in Information technology, I am signed up with every possible job service I can find and have been for 18 months now (6 different temp agency's that I call 3 times per week and stop by once per week, and the state employment office that I visit 2 or 3 times a week) I'm living off credit cards, have $50,000 in unpaid student loans (in deferment). 
I don't see a way out...I'm at my end...I don't know what to do anymore...I am starting to want to take that last long walk into the desert and make my peace with this shithole world...I'm afraid...Help.
