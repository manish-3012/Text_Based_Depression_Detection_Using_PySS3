I just want someone to be there with me...Title pretty much says it all. I've tried killing myself a few times recently. One time resulted in me being hospitalized, but even when I thought things would get better, they didn't. So, I'm here looking for another way out. I don't really care if it's painful anymore, I just want someone to hold or talk to me while I go.
