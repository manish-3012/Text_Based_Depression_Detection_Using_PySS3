I don't wanna hurt my family, I don't want to go to a hospital, I don't wanna live anymore.I was diagnosed with MDD and for the past month almost all my thoughts have either been self hating or planning/ talking myself into my suicide. My family knows hardly anything about my troubles, I am very good at keeping things to myself through years of experience. Imagine if your 20 year old came and told you "i've been suicidal for almost a decade, have more than a dozen attempts, and MDD?" it would be truly heart breaking. it would almost come out of nowhere to them. Sometimes I think the truth may be better hidden. 
 
I don't think I can live a decent life. I am not capable of it. I hurt people without realizing it. How can I be a good person? I think one of the most important things in life is human connections but what if you have trouble making them?

Please someone help, I am very much on the edge. I would appreciate an older parent's perspective on all of this
