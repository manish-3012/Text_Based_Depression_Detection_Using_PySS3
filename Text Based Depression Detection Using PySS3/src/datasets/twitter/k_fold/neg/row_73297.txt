My sister is unintentionally driving me to my suicide and I don't know how to cope with it.So for some background, I suffer from MDD w/ Psychotic Features, GAD(OCD and PTSD included), and have also suffered from an eating disorder my entire life. I'm currently on 300 mg of Welbutron and 225 mg of Zoloft, but I haven't taken my meds in a bit since I've been out and the request at the pharmacy to my perscriber still hasn't gone through. But that is besides the point. The main reason I'm writing this is because of me and my sisters relationship. Today I lost my job due to my attendance being so bad from depression and anxiety, and since I'm sleeping on the couch in my sisters place she was not happy at the fact I got fired. At all. We screamed and fought and told me to leave the house and go out and apply for new jobs and I couldn't come back until later that night. I sat in my car and cried and cried and cried until my sister came out and told me to go to our dads for the night. Its where im at now. But the main reason why shes unintentionally driving me to suicide is the only way she knows how to react is with anger. We grew up in a violent household so anger is the only way she knows how to cope with anything. I'm the exact opposite, Im an extreme pacifist. I hate fighting. She doesnt care to fight. We fight often and in all of our fights I always want to kill myself when its done and over with. I hate being like this because shes letting me live with her rent free and all Im doing is stressing her out and she doesnt deserve it. She deserves to be happy. I want to be happy and energetic and skinny and have fun but Im not. I hate everything and everyone. I dont want to be like this anymore.
