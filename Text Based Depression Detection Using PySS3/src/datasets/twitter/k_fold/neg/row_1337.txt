My future is just going to be horribleI'm going to post this on my slt since I dont want my friend to know I'm suicidal. But anyways I'm a jehovah's witness and well I don't really enjoy it. Like I dont believe in it at all and most people know what happens if you leave. Well if you leave everyone you know in the religion, including your family, are not supposed to talk to you anymore. Well me being born into this religion I didnt have much of a choice when it comes to being apart of it.
 So I plan to leave it when I'm old enough to go and live out on my own. But I dont want to be lonely, I would never be able to talk to my family ever again practically. And if they were to try and reach out to me then they could get in trouble to. So I have 3 choices with my life. 
1, either I stay and just suffer my whole life having to deal with this religion until my parents were to die. 
2, leave the religion and my family as soon as I can have my own living arrangements and a steady job setup and have to put up with never being able to tall to my family ever again.
3, just killing myself would be the easiest way out. I've already done so many stupid things throughout my life and my parents can already tell I'm not doing that good in this religion. So if I were to end it all I wouldnt have to deal with either being with any family at all or dealing with this religion still.

I dont know anyone else to talk to about these things since I dont really have any friends since I moved in the summer and I wouldn't be able to say any of these things to someone in my religion so thank you for reading this.
