Want to kill myself because I wasn't born rich.I don't want to work, I'm so angry and envious towards trust fund babies. I just don't want to do the 9-5 struggle for the next 40 years just to barely be able to afford to stay alive. If I just don't like the life I was given, why shouldn't I just opt out?
