I can't even kill myselfI came to the realization that I can't even kill myself. It was the last choice that I thought I had left, but I can't even choose that. I have all these people that depend on me. It wasn't my choice to be in this position. I didn't create this family that all need me. I love my nephews, mother, and sister. But I am starting to hate them. They need me for their home and food and transportation. Every facet of all these lives on my shoulders. I tried to be the father they needed after theirs abandoned them. I'm realizing that I will NEVER live my own life. And now ai cant even end my life, because no one would care for them. My Father told me recently that the best thing I could ever do for the world would be to kill myself. I wish I could make him eat those words.
I have been sexually, physically, and emotionally abused my whole life. The only woman I ever loved cheated on me with my best friend. Everyone who didn't need me has left. And if I didn't bring home the money, I'd be dropped like a hot potato. Idk what to do. I'm stuck and I'll die in this awful home.
