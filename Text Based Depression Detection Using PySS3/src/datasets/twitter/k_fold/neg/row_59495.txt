I donâ€™t think I have much longerIâ€™m almost 26, and I feel like Iâ€™m just done. I donâ€™t have any affection in my life. Iâ€™ve tried so hard to date, so hard to meet people, to be someone that someone wants to be with, but it never works out. I was recently seeing a girl that Iâ€™m ecstatic about, she wanted to date me, I was afraid of being hurt and expressed that, but she really wanted to be more than friends. Now, itâ€™s like sheâ€™s completely forgotten about me. I was already so hurt before, so starved of affection and love and now I just feel even worse. Casted away, neglected. And all I have done is try and put effort in, but nobody wants to give any effort back.
