Itâ€™s all becoming too much.Iâ€™m not necessarily the most suicidal person, but shitâ€™s been getting worse and worse, Iâ€™m not sure how long Iâ€™m gonna last. I really just need a place to let it all out. This is gonna be a long one.

One of my closest friends goes through a lot, and he has a lot of mental disorders. I know itâ€™s really hard for him, and I really feel bad and wish I could help more. I try, I really do, but I always end up feeling worthless. I know I canâ€™t fix it, but I want to try and at least distract him from the pain. He talks about suicide and self-harm a lot, and I have a really hard time talking about stuff like that because of my own personal shit. I try and take it anyways because I wanna be there for him if he needs to vent. Iâ€™m so scared of losing him, I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve considered killing myself to avoid the pain when he eventually commits suicide, because at this point, I feel like Iâ€™m a burden to him. Iâ€™m so anxious to ask him if anythingâ€™s wrong, and I feel completely worthless because of it. I canâ€™t stand the thought of losing him, heâ€™s literally made me so damn happy and I feel so bad I canâ€™t do the same for him. Im so selfish trying to prevent him from killing himself because heâ€™s in a ton of mental pain. I donâ€™t want to leave him and abandon him, and I feel like if I tell him this myself, heâ€™ll cut himself. I donâ€™t want him to hurt himself or worry about me, but everything is becoming too much for me to take in. I tell him I care for him, but it probably doesnâ€™t mean much to him. Every day, I fucking pray that heâ€™s alive and didnâ€™t kill himself at night. Iâ€™m so scared whatâ€™ll happen when heâ€™s finally gone. I just wish i were better. I want to be there for him, but Iâ€™ll never be enough.

I decided to kill myself when he does, because I literally have nothing left to live for once heâ€™s gone. I know itâ€™s gonna happen one day, may be tonight, may be in a couple years, but I know itâ€™s gonna happen.
