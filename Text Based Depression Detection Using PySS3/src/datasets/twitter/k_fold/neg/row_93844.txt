All I want is to odAs I said, all I want is death. I'm 14 m and I can't seem to keep going. My meds don't work, my parents are probably going to divorce and I got left recently by my gf of a year. I also can't stand that I'm bi. I carved "fag" on my arm because it's how I see myself. Constantly being called a fag, a woman and other shit hurts. I'm also losing all my friends and I got beat up by 3 different people this week. As you can see, it's not going the greatest. Especially not being able to feel the few good things that come across. I feel like if I were gone, it would mean nothing to anyone.
