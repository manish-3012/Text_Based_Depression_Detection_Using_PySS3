Update from my physical pain that made me want to end my life, it's all gone now.I created a post here a few months back saying the reason I wanted to end my life was that I had a problem with my foot for the past two years and it caused me a lot of pain (I was 15 when it started, I'm 17 now), and it got 500 or so upvotes. It was on another account that I deleted, but I just wanted to say that I'm officially pain-free! I have been for the past month. I never even thought it was possible to heal, let alone the problem to be over so soon.

I feel so grateful. I still feel pain but it's very minor, I can sleep, walk, run, do everything that I never used to be able to do for two years, I thought I would be in pain for life.

I wanted to make this post for a bit but I just haven't gotten around to it. I had surgery if anyone was wondering.

So if anybody remembers my post, thank you so much for the support. I wish I kept the post and account up, but unfortunately, I did not! I did what the comments said, to push my doctor's to investigate more, and only a week after that post my surgery was done. I was really amazed at how quickly everything went through.
