Every time I tell someone my problems they stop talking to me.Friends, internet strangers, a freaking therapist gave up on me after I told her some of my problems. It just reinforces the idea my problems can never be fixed and I should just kill myself. I mean if this many people give up on me why shouldn't I give up on myself?
