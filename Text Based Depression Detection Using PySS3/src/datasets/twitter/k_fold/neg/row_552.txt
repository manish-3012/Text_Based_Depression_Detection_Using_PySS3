Don't even care about a throwaway right now...I feel like a 15 year old looking for attention... I feel so stupid.

I don't want to make a "wall of text" that everyone seems so hate, even though I am so prone to them. I never shut up about myself, do I?

I have some weird issue, where I get depressed late at night. I can be okay all day and then all of a sudden I'm just down and I don't feel like trying to get out.

I have only cut once. But I've had thoughts of it for years and years. Maybe 5 or 6 years. I actually did a year ago. I was so glad it didn't scar... I fear the scars.

I don't know if I'm the only one who is like this but... I love the way it looks. I fear the scars so sometimes I just scratch myself so I see all the little white lines and feel a bit of pain. Or used to put lipstick on my wrist so it looked like cuts (for about 2 or 3 years before I actually cut, I would do this). Sometimes now I use red sharpie. Most of the time I find a razor or knife and just look at it... telling myself, "just fucking do it." But then I fear scars and don't. 

I even want to do it when I'm happy. I just like the way it looks! I want to look down and see it... but not the scars, they have to be fresh. I don't want the scars in case this feeling one day passes, or someone sees...

I think about killing myself. I think I'm just sucking the world of it's resources and giving nothing back. I have no job, little friends, and I almost have no where to live. In 15 days if I can't come up with the money, I will be homeless.

I am only living on my own because my mom is crazy too. I had to leave, even though I knew I couldn't afford it. I lost all my jobs over my depression. Everyone can see it. I lost boyfriends and friends, too.

I have a boyfriend now, he broke up with me once over my depression, and that I was still in love with someone else. I tried to prove to him that I was getting better, and now hide my depression better. Fake smiles are becoming easier. He believes in me again.

As for the other that I love... I wish he was just a bit different. Then we would be okay. But he demands sex and lacks any sympathy or empathy. The only reason I'm not homeless today is because he helped me out... but wasn't nice about it. Just gave it to my roommate, didn't talk to me. 

I wish we could've been just friends. At LEAST.

This is getting long isn't it? Just a couple more points...

Back to I Feel Stupid. I pride myself on being smart but I feel belittled by people almost daily. I don't know how to cook. I can't keep a job. I'm a picky eater. I'm shy. OH am I shy. I have some social anxiety. I sit in the corner alone at parties unless I'm drunk/high. I know what they're all thinking, "What's wrong with her?" And that makes me even more anti-social. I fear the people.

"Why don't you help me cook?" "Why don't you initiate sex?" "Why don't you clean something without someone asking you to?" "Why don't you know how to do _____?" "Why won't you try this food?" "Why can't you make a decision?"
I feel like I curl up into a shell when I hear these things. And then it gets worse... "Why are you all quiet and depressed now?"

I don't want to be mean to my boyfriend but earlier I clicked a Reddit link that turned out to be a "screamer" gif. So I screamed. He was resting in bed, like usual, and he yells, "What the fuck! Fuck you! What was that for?!" I laughed about it and said sorry, but he didn't laugh. I tried to make light of the situation but he was just angry at me for screaming. Thus started my late night depression. I was just fine before that.

I just don't like when people are mad at me. I just want to make people happy. That's all I want to do with my life.

Okay so:
**TL;DR** - I like cutting but fear scars, I'm crazy shy and it makes people not like me, I think of suicide but fear death, I constantly feel stupid and inadequate and instead of doing something about it, I usually hide in a shell and become worse.
AMA. Haha. Kidding. But go ahead if you care...

**EDIT** going to bed cuz i cant find anyone to talk to... feel free to say anything you feel necessary. goodnight SW.
