No Good Deed Goes UnpunishedWriter's Note: This is meant to express my feelings. Please do not take this as advice. 

There comes a time when you must face your demons and either say you do not control me or you win. I am at the point of the latter. All my life people in the cheap seats have told me tomorrow will be better. 60 years later and life still sucks. I have no opportunities left. I'm tired of being food insecure. I am tired of having one foot constantly in homelessness. I tired of a body riddled in disease. I am tired of losing a little piece of me everyday. I worry that when I can no longer take care of myself, I will end up dying in the street as I don't qualify for nursing care. I am tired of being a self-fulfilling prophecy. I am tired of feeling like a burden. I am tired of friends making me second fiddle while they think with their dicks. Even my father forsaken me for that cunt he married who took my inheritance for her grandchildren. At least the one I do have is brains and those brains found how to slip away into the night. No pain, no fuss, no muss.
