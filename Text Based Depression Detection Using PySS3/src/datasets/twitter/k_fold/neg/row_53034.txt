Reaching out.How do i reach out to somebody about my suicidal thoughts? What do i even say to them? I wanna fucking shoot myself in the head everyday? I dont expect anyone to fix my problems, but i also dont think keeping it to myself is any better.

Whats worse is that i feel like my reasons for being depressed are stupid. I think my friends hate me, i have no talents or skills, and i cant jeep conversations going. I also think im worthless and i let everybody down. I had a bad childhood. I was bullied and neglected and i dont think people will take me seriously if i mention why i want to kill myself. I tried the suicide hotline and it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be. A nice lady talked to me. Her name was erin. But it was the texting hotline and texting doesnt really help me much. 

I just need someone who cares.
People like those are hard to find these days.
