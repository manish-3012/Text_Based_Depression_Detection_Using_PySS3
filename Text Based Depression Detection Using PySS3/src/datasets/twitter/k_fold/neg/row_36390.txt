I'm concernedMy therapist wanted me to go to the hospital after I told her i had a suicide plan. I told her I didn't want to go to the hospital because I was afraid it would interfere with my plan. I only told her this because my boyfriend wanted me to seek help. I didn't want help. I wanted to kill myself. In the end they decided to send me home but just to have my boyfriend monitor me 24/7. That's right. I basically said that if they didn't send me to the hospital I would probably kill myself and they decided not to send me to the hospital. I'm now alone at work and contemplating suicide. I feel like my therapist really doesn't care about me if they are willing to gamble with my life. I struggle with an illness that makes it difficult to think and communicate. I forget words etc. And I don't want to live with myself anymore. I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I'm in treatment but I just learned that I'm backsliding and after the cost of my last appointment I have $30 to my name.
