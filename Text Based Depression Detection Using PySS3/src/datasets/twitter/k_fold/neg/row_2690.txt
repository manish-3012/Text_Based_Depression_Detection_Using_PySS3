People hate me, I guess they'll never bother about me once I'm goneI would describe myself some kind of a loser, I'm currently 22, I have always been bullied since I was young. I still have no idea why a lot of people has been rude to me, but that doesn't matter anymore. When I was like 5 years old, I often got bullied by everyone, teachers, classmates, everyone...

Now that I'm studying in a local institution, I'd feel insecure and I can tell that people who... I don't even know, would talk about me behind my back, slander about me for things I don't even do. Even attending classes some lecturers show their animosity and prejudice towards me. Well, of course, sometimes I would just motivate and tell myself fuck whatever they said about me. I am getting immune to whatever shit people have said about me. However I feel so tired of living in a world where I have done nothing wrong and assholes start to fuck my shit up.

for years I've thought that it would be better if I'd isolate myself away from such people but I think it's best for me to end my life permanently. I'm setting a date to die.
