Bye bye :) Most days were the same, or at least, a small variation of the same. I liked to tell myself I was living break to break, but I know that was a lie. Summer and winter breaks certainly provided an initial release from the monotony, but eventually Iâ€™d sink back into the same gutter that I wade through during the school year. After only a few weeks Iâ€™d romatincies my time at university, and the lonely nights feeling my mind numb due to my lack of resolve to make more genuine connections seemed to be absent from my memory. The sobering reality was the monotony is internal, a part of who I am.  I ruin most relationships I enter due to putting too much pressure on people because they become my only reason for living. I think it has to do with my fear of dying alone, but honestly it's kind of ironic seeing as I'm making a post on this god forsaken site to get some very last human connection before big pharma takes me to the next life. If any of you want to talk before that tho i'm real chatty so hmu
