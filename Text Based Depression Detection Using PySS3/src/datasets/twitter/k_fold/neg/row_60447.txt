What would I say on my deathbed?I'm so bitter right now about the opportunities I've missed over the past five years that I'll never see again. I feel like if I got a horrible disease and died, that my last words to my family would be horrendous things intended to hurt them, like "Oh *now* you're sorry!" or "Well good riddance to me!" They don't deserve this. They've been the best, most loving people in the world to me, and it still wasn't enough to make me happy.

Philosophers have debated for years what a life well lived means. Whatever it does, if I died tomorrow I couldn't have it. And I'm already so plagued with regret, I don't think my life can ever be happy. I will always have the past I hate. 

There's no suicide note I could write that could say all I meant, and even if it could, I can't even decide how I want people to feel about my death. Am I vengeful and do I want them to suffer like I have? No. Do I want them to feel like I'm at peace after a life of torment? No. Do I want them to carry my memory, or forget I ever existed? Do I want them to remember how my mistakes caused my demise as a cautionary tale, or forget them in favor of my fonder times?
