[Update] Appointment todayI think a lot of the anxiety was in my head, but it was just as depressing as I anticipated. I cried till I couldn't speak. And now, 2 hours after I left the doctors office, I'm left with just this empty feeling. I'm left with this hopelessness and this anger and this just exhaustion. I couldn't bring myself to tell her that I actually tried to kill myself, only that I had the thoughts. I'm such a coward. They raised my medicine to 150mg now... maybe that'll work and I can just become some happy zombie. I don't even care if I'm out of it half the time, I just want to be happy or at the very least not depressed. She told me to make a list of all the things that make me happy but all I want is the nightmares to stop and the thoughts to stop. 

I yelled at my boyfriend to leave me alone, and I got what I wanted I guess. He won't talk to me anymore. All I do is hurt people. I've become a monster in the shell of someone who was once happy.

I wish I could just walk into traffic and just vaporize. I don't want to feel the pain. I don't want the thoughts of all the consequences. I just want to disappear, as if I never existed to begin with. The thoughts won't stop. Maybe I'll end them myself soon.

Edit: I was listening to my spotify playlist and came across this:

[Iâ€™m gonna die alone , This I know.
And youâ€™ll find someone new to love.
But I want you more, I want you more, I want you more. 'Cause Iâ€™ll never know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDCkI9bKKQM) 

The way the guitar just carries the vocals is like bitter honey, so comforting but so depressing.
