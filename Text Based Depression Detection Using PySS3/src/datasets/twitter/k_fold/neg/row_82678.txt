I thinkIts starting to end. My wave thats been bothering me for weeks seems to be slackening a little but its still there. I still want to die. I still have my suicide note in my notepad app. I keep getting signs that its going to get better and im thankful for that. Im just longing for something i dont even know about yet i guess.
