No help, no outlet, just die on youâ€™re own I seeIâ€™m getting really scared now. Iâ€™m only 17. For the past weeks nearing a month Iâ€™ve been getting these dizzy like spells that affect my eye and frontal face area. My sinuses are mostly clear. My parents donâ€™t give a shit. If I were to have something serious like cancer , theyâ€™d have a huge guilt on them for trying to blame my symptoms â€œbecause I donâ€™t sleep at nightâ€ even though every teen is going to sleep at 6 AM and waking up in ten afternoon. I still sleep my 8 hours it doesnâ€™t matter when . Fuck. Gotta fend for myself. Iâ€™m fighting for my life right now
