it never gets better(first reddit post, wow thats sad but whatever) its 4 am and idk who else to talk to.

 This might be a shout into the void but whatever. so ive been suicidal with severe depression and anxiety for about 6 years now. iâ€™m almost 19, and until a year ago i kept telling myself, â€œwait until you graduate, everything will get betterâ€. Well, here I am, and now I feel things have only gotten worse. Each new positive aspect gained brings along 2 negative ones. I live with my girlfriend of almost 4 years, awesome. But now i have to pay rent and weâ€™re both struggling and no one to clean up after us so everything just gets disgusting and makes us feel worse. I can drive, sweet. Now I get to pay $200 a month for insurance on top of gas, plus all my close friends moved out of state because living here is impossible. Iâ€™m going to school for what I want to do, or so I thought. Iâ€™m in beauty school, i loved makeup before but now the depression has ruined that too. and my social anxiety makes it almost impossible to work on clients or even talk to my classmates without being a wreck, i so badly want to drop out but i canâ€™t afford to start paying my loans, plus then everyone would be disappointed in me and i would stop getting money i need from my family in order to live. I just feel like every breath I take costs some amount of money and I want to stop paying. And if it isnt obvious i canâ€™t afford therapy, i have my stateâ€™s low income insurance but even then finding someone who will accept new patients who isnâ€™t a stupid long drive away is near impossible. my friends dont talk to me anymore and i fail every time i try to make new ones, in person or online. idk, it just feels like iâ€™ve dug myself into a hole iâ€™ll never get out of and iâ€™m ready to take the easy way out.
