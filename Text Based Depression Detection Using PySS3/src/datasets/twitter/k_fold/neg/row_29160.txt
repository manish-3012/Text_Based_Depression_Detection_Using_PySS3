Weird "outburst"There's one thing that really bothers me, and that are outbursts that I will have from time to time. I will just say something without having thought it first, this only happens when I'm alone. More and more frequently, the words "I want to die" just falls out of my mouth. I have no real wish to die at the moment, but this keeps on falling out of my mouth. It worries me.

I don't need any support or help or anything, but I want to know what I should make of thosse words falling out of my mouth. I don't know why but it's been more frequent the last month or two. I feel bad after realizing what I've said every time.
