I don't know what to do and suicide seems like the best answer.....My little brother has been accepted to a prestigious university. If that isn't bad enough, I was denied admittance into a mere state school. 

This fool hasn't worked a day in his life and gets whatever he wants. To make matters worse, he's not even smart! It may sound like I'm just being envious but I'm not. If he actually deserved it I would be proud of him. All he does is watch tv and text on his phone while I have to study my ass off and work!!!

God must hate me...

My parents now want me to stay at home in this fucked up small town but I can't bear the thought of that. Death would be a much better choice than staying here.

This is the most suicidal I've felt in my life. What do you recommend I do?
