I should be in a hospital right nowI just hurt myself really badly. Not like I'll die, but a lot of blood. The voices have gotten really bad (I have schizophrenia) and they say I am worthless and that my name is Worthless because that's what I am and I need to accept my new name , my true name, so I can make the world hell . This is the worst I've felt for a long time but I can't go to the hospital because people did bad things to me there, and if I get hospitalized, they'll see that I've been committed before and then they'll shut me up for good. I need help but I CAN'T, I have to do college and my job and not be even more of a disappointment. I can't stop self harming. I've attempted suicide probably twenty times. I'm not good at anything, even dying. I don't even have a therapist anymore to talk to. I fantasize about making people watch as I kill myself all the time. It's going to taste good and the blood will feel good and I'll have that happy feeling inside. the voices tell me I'm not worth spending time on this earth any longer and I need to transcend all of this and end it as I am. I want to drink all of my blood as I die and it's going to be beautiful
