Hitting a low point.Considering checking myself into a psych ward. I've struggled with depression of varying degrees for at least a decade, and I've hit low before. This is an all new low.

I'm constantly in a state of self loathing. I feel constant guilt. I don't feel like I have an impact. I don't feel I'm morally sound. My head screams the logic that I'm distorting this all because of my mental illness, but I can't shove down this constant void in my chest. It feels like I'm heartbroken, but I have nothing to be heartbroken over. I love my boyfriend. I've made amends with my family where I can. I'm doing really well at work. I hate everything I am.

I am struggling so hard to keep from drowning in my own suffering. I have no reason to suffer other than I'm just... broken, I guess. I don't want to wake up anymore, and I don't want to feel this way. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to, though I know people in my life love me and care for me and would listen. I'm just too much of a coward to talk to them.
