i feel terriblei was already bad yesterday because my friend said he wouldnâ€™t be talking to me for months. i still canâ€™t get over the past physical and mental abuse my parents put me through since i was little. my mom still yells at me a lot or completely ignores me when i ask a question or try to have a conversation. my communication skills are lacking. iâ€™ve asked to get therapy for my depression and anxiety but my mom â€œnever remembersâ€ to make an appointment for me. iâ€™ve stopped trying at this point. i donâ€™t want to eat. i have a rope tied. it seems like the easiest way out.
