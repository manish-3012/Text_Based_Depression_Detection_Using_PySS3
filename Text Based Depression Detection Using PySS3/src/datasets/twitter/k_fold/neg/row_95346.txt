Suicide's become a question of when, not ifI don't know what to do anymore. I've been suicidal for the past few weeks, and I keep alternating between fighting the thoughts and succumbing to the darkness. In the past year I've gotten into a car crash that totaled my car, broke up with my boyfriend of 5+ years, lost my cat and lost a coworker. I work a full time job, a part time job and I'm a full time graduate student. I haven't been sleeping well at all and I'm slipping back into my eating disorder. I'm starting to get paranoid of everyone around me. I don't have many friends and I feel like my depression is making me a burden to the ones i have. I'm on an antidepressant which doesn't seem to be working any more, and my psychiatrist is taking forever to get back to me.

I'm making myself wait until I finish the school year and my part time job. Ironically I'm studying to be a mental health counselor and I wouldn't do anything to hurt my clients. But come May 10th there's nothing holding me back anymore.
