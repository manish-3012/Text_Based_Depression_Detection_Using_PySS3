What is medication like?So Iâ€™m gonna try and make this short but, long story short I suffer from severe anxiety and depression and my mum knows about it (I told her about all this pretty quickly) and she says that we might have to try and get me on medication, obviously we havenâ€™t arranged it she has just said it a few times as of how I am mentally and I just want to know, what is it like? Sorry if it sounds weird but going on medication just isnâ€™t scares me idk why.
