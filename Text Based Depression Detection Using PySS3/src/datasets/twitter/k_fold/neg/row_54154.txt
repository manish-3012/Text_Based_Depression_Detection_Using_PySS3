I feel it might be about time I do it.I hate being in pain all the time since I've been hit by a car, and hate being breathless with my disease.
People just use me, and abuse me. Just like my mother who had ran away.
It doesn't matter where I am, or what I do, I'm always harmed and bullied.
I'm so alone, and can't trust anyone.
It's probably better than I'm dead. No one knows or cares for me anyways.
