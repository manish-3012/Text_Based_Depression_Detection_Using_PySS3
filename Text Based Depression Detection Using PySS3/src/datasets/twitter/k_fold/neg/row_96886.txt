Was denied my revengeAfter I aged out of foster care I was going to find my biological parents and kill them but like the fucking junkies they were they died years before from overdoses.

Then after I got medically kicked out of the military I was going to kill my foster mom for being an abusive bitch but she died of a heart attack a couple months before that.

I have no friends, no family, no job, and no purpose in life. And I'm going to be homeless soon. I'm pretty sure none of this is real and I don't actually exist anyways.
