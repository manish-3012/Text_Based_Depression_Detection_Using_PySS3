my mom knows nowthe other night i told my mom that I had been planning my death for a few months. she asked if i wanted to go to the emergency room.

i said no, of course. what the fuck can the hospital do? therapy is bullshit. I dont want to cave and concede and bend my life to be the way they want it to be. I wanna be myself and myself is fucking dead.
