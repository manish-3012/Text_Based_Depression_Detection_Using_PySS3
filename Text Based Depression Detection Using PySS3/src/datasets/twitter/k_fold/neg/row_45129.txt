Someome attempted suicide last night and I have been blamed for it.People try to place the pin of blame on someone just so they can rationalize and understand certain situations. I had been pushed to the point where it is partially my fault. The person is okay and in the hospital but just...now I feel suicidal and feel like I donâ€™t deserve to live. I am worthless, a waste of space. I need to rid myself so no one else does anything.
