Why?Why should I have to stay alive? Why should people love me? Why does it never get better? Iâ€™ve tried everything for 3 years and it all feels the same. Iâ€™ve started talking to a guy but now I just feel Iâ€™m going to hurt him, and my mother looks after me mentally while she is physically ill, I just hurt her too. I just want to be happy. I want to spread my art and my music and have others understand the way I see the world, because it can be so beautiful but my goddamn fucking brain just terrorises me. Just for info I have aspergers and many other things.
