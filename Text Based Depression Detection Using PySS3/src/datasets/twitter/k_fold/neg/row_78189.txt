My car window just randomly shattered when I closed the door.Not even mad. Just sat there for a while in awe, with a strong desire to not exist anymore. Was just trying to get to my shitty apartment after I got off of my shitty job that I have to fund my shitty life. Only to be met with this at the start of winter. If this is all life has to offer, I don't want it anymore.
