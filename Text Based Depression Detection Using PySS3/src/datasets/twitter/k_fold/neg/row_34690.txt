I feel like Iâ€™m a ticking time bomb.Hi everyone. First post. I hope Iâ€™m doing this whole thing right. Iâ€™ve been struggling with mental illness for a long time. It all spiralled when my brother killed himself 5 years ago, from then on everything has been an effort. I have been on medication for a long time and every now and then I have my down times but I usually get back on my feet and feel relatively fine. Around a month ago, my medication suddenly started making me feel agitated and unsettled, it wasnâ€™t a nice feeling so I stopped all my medication cold turkey (a terrible, stupid idea, I know! I didnâ€™t think it through). The first two weeks I felt great and then last week, 3 weeks without my meds, I had an episode where I was screaming and crying and inconsolable due to being triggered by the smallest thing: a sound. It has never been like this before. Sure, some sounds get under my skin but while medicated, I can usually control it. It scared my parents and I feel terrible about it. They are such caring, beautiful people who have done so much for me and I constantly feel like a burden and failure. For some reason I get triggered by them sometimes, by certain things they do (itâ€™s not intentional, and they truly canâ€™t help it, I know that. itâ€™s just my stupid, awful brain). Part of it stems down to something that happened to me as a kid (nothing they did, I assure you), I told them about it last week and they were supportive but these moods are getting worse and I spoke to a general practitioner last week (not my regular one because her next appointment isnâ€™t until January and same with my psychiatrist too). She has had me start back on one of my medications and I will see her again next week. As the title says, I feel like a ticking time bomb. I am getting so irritable and I canâ€™t control it. I hate that my family have to witness it... I feel like an idiot. I just feel terrible that they are stuck with a god awful daughter like me. I have so much to be thankful for, I just started a new job â€” my first â€œrealâ€ job, not including the brief jobs I did as a teenager. My parents love me and I have friends and extended family who love me too, but for some reason I just feel like ending it all. I donâ€™t have any plans to do so at the moment and would never want to hurt my parents like that considering itâ€™s how my brother died, but I donâ€™t trust myself when Iâ€™m having an episode.

I apologise for rambling and I hope this makes sense. Thanks for reading. Any advice would be appreciate... Iâ€™m in such a predicament right now.
