Getting fired tomorrow morning, really want to kill myself after that.Pretty sure I'm getting fired tomorrow morning.  I know the method of suicide I want to use. I spoke to my boyfriend and he says he'd never forgive me if I killed myself. We are in a long distance relationship, unfortunately.

Pretty sure the only people that will care are my boyfriend and my father, so I'll owe them an apology in the afterlife, probably.

Truth is, I've been suicidal for a long time. I have attempted suicide and failed once. Did self harm, too. The whole thing.

I want it all to end. My life isnt getting better.

I just wish my dad and my boyfriend would understand.
