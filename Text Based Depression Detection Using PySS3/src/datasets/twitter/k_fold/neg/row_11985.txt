She left me. Ready to die.My girlfriend..well ex girkfriend is bipolar. She constantly tells me i manipulate her when we argue. I dont. Usually were great. But once in a while we argue and she breaks up,says horrible shit. Today,i was tired in class and was kind of irritated. When i got home she was being short and she broke up and blocked me. Im fucking broken. All ive done is be there for her,support her,accept her and im the one thats broken. Ive been through too much. I seriously want to be dead. Not even over sadness or spite. I genuinely dont want to continue living. I cant even talk to her. Shes in my class but im sure shell ignore me. She has friends to talk to. I dont. I have no family. Nothing. Im alone,chain smoking,numb and empty. I dont understand. I think im going to kill myself on new years. I have a connection to get LSD and i may just trip and do it. Im sick of being constantly hurt and let down. I loved her. So fucking much. I planeed so much for us. Even Christmas. All gone. I dont think shes coming back this time. Im so fucking lost...
