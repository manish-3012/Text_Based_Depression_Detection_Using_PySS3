Everything is gone to shit and I'm considering buying a gun as my way outI'm in a shitty situation, my life has been 99% shitty situations and I'm so over the uphill battle.  I work full time despite being disabled.  I dont do luxuries. I dont spend frivolously. I had a plan to gtfo of my current situation and it got fucked up.  I saved money meticulously and this stupid hurricane fucked it all up.  I dont have the time, literally, to save it back up again by the deadline, but in all honesty, a cheaper and quicker solution would be a gun, and that only cost me a tenth of what I was originally saving up.
