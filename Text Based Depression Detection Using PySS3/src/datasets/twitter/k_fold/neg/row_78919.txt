Goodbye, the first and last post.I had a great girlfriend. She is the most amazing kindest person. Besides slight autism she was perfect. Some, including myself would argue the autism perfects her, if shapes her. She was so amazing. I lost her today. I flirted with other girls and traded photos. She's not responding to me anymore and I don't blame her. I can live with myself anymore. I took a perfect vase and scratched with a nail. She so fragile and innocent and I crushed those, all my friends have turned on me. I hate my life. I took all my sleeping pills. The whole bottle, even as I sit here I can feel my head starting to hurt and am beginning to have a hard time keeping my eyes open. Goodbye P, if your reading this. I love you, I always will, you deserve the best. I am so sorry it wasn't me. I had everything in the world when I was with you. And I lost it all. I am so very sorry. I thought with my dick. I love you P, become who you know is best and follow your dreams.
