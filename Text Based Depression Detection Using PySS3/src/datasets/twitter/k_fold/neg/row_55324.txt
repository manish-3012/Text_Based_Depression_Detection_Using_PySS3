Why should I keep on living when only a small portion of life is happiness?Yeah I know this is so cliche and overthought but I just don't understand why I should keep on going. Sure there's things now and then in life that are fun but the majority is life is working, exhausting myself, being stressed (or at least this is what I'm being told).

I want to live a fun life forever until I die but everytime i mention this idea i get shot down saying that I can't live like that as I can't have fun in life most of the time. Why should I keep on going if I can't enjoy life every day and I have to be stressed and exhausted every day? Why should I live for a sprinkle of happiness a pool full of stress and sorrow?


I'm stuck in school every day. I have to wake up at 7 and I get back home at 5:30 exhausted. I procrastinate the few hours left of my day away. I go to sleep and this cycle starts again. I'm also expected to work during the weekends so where's my life going? I'm being told I need to do all this for the future so I can get a good job and not struggle financially but I'll just be stuck in another 9-5 routine, potentially working overtime here and then and being too exhausted to do shit.


Then i get told that's just life and i have to deal with it. Maybe i don't want to deal with it and i just want to die because the cons outweigh the pros.
