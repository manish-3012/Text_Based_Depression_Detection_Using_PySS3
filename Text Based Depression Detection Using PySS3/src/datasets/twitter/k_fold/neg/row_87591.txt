I'm tired of trying.Sorry if this has been posted up countless times by some other people. But I am tired. I called Samaritans this morning on my way to work and she asked me, "Do you not find any pleasure in life?" I said "No. Not anymore." 

I'm tired of it. I give up. I tried making things better and looking at things from a different perspective but it didn't help. 

I'm going to work on my note. Should I even bother with a note? 

I never wanted to die so badly like I do now.
