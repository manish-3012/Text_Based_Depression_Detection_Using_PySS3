Feel like hurting myself to get helpI've been in and out of basic therapy with many different therapists for years but it has done little to help. I'm at a very low point in my life where daily function is very difficult. I desperately want more intensive treatment but I seem too functional and self aware for anyone to take me seriously. I'm considering overdosing or self harming badly. Either I succeed and die, or I fail and they treat me. Or maybe I'll just be seriously harmed and still get no treatment. I don't know. I can't trust myself to get through each day on my own now.
