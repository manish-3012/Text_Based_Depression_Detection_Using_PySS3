My experience I shared on other subreddits 2 months agoThis is my story, it happened on valentines day.  


 "Two nights ago, I commited suicide. I took 10 pills, swallowed them and  went to sleep. I simply cant handle it anymore, I need money I cant get,  pressure from all sides is great so I went with that. Those pills are  potent, only one pill almost killed my day when he took it by accident.  Anyway, I woke up in the morning like nothing happened, at the time I  usually wake up. I didnt have explanation what happened, and I was  disappointed that I'm still alive. I checked the pill case, I indeed  took them. My body felt normal. I got up and took 3 more and sat there,  waiting for them to start working. But no, nothing happened, and still  I'm here. Something is keeping me here, something doesn't allow me to  go. But, in a small chain of events, I managed to borrow the money I  needed and took care of that problem for time being. I still need it but  I will find ways to get it somehow since suicide is no longer an  option. "
