This is itI feel like shit all the time. Iâ€™m killing my self and nothing will stop me. Donâ€™t gimmie that crap saying itâ€™s not worth it or youâ€™ll regret it because I know I wonâ€™t. People always say that theyâ€™ll be my friend, but only when they find out Iâ€™m suicidal. And they say theyâ€™ll never abandon me but in the end they do. So many fucking people. Literally countless have said the same thing, I promise I will never not be your friend, even when I tell them what Iâ€™m telling you right now. But Iâ€™m the end they always do. They ALL do. No one cares about me, not my parents, not my bird, and I have no friends. I thought I did but just like I thought, they got bored and left me. If anyone could provide some good suicide methods it would be greatly appreciated.   Iâ€™m an ugly piece of shit, whoâ€™s fucking retarded and an annoying asshole. Iâ€™ll never have a single friend, let alone anything beyond that. I deserved to die. Nothing about me is good. Maybe Iâ€™ll try and take some fuckwads down with me. And I know people will say, â€œno you canâ€™t that cruel and badâ€ you think I give a single fuck? Iâ€™m killing myself, Iâ€™ll do whatever the fuck I want. Also if I could get some encouragement to suicide, it would be greatly appreciated as well, donâ€™t want to coward out like the thousands times before. And no, Iâ€™m not just a cringy kid who wants to kill themselves for no fucking reasons all the time, but I bet thatâ€™s what most people will think anyways. Iâ€™m counting the second till I work up the final push to die. Iâ€™ll do something right, something that sets me free. Fuck you and fuck everyone.
