I feel like Iâ€™m taking up space hereAnd maybe Iâ€™m not. But I always feel bad for posting here. Iâ€™ve tried writing out my life story but thereâ€™s too many pieces and memory loss. I just wish I wouldâ€™ve been protected as a child. I wish I grew up learning how to process emotions. I wish my family wasnâ€™t the way it is. Iâ€™m stuck like this and I know I just have to hang on but is there even any point anymore?

My future... wonâ€™t be good. I know it wonâ€™t. I feel so excited that one day Iâ€™ll be able to live on my own and have my own space but I know thereâ€™ll be something holding me down. There is always something that has to fuck even the tiniest things up so that nothing ever works smoothly for me. Iâ€™m tired of it.

And Iâ€™m trying to get help. Iâ€™m trying so hard. And in trying so hard to do my schooling which will fuck up my future even more if I fail. I just wish it was easier. I wish I wasnâ€™t writing this at 9am when I fell asleep at 3am. I wish I could sleep without weed. I canâ€™t even sleep longer than 6hrs with it.

And if one more fucking person asks me how much I weight, Iâ€™ll literally fucking kill myself right then and there. My meds fucked me over and while I donâ€™t feel as anxious anymore I also donâ€™t have a goddamn appetite. Drs just tell me to force food. Weed is the only thing that can give me a bit of appetite. So leave me the fuck alone irl people.

I wanna fuck things over. I want to go crazy and tell everyone the fuck off. Tell them what I really feel about them. When I left my local school no one gave a shit. I left without notice and not a single person even contacted me to ask where I went. No one cared. But then I decide to post a photo on my insta wearing a crop top and finally being open about my DID and so many messages. I guess Iâ€™m only interesting when I have a fucking complex as hell disorder. 

But sometimes I want to live to be better than them and wow, what high expectations I have for myself. I know school isnâ€™t everything and these people shouldnâ€™t matter but I havenâ€™t really had a real real friend that I didnâ€™t fuck it up with. I always get way too attached and happy that I do or say something or Iâ€™m just annoying and clingy as hell. I wish people would just tell me if they donâ€™t like me as a friend.

Sometimes I get so angry. Where I want to contact every person that has hurt me and just fucking tell them off. Tell them about how I literally attempted suicide so many times because of some of them. Then I fall back into the sadness. I just want happiness and stability. Is this all life is? Is it as terrible as it seems? Where Iâ€™ll have to work unbearable hours to pay for basic supplies and a house. It doesnâ€™t sound like a good time. I donâ€™t see what the reward is for living. Children? Iâ€™m not bringing a child into this world and especially not adopting a kid if my housing sucks and itâ€™s just me. I canâ€™t do shit. 

I just kinda wish I had a choice. Or maybe a different upbringing. Selfish as hell, but itâ€™s true. Maybe if I grew up different I wouldnâ€™t be like this. Maybe I wouldnâ€™t have to constantly wonder if my entire life and disorders are a delusion itself, which they could be, I donâ€™t even know if theyâ€™re real or not. Who knows.

Sorry for just talking nonsense. Iâ€™m really tired and such
