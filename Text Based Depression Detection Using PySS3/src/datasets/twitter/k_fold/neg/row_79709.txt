Need to talk again. I've lost all belief in God and souls and have begun to question my existence. I am living every second to second. I just waited 23 hours for a woman I love to call me, but was denied as she was too tired after flying across the world. I guess I don't blame her. 

Honestly, I don't know why I exist right now. I am just a leech on society despite my attempts to be a contributor of this thing known as life. I have done into a very dark place in my mind, and if I could fall asleep and become death, then maybe I would be okay with that. To cease to exist and vanish.
