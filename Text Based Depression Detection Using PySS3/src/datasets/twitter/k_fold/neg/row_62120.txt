Struggling to see the point...I just cant see the point. Everyday is spent longing for the evening so I can sleep again, then dreading having to get up in the morning. I'm tired all the time, nothing seems to make it go away. Every day at work is just spent counting down until I can go home. I can see no logical reason in existing for the sake of existing, being alive just to pass the time. Surely the logical thing would be to just end it all now....
