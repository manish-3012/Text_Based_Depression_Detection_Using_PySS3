I don't want helpI do want help. Candidly. I am afraid of getting help. No, I am afraid of asking for help and not getting what I need. I need to go to hospital. I need to admit myself. 

I am a danger to myself. I can't keep myself safe. 

I am afraid of myself. 

I don't need help. I need someone to *see* me. To really see me. And to say that they believe me. 

I need someone to believe me implicitly. Explicitly. 

I need someone to acknowledge without feigned care. Without reproach. 

I used to think I could only feel one way at a time. That I could only believe, or think, one way at a time. But I know now that that's not true, that I can think and feel conflicting things. 

I don't want someone to look at me and say, "You must not want to die, deep down, if you're asking for help." 

I don't want them to tell me that I'm so young, that things will change, or get better. I don't want to be guilted about how my family or friends might feel. 

I don't want them to tell me the same tired platitudes that they reserve for people like me. 

I don't want them to be frustrated at how long it takes me to say things. Or give up listening, or get bored, or tell me that I'm overreacting. 

I don't want them to see my silence, and think that it means I'm not serious.

I want someone to look at me and genuinely *see* me. 

I want someone to acknowledge I'm spiralling. To hear me talk about my plans to end my life, and take me seriously. 

I want them to hear how terrified I am, and to tell me they see it. 

I want to be seen as I *am*. Not as I was, or could be. I want to be seen in this moment. 

A person at the edge of their life, a person with no hope and no control, a person desperate. 

I need someone to see me, but I am terrified of being seen.
