I don't really know what to do anymore. I don't really know where to turn.I'm really just trying my best to feel better.

A little backstory; I grew up with a family that always put me down, making comments about my appearance and intelligence daily. I've struggled with my weight my entire life. Every time I felt good about myself or felt I looked cute even if i wasn't skinny or perfectly beautiful my step-father and mother would never hesitate to jump in and let me know how stupid or fat or ugly I looked. I spent my entire childhood being completely controlled. I wasn't allowed to use the phone or go to friends houses or go to parties because my mother believed no one really wanted to be my friend. Every attempt I ever made to have friends would be met with her telling me I was just being a follower and how no one could ever like me because I was a liar and a manipulator.  I grew up pretty poor as well. I remember being 12 laying in my bed crying my eyes out thinking about going to school and telling my friends "I didn't get anything for Christmas because my family can't afford it." When I was in middle school/high school I found myself getting into a lot of trouble. I spent a good amount of time being suspended and so my parents decided to keep me out of trouble I was going to get a job.  I started working at a catering company cleaning the kitchen after school. My parents then proceeded to take every paycheck from that moment(the age of 12) until I finally left them at the age of 28. I've never learned how to be responsible with money because I've never had any. I never learned to try harder because I was told that where I was was where I was always going to be. To think I could do anything else was stupid because there was nothing special about me. I have one older sister, one older brother, and two younger brothers. Around the age of 17-18 years old I started to get incredibly frustrated. All of my friends had cars and independence and I could never keep a dime to myself to save. I didn't even know what saving was. I found myself angry at these people for having that privilege. Angry at people for having a family that taught them about the world and tried to give them advantages even if they were very very small. I started to isolate. I woke up and went to work. I came home, played video games and went to sleep. This cycle went on for awhile and I really thought I was finding happiness even though I never moved in any direction. My electricity and cable were constantly being shut off. I made around $200 a week and it all went to my dad. If I didn't willingly hand over my paycheck there would be threats of kicking me out and bullying about how I didn't care about my family. I was just a selfish stupid girl. I brought up having siblings because the entire time this was happening I was the only one required to work and contribute. In my 20s when my little brothers were older, around the same age as me. They had never even had a job. I mentioned Christmas and not having any money for it, but later on we started to be a bit better off. I never received a Christmas present, from the age of 12 until I left around the age of 28, but my younger brothers did. Even if it was just a pair of socks. That hit me so hard. Looking back even now I'll never understand why I was treated so differently, and I really was. I wanted to go to school. I woke up one day and decided I was going to figure out what I needed to do to make college happen. I did it all by myself. Filled out my loan papers, scheduled classes, went to counselors to figure out what I wanted to go to school for. I started reaching out to resources outside of my home because I never got anything from home. This was met with so much backlash. How could I ever think I could be anything? My little brother also wanted to go to school but never did anything. My mom did all his paper work and forced him to go meetings at the school. He got in and found he really liked it and he did really well. My mother praised him for his good grades and told him he was so smart and she always knew he could do something different. I also had really good grades, but guess who never really cared?

Flash forward to now. I've moved away and been away for almost 3 years. Almost 2 years ago I went to the doctors to figure out what was wrong with me. (I actually put it like that.) I felt incredibly scared all of the time. I had crazy nightmares about when I was a child. My step-father and older brother used to get into fist fights all the time. My older brother was a bit of a hand full growing up. Last year I found out he was diagnosed with Asperger's and my heart broke in half. Everything about the way he was growing up made so much sense. I found myself filled with anger at my step-father for deciding that beating him was the answer to his behavioral issues. 

My doctor sent me to a therapist so that we could start a dialogue and figure out what was going on. He sent me to a psychiatrist that asked me a million questions and gave me an intelligence test on my own request. I can't remember the name of it now, but I had to match symbols and try to make blocks match a pattern. He sent me back to my therapist with the results. About average intelligence, which felt pretty nice. Like hey... I'm not actually dumb? Just for reference I consider above average to be exactly average. I don't think I'm some special genius, but it's nice to know I am capable. Also his pre-diagnosis of Bipolar other specified (which basically means I show characteristics but I don't fit healthy into either 1 or 2) PTSD, and generalized anxiety disorder. I went back to my therapist and we started working most intensely together. Cognitive behavioral therapy is what they call it. Where I started to learn to slow down my thoughts and question them. I started to learn to confront situations before they drove me crazy. When my primary doctor decided the medications she had me on weren't enough she sent me to yet another psychiatrist to try out some new things. She put me on a mood stabilizer, anti-depressant/anti-anxiety and a blood pressure pill to help with my nightmares. Everything started to work but I what I forgot to mention was that I never touched a drink in my life until I moved away from home. I developed one very quickly. Even while trying to figure out my medications I still drank heavily. This went on for about 2 years. One day I feel like I woke up and realized I was binge drinking. I would have one beer and somehow that would turn into 20. I would constantly drink until the point of throwing up and getting sick. I started to mix weed with my drinking and that scared me. Little did I know that weed increased the rate at which alcohol is absorbed into the blood. There were a few times where I really thought I had given myself alcohol poisoning. Because I thought that in order to avoid getting sick from drinking too much I could smoke some weed to avoid the nausea and keep drinking. HA! Joke was on me. I spent 2 years being drunk every single day. I would go on dates with my boyfriend drunk. I would hang out with his family drunk. I would go to Christmas and Thanksgiving completely trashed and continue to drink heavily despite already being intoxicated. Two Thanksgivings ago I woke up hung over from a night of heavy drinking. At dinner I had more to drink. I got sick right then and there. I ran downstairs and threw up all over the carpet. I spent the next day in bed getting up every few hours to throw up. My boyfriend was not happy. Drinking got in the middle of our relationship so much. I would lie to him about how much I was drinking or how often I was getting sick. I would start to steal his alcohol. We would also have the most awful fights where I would threaten to drive away completely wasted. A few times he was actually the one to leave and drive around for a few hours. I even wound up in the hospital from my drinking. All that sugar affected my kidney. I wound up getting a kidney infection and spent the next week in the hospital in so much pain. My boyfriend was so worried he slept there every night with me. I never told him I knew it happened because I was drinking so much. I still haven't even though I'm now well past this.

I haven't had a drink since February of this year. The 18th. I decided I didn't want to be my mother or my real father. They were both alcoholics and they both abused drugs. My mother actually gave birth to me high on heroine. Heh. I've been taking my medications every single day. I've been exercising and have actually managed to lose 12lbs. I ride my bike 10 miles at least 3-4 times a week. I've managed to get myself a full time job so I can start fixing my credit. (My mother took cards out in my name, ran them up and never paid me so I could pay them off. I couldn't pay them off because they took every single one of my paychecks.) My relationship with my boyfriend has never been better. I have never felt happier... and yet... I don't really know I guess. I sometimes have these awful thoughts about slamming my head into the tops of the fence. (they have really pointy tops) or using a knife I'm holding to do the same. Sometimes when I'm driving I think if i just flick my wrist BOOM! that'd be it. I don't know why these thoughts happen. They scare the shit out of me. A lot of the time I really don't want to be here because it all just seems so hard. Everything feels like I really have to work at it. I feel so tired all of the time. I feel like there's no point. I don't think that I deserve anything good. I don't think that I deserve to be happy. In my life I have done things that have put me into a category of people who never deserve to be happy and one day I won't be. Things are okay right now, but someone is going to fuck me over. It's like I can feel it in my entire being. The last few weeks have been really hard for me. With the protests going on there have been people fighting at my job. Like actual physical fighting. It triggered something in me. I no longer felt safe at work. I no longer felt safe at home and that made me realize I have never felt safe. I don't know what makes me feel safe. I don't know how to feel safe. Or happy for that matter. I want so badly for my life to have meaning because I sometimes think if I can't find it I'll just find ways to numb myself again. I don't know what to do. My therapist told me to start keeping a journal. I guess this is my version of that. Hoping someone somewhere will know what I'm feeling and offer up anything. Even an "it's gonna be okay bud" would be nice at this point.
