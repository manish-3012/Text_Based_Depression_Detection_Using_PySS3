Me and the girl I have a crush on and the only person I ever told I had suicidal thoughts to had a fight and I don't know what to do.Basically I told her about my suicidal thoughts and today when I sw her I told her I fell and hit my head and showed her the giant bump on my head. Later I told her the truth that I didn't fall and the knot on my head was actually from me punching myself in the head. 

Later on we were talking about how her date hasn't shown up yet and then we had this conversation. 




"If he stands me up i will be so angry. I will get on POF and find some sorry soul and meet up with him and make him give me head and then leave him hanging. I have already thought this through."





I said "I'm on POF LOL"





And then she went on to telling me why we couldn't do that, and then she just left the conversation and I tried to get her to talk and then when she finally came back she said this






"I told you what I was looking for. I'm sorry you don't fit that bill. 99% of all men don't. It's unfortunate  that you developed a crush on me because when it comes to men I'm a stuck up bitch that's why I have been single for 2 years. Most beautiful  woman never are single. It's unfortunate  for me because  you wanna fuck me and make me yours just like every other guy in the world. I couldn't  just have a friendship with you. I was friends with you because you made me feel  appreciated.  And I was benefiting  from being friends with you. But when someone  starts to dragging  me down and comes at me in  emotionally  abusive  manners, I have no need or want for relationships  like that."






And now I don't know what to do.
