Feeling horribleI don't think I wanna live anymore. I've caused too much pain to too many people and I just don't deserve to live anymore.... I wish there was another way to solve this problem but seems like death is the only way out. I just don't know what to do, I feel so helpless. I feel like the world would be a much better place if I just left....I've always felt worthless and pathetic and I feel like ending my life would be so much easier. Thanks for listening to me :(
