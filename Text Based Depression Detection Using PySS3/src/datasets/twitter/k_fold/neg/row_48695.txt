Donâ€™t deserve suicidal feelings?What do you do when you have severe suicidal ideation/thoughts, but to most people, your life seems great and theyâ€™d love to trade places? In other words, you feel like you donâ€™t deserve to have suicidal feelings, that you â€œshouldâ€ be happier and â€œshouldâ€ be grateful for what you have. And yet, you nevertheless do have those awful feelings (itâ€™s not like you chose to have them...they just happen). 

There are things going on with you that others donâ€™t know about (say, chronic health issues that severely impact quality of life) as well as major career troubles, few friends, and a couple of very bad financial investments that continue to haunt. On that last point, as an example, say someone had a million dollars and lost $800k of it, and is suicidal as a result. The average person would say shut up dude, you still have $200k which is more than a lot of people. But the loss was so unbelievably painful that, when combined with other problems, you feel suicidal from the self-loathing for being so stupid. And itâ€™s exacerbated because you have these feelings but feel like you shouldnâ€™t because youâ€™re still better off than others, and certainly canâ€™t express these feelings to anyone who knows you as they would make you seem like youâ€™re overreacting for attention or something.
