I hate livingI've despised being alive since I was ten years old. That's the first time I tried to kill myself. I slit my throat but unfortunately my sister grabbed the knife. I also ate a handful of pills but threw them up. Later at about sixteen I tried to hang myself but the beam broke. Bad luck....  

I thinkk of killing myself on a daily basis but can't handle yet another failure.
