Im feeling more and more terribleIve been so unhappy lately. Mostly id say about my life. Where its going and what ive done with it. I just couldnt get over the feeling that im 25 and i havent done anything, and i dont have anything. Its been tough. Its made it so hard to do anything because i cant get the thought of "whats the point" out of my head. 

As of recent though these thoughts have moved to myself as well, and its pretty obvious why, id say. 

People dont like me. I had terrible anxiety most of my life, and its better now but its still obvious that i dont know how to interact with people in a normal way. I just cant keep anyone around, no matter what i do, and thats if i even get the chance to talk to them in the first place. 

Its killing me. On top of everything i dont have friends and i cant for the life of me make any. I havent been happy in so long and i feel like i dont even deserve to feel bad cause its my life and my fault. I just dont want to feel anything at all. Im done :/
