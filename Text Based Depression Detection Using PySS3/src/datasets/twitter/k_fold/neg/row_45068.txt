I want to stop existing but everyone considers this unfair and reminds me how good and easy I have it compared to so many.This often feels like the problem. I rarely have to scrap or fight for things I want and it has left this empty, pointless feeling of a void to existence. I get how this sounds but I have no drive left..
I feel as if I'm getting worse every day and don't think I'm going to make it through the year. 
I'm sorry, I just needed to get this off my chest
