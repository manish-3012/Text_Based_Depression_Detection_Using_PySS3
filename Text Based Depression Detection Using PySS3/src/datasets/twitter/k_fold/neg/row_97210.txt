Nearing my end I guessIv finally pushed the last person away from me. and I just feel like doing it. I hate myself, I disappoint everyone, and I just dont want to do life anymore. I work a shitty minimum wage job, I'm fat, ugly, and un-talented, I feel like a burden on my family. I'm socially awkward so Its hard for me to make friends, and overall I'm alone, If I do nobody would miss me. Only thing thats probably stopping me is that I don't know how to do it, I don't want it to be long, just quick sweet and to the point, I also could never bring myself to do it.  i'm a burden, the world will be better without me.
