It's long but short if you know what I mean.You see my parents didn't really give a fuck

They use to physically fight all the time, well that's just my luck

Well that's what I get for being born with a silver spoon

That's most of my memory from my childhood

I remember a lot of the fights and the reasons why

And man, the amount of problems they had I ain't gonna lie

I could write a whole fucking list and it wouldn't fit

They say ignorance is bliss so that's why I always get fuckin lit

Not many really knew until recently

Because it's really fucked me up, I live in misery

But it helps me reflect on the person I am

So I can understand others who have also been dealt with a 
shitty hand

Back in school I use to get bullied a lot

It seems everywhere I'd go I got hated on

I was a quiet and shy kid so i got chastisized

And I'll tell you now, suicide was something as a kid that I'd fantasized

I got into trouble a lot even though things were never really my fault

I learned early on that no one will listen even when i told

them the truth because to some they just don't really care

They just wanna let you know their own version of fair

A lot of this stems from my mum n dad

I try to hold a lot of this anomosity within because I know they also had it bad

They remind me n my siblings constantly

Beating us then telling us we had it better than them like honestly

What kinda logic is that? Man it's fuckin whack

I still got scars on my face, hey mum thanks for that

And btw thanks for the name

I spent my entire life even now getting mocked the same

Of course now i get it a lot less

because now I'll fuck with u if u wanna test

One of the things they argued about was that my dad gambled a lot

And another is the fact that my mum donated to her cult like religion and didn't stop

Like really, I'm not even going to get into the list

I just stated these 2 things because I believe they both needed this

Everyone has their own vices and their own escapes

I'm willing to look the other way and let them enjoy their cakes

But if you flip the cards around, Uno they'll reverse it back on to me

Yeah, I'm talking about if they ever found out the shit I did to 
keep my own mind company

But fuck it since this rap is dark anyway

My mum pulled a butcher knife on me since i had somethin to say

She use to grab whatever she could find

Beat me up and then tell me I should be glad that she was kind

How her dad use to beat them up even more

Like really who the fuck is even keeping score?

Left a scar on the bridge of my nose from punching my glasses into my face

Then went back to tell my dad that I hit her, man this bitch has no shame

Every time I'd get sick and if you know me you'll know that I'm weak

She will scold me non stop and then tell me that she cares for me

She will guilt me and shame me as if I did something wrong

I'm literally scared to cough around her and this shit goes on and on

Even to this day, anything that happens to me

I refuse to tell them anything, because they twist it immediately

I am always the bad guy in their eyes

My own dad told me I'm the number 2 reason he hates his life

My mum constantly tells me when I die I'm going straight to hell

What am I to them I can't really tell

I'll be lying if i told you back then I didn't wish them both to be dead

But now that I'm older I just wish my own life to end

I know exactly the way I will do it so I'm taking my time

That's a lie, if you have severe depression you'll know it's a matter of your own damn mind

I refuse to go therapy because I'll never trust them

If you wondering why, I can't even trust my own parents

They've lied to me countless times

They've made up stories of me and told the family lies

They will hear my side and ignore everything I say

Then they will make up their own worst version and call it a day

Just another day of our son being an absolute useless lazy cunt

Even though I've literally been breaking my back but their care is none

I really can go on and on since this is a constant fight

Honestly... this is a tunnel where I don't see a light

I was planning on offing myself on my 31st

But I didn't end up going through with it, it would've been the worst

I guess I'm still too weak to even make the leap

No I'm not talking about jumping from a thousand feet

I know the best way to finish the job

After all these years, you really think i wouldn't have figured my own send off?

I don't even know why I bother writing all of this

I guess it helps keep my mind off of thinking worser things

I stopped the weed just to keep my damn head straight

Even though the reason was to keep it from doing so in the first place

But I can't let it consume me because I can't

See myself become an addict since that's a trap

Every time I write here I feel like such a sook

I actually have almost 0 self esteem even though now i got the looks

Now i got the attitude and I got the confidence

At least on the outside I can make it seem more prominent

Cuz on the inside I'm fucking dead as hell

I've gone through so many bad break ups and had so many friendships that fell

You might think these things aren't that big a deal

Every one goes through the same, come on let's be real

Well if you actually been through some real shit too

Then you'll be more understanding of the shit that I been through

I've noticed a lot of people who haven't been through much

Are quick to disregard, they're basically in a sense out of touch

But like I say ignorance is bliss so actually I am envious

Of all your happy families, I hate coping with this

Maybe in my next life I can feel the same

Then I can also turn my back and say that this shit's lame

I've had so many people try and downplay the shit I tell them

Even though I downplay most of the shit that I felt then

So this is why I try to keep shit to myself

Hearing others question me when I'm opening myself is really not good for my health

So this is why I write here when I'm sad

So I don't have to hear people telling me that I ain't really got it that bad

Fuck all of you who doubted me

Although I know it's because you were born from a different tree

It's getting late now and I can't sleep

Maybe it'll be easier 6 feet deep
