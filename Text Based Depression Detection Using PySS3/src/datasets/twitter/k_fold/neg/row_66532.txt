General thoughts.Iâ€™m in constant pain everyday. My joints and muscles always ache. Iâ€™ve always had migraines but theyâ€™re getting worse and have more symptoms like light headedness and dizziness. Iâ€™ve been eating less and less each day I have no appetite at all I look sickly all the time. My memory has gotten worse. I canâ€™t remember my childhood at all. I canâ€™t remember things iâ€™ve read over and over again. My grades are slipping. Not that it matter because my attendance is poor too. During the summer I got my life on track in a way. Went to the psychiatrist but shortly after overdosed on pills. I wish I died I got scared because my heart started beating really fast. Iâ€™m scared to go back because I donâ€™t want to talk about it and what if she knows about it? I only talked to her once she was really nice. She said I had bipolar disorder and some type of anxiety and she wanted to follow up. I had an appointment but I didnâ€™t go. I have friends but I always say no to hang out with them. Iâ€™m a terrible friend. At home things arenâ€™t good. I could write a book detailing everything but my mom is a horrible person. Nobody does anything about it. My dad is growing older and it scares me if he dies I donâ€™t know how iâ€™ll live.
