Sad, lonely, tired, had enough.Some days this all feels like a nightmare. Honestly even just moving I feel pain. I'm trying to hard to be a good person. I haven't drank alcohol in 70 days. Trying to deal with my emotions raw now and it's just too much. 

I have a small family. A mom who spends her entire days on the computer with her crime sleuthing forum, or bitching at me. My little sister who use to think the world of me rarely picks up the phone anymore. My aunt who was a second mom to me passed away in march.

I'm 27 and I spent the last 5 years of my life in a deep dark depression I can't escape. I turned to alcohol and ruined any relationships I had left. I ruined my relationship with a guy I love so much. He won't even talk to me anymore and keeps me hanging on a string with "maybe" responses. I can't even escape by sleeping because I will either dream about him or my aunt and I just wake up crying. 

I feel like any day now I'm going to loose it and quit my job and end it all. I don't even have a decent schedule or routine. I'm not eating or doing anything. Nothing gives me joy anymore. Crying seems futile. This is the first time I can't even cry. Nothing bad happened today I just feel completely numb. Talking to someone requires money  and even then I don't want to be too honest and get thrown in the psych ward. 

I'm just done with this all... I want to wake up from this nightmare, I just wan't to go.
