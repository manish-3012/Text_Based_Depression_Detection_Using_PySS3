I am sick of being a burden.All I ever do is make my friend worry. I am always bothering her with my constant overthinking of every little thing I say or do. All I ever do is take up her time and give nothing of use back. And the worst is that I will go back and overthink the exact same thing less than a day later. I am constantly apologizing to her and she will say it's fine, but I know that no one can handle this for very long. Is there even a point to going on if all I am is a burden?
