Lingering thoughts.I might as well do it, suicide, because there is honestly nothing for me to gain,or lose, in this world.

My grades have gone to shit due to me slacking and putting work off till the last minute. I'm struggling to pay attention and staying focused on what ever I'm doing. 

I overthink every situation I put myself in. It's now a tendency to hurt myself and my feelings because I keep overthinking about it. I feel like I have strained my relationship with my best friend, but he says it's fine. But I can't accept it, it's not fine. ITS NEVER FINE. Why does he freaking choose to be my friend, I have been nothing more than shit and a downer. I don't deserve all my "friends" attention and sympathy. It's just a waste, just like myself. 

I am mentally struggling with myself- I'm trying to find out who I am, and trying to find out what people see in me. In this mess we call [Freklot]. - and I am so dependent on people that with out attention I'm lost. 

When I'm alone I feel worthless and lonely. I feel like my presence is not needed and that everything would do well without me - because no one ever asks me for anything, I have to force my presence to be acknowledged- and that no one will notice me disappearing. I feel like I'm just here to bring everyone down and that no one actually cares about me.

 I am so close to persuading myself that I actually don't have any friends, and that they're just being there to be nice to me. 

In this world I feel alone. In this world I feel worthless. In this world I am torn. I'm probably better of dead. Because hell is already where I'm 'predestined' to go, because I am gay, and that's where all abominations go. Right?

I have always thought about suicide, but this time it's strong and serious. I might as well do it during the break. No one will notice. I'm just a Junior in high school, no one would care.
