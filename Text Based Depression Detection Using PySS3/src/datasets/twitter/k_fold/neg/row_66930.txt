I wish my brother lived instead of meI am not suicidal, but the thought of why the fuck am I even here always crosses my mind. When I was 2 years old my 10 year old brother past from cancer. I was told he was the nicest boy, he prayed for a younger brother, wanted to work as an ice cream truck man to see the smile on kids faces. I wonder he would think of me now. 2 years ago I recovered from depression, but each day iâ€™m starting to feel weaker and weaker. Although I try my hardest to power through it. It feels like I canâ€™t do anything
