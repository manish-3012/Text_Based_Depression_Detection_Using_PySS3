LostI first became depressed at the age of 6 or 7 and had mentioned suicide to my mom sometime around my 8th birthday. Iâ€™m 22 now and suicidal thoughts have always been scratching in my mind. I hear â€œkill yourselfâ€ literally spoken in my head so many times every day. I have a family that loves me but I have no emotional connection with any of them, though I do feel some sort of love or responsibility for them. Iâ€™ve distanced myself from them unintentionally over the last 10 years from extreme anxiety and how I seem to explode on them when I become stressed.

I started to get to know this girl, long distance, I know, but there was a real connection. I ruined it with my commitment issues and anxiety to meet her. Thereâ€™s a little more to it than this but Iâ€™m not good at expressing my feelings and especially writing them. 

I donâ€™t know what more there is to say. I started taking Zoloft, I feel different but not better. The thoughts and feelings are still there but I feel completely frozen and suppressed when they come on hard.

I guess this is my cry for help, my other cries havenâ€™t been enough and I feel physically unable to reach out to someone in person. I feel embarrassed or that Iâ€™m overreacting.
