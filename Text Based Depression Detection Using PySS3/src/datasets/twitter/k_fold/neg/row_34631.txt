My life is just embarrassingIâ€™m 21 now. And it blows my mind how fast life has moved for me. I know every mistake or decision I make is my own but at the same time some are just out of my control. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m this old now and donâ€™t have anyone to rely to except my own parents. Life is truly strange for me. On top of that I now realize that u canâ€™t survive without friends.... i wasnâ€™t really happy where I was at my first college and so my parents decided to move to a different city and I tried hard in college but taking a semester off to start off in a new city was not a good idea. I took what I had for granted and now I have to pay the price....I ended up losing all my work ethic for school that was built. The structure that I once had is gone. Although Iâ€™m blessed to be with a dad that provides a lot and does pretty much everything I realized due to my introversion and addiction to pmo I never truly managed to connect with anyone in my early childhood and teenage years. Now that Iâ€™m sort of an adult, itâ€™s incredibly awkward now... Now Iâ€™m depressed everywhere I go. Itâ€™s even worse since Iâ€™m a paki. Weâ€™re known to be very sophisticatedly smart people.... and I sort of ended up dropping out school because I was tired of studying all the time all alone in the library I fell behind in one class and went into a full panick mode for the rest of the semester.... I feel like I ruined myself to the point where I just feel like I just donâ€™t want to continue on anymore..... I feel like my hole life Iâ€™ve been just watching a movie of other peopleâ€™s liveâ€™s. I just feel awful about myself and I donâ€™t know what can change that now... I feel like I donâ€™t even know who I am anymore...
