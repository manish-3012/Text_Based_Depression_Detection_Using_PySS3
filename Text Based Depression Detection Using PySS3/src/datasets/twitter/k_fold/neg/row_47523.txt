I wish I had the bravery to jumpI've been struggling to find a job, and I graduate in May. I made a good connection last week but of course my GPA must've made them not pick me since it isn't that great. These are the times when I want to jump. I just wish I wasn't so scared of death. If I wasn't scared of death then I would've jumped a long time ago.
