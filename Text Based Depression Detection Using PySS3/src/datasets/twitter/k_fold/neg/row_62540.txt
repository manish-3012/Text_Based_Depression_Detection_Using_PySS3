I need your advice/opinion please! I'm desperate.I hope you can take the time to read this... I'm aware that it probably ain't all that fun.  
I feel stuck and I really need some input on my situation.  
I'm an 18 year old male. I've stopped going to school and the last year I've managed to pass was 3rd secondary (I assume that's like year 10) so I've got no diploma. I had trouble at school because of my mental health. I now feel extremely hopeless... I'm planning on starting studies next year (September) but I'm scared. When I was in school, I ended up randomly crying in class (hiding my face) or during breaks in the bathrooms. Now I spend my days at home doing nothing, waiting for time to pass by... waiting to die... but I'm not ready to end things. There's still a small side of me who's willing to fight back and wants things to get better but the other bad side heavily outweighs it. I may have a few hours a day when I feel okay and ready to make things better for myself but then randomly comes the bad thoughts (constant thoughts of my life being over, no way things will ever get better and suicide thoughts to make it short). And that basically destroys any hope of me changing things for the better.  
I'm scared that things won't ever get better... I really want them to. There's so much I want... so many simple things (boyfriend aka love, friends, simply being a bit happy with my days). It's all I'm asking for... and yet it seems impossible to obtain (which I'm sure some of you also feel). Things any human should have the right to feel and have.  
To make things short: I want to change things and feel better but my constant negative thoughts are DESTROYING any hope for that. I need your input, I'm desperate.
