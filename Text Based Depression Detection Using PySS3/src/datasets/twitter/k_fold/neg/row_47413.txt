I am truly, absolutely, incredibly, utterly tired.I am so tired of everything. I feel like shit all the time. I'm ugly, have no qualities whatsoever and am nothing but a burden to everyone around me. No one truly likes me, they all pretend to because they're too nice to tell me how they really feel about me. No one has ever liked me back, I'm 19 and I've never even kissed anyone in my whole life. I know it seems silly to say it like this but all my friends have, and they're all so pretty, nice, smart, feminine and lovely.

I have been feeling like this since I was around 13/14. I've had ups and downs, things have gotten better but now I feel like they've never been worse. I don't want this. I don't want this. I don't wanna die, I just don't wanna live as myself. I'd give anything to be someone else.

I am prescribed Xanax for my anxiety disorder. I usually take 0.5mg/1mg a day, but these past few days I've been using more and more just to feel high. Two days ago I took 13.5mg. (I ended up fine, I called the poison center bc I didn't wanna kms but I'm fine now) Anyways I got so high that I texted my friend a bunch of bullshit, basically that I felt like I had to conform to society's standards of femininity otherwise I was worthless, that I wasn't conventionally attractive and tired of it, that I was tired of feeling different and that I should just do everything society expects me to do and be as a girl. Yeah, I was really high and that was embarrassing lmao.

I had promised myself that I would stop telling my friends about my "problems" and my worries because I didn't wanna be a burden to them, and yet again, I broke that promise. 

Oh, and I have my exams starting in 10 days which I'm probably going to fail as well because I haven't been able to study. Academics, the only thing I'm usually good at, will be gone as well.

I am nothing and worth nothing. Nothing more than a useless piece of shit.
