Not muchHello, to start off I am 22, f. Ever since elementary I have been suicidal. When I was 5 I was molested by my cousin, and he never got in trouble for it because supposedly my aunt was going to "take care of it." It was never taken care of. Once I reached 12 years old I was bullied in elementary school and all throughout highschool for being shy and "weird." My parents also got addicted to pain pills and heroin, my sister and I were placed with over 5 different foster families up until i was 14 years old. One of my brothers was placed with my grandfather. My other two brothers were adopted sadly and I have never saw them since they were 9 months and 3 years old. I was 15 I found out I was pregnant. The father of my child and I stayed together throughout that and after our first child was 2 i found out I was having another baby. While I was pregnant with the second baby he left me for another woman. We eventually got back together and i unfortunately fell pregnant for the 3rd time at 20 years old. While I was pregnant with the third he cheated on me once again and I had to move in with my parents which have been clean for 5 years now today. Anyways, everyone in my life has left, cheated on me, or have felt pity for me and was nice to me just because of my past. I feel as though there is no reason to live. I have 3 children at the age of 22, im turning 23 this month. I do not have a license so I cannot drive therefore I cannot get a job. My kids father has a gf and they both have jobs and a nice home. My children would be better without me. I cant even do basic things like do the laundry, or make dr appointments. There is absolutely no reason to be here. No matter what I do there is no reason to be around, no one would remember me or care if I were gone. I contribute nothing to society or to anyone's lives. I hate myself
