Iâ€™m really worried about school todayIâ€™m worried for several reasons 
1. Huge Covid-19 infection rate 
2. Work
3. People
4. Plans I made

Okay the first three are reasonable but I told myself that Iâ€™d either self harm or attempt to do something worse today at school. And I made a promise to myself that if I donâ€™t do one of the two Iâ€™m not allowed to eat for 3 days. I mean sure I can break both of those but like FUCK why do I do this shit to myself. (Btw itâ€™s like 2:40 A.M. rn and school starts at 7:30 A.M.)
