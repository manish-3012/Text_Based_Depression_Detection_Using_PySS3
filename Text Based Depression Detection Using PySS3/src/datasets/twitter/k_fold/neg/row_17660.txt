REALLY Fucking Pissed OffMy country has legal euthanasia, given that you have a terminal illness or a serious psychological disorder. Gave me a call today, explaining that mental health isn't a valid reason.

Ok. Fine then. I'll keep moping around the city, getting in people's way and acting my normal dumbass self until I die of some stupid accident or painful disease.

I will continue to cut and burn myself. I will continue to want to die. Fuck you and your stupid fucking lazy ass legislation. My life is garbage, and I will fucking commit suicide whether you fucking like it or whether you fucking don't like it. Only now? You're fucking guilty for putting potential motorists at harm, train drivers, and normal bystanders at harm. I have no idea when I'm going to break down. 

Even if I jump into a river tonight, there's going to be a wholly unnecessary emergency report when I could have just died safely in s hospital bed and donated my organs easily. 

I hate myself. I want to fucking die. I HATE MYSELF. I WANT TO FUCKING DIE. I'M TIRED OF BEING STALKED AND CONTROLED. I WANT TO DIE.
