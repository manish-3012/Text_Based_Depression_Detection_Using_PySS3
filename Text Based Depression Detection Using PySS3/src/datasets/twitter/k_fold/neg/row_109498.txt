I prayed for the first time since I was like 9.I don't know to who or what. I just prayed, asked, begged over and over again for whoever or whatever was up there, or down there, or just anyone who could hear me to take me tonight. To let me die. To let this day be my last. Over and over again, it's the hardest I've ever prayed, the most desperate I've ever been. I stopped believing in God when I was 10. As an avid and and proud atheist, you cannot imagine the fucking hurt and desperateness I am in to have done that. I wasn't sure who I was talking to. God, Allah, Satan, the Grim Reaper, Zeus. I didn't care. I'm setting an alarm for 4 hours from now. I just want this to be over.
