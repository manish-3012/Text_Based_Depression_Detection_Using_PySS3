A projection.I am not angry anymore, not sad... not anything. It's as if my body has accepted its death but my mind still wants to fight it. I truly hope that before the year ends that I die. I don't care if it's quick or painful, gruesome or peaceful, I just want to be dead. Speaking it into existence. I just wanna get away from here, since I was twelve I've wanted to die... so please, let me.
