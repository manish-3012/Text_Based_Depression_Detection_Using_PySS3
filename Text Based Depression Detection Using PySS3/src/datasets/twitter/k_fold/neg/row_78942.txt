COVID-19 has taken away almost everything good that I achieved in my life and I will probably be worse off after the pandemic ends. Why shouldnâ€™t I kill myself?I had a fantastic, well-paying job for a couple of years. When the pandemic hit, I got stood down indefinitely. My employer promised that I will be able to come back to work but I suspect they will either forget about me or not have the money by the time the pandemic ends. 

My attempts to find steady work have failed. I probably wonâ€™t ever be able to find a job in my field again. Nobody ever seems to have a vacancy. My skills probably just arenâ€™t viable in the job market.

Everything I have achieved over the years, both financially and vocationally, has been snatched from me. What is the point of persisting when my efforts are consistently fruitless? Why shouldnâ€™t I just save myself the trouble and just end it?
