I just took an online test which told me I have a "Serious Suicidal Ideation"Title says it all, really. The test that I took is [this](http://www.fmpml.org.au/sites/default/files/files/MSSI.pdf) (it's a PDF). According to the metric laid out in the test, any score above 20 is to be considered "Severe Suicidal Ideation" (I scored 29), with several additional criteria bumping it up to "Serious Suicidal Ideation".

I don't know what I expected when I took this test. I've been having these thoughts for quite a long time at intermittent stages, however in the past few days it's just been gnawing at me. There are definitely reasons that stop me and will likely continue to stop me from acting on these thoughts, so don't jump out of your seat thinking I'm an immediate risk. Thoughts of suicide and the sweet embrace of death are constants in my life at this point, to the extent that I feel warm and comfortable when I think of dying. Wow, that's pretty fucked up now that I type it out,

I don't know what this post is intended to accomplish. Bragging rights maybe? I've always scored well on tests...
