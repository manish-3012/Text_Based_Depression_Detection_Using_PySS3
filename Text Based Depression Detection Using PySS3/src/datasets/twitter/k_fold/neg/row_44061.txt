Horrible intrusive thoughtsI donâ€™t know how to shake these feelings of self doubt and malice towards my own ego. I have nothing to be angry about or depressed. I have a working brain, all 4 limbs and I breathe and think and walk just like everyone else. My parents have money. My family loves me and has never hurt my physically. But the thought of continuing this viscous cycle of self hate and uncertainty makes it seems like a gun under my chin is the only reasonable option. I lack determination. Motivation. Tenacity. Iâ€™m just a Blob of flesh that floats through life and never plans ahead or can think without a screaming voice telling me I donâ€™t have the will. It feels like a version of me is beating another, more innocent version with a metal rod until Iâ€™m just a puddle of blood. I feel guilty for being depressed when so many people have less and make it work. I feel like a parasite to my parents hard work, and I just want these feelings to stop. I want to feel joy again.
