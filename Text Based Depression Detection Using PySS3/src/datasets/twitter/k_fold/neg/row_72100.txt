What do you do when the thoughts get really intense? When feeling you can't take it anymore? Been having some days where it lasts a couple hours, but about a couple weeks ago it lasted for days and days, NONSTOP, and I was really sure I was going to do it.The thought of doing it brought a sense of relief; a sense of calm I hadn't really had before.

I don't think I want to die...had and have to remember that the depressive and feelings of hopelessness are *because of depression. 

Id like to know if you guys have some coping strategies; some other ways to help the feelings stop, or to weather the relentless storm. It has been less intense than a week before---that was the height so far---but I'm still getting them.

I would wait. One minute. One more minute. One more. 

But...it almost wasn't enough. And that's scary to think about. It's was very...'comforting' to think about, in a way, too.
