Scared to attempt again and failingI have had depression for 9 years now. In that time I have attempted suicide by overdoses,  cutting, crashing my car and investing poisonous seeds. 

The last attempt was supposed to be certain, the Dr's were confused as to why I survived (I think I bought some dodgy seeds from amazon).

After the fallout from each attempt I am honestly more scared of failure than dying.

If I could take a magic pill and never wake up I would. I font know what to do. 

I feel like I'm in s suicide limbo....
