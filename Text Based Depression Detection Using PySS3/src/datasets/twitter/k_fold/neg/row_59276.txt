Sorry if this doesn't belong here.I think I dont want to die, but IDK. Im staying alone in a friend's house (she let me stay here while she is gone, because Im going through a break up of a long term relationship and I dont have a place of my own) 
Im here in this  8th floor, and I cant help wonder how would feel If I jump.  And it is a current thought that I have , thinking of different ways to die. I never attempt against my life, but scares me that im feeling very lonley, a failure in so many aspects of my life. Maybe the easiest thing to do is just end it for good. 

IDK , its common to think that? Are this kind of thought going to increase? 


Sorry for my possible mistakes, Im not a native English speaker.
