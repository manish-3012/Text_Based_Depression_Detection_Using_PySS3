Finally got a syringe, crushing the pills, waiting to eat my last meal.Hope you guys are having I great moment, I am too. I finally had the will to make it happen. I wanted to do this for soooo long. There is so much I wanna say to you;

people will lie to you all the time, even your parents, your best friends, you are truly alone in here. We are made to think for ourself before anyone else, and this is true in ANY situation. Trust me, I learned the hard way.

There is no god, at least none that care about its creation.

All of your action will be soothen and forgotten by time.

I hope you that are reading this will find some sort of happiness or meaning to it all, I truly hope it.

I will meet you all in a couple of years, I loved humans but I personnally can't be anymore.

here is the dirty syringe I will use: https://imgur.com/QAKeCmB
