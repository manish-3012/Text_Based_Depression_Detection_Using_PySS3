I didn't want to do a bad thingI have wanted to put an end to my loneliness for a while. tonight my friend introduced me to a girl who was very drunk and split recently with an ex. we all went to my place after me and her kissed a lot. she sits on his lap and kisses him. he says lets go to mine. i could have ended my loneliness briefly but held back because she was too drunk. i just filled the bathtub and just rested on the edge of the water. i couldn't drown myself. fucking coward
