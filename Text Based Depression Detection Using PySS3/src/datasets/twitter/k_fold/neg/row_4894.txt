I want to dieHi reddit. Two days ago i was discharged from the army for a decline in mental health. I was hospitalized twice. Once for self mutilation and the other was a failed suicide attempt as two battle buddies found me hanging from the bathroom post. I wish they hadn't found me.

I'm not angry, I just have no desire to live anymore, I don't want therapy, I don't want drugs, I don't want anything preventing me from dying. I want to slip away. I feel completely lost.
