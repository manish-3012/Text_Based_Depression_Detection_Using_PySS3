I have to leave.I can't stay here. I'm supposed to go away. Multiple events have tried to convince me that this [life] is not something for me. I am a mistake. No social life. No friends. They always stop talking to me after a few weeks. No diploma. No job. I am going nowhere in life. I have to end it. I have to leave. It's where I'm supposed to go.
