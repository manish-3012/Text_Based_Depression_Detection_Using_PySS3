A letter to myself. I know you have asked many times why I choose to hurt myself so I thought it would be helpful to get it off my chest.


 Though the feeling isn't the most pleasurable sensation, the trail of blood that follows is. When the blood escapes, all my stress and anxiety and worries go with it. I'm left feeling calm.  Finally I can breathe again. It's especially rewarding when I'm feeling depressed but I can't cry, which is usually always. Unfortunately, this calmness washes away. Starting the cycle all over.


 With my depression it's pretty common to feel disconnected or numb to reality. The physical pain brings me back. It is a reminder that I am still alive, which often disappoints. 

 I know it's not healthy to harm myself at any sign of trouble. I just cannot stop. It's my addiction, my vice. I cannot stop. But I want and need to.
