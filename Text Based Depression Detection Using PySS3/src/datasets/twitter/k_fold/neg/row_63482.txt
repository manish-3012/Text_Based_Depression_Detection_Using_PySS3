Iâ€™m worthlessDonâ€™t delete this. Iâ€™m gonna die young. What to say. First of all I want to say you people are lucky. You have a job maybe. You have a good family? You have faith? No major disabilities? More than 1 person who truly cares for you maybe. A chance at life maybe? A car? A house? A pet maybe. Do you have water or food? I donâ€™t. I tried living... but itâ€™s too late.
