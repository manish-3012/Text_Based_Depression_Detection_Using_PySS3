Iâ€™m so lost and Iâ€™m so...done.I have a gun. An old neighbor gave it to me â€œfor protectionâ€ when I moved; Iâ€™ve always hated guns.

Tonight I put that motherfucker to my head and, unloaded, pulled the trigger. Just to see how easy it would be to end this. I ended up telling my best friend but as with all my friends sheâ€™s hundreds of miles away. I genuinely feel like for me, the end by my own hand is simply just a matter of time. Iâ€™ve tried before; two or three times. Always was found; didnâ€™t take enough; you know. Now Iâ€™m 32 fucking years old and see nothing to look forward to. My partner left me when he went to rehab for the billionth time. Although we speak casually I feel a huge hole where he was supposed to occupy space with me. What was I to him? Just some mommy stand-in? None of my friends - no one actually - knows how truly bad this is. And Iâ€™m so so so FUCKING SICK of hearing cAlL a hOtLinE like lol ok buddy those are such a joke it offensive. 

Iâ€™m a fucking mental health worker. Iâ€™m supposed to have to together by now. I survived so many horrific things in my life but I wish I hadnâ€™t. When yet another one of my close friends died a few weeks ago, you know what my first thought was? Before anything else? I was fucking jealous.

I think I am beyond help. When I was 11 I clearly remember telling my friends at a sleepover that one day I would kill my self. That shit isnâ€™t normal. I feel bound to this stupid miserable fate no matter what I try to do to fight it.

Will it ever get better?! Please help me, please...the only reason Iâ€™m still here is so my family doesnâ€™t have to suffer. Please give me another reason to keep trying.
