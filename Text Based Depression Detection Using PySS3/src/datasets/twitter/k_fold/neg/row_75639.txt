Rather than deal with coronavirus, I want to dieMy life is a shambles. Girlfriend I thought I was going to marry left me for reasons I believe are solvable  


Now the coronavirus is here, rather than wait it out for 18 months in misery I just want to die. It's perfect for me because I don't want a funeral (I don't like a fuss being made about me) either
