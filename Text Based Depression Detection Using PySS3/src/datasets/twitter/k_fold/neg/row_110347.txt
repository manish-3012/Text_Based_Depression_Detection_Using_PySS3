SuicidalI bought a gun and bullets this week but the only reason I haven't shot myself is because with my luck I would not die and would just become a vegetable and make my life worst. I want to die but I don't know what will happen when I die or if I would just injure myself. Life never really gets better so I hate when people say that and I hate when people say its only temporary because really happiness is only temporary and pain last forever.
