Don't see a good reason to keep on goingI've kinda done everything I wanted to do. And I'm still just grossed out by living in this world. Everything feels wrong and disgusting. I have friends, family, everything you could possibly want, and I still just want to die. To be honest, it brings me a sick sense of joy knowing that people would be unhappy with me dying. I've talked to a lot of people about suicide in private, and the answers are all garbage. 

I don't want to encounter anything difficult or annoying. I've had enough of trying. I used to be a straight A student, but in my last year of college i just gave up. Why even bother? For some people I dont even care about?

Soon enough I'm gonna get the virus, I kinda wanna avoid that, so, to be honest, I just wanna end it soon. Screw all of you. I hope this entire world burns to death.
