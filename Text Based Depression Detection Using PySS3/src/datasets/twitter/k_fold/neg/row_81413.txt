Feeling pretty badIâ€™m sitting on the couch in hysterics right now, trying to decide if I should go to the ER. History of PTSD and bipolar disorder. My psychiatrist is changing my meds around lately (due to tardive dyskinesia), and my therapist has been out of town for a month due to a death in the family. 

Iâ€™m in a very bad work situation and trying desperately to get out. I gave notice but they begged me to stay on until they found someone new. Itâ€™s so bad that Iâ€™d literally rather die than go back in one more day, but thereâ€™s no one else who can do payrollâ€”which has to be done by tomorrow or no one gets paid. 

I also have an interview this afternoon with two senior VPâ€™s of a large organization. I donâ€™t know why they want to interview an administrative assistant, but there it is. Itâ€™s the third interview before they make their decision, and I desperately need this job. 

I took my Ativan and am starting to calm down slightly, but as soon as I think about going to work and this interview, I lose it again. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. If I go to the ER, one of two things will happen: they will blow me off (which they have a reputation for) or they will admit me. If the ER blows me off I will feel even worse (which could lead to a suicide attempt). If they admit me I wonâ€™t be able to run payroll, and no one at work will get paid this week. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. The anxiety is overwhelming but I feel like thereâ€™s nowhere to go for help.
