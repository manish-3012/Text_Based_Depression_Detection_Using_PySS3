need orientation on how to help a friendThough we're brazilian, my friend lives in Germany. She texted me today and said she got locked up on a psychiatric hospital forcibly because of suicide risk and just came out today. I think she might have tried suicide and failed. All of this is because of her ex, Kurt. She cheated on Jan, her bf of 5 years with that guy and was devastated Jan broke up, but Kurt decided to be her new bf, so she coped with it. Kurt was an abusive jerk and screwed her over before breaking up with her and now she has been depressed. I tried suggesting her to come back to Brazil, but she says she has to get her masters degree there before she considers leaving Germany for good. I've been in a pretty similar position, but I went to a psychologist and idk what was the thing that made me stop seeing the world as this terrible place. I need some help to convince her not to harm herself and to consider the thought of taking a break from Germany, since she has no one close to help her over there.
