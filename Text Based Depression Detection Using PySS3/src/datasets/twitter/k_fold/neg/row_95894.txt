I don't want to die, I think21 f here.

As the title says, I think deep down, I don't want to die. But at the same time, I really really want to. I had often fantasised about running away and getting incurrable amnesia but obviously, killing oneself seems easiest. These past few days have been especially hard, for some reason. I always try to remind myself of how much I love nature, and the sky when it turns that nice greenish hue around the mountains as the sun goes down. And how much I like the rain, or ballet, or my cat. And that being so utterly alone is a normal thing and to remember my favourite quote; "family not by blood, but by bond". Or, however it goes. I don't know. But with everything going on (or not, in this case), I feel like I'm never going to feel better. I have a bad habit of being nostalgic, and dwelling in the past and it's making everything seem pointless and irreversible. Even as I write this I'm a gross mess. I haven't showered or eaten, my heads pounding. I'm only 21 but I've felt this way for years. I can't exist anymore, I guess. I don't know.
