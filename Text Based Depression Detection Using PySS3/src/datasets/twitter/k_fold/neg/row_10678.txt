What do I doIm a 33 year old Male with no career and no one near me to help.  I am in the process of getting divorced and have 2 kids that I will never see again when I move away.  I've tried to kill myself when I was 19 and fucked it up and just got really sick. I tried again last night and the knife broke on me.  I don't want to die I just want to be happy and make someone else happy. I fucked everything up in my life and now I'm back to the place I was at when I was 19. Every minute of the day I look up the least painful way to do it.  I talked to my friend today and she talked me down.. but I can't rely on that every time. Im drowning in my own thoughts.. they are all terrible. I don't want to hurt..
