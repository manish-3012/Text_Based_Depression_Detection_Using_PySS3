Even if it does get better, so what?I think *anhedonia* is the term. I don't even feel happy when I get things right. Doing the things I used to love doesn't feel the same anymore. There is no enthusiasm to go to places or learn a new skill. When I do something, it's more of 'obliged' than 'interested'. Even if my chronic illness is in remission, I am nowhere deterred from putting off plans to end my life.
