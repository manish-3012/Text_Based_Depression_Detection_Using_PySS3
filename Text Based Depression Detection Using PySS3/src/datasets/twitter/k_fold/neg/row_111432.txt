How am I supposed to make it through each day if I've lost the ability to feel anythingI haven't felt happiness for over 7 years, I've dropped out of school and I've lost interest in any hobby I've ever had. 

To make up for this I've been forcing myself to be in constant sadness every day. Sadness was all I had, it was a comfortable feeling... it was a feeling. But a few weeks ago I lost the ability to feel sad, I've done research and found out that I've become numb, most likely due to recent stressful events that I don't want to go into detail with. I hate it. I feel every second slowly passing by. I have nothing to comfort me and I don't know what to do except to turn to self harm since it's the only thing that gives me feeling anymore.
