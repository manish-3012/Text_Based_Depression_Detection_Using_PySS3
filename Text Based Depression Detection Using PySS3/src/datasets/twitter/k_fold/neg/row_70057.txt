I've been feeling very depressed lately and I have no idea how to deal with this.I don't know for how long I've felt this emptiness inside of me. It's as if I'm completely useless to everyone around me and the only
time someone needs me is probably related to chores or schoolwork. There isn't really anything that I find worth living for - I live in a country with no perspective, I'm failing at school and my peers are either bullying me or not giving a damn about me. And the rest of people around are simply watching from the side. I've done a lot for the people around me - ranging from functioning as a family member to frequently helping with various different things, even when not asked. But despite my attempts at being useful, I've only been met with more and more criticism or ignorance. No one cares about me besides my family members. 

The issue is that I've been having this feeling for months and right now I'm going through a very important year in school. This week I'm also writing an entrance exam to a very important school and I have no idea if I'll be able to pass it. Besides that, I'm not doing well at school - my grades have been on a decline and I'm getting a lot of flak due to it (I'm known as a very intelligent and smart student, usually with high grades). 

I feel unneeded to people around me. I never get any attention and I spend more and more time online to compensate the lack of real friends and social anxiety. At times people make it seem like world would be better without me. 

I am still attending school and I have no idea to solve this issue. I don't want to talk to my parents about it since I feel very uncomfortable while talking and I've told them way too many times that I feel good and have no life issues. If I told people from my class about it I'd be made fun of. I have no friends who would listen to me besides anonymous strangers from online.
