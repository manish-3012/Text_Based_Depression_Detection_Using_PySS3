There is no hope for me anymore.I've tried so many things already and they've all failed. My life is a disaster and my attempts to make it better failed. I've called out for help so many times, no one answers no one cares. All signs point to me being better off dead. All I have to do is get in my car and drive as far away as possible. No more waiting, tonight is the night.
