Why?Every attempt I make to do something to feel better is only temporary, and I just dread it when the late night comes. I hit absolute rock bottom, drowning in my own doubt and belief that I am nothing. 

I'm told that 'everything will be fine' or 'you just need to let it out'. Well, neither of those things are right. I wish it were that simple. I'm told by all of these people that they would miss me if I were to disappear, but I don't believe them. 

I was told in high school by one guy that didn't really like me, that I was the 'biggest excuse for a human being'. That sticks with me to this fucking day. I acted like I didn't care being told that, but the more I think about it, the more I believe it.

I'm just some 18 year old guy that has absolutely nothing. I'm just a fucking burden; and it doesn't help that these feelings are going to be with me for the rest of my life. I've never had a girlfriend, never gone on a date, never held hands with a girl, never had anyone express even a sliver of interest in me. My family 'supports' me but that doesn't fucking matter to me. I'm just numb to everything. 

I'm honestly thinking that killing myself is the only way out. I hate myself so much I can barely force myself out of bed each day, knowing that I'll just waste another day doing nothing, trying hopelessly to find a job somewhere. Every time I look in the mirror I just stare at myself, wondering where it all went wrong. 

And above all else, I just ask myself over and over... Why?
