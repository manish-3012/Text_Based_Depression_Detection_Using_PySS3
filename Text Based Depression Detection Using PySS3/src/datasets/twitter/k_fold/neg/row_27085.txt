I'm just so sad and I feel broken, life doesn't seem worth living.I feel like a part of me is just damage and filthy and broken and that I can't fix it. There's so much shit in my past that went wrong that I've bene dealing with and trying to just let go because there is no way I can work though it all. But I just feel like I've lost purity or wholesomeness and I feel like I'm just this depressed mess that I can't fix. I'm 18, none of my family knows that I'm depressed or have any mental issues, it's been so hard to live with them because they argue constantly and make a really unhappy living environment. I finally got good friends that love and support me and they know about my awful depression but we're all graduating this year and I'm so so so afraid to lose my friends because I don't even want to make new ones. Life doesn't seem worth it anymore, I don't get the point of it all, I'm just going to die one day and there's not much of a difference if I do it know, and I know it would upset so many people and I feel so bad about that but I just don't want to live at all anymore. We work so hard in life for nothing, so many people are hardly ever happy with their job or house or whatever else, this world is not forgiving or kind. I do not want to be a part of a place like this, I'm so exhausted.
