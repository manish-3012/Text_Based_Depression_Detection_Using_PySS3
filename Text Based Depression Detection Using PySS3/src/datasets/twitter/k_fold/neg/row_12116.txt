I just want to jump off a building and die.I've been thinking about killing myself for several years now. I have nothing. I work hard but can't afford anything. I buy food but it's just barely enough to survive. I have no family. They are all dead. I just hang out after work in different shelters or I go and sleep in a dugout of a baseball field not far from work. I really hate life. I've been looking for a new job for a little over 10 years now. I can't find anything that pays enough to allow me to have an apartment. I have something wrong with my personality that causes me to fail at job interviews. I usually end up in positions where they just have to have someone and I'm always on the bottom. 

I'm ready to die. There's no advancement in life. It's the same thing everyday. Everything I want to do is out of reach due to lack of money / resources. It's just time to end my life. I know I'll never get to do any of these things because I have something wrong with me and I can't afford any kind of treatment to fix me. I just don't see another way to not be miserable all the time.
