Just talk to me pleaseIt's NYE and my SO is out of town.

I was on the phone with them when they started to sound a bit stressed and angry so I just hung up out of fear. They then texted me and told me I shouldnt've done that, then told me everything they were going to send to me when the clock strikes 12 here, it was all so nice and sweet, and I wasn't going to get any of it.

I broke down in tears.

I've been suicidal for months now and have struggled with depression for years. 

This has tipped me over, making me feel like complete shit.

I know it sounds pathetic, but I might end my life tonight.
