I know it isnâ€™t here. And I may get banned for even asking: Why canâ€™t I just do this â€œdeathâ€ thing? (This question is rhetorical.) Why/Where is there a web-site I can get help? Iâ€™m NOT interested in â€œhelpâ€... I ONLY want out. When I want â€œoutâ€. The be failed too many times.Iâ€™m new. Sorry. I was trying to say:  Iâ€™m wanting â€œhelpâ€ w/checking outâ€”Permanently.   Iâ€™ve TRIED it all. Iâ€™ve ASKED my (well-established ..6,8,10 YEAR history w/EACH) doctorâ€™s  Iâ€™m associated with &amp; I get NO advice &amp; my request for a referral (for a psychologist and psychiatrist) has been IGNORED!... as if Iâ€™ve said nothing!  Iâ€™m apparently NOT worth their time.  And Iâ€™m no longer willing to debate or discuss. 

This scenario is basically â€œthe story of my lifeâ€.  Iâ€™m just ready to go. 

IM NOT INTERESTED IN BEING TALKED OUT OF THIS. -AND- THANK-YOU, NO. IM NOT interested in advise w/hanging in &amp; hanging around.  Iâ€™d like to speak w/like minded people, but Iâ€™m sure that isnâ€™t an option.  ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–
