Thank you suicide hotline     I found out tonight that due to mistakes of my own doing, I can't get financial aid for the next year of school. 
     I panicked.  I've never felt like that before.  I was (and still am) so scared of having to face my family especially because of the financial problems my parents have been going through. 
     I felt out of control and nauseous and I kept having wild thoughts and I was SO SO scared.  
     I didn't know who to call, so I googled suicide hotline and called them.  I didn't want to kill myself, but I felt like I could hurt myself.  
     The guy I talked to was so calming and reassuring.  I still feel shaky, but he got me past the twisting dark blind panic.  
     I felt bad for calling.  I know my issue is not at all as terrible as other people's issues and I wasn't exactly suicidal, but the hotline helped so much.  
     So Cesar, wherever you are, thank you.  You got me off my bathroom floor. I thought I was going to feel insane and terrified forever.
