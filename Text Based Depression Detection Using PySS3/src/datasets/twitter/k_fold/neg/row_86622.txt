No friends, controlling family, no cause, no career, never had a relationship. What is the point of living?Title says it all. I feel like my life is ticking away. I don't understand why I have to stay here. The few people who care about my well being would be upset but at the same time they never check up on me. I am sick of always having to be the one to put effort into being a good friend. The best friends I ever had were the ones who would seek me out to do something but they have all moved away. At this age, I can forget about ever having a relationship. I see no point in living. Someone please either help me or give me the means to end it.
