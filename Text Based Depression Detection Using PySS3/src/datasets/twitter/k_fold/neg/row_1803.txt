Whatâ€™s the point?Iâ€™ve been depressed for 3 years now, Iâ€™ve just learned to live with it. Within the past 8 months though, Iâ€™ve started cutting myself with needle,hoping they wouldnâ€™t leave any scars behind, but I was wrong. So I stopped for a while worried about what people think, but  Now Iâ€™m addicted to these scars again and for the past month my life has done nothing but go downhill. I feel like I have no one or anything left to live for. Iâ€™m nearly broke between lying for school getting my teeth fixed and now a bug infestation in my room. I donâ€™t have any where to go to, I cry myself to sleep every night and my parents thought I was  being dramatic when I asked for help...I  canâ€™t do this anymore. I really canâ€™t, the cutting only does so much, I need something bigger something better. I just want to feel better. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like there is nothing left in my life, Iâ€™m tired of feeling like this.
