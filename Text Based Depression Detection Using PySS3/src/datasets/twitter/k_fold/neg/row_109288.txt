why the fuck not?well i'm back. after overdosing last year and spending the summer hating myself, i'm right back here. 

a girl at my school tried to kill herself today. a tiny freshman, my math teachers daughter. and i can't stop fucking wondering, what would have happened if i'd died like i want to.
