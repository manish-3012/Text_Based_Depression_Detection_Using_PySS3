Long distance girlfriend wants to suicideI need help. My girlfriend (24 years-old), who now lives 12 hours apart from me, has suicidal thoughts. She lives in an abusive home and told me she want to end her life because she doesn't see another way out. I tried to get her to call a hotline but she wont. I don't know what to do. I fear she might hurt herself.
