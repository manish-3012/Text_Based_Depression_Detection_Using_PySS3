there's no more pointthere's knives and pills waiting for me in the kitchen. i'm done with life and there's no point of me continuing it. everyone i love leaves me and i'm tired of feeling things and i'm a horrible person and i need to stop hurting people and being useless. i need permanent rest. goodbye
