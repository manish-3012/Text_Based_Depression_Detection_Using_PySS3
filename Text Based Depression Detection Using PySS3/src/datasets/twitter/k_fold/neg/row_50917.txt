Scared of dying, it's ruining my lifeFor atleast a year now, I have this immense fear of dying. Im 19 years old. Each night, I almost vomit myself just with the tought of me.. Not existing anymore. I drool alot and cry alot and almost shred my hair off. I even scratch my face and my heart burns, each and every night it's like this. Now for a week, or two, I have been thinking about it in the day too. My heart has this burning sensation all day long. For the past year I have only checked sites on reincarnation, immortality, etc. But I don't want to be immortal, I don't want to die either..

This is screwing my life, and I only have 30 or so years left, it's not enough, im starting to think about suicide each day just to end this pain and finally knowing what it is like after death.

I do nothing in my life, I don't have friends that I see often, no jobs, school, nothing. I haven't seen any one for the past 6months, and it's devastating me.


I need help, I don't want to die, I really don't, I just feel like ending it to finally know what's the afterlife.. Or nothing at all, im afraid of nothingness.. I am really afraid, it's ruining my life
