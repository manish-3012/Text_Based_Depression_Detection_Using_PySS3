How much can I tell a professional without getting screwed?My suicidal thoughts are usually passive, like, "everyone would be better off without me." Sometimes, when I'm alone and recall a bad memory, I reflexively say "I should kill myself." Probably the scariest thought I've had is realizing that I don't have a good place to hang a rope off of in my house, I think.

I have a doctor's appointment soon, and I've never sought professional help before.

I don't want to die, despite what I seem to be thinking lately, but I would rather die than end up forcibly hospitalized or have the cops busting down my door. If I don't want to harm myself and don't plan to, should I be okay telling a doctor everything?
