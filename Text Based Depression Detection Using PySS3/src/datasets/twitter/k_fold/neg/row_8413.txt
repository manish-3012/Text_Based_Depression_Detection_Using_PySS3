Doctors Told Me I Have LupusIâ€™m not sure what I want this post to be about, but my depression is through the roof. I got diagnosed with Lupus, and that has explained a lot about whatâ€™s going on in my body. I deal with extremely fatigue, sometimes out of nowhere, and these joint pains are pretty unreal. Especially when they start in my knees. My hips hurt a lot, and I canâ€™t sit down for to long or they lock up. I feel like Iâ€™m 70, but Iâ€™m only 22. It really sucks because people always tell me I need to get a job, and focus on making money, but I donâ€™t know if I can really build a better life for myself with all these things going on. My mental issues are the worst. I have OCD, brutal social anxiety, and of course I struggle with a fair amount of depression on a regular basis. 

Honestly I just feel like Iâ€™m letting my family down. Iâ€™m the oldest out of all my brothers, and I know most if not all of them look up to me in a way. It sucks I canâ€™t set a better example for them. 

This post is basically me venting in a way because I donâ€™t want to let my family know how weak and hopeless I really feel sometimes. I know Iâ€™m not excellent at everything I do, but I really do try hard, regardless of what my family may think. I donâ€™t think all hope is lost, but I wish I had somebody to be there for me and tell me everythingâ€™s going to be alright... just something
