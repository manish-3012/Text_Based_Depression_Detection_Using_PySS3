I don't know how much longer I can last.The only reason I haven't attempted yet is because I don't want to hurt others, but I don't know if that will last.

I'm a 17 year old male and the problems I'm having are more complex then I'll be able to articulate here.

I've been seeing a psychologist for a few weeks, but I don't think it's helping at all.

My main problem is a lack of understanding or feeling any emotions I have, so I end up faking almost every interaction I have with others. I've never truely felt anything for anyone, and I don't know why.

I feel nothing for my mother, sister or any family, nor do I feel anything for my "friends". 

The only thing I can sometimes feel is anger and a self-loathing of my lack of emotions...

I want to be happy and have relationships with these people, but I just can't and never really have.

I've only recently admitted to anyone about my problems, but most just seem to make it worse now. I had two friends that have tried to help, but they are fading away, too.

I just can't think of any reason for me to be alive anymore. But I haven't been able to attempt anything, yet...

I've always been a top student in school and I guess generally liked because of my act, but even that has been diminishing lately. My anxiety and stress over my loneliness and helplessness has started affecting my school work. 

I just don't care about anything anymore. Over the summer I had lost 30lbs in 2months, but now I can't motivate myself to exercise or eat right, along with the lack of motivation to do any work.

I just don't want to live in constant anxiety and loneliness anymore, but I don't know how to fix it.
