I can't keep goingI can't keep living. I can't do this. It hurts in the pit of my stomach. I need someone to talk to, please. I have psychosis and I'm hallucinating. Everyone thinks I am crazy. Don't tell me to go to a hospital please. It doesn't help. I feel nothing anymore. I am so numb. I feel nothing. I can't do anything. I can't function. I'm starting to fail in school. I don't know what to do. I am all alone. I have no one.  I have absolutely no one. My best friend who is like a brother to me called me today and I felt nothing. It's all numb. I want it to end. Death has got to be better than this. It has to be. I'm ready to just end it all.
