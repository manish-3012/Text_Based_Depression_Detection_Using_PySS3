I don't want to kill myself, but...Almost everything I do causes me mental anguish. I'm just so tired of it... Tired of believing and hoping that something will change it. Tried meds, tried counseling, tried taking a break from work, tried changing my environment... Nothing has changed; everything I do and think makes me want to scream, throw things, hurt people or stab myself in the eyes.

And it's not like I want to kill myself; I have a vague understanding that it won't help. I just want to... stop being mentally exhausted. Just want to lay there and do nothing, possibly under a mind-numbing array of chemicals. I want to cease doing anything that hurts me. But I realize that doing so means the end of my career, financial stability, comfort, and most likely health and safety.

I don't know what to do. I've posted here a few times in the past, hoping something will help. I just don't know.
