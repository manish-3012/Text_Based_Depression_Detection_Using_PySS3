My dog had to be put to sleep...and I just don't want to live any more. 

I can't kill myself, because someone I loved dearly who has died was catholic, and I strongly believe I'll see him again. So long as I don't go to hell, which yeah, sounds funny, but I have to believe something, that it's not just a fall from one blackness to another, right?

But I just want to stop living. I want a heart attack, an aneurism, a tragic single car accident. I just can't get over this emptiness. The house is too big and too empty. There's a permanent smell of doggishness on the sofa. The place she used to lay in the bedroom has the mark where the rug is all squished in her shape. I've tried cleaning but it doesn't clean up.

I want to move, I want to die, I want my dog back. I don't even know why i'm saying anything. Maybe so everybody can laugh, cause even i know there's way worse things that people are dealing with. But I just can't take the lonliness. I have no kids, moved 3000 miles from my friends a few years ago and haven't made any here, I just don't want to go on. My life is over, there's no sunshine any more.
