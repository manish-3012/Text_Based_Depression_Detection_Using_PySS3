What is the point in trying?I can't do anything right. Can't go for my final year of high school because it's too overwhelming for me. Can't find a job that I can handle with my anxiety disorder. Can't find a single medication that works. Can't find a councillor who doesn't make me feel worse? Can't find any person who does just say "don't worry about it. Stop stressing. You'll be fine" as if I have a choice to feel this way. Can't find a reason to live. 

I'm a white privileged teenager who complains of nothing to make it something. I harm the only body I have as if it will help me and I dream of suicide as if I have it bad when I know so many have it worse. I don't deserve to live if I'm such a low life piece of shit who isn't grateful for the life she has. There's nothing here for me and nothing my depression wouldn't ruin anyway. Im alone. 

It will hurt people if I die, but I'm selfish enough to stop living because it hurts me.
