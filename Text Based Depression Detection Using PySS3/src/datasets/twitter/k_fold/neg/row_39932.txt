I can't do anything right.No matter how I do it, I constantly screw up. I'm a lazy retard who can't do anything right. I feel like a waste of space. I get good grades, but to me, that's not a representation of intellect. I feel like just dying, but I'm afraid my loved-ones will follow the same path, which is why I would like help.
