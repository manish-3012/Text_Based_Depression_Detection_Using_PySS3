people do care. and it makes me feel worse.i still feel worthless and misunderstood, but the thing is... i know people care. yet i still can't help feeling the way i feel and thinking bad thoughts.

finally opened up about my suicidal thoughts. went to the hospital, took medication (helped a lot because i was literally falling apart), talked to professionals (including my new therapist), all of them giving me pep talk and trying to calm me down. now my family is all worried and walking on eggshells around me. i won't be left alone even for five minutes. they all stare at me ~like that. my entire giant family, my aunt's pastor, my sister's friends, people i've never even met now know that i'm crazy and want to kill myself. the butterfly effect. 

i know all these people care, and are trying to help, and love me. i've SEEN it now. but i still want to die. i still see no real future for myself except self destruction and my eventual demise. it's like it's inevitable. give me meds, take me to church, talk to me for hours on end, hospitalize me. my mind is still a goddamn mess.
