I'm the villain. Everyone wants me dead.I'm someone who has wronged so many people in my life that I don't deserve to live anymore. 

Everyone wants me dead.
The person I liked wants me dead.

I do more harm than good to the world
I'm the villain. I don't play victim. 
Nobody bothered my side of the story.
I will be the villain if thats what everyone thinks of me.

Everyone will be happy to see me dead.

Will you talk someone like Logan Paul out of suicide?
Will you talk Hitler out of suicide?
Will you talk someone who sinned against you out of suicide?
Will you talk a college dropout out of suicide?
