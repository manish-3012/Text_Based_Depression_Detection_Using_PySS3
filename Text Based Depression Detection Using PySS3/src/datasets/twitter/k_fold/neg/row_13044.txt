I donâ€™t even know anymore.I usually donâ€™t ever post how Iâ€™m feeling on threads or even tell my therapists how Iâ€™m truly truly feeling because I feel guilty for these thoughts that cross my mind.  But I feel like Iâ€™m going to go crazy after this Christmas. 

I hate this time of year. Iâ€™ve always had mental health issues, been hospitalized twice as a teenager, self harmed, drank mouthwash just to get drunk to ignore my feelings whatever. I had a great life growing up nothing really triggered me to become this way I guess my brain is very chemically imbalanced. 

Anyway Iâ€™m 24 I had my daughter at 20. to keep the story short I had a healthy pregnancy besides my type one diabetes but I took care of myself. I was scheduled to be induced, and she was perfectly healthy at the time however due to doctors negligence, and not paying attention to signs of distress . She was born having 36 seizures in 43 minutes and her whole brain was completely damaged. I was told she would not â€œlive the ideal lifeâ€.  If you saw her in person today you would never guess anything was wrong with her, but there is. she is doing way more than anyone expected however Iâ€™ve noticed my mental health getting worse and worse every year. she was diagnosed with HIE, LGS, and type 1 diabetes within the first 2 years of her life. now that sheâ€™s getting older her seizures are getting worse, sheâ€™s becoming more delayed and I just honestly hate saying I donâ€™t want to do it anymore. Iâ€™m tired of seeing kids happy on Christmas while my daughter is out of it not knowing how to rip open a present. I hate her birthday because her grandparents want to throw her a party every year and I hate everyone watching her â€œopenâ€ gifts (me opening them) and sheâ€™s just so out of it and has no clue whatâ€™s going on. and I donâ€™t mean I donâ€™t want to do it anymore as in I donâ€™t want her anymore because I love my child to death, sheâ€™s the strongest child I know that can light up a room with her smile. I mean I donâ€™t want to watch her struggle every day of her life, even though she doesnâ€™t realize it. I have become so numb to her daily seizures because itâ€™s the normal for our family. Im tired of the mix between of hopeful days and I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s coming days. I donâ€™t want to die but I just donâ€™t want to live anymore. It makes me so upset seeing neurotypical kids doing normal things and I have to watch my daughter just struggle to walk sometimes. I hate feeling this way I fucking hate it. Having LGS also means at any given time if she falls asleep she might not wake up due to a seizure in her sleep??? I hate this overwhelming feeling. I feel selfish most days since sheâ€™s the one whoâ€™s really struggling. Iâ€™m at a very all time low in my life. I donâ€™t even know what I want anymore I just feel so numb to these doctors appointments I have to go to for her, I question am I doing enough or not, how can I do enough when Iâ€™m depressed and numb as ever just sitting on the couch watching her do the same things over and over and over. I donâ€™t even know how to express this to anyone because itâ€™s the same response, oh Iâ€™m so sorry I know itâ€™s hard but your strong blah blah blah. I get people donâ€™t know what to say but at the end of the day itâ€™s something I have to do. Something I still have to deal with. Words wonâ€™t change anything because that doctor did permanent damage. I would never end my life, but I just donâ€™t want to live anymore and I canâ€™t get these constant worrying feelings out of my head. I try to look at the reality point of view but I still feel like Iâ€™m going to just have a huge mental breakdown and idk where Iâ€™m going with this, I just needed this off my chest. God I love my daughter so much she did not deserve this suffering.  I just want my will to live back.
