Struggling with LifeI'm a 13'yr M suffering with severe Social Anxiety.. Was in Top set for 1/2 subjects when I was in year 8 (or grade 7 whatever the fuck you call it in America) haven't been in School for almost a year now and tempted to start sh (used protractor to scratch a 3 letter acronym into my arm last night)..  terrified that i'm going to start dropping soon but unable to face being near other people.. 

My Therapist Isn't really helping me and i'm scared to admit it to my parents who have spent alot of money on sessions and I have no idea what the fuck i'm supposed to do now. 

Considering sui/ when I feel most down in the mornings (Not exactly sure why I still have stuff to live for like getting to level 250 on Hypixel)

Please help.. - Not that I'll ever check back here
