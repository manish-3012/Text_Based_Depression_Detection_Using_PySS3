I'm in a really dark place and I am on the verge of some pretty bad stuff.I know where the gun is and everyone here thinks that I don't know how to even hold it, but I am well versed in gun basics. We just bought a set of kitchen knives that could do some sick damage. I just bought a big bottle of sleeping pills. 

I'm freaking out. A terrible shitty day sent me into this dark little hole that I just crawled out of a few months ago. I'm scared of myself right now and I don't know what to do but I know that I want to die. 

I can't wake anyone up to tell them because they think I'm just being dramatic or a brat or idk, I just can't do this
