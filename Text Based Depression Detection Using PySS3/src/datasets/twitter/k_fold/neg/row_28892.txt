I donâ€™t knowI donâ€™t really know what Iâ€™m doing anymore. I feel like no matter how much effort I put in I am never going to be successful. I am constantly working myself to the point of having break downs and it literally never fucking matters because things never work out for me. Like this year I finally decided that I was going to fucking get my life together and I sought help from a therapist at my college just for them to tell me I have more issues than they were capable of dealing with. Like how fucked up do I have to be for trained professionals not want to deal with me? And itâ€™s like the worse I get depression wise the worse my problems with food get, and itâ€™s like Iâ€™ve reached this point where I know that Iâ€™m either going to kill myself or starve myself to death. Like and now the only thing keeping me from killing myself is that I donâ€™t think anyone in my family would take my dog after I died and like I couldnâ€™t do that to her.
