I can't find the courage to do itToday my mom took me to a general physician and he said i need to see a psychiatrist.

Firstly she didn't take me to a psychiatrist. Second she said out loud " if you are so tired of living just go somewhere and die" well yeah my mom i agree 100% with you it's exactly what I want to do but i can't seem to gather what it takes to do it.
