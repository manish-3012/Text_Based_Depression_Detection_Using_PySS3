Anger/rage issues anyone?If its any consolation its not just me whoâ€™s sick of me, its everyone that I know and care about, i get so uncontrollably angry over smallest things, its like the tiniest trigger can make me see red all around, few years ago I almost killed a couple of guys in a beatdown for messing with my ex, i have spent a night or two in jail for violent outbursts.
My parents are terrified of me I canâ€™t keep a girlfriend because in the beginning I am the sweetest man you could meet, understanding and empathetic but as time passes and my aggression rises to the surface every now and again and i get dumped bcoz its too scary, i have been nick named the hulk by my friends.
I am quite strong and when anger takes over I become and absolute monster which had made me sick of myself.
I donâ€™t know if I should die but thereâ€™s a huge possibility that my anger would be the cause of my death.
