Iâ€™m doneI donâ€™t think Iâ€™m depressed but lately all the days have started running together. I barley get out of the house due to how overwhelming online school is and how hard my mom grills me when my grades are not up to her standards. Iâ€™ve started just not feeling anything, I just donâ€™t care anymore. Only two months ago I really got an idea of what I wanted to do with my future and started working towards it, but now I just donâ€™t care anymore. I have these episodes during the day where I just wish I could die to escape the monotony, Iâ€™m just done I donâ€™t care anymore
