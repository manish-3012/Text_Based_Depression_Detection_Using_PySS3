last year my girlfriend broke up with me and i felt so lost for 6 months. i just wnated to die for so long and it's all i ever thoguht about. we got back together a while ago.

my god, head hurts so bad i just cna't stop crying. i think she's going to break up with me again. i cna't do it again i cna't fucking cry all day for another six months 

im so terrified. i just don't want to do it again. i just don't know what to do. i want to kill myself but i don't want to hurt anyone fuck. i'm so sorry
