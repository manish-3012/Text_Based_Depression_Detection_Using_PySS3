One of those nights againYou know those nights right? Where everything cracks. That wall that you spent all that time and energy building just crumbles. When all of those feelings, All of those memories, that you have been trying to fight back come flooding in. They drown you in their depths. They take your breath away. Thereâ€™s nothing you can do but gasp and hold onto anything you can grasp until itâ€™s all over. And then you just build it all back up again. Lay your coping mechanisms down one brick at a time. Then and you wait ... until itâ€™s one of those nights again.
