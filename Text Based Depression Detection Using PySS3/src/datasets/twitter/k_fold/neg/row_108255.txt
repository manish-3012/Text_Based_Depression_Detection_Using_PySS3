The suicide hotline hung up on me. I feel so sad.I ran out of my Zoloft so I haven't been able to take it for two days since its the weekend. the withdrawl is making me feel like shit. I have been doing fantastic for months now but today was awful. I just feel like such shit. I can't find a psychiatrist to resubscribe my medications. Every phyciatrist I call says they only offer counsiling. maybe I sound like a drug seeker to them when I call. I'm not. I just want my prescriptions redone. I was diagnoised years ago. I take zoloft which i ran out of two days ago. xanax which i ran out of two months ago. but my panic attacks have come back so I'm trying to get that repruscribed. the only meds I have enough of are my adderall and my thyroid medicine. I feel so guilty that I havn't gone outside today even though I didn't even want to. I told myself I'd stay home and enjoy today. I still like shit for not going outside and enjoying the weather. does anyone have advice for calling phyciatrists. my insurances website is almost zero help
