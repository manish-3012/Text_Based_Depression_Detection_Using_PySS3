Nearly ready I thinkItâ€™s just been a downward spiral since I moved to Spain. Youâ€™d think the lovely weather and beautiful architecture would make you feel better. 

Iâ€™ve been in my new job for a month and just recently theyâ€™ve started to mess me around, they could t find me any work for most of the first month so Iâ€™m trying to live off 5 euros a day, most of which goes on the bus to work. Additionally now they want me in 6 days a week. 

Got knocked back by a girl I liked a week ago, thought the feeling was mutual until she accused me of grabbing her arse (I didnâ€™t). Turned out she didnâ€™t feel the same way. 

Iâ€™m on setraline but just moved to a new brand and it doesnâ€™t seem to be working so well.

Googled the best ways to commit suicide the other day. The only thing holding me back Is knowing how devastated my parents would be. I donâ€™t, and never have had a gun but if I did I think Iâ€™d have done this a long time ago.

Anyway, hope youâ€™re having a better day than me.
