Tottering on the edgeAll of my friends abandoned me, my dad is going to die of either cancer or diabetes, and I've started self harming just to be able to feel something. There isn't a day that goes by where I wish that I was dad, and it even started to permeate into my work life. I look at my box cutter and just think, 'Everything could end right now if I just run this blade across my neck.' No one will really miss me. They say they will, but I know they won't. They all have someone else to fall back on for support and love. I'm just here for when they run out of options. 

I want the pain to end.
