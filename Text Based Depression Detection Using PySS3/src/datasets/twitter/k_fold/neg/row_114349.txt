Here we go again, but I think I have reached my final rock bottomI have posted in here a few times in the past. I am a 34 year old man with virtually no reason to stay alive. I am ugly, severely mentally ill, now unemployed for 2 months, and having a hard time finding a job, no friends, sleeping on my brothers couch, completely socially isolated, and I am too tired to carry on. I have no social support except for my Brother, and if I bring up my issues, or hint I am struggling he gets upset, and tells me to look at the positive. There are no positives, and no hope for any kind of future. I don't think that the corona-virus will take me out if I contract it, so I have to do this myself. I am in so much emotional, and now physical pain.
