Anyone Else Feel, Honestly, Like They Shouldn't Try to Save Themselves?Shouldn't I have a life worth saving if I'm going to beg others for help saving it? Why waste the time of others trying? Beg for pity? See a therapist, waste his or her time, knowing full well there's someone out there who needs the help? I can't speak honestly to someone who has heard my story, because I believe they're secretly laughing and waiting for me to go away.

It's like being intellectually disabled and being tutored in basic math. They may try to help at first, but once they realize how stupid I am, they realize it's pointless and not worth doing. Even if they're polite about it and outwardly keep trying.

Sorry if that sounds wrong; I just cannot get over how truly worthless of a human being that I am.
