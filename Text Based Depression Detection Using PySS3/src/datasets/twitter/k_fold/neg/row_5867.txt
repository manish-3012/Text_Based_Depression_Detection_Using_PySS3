I feel sick, thinking about how cruel this world isI just can't get over it. I sometimes envy ignorant people, who can just carry on with their lives like nothing is wrong.

It just happens suddenly and unconsciously.

I'm eating a friggin sandwich and BAM, I start to think about animals being slaughtered after having short and miserable lives at factory farms. How scared they must be.

I'm reading emails and BAM, I start to think about children from poor and underdeveloped countries, whose "parents" sell them to brothels or terrorists group, because they can always produce another child.

I'm watching some light hearted show and BAM, I start to think about Death camps, Tiananmen Square, My Lai massacre etc.

I just feel sick to my stomach.

As lame as it sounds it feels like I've eaten the Forbidden Fruit of knowledge and now my life is cursed. I can't go back to "the heaven of blissful ignorance".
