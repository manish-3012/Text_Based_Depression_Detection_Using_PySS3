So I need some anonymous people to listen to my rantSooooo thank you for sorting new first of all, Iâ€™m someone whoâ€™s far in the hole. Iâ€™ve stopped caring about how people will care when Iâ€™m dead, sure theyâ€™ll be sad, Theyll mourn, theyâ€™ll cry, theyâ€™ll probably even end up with a internal dialog worse then mine, but theyâ€™ll get better. Theyâ€™ve been through worse, and theyâ€™ll continue going through worse and worse things. Whyâ€™d I be different? I mean sure, Iâ€™m friends with people, Iâ€™m the first son, Iâ€™m the guy people can turn to and just let shit out and Iâ€™m the guy whoâ€™ll do everything in his power to try to fix it. But I canâ€™t keep going feeling like Iâ€™m doing everything wrong, I canâ€™t keep going thinking Iâ€™m letting my gf down, I canâ€™t keep going counting the days before she starts doing shit with other people - thinking about ending it with me, I canâ€™t deal with the heartbreak Iâ€™d feel knowing this is the happiest Iâ€™ll feel with someone and have them step on me. Do I deserve it? Sure. But do I want it? Hell no. Would I be surprised? Not even alittle. Recently Iâ€™ve been wanting to drink, I want that kick of something strong and not remember the night beforehand. I donâ€™t want to remember half the shit that I do. Is it selfish? hell yeah. Most of what my moms told me is the reason Iâ€™m turning to a bunch of people reading through reddit at 2300 when they have a exam in the morning. (Go tf to sleep, god knows I want to.) Iâ€™m only here because I keep going back and forth on whether I want to take people with me or just goto sleep. I wish someone could hold me and make it better, but I know thatâ€™s not how that works way to well. Eatingâ€™s getting scarce, no appetite anymore. Schools suffering, (teacher deadass told me to give up xd) my motivation is gone, I donâ€™t enjoy anything I do anymore, and I feel like Iâ€™m far too gone. Been feeling that way sense 6th grade. Uhhhhhh other then that, I just want to do enough shit that I canâ€™t feel anything anymore. Thank you for reading, Iâ€™ll update as needed. Those of you feeling the same way, donâ€™t follow my example, you have people who love you. I love you. Gimme a smooch ðŸ˜˜
Thank you for reading through this. The pins in my head are digging deeper and deeper, so Iâ€™m gonna bawl my eyes out. Ttyl
