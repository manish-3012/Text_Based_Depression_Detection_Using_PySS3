Maybe it does get better but this worlds not for me.To start out Iâ€™m all for empowerment for everyone I really am, I want everyone to have equality and be treated the same, to be uplifted, and empowered. But for me it just feels like I donâ€™t belong in the world any more, a straight white make just doesnâ€™t fit in todayâ€™s society. Iâ€™m probably being immature in this regard but I just feel like I should die because it would help society as a whole because I wonâ€™t be around to fight change.
