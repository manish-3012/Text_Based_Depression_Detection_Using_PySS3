I've been depressed on/off the past year and want to kill myselfI feel like shit. My best friend seldom talks to me and seems disinterested. She has new friends and I always feel like I get the short end of the stick. For holidays and birthdays, I always get my family/friends really well thought-out, often homemade, gifts. It was our sixteenth birthdays this year and I gave her a giant gift basket with a handmade card of how much I appreciate her and such. She didn't get me anything. I don't really want to address her because she's the only "close" friend I have.

At home, I have a strained relationship with my dad and a close relationship with my mom. I don't like talking about my depression to my mom, though, because it makes me feel worse. I have two brothers and my older brother is incredibly dismissive towards me. He doesn't like anything I say and is always hostile and he doesn't seem to care that I'm depressed. He *knows* I am. My younger brother is kind of worse because he just doesn't like me. All he cares about are is friends, getting wasted, and his girlfriend.

I've thought about suicide more than once, which is what got me into therapy (that started last November) in the first place. I didn't really find it to help too much and I stopped seeing my therapist last week because of the summer.

I feel like I want to fast forward to me when I'm away from this life and on my own and in a new environment, but that's what I've always told myself and nothing gets better. 

It's not a matter of desert, you know? I'm not going to sit here and whine about how I don't deserve this. I just feel fed up. I want to end my life.
