I hate itIt sucks to live, to just pretend you're doing fine and living your life. It is so damn hard to just do it because I don't want to, I just do not want to live, I do not see any purpose in living and I only feel like I am doing it wrong. Please don't tell me that I'm not the only one who thinks this because I know that I'm not, I know that ,many people feel the same but I feel like most of them get over it or are making progression or have reasons to live. I don't, I am weak and not worth living. I have a small family and of course, they will miss me when I'm gone but they will get over it because they are strong, unlike me. I am weak that I cannot deal with everyday life, I feel like I am a mental mutation who should die due to natural selection because my brain isn't capable of dealing with anything.
