Watching the world crash around meI was happily married. Five years, and together with her for five years before that. Going through a divorce because I found out she was cheating most of the time while I was working and taking care of her.

Was healthy, found out I have multiple damaged organs after losing 40 lbs to get myself "fit".

Lost my friend group because I had to move for work, and haven't met any new friends/people since I started.

My pistol misfired when I tried to shoot myself, and I got locked in in-patient for over a week and lost my ability to acquire firearms.

I quit doing drugs, and was sober for 6 months. Fell back in to old habits to cope with the stress, and can't seem to stop again.

The world views me as "successful" because of my job, but I don't have any reason to wake up tomorrow. Wish someone would come and put me out of my misery
