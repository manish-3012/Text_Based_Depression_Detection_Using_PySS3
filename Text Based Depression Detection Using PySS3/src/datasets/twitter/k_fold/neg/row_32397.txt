Probably going to leave soonOn the first day of June in 2021, I won't be alive. The last day I could possibly be alive on is the last day of May in 2021. I don't want to kill myself, and I don't want to die, but I promised myself this. I'm done breaking every promise I make. I've called the suicide prevention lifeline on the third day of this month, and while I did feel better for a while, I eventually went back to feeling horrible. Everything that makes me stop feeling so bad is temporary. I'll always go back to feeling bad again, so I should die.
