I've made my decision. Only one person can stop me and they won't.Dozens of phone calls and text messages ignored. I try to reach out and I get shut down. The only person in my life doesn't give a fuck if I live or die. The end is near and there's nothing anybody else can do except for them. And they won't. They'd probably just be happy if I did it. Everyone would be better off without me. I've picked out the day. The countdown starts now. I can't wait to leave all the pain behind. I don't know what else I can do. It won't get better and I won't be able to move on. Either I suffer for the rest of my life or I put an end to it. If I don't hear from them by my birthday I'm leaving forever.
