I feel like I have no options leftI am 26 and I have been dealing with chronic back pain for a year now, and when I say pain I mean to the point I can't carry a book bag with just a notebook in it without regretting it for at least a week afterwards. It happened at work but now they aren't paying for it anymore. I can't work because I can't sit for more than five minutes without pain let alone carry anything. No job wants to hire me and money is running out. So is patience from my family. I feel like I'm out of options. It consumes me, this pain. Every day, sure it gets less sometimes, but it's always there and it ALWAYS comes back full force. I have degraded to the point where I just lay on the computer all day or try going on walks, and for someone who used to run and play sports, it's hell on earth. I just don't know what to do. I almost did it about twenty minutes ago though, yet something still stopped me, even though I feel like I have no hope...
