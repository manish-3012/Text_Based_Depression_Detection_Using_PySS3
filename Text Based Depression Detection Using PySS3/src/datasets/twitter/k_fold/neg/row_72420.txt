21-year-old kid, no guidance in life, unemployed for over a year, not college bound, feel undesirable and worthless. Been thinking about it for a while.It doesn't help when I live in a small town and the only jobs posted online are the same ones repeatedly, ones I've already applied for, talked to the same people, got my hopes up, then my ambition quickly fizzles.

I feel like I'm unimportant and a waste of space, thoughts of which have lingered for a long time. Started with my alcoholic mother destroying my family at 8, to having serious complications in school, to my father breathing down my neck every fucking moment of my life.

This morning, remarkably, I told myself I'm done. Woke up and wrote a suicide note, but still need to decide the place and time. Fun guys! Good riddance I guess.
