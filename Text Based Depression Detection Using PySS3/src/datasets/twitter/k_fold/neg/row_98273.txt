Female (26) Need help with my depression/chronic fatigueIâ€™m in a very difficult place right now. Iâ€™ve struggled with depression most of my life, but currently I have pretty high suicidal ideation, and Iâ€™m worried that I could kill myself by the end of the summer if things do not improve. The main point of this post is any recommendations and support that I can get. I have a very good life with a graduate degree, a job starting at the end of the summer, a very supportive boyfriend, a good family, and great physical health. The only negatives in my life are really that I donâ€™t have many friends (Less than 5) and my strong depression. I work out (weightlift and cardio) almost every day in an effort to combat the depression. I also eat a relatively healthy diet. Iâ€™m also on three medications for depression and ADHD (Trintellix, 20 mg; Vyvanse, 60 mg; and Abilify, 15 mg). I work in education, and last school year Iâ€™d have to go into an office and take short naps because I was just too exhausted to continue working. The primary worry right now is my exhaustion. I tend to sleep 15 or 16 hours a day without really wanting to get up and do things. Iâ€™m good at what I do, but Iâ€™m worried that my depression will make it so that I canâ€™t effectively complete my work. I feel anxious because I want to start feeling better by the end of July by the time my new job starts. Any advice?
