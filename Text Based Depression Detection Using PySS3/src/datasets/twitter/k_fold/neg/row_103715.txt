there isn't any moral option but suicideI've come to a point where suicide is the only moral option to my family and society.  I'm going to fail to meet academic standards for the third semester and will definitely be kicked out of university. I've wasted my father's hard earned money and disgraced my parents who have done nothing but care for and support me while I was an entitled useless arrogant piece of shit for most of my life.  Any "call for help" would just be further exploiting my family into suffering and paying for my failures.  Killing myself would eliminate the financial leech I've become and would let my parents focus on my sister who is a better person than me who will actually go on to do something useful with her life.
