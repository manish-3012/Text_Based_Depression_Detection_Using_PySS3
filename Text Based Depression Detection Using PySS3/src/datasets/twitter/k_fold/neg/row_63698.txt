I wrecked my car againA few months ago I wrecked my car. Totaled it. 

I spent all the money I had, and bought a new one.

I just wrecked it a few hours ago.

The first time, my old car, someone ran me off the road. This time I was dodging a deer and ended up going into a ditch. It wasnâ€™t anything with unsafe driving on my end either time. 

I donâ€™t think itâ€™s enough damage to be totaled, but I donâ€™t care. I canâ€™t afford to fix it, however much itâ€™s going to be.

I have no way of getting to school, or more importantly work. So I have no way of making more money to save up to fix it.

Iâ€™m all alone, and things had been going downhill already. I guess this was the straw that broke the camels back.

I wish the wreck was worse. I wish I died in the wreck. That way, I wouldnâ€™t have to find a way to do it myself.

I guess this is it.
