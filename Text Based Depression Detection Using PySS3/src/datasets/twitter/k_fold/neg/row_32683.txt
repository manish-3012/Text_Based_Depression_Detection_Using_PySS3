my chest hurtsI want to die please all I do is cry and self harm.  I keep relapsing and I feel so alone. I can't breathe. this hurts too much. I can only seem to express on here because everyone is tired of me being sad all the time. am I too negative? I just wish I can take a rope and end it already. I just cry everyday. I JUST WANT THE PAIN TO STOP AND THE WORLD IS JUST CRASHING AROUND ME. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE PLEASE NO ONE LOVES ME PLEASE I JUST WANT THE PAIN TO STOP
