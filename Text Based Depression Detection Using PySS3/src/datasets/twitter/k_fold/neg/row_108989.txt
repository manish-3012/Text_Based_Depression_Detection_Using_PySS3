I feel ashamed for my existenceThis post is really depressing so donâ€™t read if you donâ€™t want to be more depressed.

People donâ€™t deserve to know this terrible, repulsive existence. And I donâ€™t even deserve to breathe.

For my entire 22 years of life, I have always felt like this way as far as I can remember. And at this point, I even feel embarrassed just thinking about the fact that people around me perceive me, think something about me or anything related to my being. I know it sounds so cringy or pathetic but that is how really I feel now.

I donâ€™t blame anyone for this, because Iâ€™ve always known that I am the only reason why I am end up here.

Whenever I look back my school years, all of the memories are just black and white, gloomy and depressing. Being a quite, introverted gay boy was not a good start at first. And my only brother who is just 2 years older than me started mentally abusing me for  almost 10 years, but I couldnâ€™t resist him one single time. And that experience makes me more reversed, shy kid, and even I havenâ€™t experienced any kind of bullying, Iâ€™ve always afraid of human beings.

At first, I just hated myself for being unusual but it became more huge. I started hating my appearance, personality and literally anything about myself. I think I started suicidal thoughts around like 15.

Depression, social anxiety, avoidant personality disorder. These are all Iâ€™ve got last 22 years. I got nothing now, and I donâ€™t even want something anymore. I donâ€™t even want families attentions anymore. Itâ€™s just shameful.
