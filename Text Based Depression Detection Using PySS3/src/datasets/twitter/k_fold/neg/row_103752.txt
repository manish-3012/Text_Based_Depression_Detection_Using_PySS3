My depression is adaptingEvery time I figure out a way to beat my depression and anxiety it adapts and comes back worse. Years ago it was negative thoughts about my appearance which then transformed into a dark gloominess. Now I fear it is worse than ever constant irrational thoughts that I accept as truth. It could be one negative thought that is on my mind from the time I wake up until I go to sleep every waking second it is on my mind, eating at me, draining me of every ounce of hope and energy. I always try to do the right thing but each little hiccup is grasped by my anxiety, warped and blown out of proportion until it tears me apart. It takes weeks and months to convince myself that itâ€™s just my anxiety but those weeks and months add up and I have lost so many enjoyable memories I could have been making. Ironically it is my high morals that will eventually lead to my demise.
