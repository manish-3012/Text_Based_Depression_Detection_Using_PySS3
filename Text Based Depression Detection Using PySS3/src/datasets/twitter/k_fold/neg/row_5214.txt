I'm done folksWell, I kinda knew that I was already done but put it off. I got some bad news that confirmed that I am pretty screwed. Talking about years in jail, family disowning me, losing my career, etc. all before 40. I'm done and actually feel relieved. I mean, I wouldn't be in this spot if I had been happy before all this. I believe we all end up as worm food so I don't care anymore. I am over it. I am waiting to straighten out my finances (BTW invested in the Greek crisis and am making a kiling) and awaiting my last federal student aid loan (which doesn't have to be paid back if I die) so my mom and niece can have something. No matter what life throws at me, I don't care because I am leaving before 2016. LOL I have lawyers and therapists all encouraging me to fight after they assured me things would get worked out. Yeah and spend thousands of dollars too. I am depressed but not stupid. I wish that things were different but I am too much of a moody and erratic person and I don't have the passion anymore. I read a lot of posts on here and can honestly say most of you do have a lot of potential.
