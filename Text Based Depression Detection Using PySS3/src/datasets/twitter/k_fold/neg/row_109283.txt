i don't want to diei want to disappear, to be small, inconsequential. i want to be a ghost, to not use anything, to not inconvenience anyone, to not be seen, to disappear, i want to not be alone, i want so many things that contradict each other and the fact that i want means i should live right? i don't know. i think like this then two minutes later i'm imagining in graphic detail stabbing myself in the stomach or jumping in front of a train or going to sleep and never waking up i don't know i hate this i hate my brain
