University is making me suicidal.I don't know where else to post this. I've suffered depression in the past but it's mostly been on and off for me. I know stress is normal in university, but it's to the point where I don't know how to cope anymore. I feel like I can't talk to anyone because they'll tell me to "get help", but the problem is that I CAN'T get help because all my fucking time is taken up by school. I can't turn to my hobbies anymore. I can't help myself or try to get better because I never have time. 

I'm studying all day, everyday, for a major I have no interest in (I took it because my parents wanted me to and I can't back out) which is also in my second language (french) which makes it even harder to understand. I'm trying my best, but I feel like I'm going to fail everything. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like my only coping mechanism is self-harm (yes I know that's terrible) but I literally don't have time to do anything else. I've considered taking anti-depressants but I'm not sure if it'll help. Any advice or support is appreciated.
