Why can't I die at this point?I am sick and tired of my life. Nothing is going right for me at all. Every day becomes more difficult to manage. The people in my life are toxic and even are encouraging me to commit suicide. At this point, nothing matters. My death isn't meaningful in any way. There 7.5 billion lives on this planet. Who cares about a 17-year-old dumbass who killed herself. I have not contributed anything worthwhile to society.   After I die, there's going to be fake assholes who pretended that they cared about me when I was alive. Even though they're lying to make themselves seem like decent people. Humans are fucked up creatures and we're beyond redemption.
