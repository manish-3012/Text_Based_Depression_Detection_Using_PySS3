My StoryHey guys, I am on my laptop so I can give a more in depth version of my story. About a year ago I started noticing small things, like fumbling a word every now and then, tripping over my own feet, some memories becoming hazy or non-existent, and I started having intense migraines and blurry vision. A few months after I went to my doctor to get my symptoms checked out and she told me everything was fine (I should note that I suffer from severe anxiety, clinical depression, and PTSD) and that I should not worry about the symptoms. 4 months later, I developed severe pain in my joints and bones, mainly my knees, back, left leg and neck. I went back and was referred for a X-Ray to scan my knee, and nothing was found. I dealt with all of these symptoms, while the fumbling of words, loss of co-ordination, and migraines/blurry vision was gradually worsening. I had a 3 and a half minute seizure 2 weeks ago, and went to my doctor. She wants to send me to a neurologist and a MRI of my head/brain, as she thinks I have a brain tumor. If I do (I have not been to the MRI/neurologist yet) then it is almost certainly malignant and metastatic. By this point, if my earlier symptoms were an indication of the tumor, it has spread to distant parts of my body. I now have great difficulty remembering my most fondest memories, dates and places are wrong, wrong people, events that didn't happen or happened in another time or place, etc. I am also having more and more difficulty with my vision, co-ordination (tripping frequently, dropping things, falling) speaking/stringing sentences together, mental confusion, and nausea/migraines every day, all day without end. I am scared and alone, my body is dying and I fear I won't make it to my MRI/neurologist appointment alive. I am taking steps to ensure my family and friends are cared for in the event that this is my last post/my last days on Earth. Even if I make it, if it is cancer, I doubt the prognosis will be good, and the survival time will almost surely be less then a year. If so, I have made the medical decision that I do not want extraordinary measures taken, in the event I stop breathing/my heart stops. I also do not want treatment of any kind, as I won't put my family through the pain of seeing me turn into a shell of my former self. no one, not even my best friend or girlfriend, knows this entire story, only bits and pieces. I do not want to worry them until I have to. I have made up my mind on my treatment plans, and I have accepted my fate. I will be visiting a lawyer to arrange my affairs and will in the coming days. I will update as often as I can for as long as I can.
