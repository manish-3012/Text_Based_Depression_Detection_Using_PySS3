The gun malfunctioned.Itâ€™s an antique, I guess thatâ€™s where I went wrong. A 32 special. The ammunition was new, but when I pulled the trigger, it only clicked. I cannot, for the life of me, describe the emptiness of hearing an empty click with a pistol against your temple. 

Canâ€™t even suicide correctly, haha.
