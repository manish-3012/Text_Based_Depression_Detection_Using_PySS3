i want to make other people happy so they dont feel anywhere close to how i do but i dont want to live either.it sucks, im in college studying theatre arts because all my life i've just wanted to make other people happy and (since the last few years) so they wont feel like how i do constantly.

the reason it sucks is because i dont think ill make it to even finish my degree. but its not all bad, right?

at least i wont be here.
