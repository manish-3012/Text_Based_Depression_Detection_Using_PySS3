Feeling as if I was 'destined' to dieAllow me to explain. For a good while now - ever since a friend of mine committed suicide - I haven't been able to shake this feeling of impending doom from above me.

We were both freshmen when he died, and I remember the moment feeling so surreal. Like a dream or a hallucination; my memories, thoughts and fears parading around together as if proud of their effects on me.

I soon began to realize that this was nothing of the sort, that what they were telling me was true, and he was indeed dead. I was very upset, as you would expect, but even more so once I begun to find out more and more about his life leading up to his suicide. Long story short, it was horrific to say the least.

He was one of those types of people who were able to put his life aside to either help or hang out with those he liked. He had things that interested him, and he was sure of the things he wanted to do in life, whereas I on the other hand didn't have a clue, and still don't!

What I'm getting at is this: I feel as if I'm wasting away, and have too much time to think (I myself having sort of a horrid past), and being that I'm now living in the house I pretty much grew up in isn't helping me at all.

I've fallen into this deep depression. This month alone, I haven't been outside at all, and have sent various family members with a list of things I needed to keep well, somewhat. I've spent most of everyday asleep, because loud noises take me to a time when they would mean harm in some way, shape or form. I'm beginning to think that maybe instead of sleeping all the time, I might as well take it a step further and put myself out of misery. At least then I wouldn't be such a burden on others.

TL;DR: Life has become a living hell for me since the loss of a friend, and has left me wondering if or not I should commit suicide.
