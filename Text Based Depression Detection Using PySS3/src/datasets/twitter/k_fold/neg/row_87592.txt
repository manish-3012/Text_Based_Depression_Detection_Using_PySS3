Should I check myself into the hospital?I don't know if I have ever been at a bigger risk of killing myself than I'm at right now. I've been depressed for many years, and for over a year now I've been taking medicine to try and relieve some of the symptoms I have. 

Anyways, I have written a suicide note and come very close to ending it all in the past two days. That's on top of having to chat with a Suicide Hotline about two weeks ago. 

I haven't been this close to suicide in well over a year. The last time though I was crying the entire time and very hysterical. Now I'm just very calm about it. I mean I still don't feel good, but I'm not crying or anything. I'm anxious as all hell, but I am not really feeling anything.

I really feel like I should seek help now, but I'm afraid to. My sister has been in and out of the hospital for things like this, and I don't want to put my parents through all of that again. But I really feel like I'm at risk right now. 

Part of me thinks I'm doing this for attention, but really I'm not. I don't anyone to know. That's why I'm using the obvious throwaway.

I just want to end it all. There's things I want to do, part of who I am, that isn't ever going to be accepted by family. And I just want to die instead of living instead of this mental prison I've created for myself. I really don't know what to do anymore. 

I know how sad everyone will be if I do this, so I can still rationalize. But how long will I be doing that for? 

I just don't know what to do, please help.
