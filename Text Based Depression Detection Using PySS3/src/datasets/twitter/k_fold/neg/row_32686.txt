finally set a vague time of when i'm going out.There's no point anymore. when everyday is an uphill battle and you have no hope for the future, it's just impossible. It'll be some day in november, and i'll go out by poisoning, because you can extract nicotine from cigarettes to create poison. I want to make peace with my loved ones and write the note first. Other than that, all I want to do is meet my online friend irl and eat at this one special restaurant in chinatown with my friend cece. 
It's a shame, really. I had a chance to be good, but just like everything else I ruined it. I'm so sorry mom. 14 was as many years as I could go, but I'm just not strong enough to hold on longer. I wish I could stay longer. I wish I could, but when every day is just so fucking hard, it's not worth trying. I'm so sorry for doing this to you. I hope you move on. I wish I was stronger. It's not your fault, you did everything you could. I wanted to accomplish something in this life so you could remember me, but i'm too pathetic. i'm so sorry.
