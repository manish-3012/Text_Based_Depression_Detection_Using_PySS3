SO told me to go die and I am strongly considering listening to him.My whole life has been a painful struggle. I have tried my damndest to overcome all of the immense obstacles in my way. I cant anymore. The stress is making my physically ill. I cant keep going. My mind and nerves are completely shot and my last hope for something to live and look forward too just told me to kill myself. I cant take the pain anymore. My dad died when I was little, my mom left me when I was ill a few years ago, my best friend left me because Instarted dating my new guy. Im sick and just so tired of hurting. I tried reconciling with my family only to be abused verbally and made to cry. I am not allowed to see my grandfather in the nursing home. All of this would make it sound like I am a horrible person. I really have tried to be a good person but a lifetime of being treated this way I cant help but think that I must be a piece of shit. Ive been hated just for existing. Im so tired.
