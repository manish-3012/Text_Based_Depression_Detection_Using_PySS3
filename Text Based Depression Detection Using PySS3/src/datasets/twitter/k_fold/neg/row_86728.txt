It's a brain problemI have had depression for a very long time and zero luck with medication until recently. My doctor prescribed a newer medication because I tried all the old ones. I took it for six weeks and it was working so well. For the first time in years, I've been able to concentrate and focus and remember things. I actually started to feel emotions other than emptiness and obligation and whatever you feel when you know you disappointed someone because you fail at everything you try.  
Actually I wasn't even fucking up as much.

Well, my insurance wasn't into it. They refused to refill my med. They fucking let me take this stuff for a month after my samples ran out just to deny the refill until I've tried the older drugs (again I've already tried them and they didn't work!)  

Do you know what happens when you quit meds cold turkey? You start seeing the "accidental" lethal potential in everything. And your insurance sends you a denial letter that would look great as stationery for a very important note to be read later.  

And see I don't even want to be like this. I have stuff to live for. I was trying to do the right thing by asking for help and going to the doctor. All I did was end up dependent on a drug I can't have anymore and I don't know how to manage without it. I can't make my brain stop thinking about how to get rid of itself.
