Why live with a demented brain?Why shouldn't I kill myself? I have nothing to offer. Just got back from the doctors office and found it's likely I have CTE from a neuropsych test. I'm 25. Memory scores were in the bottom 1-5% for most categories.

I was a gifted student in elementary school and graduated from a top university. Years of football will do that to you. I played since I was 8 and continued playing at the collegiate level until the last concussion knocked me out and was the final blow.

Why should I keep going? Doctors have told me by 30 I'm a candidate for full blown dementia and will be a nursing home at that point if I'm not already dead. I just don't see the point in life.
