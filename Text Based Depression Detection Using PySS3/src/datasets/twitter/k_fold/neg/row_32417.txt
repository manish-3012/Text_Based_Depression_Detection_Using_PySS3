My wife left me.She said she loves me, but not enough. We moved states a few months ago, and now sheâ€™s gone. And I donâ€™t know a single person for 1,000 miles. I am so so lonely. I work as a psychiatric nurse, so I canâ€™t really go to the local psych ward for help... and Iâ€™m to new to take a leave... Iâ€™ve felt suicidal before, but this time itâ€™s so so different. I do not think Iâ€™m safe. I love her so much. And I donâ€™t want to be alone
