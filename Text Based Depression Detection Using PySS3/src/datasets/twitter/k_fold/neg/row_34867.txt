I don't know what to do.One of my best friends went MIA on Monday. Just as that happened, my mental state decreased. I need him here, with other people it just isn't the same. He suggested to me about a month ago, that if my suicidal thoughts get bad - that I should call 911, but my SIM card broke, so he told me if I have to, I should walk to the ER and tell them about my suicidal thoughts. I know I need to go to the ER, and I know my friend would want me to; but I just *can't*. I can't bring myself to. I'm just so tired. I'm done. I don't want to deal with this shit. The hell can I do?
