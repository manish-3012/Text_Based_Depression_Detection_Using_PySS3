Preparing to kill myself in Jan 2018Transferring some cash into bitcoin for use on the darknet. I hate pain so the plan is a bunch of â€œoxyâ€ (probably fent press but itâ€™ll do the job).  I have some friends and family that care but theyâ€™re not in the same city and it doesnâ€™t change the fact that Iâ€™ll always be alone and single. A shadow of my former self. I have a good career but it means nothing in the end. I can barely bring myself to the office anymore; just waiting to get fired to remove that stress.
