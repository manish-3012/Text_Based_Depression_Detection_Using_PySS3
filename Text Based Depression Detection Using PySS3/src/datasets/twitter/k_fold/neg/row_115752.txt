I don't have a passion, I hate responsibilities, I'm not social, and I'm not good at anything. (Objectively)And I guess this is why the future scares me. What hope is there for somebody who's like that? 

Believe me i've tried therapy, but after a few sessions it went south. Maybe it was miscommunication or misunderstanding or whatever, but I got offended when the therapist laughed about something i said during an argument with relatives.

Rather than speak up about it, I just stopped going. The same way I quit my job after being criticized and chewed out in front of many people. Or how I quit my school and got a GED, almost three years ago. I've really just been floating since then. Guess i needed to write that somewhere
