I |14F| want to kill myself so bad that it hurtsI literally have no use in the world, everything that I dreamed about and everything that I want to achieve fails on me. I get bullied severely nobody helps or cares about me. I've been depressed since I was in 4th grade. My mom is always disappointed in me and wants me to better how hard I try i don't want to disappoint her anymore Today i tried to hang myself on a doorknob but it didn't work at all. I would do literally Anything to die or pass out. 
Im typing this while crying so sorry if anything is spelled wrong.
