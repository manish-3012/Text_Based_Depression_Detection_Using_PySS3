I've finally realised why I've never succeeded in ending itI'm not afraid of death, or whatever may or may not come after. That's never stopped me from trying, I've just never gone far enough with it. But I realise now why I haven't.

Nothing would change. I'm already dead now. I don't feel anything, I don't experience anything, and it all just seems like I'm not really here at all. Dying wouldn't change much about that, so why bother at the risk of making it worse if I mess it up? I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of being forced to continue on, but worse off. 

Now that I've come to realise this, I think I'll finally be able to go far enough.
