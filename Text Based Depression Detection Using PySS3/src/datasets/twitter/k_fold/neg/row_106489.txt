I don't feel like I can keep going on!I'm autistic, I'm bi, I'm a gamer. three things people get to judge me for. I feel weak. I feel I barely even have enough strength to type. Need to talk. At the moment I have only two things that make me feel happy. video games, and food. And I'm running out of games to play so I'm losing my only escape from my shitty life.
FYI: prone to not shutting up, and engaging in long conversations.
FYI: Don't know how to pm.
