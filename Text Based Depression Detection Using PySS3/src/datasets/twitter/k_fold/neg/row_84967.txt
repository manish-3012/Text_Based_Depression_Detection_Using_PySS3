goodbye internetthis will be the last time anyone hears from me. I kept trying, trying, and trying to keep my head up but nothing improved. this last event where I got rejected for the 2390389721978th time was the tipping point. maybe the person who rejected me will know when I'm gone as she might not know how I'm feeling right now. she might not have even rejected me in the first place by denying my follow request on Instagram but the chances of that being true are slim to none. to the girl in question, don't feel bad, I would reject me too.
