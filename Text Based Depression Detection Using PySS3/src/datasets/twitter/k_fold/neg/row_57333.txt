Venting (thanks)I've suffered from mental illness from noone knows how long - my parents have memories of my strange anxieties from long before I do.

I don't want to die (but I can't find a better sub to post to), I just wish I DID want to die, so then I'd have an excuse for all my shitty behavior.

I'm 24, I don't have any kids, the only people I've hurt I've had no choice but to be in their life. They're GOOD people, so if I had a choice, I'd choose that they'd never had to know me. Three of my four grandparents were addicts, why am I the only one with this crap?
