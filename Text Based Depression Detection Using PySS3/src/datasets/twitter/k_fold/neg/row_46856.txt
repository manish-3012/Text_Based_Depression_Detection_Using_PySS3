Would really appreciate some advice and ideas for building a plan to fix my lifeIm try to making this is as clear as possible. I am male, 22, Canada.

**TL;DR: Long standing depression, been travelling and trying new places and jobs for years. Depression got so bad, moved home, now clueless on where to begin to fix things, pretty hopeless on if I will ever feel good or have a fulfulling job again**

For almost a decade, after some mild trauma, I have been depressed, off and on in different severity. The main issue being extreme self hatred and isolation from never having had friends. The worse was age 15, i drank a lot, took drugs once, suicide attempt, hospitalized for a month, ran away from home, parents divorce, almost failed school etc. 

I ended up getting my degree in aquaculture, travelling the country, no longer wanted to do aquaculture after my first job in it. Tried different jobs that interested me, far from home or any friends and family or support. Worked in rural mining operations in the north, weeks at a time, 12hour days, never in my own bed. Isolated, miserable, unhealthy. Getting so close to suicide.

Finally called family after 7 years not discussing my mental health with them ever. Told them everything except my suicidal thoughts. They encouraged to get home to get better, I quit my job and drove 4 days to get home. 

I am home now, no friends (At least had drinking buddies in previous town), hate the big city here. All my hobbies are outdoors and I'm stuck in my parents city home. Good to have the support but at this point, I am so hopeless, what do i do. I genuinely think that I have blown my chances at having a good paying and fulfilling job, blown my chances at making good friends and I am scared I will never be happy or be able to leave my parents home again. 

I spoke to a doctor, wants me on antidepressents but I have read so much about how they mess you up, make you an empty zombie, permanently changing your brain. Really dont want to take them, just for the sake of feeling a bit better but sacrificing everything about who you are and all the side effects and theres a good chance youd have to spend a year or more trying different ones like a guinea pig. 

But since arriving home unemployed, my anxiety is so bad, I cant stay still, in so much pain its causing headaches, diarrhea, I am at times creaming outloud, cant sleep well. Dont know what to do. I want therapy but the earliest I can get is 1.5months from now at 200$ per session wow. So i am just waiting, waiting, in pain. 

**What do i do now?**

**Short term:** Need to fix self esteem hopefully for good, find a way to be happy which likely requires friends. But i dont intend to be in my parents  town forever so why make friends just to leave them in a few months. Dont know if i want antidepressents, I really dont but im going insane. What do i do with all this time when i feel like shit and am just waiting 1.5 months for a 1hour therapy session and then waiting every two weeks just for another 1 hour therapy session after that. 

**Long term:** Need to find a job that leads to a fulfilling career. I just genuinely feel stupid and like the only jobs I could do are labour for minimum wage. Need to find a town to settle down in (Lived in 5 different towns in the last 4 years). Again need a way to love myself and have friends. I feel as though if I can find a town I like (I have one in mind only 3.5hrs from family) and can begin to start a career I enjoy there (no idea if theres a suitable career for me), then after that I could begin to settle down and join clubs, make friends etc. But I am so reluctant to be social in my parents town and I still hate myself.

I have no idea where to begin both short and long term. So emberrased and ashamed of feeling this way, being unemployed and running back to live with parents. All my life until now I have had goals and plans and it had been what has kept me going. Now I am so clueless on what to do, if I just have a plan then I might be ok. But feeling so hopeless, at my worst moments I genuinely fully believe that suicide is my only choice and I am scared I might actually shoot myself in a few months if this doesnt improve. I really dont want to do that to my family though. 

Where to begin? Also no idea what to do for career is a major part of my hopelessness.

Thanks
