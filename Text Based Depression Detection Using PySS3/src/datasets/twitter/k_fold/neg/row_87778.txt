I'm not depressed, so why do I want to die?I used to be very depressed, and often wanted to die. Iâ€™m not depressed anymore, but recently the want to end my life has been coming back.

Itâ€™s almost like Iâ€™m just sick of living. I have friends, great family, and all the ingredients for a wonderful life, but something is missing. Not from my situation, but from my emotions. 

I never get sad. Things donâ€™t bother me. Things in my life go horribly wrong, and its like I just shrug and thereâ€™s no emotional connection. Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m numb, but thatâ€™s not quite it either. 

I get happy, good things will happen and I will laugh, and enjoy myself, but itâ€™s like those happy things just get absorbed into me, and turn to nothingness. A happy moment is just a moment, but leads back to numbness. Mostly I just feel like I'm existing, but not really living. 

I find myself sleeping all the time. All night, and most of the day. If Iâ€™m tired, I sleep. If I'm not tired, I sleep anyway. Every so often Iâ€™ll stop feeling tired, and stay awake for a whole week, with almost no sleep at all, and at that time Iâ€™m productive, but I tend to freak out at weird things (probably from the lack of sleep) and then I go back to my old self. That is the only time I feel like Iâ€™m really alive, like Iâ€™m going somewhere. The rest of my days are spent doing the bare minimum, wanting to sleep.
I have things that I want to do, but Iâ€™m taking no steps to achieve them. I want to write a book, but I just donâ€™t. I donâ€™t ever do it, so I donâ€™t know why I say that I will, because I know that I wonâ€™t. 

 Iâ€™ve been wanting to write this post for a long time, but I havenâ€™t because I donâ€™t feel like I should, because Iâ€™m not depressed. I know the hell of being truly depressed, and thatâ€™s not me. I also am very confident in my appearance and personality. I have all the makings of an incredible person, I have so many talents, but I just donâ€™t have any motivation. None. 

There is positive motivation, where you feel like getting stuff done and then do it, and I donâ€™t have that. There is also negative motivation, where you feel stress, and get stuff done because you worry about it. I donâ€™t have that either. I donâ€™t have negative emotions, just this happy/empty feeling. A hollow happiness. A constant, infuriating contentment that I canâ€™t shake offâ€¦


Iâ€™m so happy, so why arenâ€™t I happy? Why canâ€™t I get anything done? Why do I think about stepping in front of a car every time Iâ€™m on the sidewalk? Iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t the place for this, I just donâ€™t know where to turn. There is no one for me to talk to- Iâ€™m the â€œhappy one.â€ People come to me with their problems. They admire me for my confidence, and my resilience. I donâ€™t want them to know that itâ€™s all justâ€¦ emptyâ€¦

I went to a psychologist once, and she told me that she couldn't help me. She didn't understand why being 'too happy' was a bad thing...
