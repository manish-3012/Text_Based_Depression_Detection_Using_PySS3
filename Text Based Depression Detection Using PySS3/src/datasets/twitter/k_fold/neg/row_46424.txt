I have a abusive family... please tell me what i should do? (Re-post from /r/Advice)My dad is crazy we ran away from him me my mom and my sisters (From Asia to Europe). Because my moms parents were abusive as well and my dads parents were too my mom likes nobody else than her old friend which she doesn't talk to anymore my sisters agree with everything she says i don't know why but they are like that. My mom threatened to kill me or herself because she was annoyed by my "Actions" which i have done my whole life but now she has started to call me out for little things. She calls me dumb, idiot, crazy, ugly, delusional, and more mean words. A part of her hate is built up on me being atheist/other religion because i don't believe in things that she does she tells me you can be whatever you want but i'm sure shes not really saying that. She abuses me physically and mentally i don't want to call the police on her or do anything bad to her because she took the pain of giving birth to me, i know many will disagree on that i do too in some way but not 100%. Shes sexist and she hides that by saying she only likes European men and all Asian and Middle-eastern men are idiots and sexists when shes the one that is sexist. She says that she hates us (Me and my sisters). She only laughs and hangs around my sisters. She threatens us to leave the house or suicide so we shut up, and tells me shes gonna kick me out of the house (I am 13).. i do want to grow up and leave but obviously i can't do that. I thought of suicide many times and tried to do it but my sister caught me and she said don't do that because she and my mom will get upset (It has been 5 times that i have tried to suicide). She does many more things... I just wanted to make this as short and understandable as possible thanks. Please help me i don't know what to do with my life i would greatly appreciate it if you help me. (Also hitting your children is illegal in my country)
