How do I help an acquaintance who suicidal? She lives in USA but I live overseas and only have basic info for her.Here is the situation:

I am in a facebook social group, and we have quite a few members who share a common interest. Tonight, one of our members posted a startling message which indicated she might commit suicide tonight. 

I do not know her very well, but I am friends with her on FB, so at the very least, I can see what city she lives in, her employer and some family. Unfortunately, I live overseas, and do not know what the best course of action is. 

I sent a FB note to her son and grandson expressing my concern, but I 'm worried that it might not be seen.

I tried calling her employer, but it's after hours, and it's a large employer and I'm don't know who there would be able to help.

I called the local crisis/suicide hotline in her city and spoke to a counselor. He was understanding, and I asked if it would be worth calling the local police, but it seems that without a specific home address, the police cannot do anything. 

This is very distressing because I don't what else I can do in this situation, or even what the proper course of action would be. Being 12,000 miles away makes it even more difficult. I don't have a good handle at all on her situation, but based on what she said, I have to take it seriously.

If anyone has any advice on what I could do at this point, I would greatly appreciate it.
