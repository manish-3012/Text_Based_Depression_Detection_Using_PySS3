I need helpI am 14 and I need guidance. I am a Christian, but no matter how many times I try, I have a gun to my head every night telling myself," NO, YES, NO, YES, NO, NO, YES, YES, YES." Thankfully, my fear of death and knowing how many people my death would effect has kept me from it so many times.

It started about a year ago, when I was getting ingrown toenails. The pain day in and day out drove me insane, including the times where if you stub your toe it feels like getting shot with a bullet. I didn't worry too much about the small dark thoughts in my head.

A few months pass, and I did a 50/50 challenge with my bud. That night I had a horrible nightmare I don't think will ever go away. It was just dark. Nothing more. I woke up, hyperventilating, not knowing what happened, so scared that I felt like I was in an insane asylum.

Another month passes and christmas arrives. I was excited because I wanted a new computer to pursue my dream of becoming an animator. I got it, but when they brought it out I felt little happiness. I still showed them I was grateful, and continued my day.

New years eve. My dad's dream business shut down. It wasn't a big business, but we needed it to get though the bills. He came home from the shop that night, thankfully unhurt. But the dog there was sleeping in the bathroom when it all happened. Poor thing. After a few days, I started getting nightmares like the one I had in november. 

My 14th birthday June 10, I was happy it was here and I didn't inform my parents of any present ideas so it was a surprise. My mom and dad came to me with a box and said," We know you like to 3d model and animate so we got you this 3D PRINTER." I couldn't tell if I was happy or not. I felt no joy, but I still gave them a good smile to know I was thankful.

Now I am here. Please give some advice. I really need some advice.
