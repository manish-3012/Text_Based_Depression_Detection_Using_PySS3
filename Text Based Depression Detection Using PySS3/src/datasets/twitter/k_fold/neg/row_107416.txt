I'm tiredHello,
I'm 20 years old and I don't know what to do...
so many things that are happening in my life that are driving me insane. I'm gay but I don't dare come out to my very Mexican family because they would look at me with disgust. They are always asking me when I'm going to get a girlfriend and other uncomfortable questions. I just laugh it off and say that my education come first but that too is a lie . I tell my parents I'm going to school but I haven't taken a class in two semesters because of financial issues. I help with bills and stuff but at the end of the month I have very little money. I'm a few pounds overweight but nothing to extreme but my family still makes jokes about my weight. To them they're just funny comments but to me they really hurt. Sometimes I eat very little because I don't want to go back to being 260 pounds. I'm currently at 195 but I'm still not happy. 
It's very hard for me to make friends and I fail at every attempt.
My friends from high school are no longer with me. I was never part of the group apparently. 

Sometimes I just think of ending it all but the love my mother shows me prevents me from doing it. She has ways been there for me and it would be a terrible way of paying her back.
