The Neverending CycleSo I'm listening to electronic music. It's wonderful. At the same time though as I sit here, and when I get back home, I could slit my wrists at any time and be perfectly okay with it and be happy. Happy to know that no one else has to deal with me in life. That's have to deal with No one else. To know that i relieve them of the pain that is me and dealing with me. 

I would probably have more friends in death than life, especially if all people that commit suicide go to the same place. Then people could and Would understand me. And I could make friends.

Actually nothing of this has to do with electronic music. It's just that the music is happy and upbeat and that reminds me of my depressed and sad life. 

It's the same reason why I don't want to ever fall asleep. Depression should make you want to sleep the days away, however, when I fall asleep I live in a world where I'm happy and feel good and have friends. And that depressed me more in the real world than the happiness of falling asleep. And when that happens, you just don't want to sleep. Because ultimately it depressed you more.

The same with hanging out and taking with people. You can talk to people 5% of the day, but then your depressed more when you don't have anyone to talk to the rest of the 95% (including texting). So you end up not talking to anyone so you don't remind yourself what it's like to talk to someone. 

And the cycle is a vicious cycle. And you can never make friends or talk to someone because of it. 

And the cycle is a vicious one. Being alone makes you depressed, but being happy briefly and remembering it later makes you more depressed and suicidal because you never know if you'll ever feel that feeling again. 

I'm trying I'm trying to sleep. I'm trying to trying to sleep.
