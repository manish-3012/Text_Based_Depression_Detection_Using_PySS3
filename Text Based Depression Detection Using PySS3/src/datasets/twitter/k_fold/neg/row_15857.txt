I've been waiting for things to get better for years, I'm tired of waitingEverything is the same.  
All my problems are vicious cycles.  
Don't know how to break the loop.  
Looks like I'll just wait forever and die waiting.  
Things won't get better.  
I'm justing thinking about how much time I'm wasting.  
Ending things now is a solution.  
Don't want to live 50 more years to be sure all of this is pointless.  
Don't want to be a bad friend anymore.  
Don't want to be a bad son anymore.  
Don't want to be a bad parent.  
Don't want to be a worthless human being.
