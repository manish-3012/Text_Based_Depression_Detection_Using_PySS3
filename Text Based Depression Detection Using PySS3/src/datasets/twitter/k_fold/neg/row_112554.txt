Feel like it's my timeMy life has not turned out how I envisioned it and I think I realized I'm just not meant to live anymore. I'm in my late 20s and have not done what I wanted with my life. I've always wanted to be a photographer and although I photograph daily,  and put effort in I am still nowhere near other artists my age. Not only career wise but in every other aspect of life I have failed. I have not really dated anyone (Mainly because I'm ugly) and It's especially difficult because I'm not straight. I also dont have friends. I just think this is it for me.
