I just canâ€™t stop myselfI feel like I have nothing to live for and I just canâ€™t stop myself from cutting myself yeah Iâ€™ve tried but it never works something heartbreaking happens in my life and then the next thing I know is Iâ€™m holding a blade with bloody cuts on my wrist and crying not cuz of the physically pain but cuz of the mental pain that I canâ€™t stop some of my friend know what Iâ€™m doing and try to make sure I stop and some days at school I just get sick of faking the smile on my face and so then when I donâ€™t smile I get asked by mostly my  teachers if Iâ€™m ok and then Iâ€™ll say yes but Iâ€™m not and I just canâ€™t tell then oh no Iâ€™m depressed and want to just die some times I dont want my mom or family to know  Iâ€™m scared to but I know Iâ€™m not going to kill my self anytime soon
