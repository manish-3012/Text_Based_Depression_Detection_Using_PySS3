I am completely lost and aimlessWhat more is there to say? After I separated from my wife. At first I didn't mind, but then everything just went down the hill...

I lost my Visa, because I wasn't married anymore and had to leave America, now I'm living in Argentina because I can't really go back to my home country, it's not safe there...

Truth be told, I don't feel I deserve sympathy or love, I cheated and lied to her, that's unforgivable... I admit and recognize my mistake, I'm not sure why I did it in the first place, but Jesus do I miss her, do I miss my old life, the future that we were supposed to have.

I feel worthless and pathetic, undeserving of love, and frankly I'm at a point where I just want to die, I don't want to leave, I hate myself, my actions, how much I hurt her, how I ruined my life...

I just want to kill myself.
