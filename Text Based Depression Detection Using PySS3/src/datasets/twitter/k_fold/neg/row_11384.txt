To grow up and being an adult (adulthood) is overrated and depressingWhen  we grow up  into being an adult, often we are pressured to be  "realistic". But at  what cost? Too often, especially when you're not  'lucky/fortunate'  enough, all this whole "adulthood" and "grow up"  things just turned us  into a jaded, weary, bitter, cynical, apathy,  limited, empty, cold, sad, &amp; depressed person/individual..

The   young, youthful, carefree, freespirit, creative, lively, happy, &amp;   dreamy/dreamer "child" / "childhood" in us often times slowly have   died.. as we grow up into being an adult..

And  for  many people, it also usually means that we have to "let go", or to  be  more honest &amp; real, I would say that we are being pressured to  kill  our dreams..

Reality is  cruel, cold, disappointing,  very limiting, mundane/boring, stupid,  pointless/meaningless (often  times), &amp; depressing.. especially for  some of us who have fully  realized it &amp; wake up to the harsh truth.
