Lost all hopeI never thought Iâ€™d be making a throwaway and post something like this but here I am. 

I have always dealt with depression for years and self harm. Itâ€™s decreased a bit, but some events have triggered it and Iâ€™m just at the end of my rope. If it wasnâ€™t for my job Iâ€™d be dead right now. Thatâ€™s the only thing weirdly is thatâ€™s keeping me from attempting is having work at 8 am. I used to be happy, have a great support system, be the strong one out of the people around me. Now I have no one. My parents donâ€™t give a fuck, my friends ignore me unless I have something to offer. My life consists of me getting high off Xanax and drinking when Iâ€™m not working or attempting to get my degree. Iâ€™m only in my early 20s Iâ€™m young but just seeing the suffering of those even older than me makes me realize this isnâ€™t worth it anymore. I also went thru a very nasty breakup and itâ€™s been six weeks since it happened but the relationship was toxic in a lot of ways so Iâ€™m very fucked up mentally because of it. Two months ago I was doing well in school, got a promotion and had fallen in love for the first time in almost 6 years. Now Iâ€™m just a shell of who I am and I donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore. I just want a painless way to sleep forever.
