Seriously gonna do it (for the second time)I am genuinely just a burden on society. This isn't some depression-created delusion or anything, it's genuinely just the way my life has gone. I guess I shouldn't even phrase it that way; all seventeen years of my life has sucked BECAUSE OF ME. I'VE DONE THIS. I'm only really realizing this now, though. 

My entire family is broken up because of it. My dad and older sister barely consider me family because I'm such a fuckup. All I do is worsen my mom's weak mental state (I've been told this, so it's actually true and not me having self esteem issues or anything). After realizing how I'm a fundamentally horrible person, how can I NOT kill myself? 

I have the means but I just won't do it- just like everything else in my life. I'm not even sure why I'm making this post because I don't even want to be talked down. Well, in a way I guess I fear dying and DO want to be talked down but ultimately I know it's for the greater good?

Anyway, I guess I need some help. I have two pets that are solely in my care. What can I do to give them up? I'm not really sure how. Do I call a shelter? They're birds, so my options are kinda limited. Don't use them as a reason to not do it; I know. I hate myself for leaving them. But I hate myself even more for not caring for them properly and I know they deserve better. 

I guess I also just hate living with OCD. It's getting severe to the point where I'm becoming extremely unwilling to leave the house. No treatment is helping at all. In fact, I stopped taking my meds so that I'd have means to kill myself because they did such little. 

I guess this is a 'goodbye', Reddit. At least, until I do it (I won't tell you my exact date but it's very soon). Advice on the pet situation would be extremely helpful; even if I don't kill myself, I need to give them up anyway. 

Thanks.
