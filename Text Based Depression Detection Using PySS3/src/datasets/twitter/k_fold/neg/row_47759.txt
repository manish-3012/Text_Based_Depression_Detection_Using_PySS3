I want this to be my last Christmas.Coming here to vent a bit. I donâ€™t see myself in immediate danger, but I need to talk about it. 

The last 16 months ave just repeatedly beat me down. Over and over. When I think I could possibly get out of this funk something else sucker punches me and Iâ€™m back in it. Itâ€™s not all things out of my control. There has been some bad decision making on my part and I accept that. 

Along with external factors, internally Iâ€™m just a wreck. I just donâ€™t enjoy anything.  At all. Iâ€™m always just so lethargic, anxious, or angry at dumb shit. All I want to do when I get home is sleep on the couch. I wouldnâ€™t ever move if I didnâ€™t have to. I donâ€™t even do anything. Yeah, I have YouTube on but Iâ€™m not even watching it.  Iâ€™ll read Reddit and then get bored and close the app and immediately open it again. 

Iâ€™ve talked to my psychiatrist and we have been working on adding different meds. It seems like we just keep adding and adding and nothing changes. Iâ€™m in the exact same place I was at mentally before I even started seeing her.  Nothing is working and nothing changes. 

Iâ€™m thinking of just making this my last Christmas. Iâ€™ll hold on until Jan 1st or 2nd and bow out. This life is not worth living to me. Iâ€™m not happy and I wonâ€™t ever be. Itâ€™s a waste of my time and Iâ€™m just a waste of space.
