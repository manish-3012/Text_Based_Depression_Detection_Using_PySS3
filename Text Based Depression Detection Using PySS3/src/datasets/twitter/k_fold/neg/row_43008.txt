Quick and painless.Iâ€™m not going to go on a rant as to why I want to go through with this. All I know is Iâ€™ve gotten to this point and there is no turning back. All Iâ€™m asking for is ways to make it look like it wasnâ€™t intentional. The last thing I would want is for my wife to know how I truly feel about myself. I also want it to be painless. Idk, maybe thatâ€™s not the way to go. Maybe I deserve the pain for wanting to go through with this. Either way, suggestions?
