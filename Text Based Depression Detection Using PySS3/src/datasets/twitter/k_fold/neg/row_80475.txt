I don't know what to do anymoreI haven't accomplished much in my life. I'm 18, still living with family, and can't hold down a job because I'm shitty with interacting with people. Been fired for it 3 times already, all three times I was told the equivalent of I'm not assertive enough and I'm too shy for the position.

 I'm shitty with interacting with people because I actively avoid people, and I actively avoid people because I'm shitty at interaction. That's never going to change. The only thing I had going for me was that I started college this year. It's already extremely stressful, but its the only thing that gets me out of the house and I can look forward to actually having something that'll help me get a job later on. 

The only reason I can go to college is because financial aid covered it entirely. I was originally going to get have tuition covered plus a check for $2K for supplies. Funding was cut down to a check of $100 for supplies.

Funding was just cut again. I owe the school $1500 more per semester than aid is covering. I have $250 saved in my bank account, it's all the money I have left from working. All my non-essential assets, if sold, maybe would cover $1000 and would leave me with pretty much nothing but a really cheap laptop. I still wouldn't be able to afford the first semester, let alone next semester and then the three years or so after. My family is dirt poor (which is why I got fin aid in the first place) and living paycheck to paycheck, so that's not even an option.

I don't know what to do. Without a college education my life literally has no meaning. I'm fucking worthless to society. No skills, no experience, no goals, no friends, no money, nothing.

Going to financial aid office in the morning to see if I do anything that can resolve it. I have a tiny shred of hope it was just an error (highly doubt it). If they say there's nothing they can do to help me out, I'm probably just going to kill myself tomorrow.
