I have asked too much of my friends and lost my one excuse to leave the house anymoreIâ€™ve been accused of emotionally manipulating my friends into giving me â€œfree therapyâ€ and have been stuck in social isolation for months because of it. No one will just talk to me. I canâ€™t function like this. I stayed up till 7am with a panic attack over losing my only consistent social event and fall asleep at 3am on a good night. I have been raped, hospitalized twice, and trapped alone in my room for months too agoraphobic to just go for a walk.
