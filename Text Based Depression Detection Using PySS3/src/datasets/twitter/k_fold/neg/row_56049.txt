Yo, I'm outIm tired of my mind playing tricks on me. Let me see where do I start. I'm 20 years old grew up a screw up in South Los Angeles California in the hood. Did all that. I moved to Portland 2 years ago. Came here had a blast was dating all sorts of chicks. Tried meth here for the first time. I over did it fried my brain. Now I hear voices, I have trouble breathing and I'm not saying I'm gay because I don't sleep with dudes but I picked up some fruity behaviors I can't shake off. And I got PTSD from getting in a shoot out when I was high (nobody died thank God.. I was stupid but self defense). I hate this it's embarrassing living like this. because of who I was. I was the man. I was the one people came to for back up. I was the one who people wanted to party with. All the females wanted some of this.  Now everyone switched up on me, even family. I kinda think some one did witch craft on me. I just want my old life back. But it doesn't work like that. So ive accepted suicide as a way out.
