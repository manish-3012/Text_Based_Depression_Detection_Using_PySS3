Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™m sorry for being a worthless excuse of a â€œpersonâ€ Iâ€™m sorry for never being able to do anything right Iâ€™m sorry for messing everything up Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m still alive and Iâ€™m sorry for this post Iâ€™ve known since I was 8, that I shouldnâ€™t have been born and suicidal thoughts since 11 and now Iâ€™m 18 after being in a very abusive home for years and my work money being taken and spent for years that I shouldnâ€™t have been born because itâ€™s my fault for not being good enough for not doing the cleaning properly for making friends want to leave me because Iâ€™m annoying. Iâ€™m sorry for my existence and that Iâ€™m still here.
