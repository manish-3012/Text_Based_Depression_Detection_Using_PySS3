I tried to kill myself and I couldn't tell anyoneA few weeks ago, the crushing reality of life came down upon me and I couldn't handle it. I realized I'm not good enough to get into a music oriented college and I have so many mental problems I'm pretty much useless(Anxiety, MDD, ADHD, Psychosis). 

I took 66 pills and went to sleep with extreme pain in my stomach from the pills. About 8 hours later I woke up vomiting and in pain my whole body felt so heavy like lead was running through my veins. i couldn't concentrate I couldn't have any coherent thoughts let alone speak for hours.

I regretted it for a few days because I was in constant fear of my liver failing. It could've  taken up 10 days for my liver to fail. After I was in the clear I no longer regretted my decision and I wanted to do it again. I actually found it funny that I tried to kill myself (which I realize wasn't a normal of ration response in any way shape or form). I haven't tried since then but in the past I tried to kill myself using different methods more times than people know. There's 3 suicide attempts that people know about and then there's about 13 that people don't know about. 

I feel like I'm in a constant loop of feeling better than trying to kill myself and I don't know if it's ever going to end until I succeed.
