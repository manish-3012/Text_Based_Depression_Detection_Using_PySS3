Feeling conflicted about seeking helpIâ€™ve been feeling on and off suicidal for the past three weeks now. Much of it is due to social distancing, or at least the impact of it. I havenâ€™t been really talking with anyone since this all started and itâ€™s been horribly isolating in general. And I think this loneliness paired with a deep fear of being left behind is bringing up negative feelings again. 

But I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m able to speak to anyone. I feel too in the middle, you know? I donâ€™t have a date or the stuff on hand right this second for going through with it. I have a solid plan and can go through with it when I need to, but I donâ€™t have like a set date or anything. Itâ€™s just, planning out of comfort or for when I finally realize itâ€™s not worth going on. And because of that, I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m a priority. Iâ€™m not in immediate danger, I genuinely have no idea how anyone can help nor do I really want help. Iâ€™m not refusing but, idk what actually can help. So I donâ€™t want to bother people with this nor do I want to call a line seeking help. 

I just need a place to vent or somewhere to talk where I can at least get these emotions out and not sit on them making them worse.
