Itâ€™s all falling into place for me.Iâ€™ve been depressed for a very long time. Itâ€™s gotten itâ€™s worst in the past 6 months. But recently, I lost my best friend, and subsequently other friends to. Yes, I have my fiancÃ©. We just bought our first house. But she works and Iâ€™m home by myself every day and I stay up by myself at night. I knew I wanted to die before but this is the first time Iâ€™m actually considering it.
