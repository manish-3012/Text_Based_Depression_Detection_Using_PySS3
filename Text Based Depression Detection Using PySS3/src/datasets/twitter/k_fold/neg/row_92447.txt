[Q] What are the general symptoms of suicidal tendencies/depression?I'm concerned about my friend... He's gone from a happy guy to very quiet and withdrawn. He barely eats anymore, looks like he never sleeps, and has left most of his friends. He used to hang out with us a lot, but now he barely even says hello to anyone, not even his GF. He's big into art and standup, but his jokes as of late have gotten pretty dark, and his art went from melodramatic to flat out frightening. He's lost interest in school (his GPA went from a 3.4 or so to a 2.2, and he sorta blanks out whenever any teacher tries to talk to him apart from asking a yes or no question) and no longer seems to be interested by any of the projects.

I'm worried about him. He's always been sorta bottled up when it comes to emotions, but now it seems like he's hiding something. Any advice so I can try and figure out what's going on and how I can help him?
