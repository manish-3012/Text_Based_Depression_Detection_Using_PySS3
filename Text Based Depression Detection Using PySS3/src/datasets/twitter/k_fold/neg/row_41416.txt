I think I'm doneSo I've never been very happy. Never had friends. Always been the 'spare child' and never been too bright outside of academics. And it's all catching up to me. I'm single, totally alone, and about to drop out of uni because I screwed up my finances so bad. I have no prospects left and no one to give me a hand out of this shit hole I've found myself in. My only friend, the last person keeping me hanging on to life, is leaving for her home country in less than a month.

Honestly, I don't see the point in struggling for another 20+ years absolutely alone and still failing at everything I turn my hand to. I have no talents, the idea of a desk job makes me want to vomit since the only thing I'm qualified for is a mind-numbing admin role, and my financial situation means I can't even escape to try something new somewhere new.

It's amazing how many big plans for my future I've managed to fuck up. And now I don't have a future. Just regrets and apologies. And I want it to be over.
