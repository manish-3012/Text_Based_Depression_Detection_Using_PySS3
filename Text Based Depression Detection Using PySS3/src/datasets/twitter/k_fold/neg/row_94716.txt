How to deal with not wanting to live(sorry this started as a question but mainly just turned into a rant to vent some of my frustration)I have not been happy almost a decade at his point.(Went down hill after was ditched by my friends at school and just never managed to make any since*[I have made some acquaintances from time to time but they never last and I don't really feel close to them] )
I have tried counselling,antidepressants, CBT,etc.. yet nothing ever seemed to help. One thing which has frustrated me with getting help is nearly every time I have a checkup meeting with the outpatients unit they ask what can they do to help me? At the start it didn't bother me but now I just keep thinking if I knew how to improve my mood then why would I even be there? It just seems like they ask that to give me the illusion that there is someway for me to be enjoy life, when really there is not. As at the end of the day how could they help, don't they say in the end its always up to the person to get better themselves? 
Even at the last meeting when I felt had kind of a plan to kill myself the next week I couldn't tell them as the last time I told them they came very close to telling my parents. Unfortunately I didn't go ahead with it I just set a noose up a few times and stood up on the chair a few times that week and just stood there for a while on two separate days hoping I would slip but it just felt so surreal. Currently the only thing that is keeping me going is my goal to complete university but last semester I just could not get myself to study it just felt like what was the point. Even now I am waiting for my results back and part of me thinks if I don't to well enough/ need to repeat anything I should kill myself as I have already taken time off and needed to switch university due to depression. Life just seems hopeless I have nothing to look forward to and if I apply for a job they will probably ask why I swapped university and took time off and why did badly that one semester and they would probably guess it was due to either me being laz or unwell either way I can't help but think even now why bother completing the degree as with how it will look I doubt anyone would hire me and with my lack of social skills there is now way I can get a good job without the degree. There is nothing I enjoy and I spend most of my free time just watching tv shows online to distract myself.

So I guess why live? It seems like I am failing at every aspect of life socially as I have no friends and can't seem to get into any meaningful relationships(platonic or otherwise), Academically due to the bad grades from this semester and my past track record and now my loss of motivation for life, fitness with as I hurt my foot awhile back so I can't even do much in that department(I have tried physio but I couldn't keep up the exercises).
Well I doubt anyone will get this far and I am not even sure how cohesive this is but if you have any advice it would be appreciated, also sorry for wasting your  time with this long post.
