Tired of this world, but i can do nothingI've lost my will to live... The idea of being condemned to a life of work for the benefit of others (capitalism), in a world filled with violence, injustice, corruption, diseases, etc. For another 50 years aprox. (I'm 30) just fills me with despair.

Why do other people think that it's worth to be alive? just for a few moments of "happiness"? or for some sporadical dopamine rush at the cost of much effort and pain? For me, it doesn't worth it.

I have no long term goals, not even short term ones, have no illusions or dreams. Everything demands effort, everything has a cost, a sacrifice, and for what? we'll die anyway. Why to prolongue the suffering?

The most frustrating thing for me is that there are no means for people to choose to end their lives peacifully and with dignity. There are no laws for assisted suicide or euthanasia, the substances that can kill you without pain are forbiden, and there are even scammers "selling" promises of relief, the organizations that preaches about the right to die are just lucrative bullshit or put several requirements to "help" you, everything in this world is about making money, and the worst money is made from the despair and the suffering of others.

I won't kill myself (for now), because i want to die in my own terms: without pain and peacifully, but in this stupid world it seems something almost impossible to achieve.

Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad english.
