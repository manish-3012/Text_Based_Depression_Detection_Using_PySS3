Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™m sorry that I canâ€™t be a perfect daughter 
Or a good student
I canâ€™t focus most of the time 
I spend a lot of my time bored 
And alone 
Iâ€™m sorry I canâ€™t be there for everybody on this subreddit 
I want to be 
I really do
But I just canâ€™t 
I donâ€™t want to hurt myself 
Or kill my self 
But I do wish I was dead sometimes 
A few months ago I took an actual depression test and I guess I have severe depression but I canâ€™t tell my family 
And I canâ€™t get help 
I just want to be in my happy place hanging out with my cousin 
Heâ€™s my best friend but I never see him
I just wish I could help others 
But I donâ€™t know how
