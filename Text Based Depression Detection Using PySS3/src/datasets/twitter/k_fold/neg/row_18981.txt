I just need someone to listen.I feel so numb and I'm scared of feeling this way again. It's been years since I've felt this depressed. The last time, I almost went through with it. I thought I had it under control. My wife has been struggling with depression also, lately. I've been trying to be there for her and trying to get her to get help but it feels hopeless after hearing so often how she finds no enjoyment in life, in being with me or our kids. I'm struggling not to take it personally due to some of my own insecurities. I'm a stay at home dad because I couldn't push through to finish college. My family has basically cut contact because of differing religious beliefs, and I've left behind all my friends to get out of the drug scene. I need some support once in a while, but all I have is her. I need to feel like I bring something worthwhile to the table but she can't provide that right now and I can't rely on one person for all my social support. I keep trying to bottle away my own issues until it explodes and I say something I regret. It feels like I just keep making things worse. I feel like I have no control over my life right now and I have no idea where to go from here.
