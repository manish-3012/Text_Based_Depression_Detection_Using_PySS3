I've realized why people kill themselves.Since the day I was born, I've always been alone. I've never been able to form a connection with anyone. Not even online.

And suddenly, it hit me. Like a sledgehammer right into my face - **I am completely alone in this world.**

Even though it may seem liberating or romantic, it isn't. It's the cold hard truth I'll have to face for every day until I die.

I don't think I'll be able to bear that burden.
