I have a feeling my brother might commit suicide but have no idea how/if I should confront him about it.Long story short, my brother's in some deep shit.

For all of my life, he's always been extremely upbeat and one of the most positive people I've known. 

For the past ~8 years, he's been in (what appears to me as) an abusive marriage. Over the course of the past 8 years, he's had 3 kids with his wife (in what I believe were attempts to rekindle the marriage) but this has only caused more problems.

He always tells me that he's strong and that he'll figure it all out but I'm worried that his strength is wavering. He recently got arrested for something car related and is now either in jail or at home with his abusive wife.

From the way I've described it, it might not sound like there's much for me to worry about, but I'm seriously having my suspicions. I'm extremely worried about him but I have no idea what I should do to help (if I should at all). He's my brother, after all.

Please help :(
