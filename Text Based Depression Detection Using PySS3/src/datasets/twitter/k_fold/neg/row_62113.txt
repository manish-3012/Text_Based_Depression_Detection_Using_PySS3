I need a friend right now.Quick and to the point, I was just told by my wife that she is done and wants a divorce. I'm seriously fucked up in my head right now and although I don't know for sure if I want to die, I keep looking over at some strong leather belts wondering if they'll easily support 225lbs. of weight. My heart hurts, I'm crying like I've never cried before, I'm at the lowest point of my life right now.  
  
**Update:** Last night we talked on the phone for almost 3 hours and she admitted that she was making another rash decision like she loves to do. I brought up the possibility of marriage counseling again to her and she agreed "if we can get through the next couple months without killing each other."  So I stayed up all night looking up places to get counseling. I even grabbed a few e-books to read about how to deal with marital problems. I'm exhausted and have read 2 books, both with some really good information in them. I was in the middle of printing one of them out for her to read, I was going to go over and present it to her this morning...well, I was until she sent me a 5 page text saying that last nights 3 hour talk was a waste and that she wanted to be left alone.  
  
I'm drained right now. I don't know what to say or do. My body is shaking and I keep staring at my wedding ring and wondering where it all went wrong. This sucks.
