I'm really struggling to find a reason to stay alive right now.There's nothing left here. I feel like no one really cares but I guess maybe that's not true. I don't know. One of the few things I love doing is being taken away from me because of my physical health and even though it's just a month without it, I'm not sure I can keep on. I don't know. This is a pretty pointless post. I don't know. I've always been told that I'll probably follow in my moms footsteps and right now, I'm really close to taking that way out. Today might be the last day or maybe it won't be. Who knows. And if it is the last day I'm very comfortable with that. I'm just struggling to find a reason to keep living. 

I just finished school for the year and that makes me really upset. This summer is going to be awful. My dads going to force me to stay home and watch my brothers the entire summer. He's going to stay mad at me because of the report card that I should be getting in the mail soon. I don't know. I shouldn't even be upset. Right now I have great friends and okay family and yet I'm still really depressed. My meds aren't doing anything for me. I don't know. I'm sorry for wasting everyone's time but I'm just not sure there's anything left here for me. I just want to die.
