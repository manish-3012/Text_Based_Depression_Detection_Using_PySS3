PanickingCurrently anxious as hell. Thinking about a lot of things I shouldn't be. I don't want to have a panic attack but I have no one to reach out to right now and it's so hard to calm down and prevent one from happening.

Please can someone just talk with me? I feel like a pile of shit that I have to come here so much. I just have nothing else in my life.
