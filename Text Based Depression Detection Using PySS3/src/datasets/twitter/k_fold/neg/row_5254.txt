I apologize for posting this, as I write it.Hi. My name is Trent, I'm sixteen, and I've been dealing with depression for a while. I was alone as a kid until the fifth grade when I met my first friend. I was picked on a lot. I know this post is dumb and I'm sorry for posting it, I've been trying to post for the past three nights but every time I finish I just erase everything since it's worthless text. 



I'm sorry for anyone who knows me in real life on this reddit account. I'd use a throwaway if I didn't feel like I'd be quitting life soon. 



I don't really want to start by telling my story. I've wrote it so many times, I know that people don't care at this point. Last September I went to the hospital for the second time because I was extremely suicidal. I've been sick from school with mono for the past few days, and I'm feeling extremely lonely. 



I don't know. I'm sorry I'm not saying enough, and I'm sorry I'm saying anything. I'm terrified of the idea of being liked or disliked, and how thin the line is. Maybe this is all silly. Maybe I should give up, erase this, go to bed and find the bottle of Tylenol when I wake up. But I'm writing this post to try and find alternative routes. 



I like music. Kid Cudi. Kanye West. Of course, everyone makes fun of him 24/7, so it's hard to be motivated by him nowadays. 



I'm sorry. I'm going back to crying. I love you guys, this subreddit is amazing and I'm sorry I feel this way.
