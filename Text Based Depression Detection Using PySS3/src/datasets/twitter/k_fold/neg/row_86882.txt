Done.Iâ€™m fucking tired of my family. I feel like Iâ€™m being punished for being in their presence. I feel like a burden and a pest to EVERYONE I meet. Iâ€™m amazed Iâ€™ve gone 19 years without a suicide attempt. Iâ€™d love to check myself into a crisis center just to get away from them. If I donâ€™t do exactly what they want me to, Iâ€™m met with screaming and empty threats. Every day I edge closer to hurting myself. I fucking hate everything and university was an ESCAPE. I regret being excited for summer break. I hate that they brought me into this world and I hate waking up every day. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m fucking done.
