The end is near.I've been diagnosed with depression for 5 years now, although I've been feeling bad for longer than this due to many many factors.

I have tried everything. Therapy. Medication. Psy ward. Suicide attempts also. Nothing and no one has had the power to save me from the burden and the sorrow that my life is today.

People don't care about me anymore when I ask for help. They say 'well...business, as usual, she's depressed." 

I'm not worth living. I am a burden to everyone and an awful human being.

I have been recently dumped by my 'boyfriend' (i was a rebound actually) and my job, which led me to consider suicide properly.
I have prepared everything for some time now and I think I'm living my final week. I want everything to be ok, and finally end up all this and achieving it. 

I'm sorry English is not my native language, but if someone out here could have a little word for me before I go, this would be good to tell myself that at least someone thinks about me.

I hope all of you there will make it, instead of me, my thoughts are with you.
