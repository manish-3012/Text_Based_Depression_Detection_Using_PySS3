I want to ram my car into a treeThe title says it all. I have this running movie in my head. I go to my car, drive a little ways from home, find a good place to pick up speed and go right into a tree. Just fanatizing about it feels so damn good. 

I have this fucking song stuck on loop in my head as well, idk the name of it but it makes me extremely depressed and upset.

I see no way forward in life. I see no other options than outright killing myself. I was born fucked in the head and I always will be, no matter what sugar pills/placebo they put me on. They don't know how to help me, only my mom does and she's dead.

Edit: Thanks for downvoting my thread, you're just reinforcing all my thoughts. And reinforcing my idea that no one gives a shit.
