Walking a tightrope.Hi,

Iâ€™m not sure where to start, not really good at expressing how I feel aha. Iâ€™m 19M and was diagnosed with Type 2 Bipolar Disorder just before I started Year 7, when I was 13. Since then, Iâ€™ve felt it hard to control my emotions.

For years Iâ€™ve put myself through a bunch of bullshit and put up with so much fuckery that has just reduced me to a state of turmoil and Iâ€™m not sure where to go anymore. Iâ€™ve abused drugs, seen friends overdose and die and been subject to beatings at the hands of my Motherâ€™s partner for the last 7 years of my life, with him telling me that my friends will leave me and that Iâ€™ll never amount to anything repeatedly. I have no confidence in myself and my abilities, I canâ€™t hold a job, and Iâ€™m losing the passion I once had for writing and reading. 

Every time my mood shifts my thoughts go to committing suicide and planning how to do so. Iâ€™ve self-harmed quite a few times and attempted twice. Iâ€™ve never gone through with it because Iâ€™ve always thought about how my friends would feel if I did. But recently Iâ€™ve felt myself growing more apathetic, almost like I donâ€™t care how theyâ€™d feel anymore. I find it kind of scary but at the same time, for the first time, I feel like I could really go through with it. 

I find it incredibly hard to talk about my feelings.  I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever tell my friends how I really feel. I always act like Iâ€™m okay around them but sometimes theyâ€™ll see my self-harm scars or bruises from where Iâ€™ve been beaten down and Iâ€™ll try to change the subject. I donâ€™t know why, itâ€™s just instinct at this point. 

So, yeah. Iâ€™m not really sure what Iâ€™m trying to get out of this. I guess I just needed to let someone know. 

Thank you for reading.
