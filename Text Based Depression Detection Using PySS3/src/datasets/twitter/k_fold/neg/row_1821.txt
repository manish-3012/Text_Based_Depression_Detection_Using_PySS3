I canâ€™t stop this lonelinessMy whole life I have been feeling lonely off and on. I always felt like everyone was more liked then me, had more friends, was always being kept in contact with.

 There were times where these feelings subsided and others where it comes back in full force. But it mostly has been a constant feeling. I just feel like I have never been loved. 

I always wanted to have a big group of friends where we did stuff all the time with each other, always planning events with each other. I see this all the time with other people so why not me?

I guess I had this a couple of years ago but it has slowly subsided. I feel like between the few friends I have I am always having to make the initiative. 

If I didnâ€™t they would never keep in contact with me. I am sure though that amongst there friends they are always being invited or they are inviting others, forgetting about me. 

I often get jealous  of other people, Especially Hispanics. I see them with friends and family all the time, there parents probably take initiative to see them multiple times a week and my mom doesnâ€™t take the initiative with me. 

I donâ€™t know what I did to not be so unliked in life. I am a 30 years old white male living in the Bay Area, married, with a child on the way. I just feel like ending it all I have a terrible fear of loneliness and I want to be loved. I donâ€™t want to die alone. I would rather end it all now then feel like that later in life. I just want to feel loved, have a big family, and a bunch of close friends that care about me.
