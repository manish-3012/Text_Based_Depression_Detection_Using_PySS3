Stuck in the middleHello...Iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself for many years now on and off. I did try to commit once four years ago but I survived and got better. This year something bad at school happened (in my senior year, in February) and it traumatized me beyond relief. In March my school closed and I never got to experience normalcy again. I donâ€™t have any friends, and I donâ€™t feel any hope for the future. Nothing excites me anymore! I used to want to be a nurse or a teacher but I donâ€™t want to work...I feel no sense of purpose, no sense of fulfillment, and I donâ€™t really know anyone whoâ€™s actually happy. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because it would make my mom feel the exact same way I do right now, and I canâ€™t pass that trauma on to someone else. Therapy, medication, and partial hospitalization programs have not helped me. I donâ€™t know where to go from here...
