I tried to suffocate myself this morningItâ€™s the only thing I have the courage to try. I have nothing left to live for Iâ€™m a loser and the one person who gave me the will to live hasnâ€™t talked to me in over two years and sheâ€™ll never talk to me again. Iâ€™m only 20 but Iâ€™m going nowhere in life I just want to die already
