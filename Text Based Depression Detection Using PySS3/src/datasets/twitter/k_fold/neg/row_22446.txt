What's the pointFrom an outside perspective you'd think my life is great. I have a supportive family, I'm graduating high school and going to a fantastic college... my future is bright. My motivation to do basically anything past the essentials is incredibly low because I cannot find a point or purpose to life. What's the difference between dying now and dying in 50-80 years? I can't see myself holding a job, no matter how easy. I foolishly thought money and success would make me happy and I'm now beginning to realize how wrong I was. Anti-depressants help with my overall mood, however they cannot change my point of view on life. Every day and every night is spent thinking about suicide. I don't know what happens after death, nobody does. That's the only reason I haven't done it. Each day I'm getting closer and closer. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I worry for my life when I'm on my own. It's such an odd feeling being so depressed and suicidal, yet being afraid of death. I've tried therapy. Maybe I went in with the wrong mindset, but it turned out exactly how I thought.

I don't know how much longer I can hold on.

We are just born to die. Why prolong the inevitable? I can't get past that mindset.
