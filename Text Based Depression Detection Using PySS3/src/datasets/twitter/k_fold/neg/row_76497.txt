Online friend that I can't meet in real life has been very direct as of late, I need urgent help as to what I can do.We became friends on one of those friend-making subreddits and for many weeks now we've been good friends, talking all the time and playing games together. Cheerful but stressed-out individual that was okay for the most part.

For the past week or two he has been telling me he was inflicting self-harm over bad test scores, and a nasty recent breakup. 

Today, on a common server, he said he decides to take his own life in the near future. Immediately I messaged him about it and he said he was being serious.

I didn't know what to say for the most part but mate an aggregate of all the reasons he was important to me and several others. At the moment that somehow it seemed to have convinced him, but

It is important that I say the right things and avoid clichÃ©s that might put him off from wanting to listen to me any further. Note that it is very unlikely he has told anyone in real life about it so I feel obliged to do something about this myself for all that an internet stranger's words could be worth to him. 

Thank you. Time is of the essence.
