I am overcome with great despair because I'm still breathing. I desire nothing more than to overdose and die.Hello everyone, I'm 17 years old, I have come to the realization that death is what I crave, I've lost interest in everything under the sun, I also believe wholeheartedly that I am the most inept and underwhelming human to ever touch the human race, deserving of death.

I am terribly unskilled at everything I've ever done, nothing has ever cliqued in my mind, and nothing ever will, I am an embarrassingly useless and unintelligent individual. I can barely follow basic directions without ending up sabotaging whatever I was doing. I don't have a job, I've never been attractive enough to get relationships, or even make friends. Nothing in school matters to me, I don't have any motivation to do anything in the classes anyway, all of it is boring rubbish that I'd rather die than listen to. Matter of fact, all of life is that way.

Daily politics bore me a lot. Video games, a pastime that used to provide me solace, doesn't entertain me at all. Listening to music used to be one of my favorite things, but I don't enjoy it at all anymore, like most things, it doesn't distract me from what I really want, which is death. 

An hour doesn't pass by without me fantasizing about delving deep into the medicine cabinet and consuming every last pill.

I have never affected anyone in this world in a positive way, I'm not of use to anyone because I don't have the ability to succeed in anything despite effort. I would be much more useful to the world if I were to kill myself right now, statistically speaking. Humans are a disease to the world, therefore me dying would be one step in the right direction when it comes to population control and lowering carbon emissions, as little as that may be. One inept person doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things anyway.
