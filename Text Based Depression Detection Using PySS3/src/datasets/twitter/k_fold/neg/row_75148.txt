Starvation Mode...Well, after failing at slicing my neck open, I made an exit hood and bought a tank of helium. Haven't the guts to use it though!!

I've eaten less than one thousand calories in seven days though, no medication, and now stopped drinking water as of last night too. I even slugged neat vodka a couple of times to help things along... 

Am considering taking zopiclone with a slug of vodka? I've got way too much energy for someone who has starved themself all week yet no cigarettes, and no desire to do anything. I just toss and turn. Am wondering if a benzo with dehydration and alcohol might be all I need to have a heart attack in my sleep?

I have some Valium here too but as I have mast cell disorder, and Valium is a mast cell stabiliser, I fear that taking Valium would help rather than hurt me. 

Thoughts? (No talking me down from the ledge thanks. It's a long story, I've had enough, and can't even get a job because of what my evil bastard doctors did to me.)
