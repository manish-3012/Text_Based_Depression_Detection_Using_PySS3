No one can hear meSkipped through like another page in the book, seen but unread.

Screaming and crying for help but no one there to hear me â€œsomebody please god anybody help me, I canâ€™t escape the pain please just end meâ€ the 1000th prayer for death unheard again. 

The blazing fire of the unknown anger, yet it all feels so cold.

My tears soak the pillow again, building every day until the hurt is drained down to the feeling of nothing. 

Hopelessness, mentally facing the cold floor but looking up at the stars every night to see no sight of heaven. 

Iâ€™ve been alone long before quarantine, and as I think to myself... itâ€™s the same as being in a crowd... unseen again. Die, Die, Die my brain and heart scream... if only I could. 

Iâ€™m not mute or anything, but Iâ€™ve always been to the ears of god. No one loves me, no one will. 

Injustice to the desert of my soul, getting weaker every day... until finally, I can die.
