Iâ€™d like to know that at least someone loves me for who I amDuring these days of waiting before killing myself a thought is recurring in my head. There is one event that may make me reconsider, and that is finding someone who showed to love me for who I am, without the conditioning of emotional dependence (my mom, my wife, my best friend who is more suicidal than me), financial (my wife), career (my team). It feels like the only people who care for me want something from me. Iâ€™d like to meet someone who just likes hanging out with me. Itâ€™s a lot to ask huh?

And then, if I find her / him, sheâ€™ll become emotionally dependent on me and I on her, and weâ€™re back at square one, ahah.
