I feel like really I just enjoy being sadIf I wanted to better myself I could, but I don't. It's shameful that there are so many things I could be doing, so many ways I could become worth something, but I choose not to every single day. It's no one's fault but my own.

Everyone sees me as a loser except myself, yet I must be a loser to be this unhappy. It's confusing though -- I see people having parties, socializing, having families etc. and I look back to when I did have those things and I just wanted to be alone during it. I got my wish now but now I'm self-destructing my health and am just as unhappy as I was before. (Maybe I was happier before? I honestly don't remember.)

Why are we supposed to constantly be striving for more? It sounds cliche, but I didn't ask for any of this. 

What's more is I have a family member who is counting on me, so I feel immense guilt about ending it. It makes me feel resentment for her because if she were more able, I could be free...

I don't really want to stop being an addict. Every time I talk to someone about the way I feel, they just say, "Well, if you didn't do ____, you'd be happier." I don't believe it, and to be honest I don't really want to put in the work to find out. It's like I'm happier being unhappy. 

Going to go do _____ now so I feel better, lol.
