hey guys, im doneI've been lying to myself that ill come out stronger if i just carry the pain, people trying to talk me out of it, telling me how i'll hurt people...i believe my pain will forever be there, no coping mechanisms work, sure they help me get out of the feeling for sometime but j still go to sleep and wake up wanting to die, i know life isnt rainbows and butterflies all the time but to wake up wanting to die and cutting myself every morning isnt normal...no therapy works, it never feels authentic anyway, why should i live just because and i dont want to hurt people?...i choose eternal peace.
