Not acknowledging that something is wrongIt feels like sometimes my mom just doesn't want to talk about me being depressed and having anxiety. Half the shit I do I don't want to do. My mind is literally a living hell for me. There are good days but there are days where I want to scream so loud that everyone can hear me. They can hear how much things I am holding in so that no one get uncomfortable. I get told people have to walk about me carefully, trying not to upset me but that shit wouldn't be necessary if they actually try to understand what is happening with me. There are so many people who knows I need help but the one person who can help me get it just think it is "the darkness in me" What the fuck does the mean? What the darkness in me? I am literally not okay mentally. I don't know half of the shit I am dealing with. My emotions are so horrible that I wish it would go away. I wish I wasn't like this, I really wish that but unless someone actually realize that this shit can't just go away but ignoring it then everything will keep getting worse. I am literally a time bomb. One day I will explode and no one will be able to stop me
