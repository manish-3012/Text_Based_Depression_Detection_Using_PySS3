I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live eithercuz if I die that means I'll never be a girl (I'm MtF trans). I don't think I have depression but life really sucks. Having gender dysphoria sucks, being aromantic (and asexual) sucks, having intrusive thoughts sucks. many times I don't see a real reason to be alive, but I don't  wanna kill myself. I actually don't think I can kill myself. But I really hate being alive and looking at the future. A future full of just doing boring work. I don't have hobbies or passions. I just want to have a reason to live for except transitioning.
