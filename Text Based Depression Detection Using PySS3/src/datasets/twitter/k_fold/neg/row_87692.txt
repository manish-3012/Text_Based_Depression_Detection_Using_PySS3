I was told by my therapist Friday that it was best if I took a break from therapy to get myself together.I go to therapy with my main therapist J, a few months in I started developing pretty bad OCD. She referred me to someone who specializes in OCD. I started seeing a 2nd therapist named A, a few months ago who diagnosed me, and treats me for OCD through exposure therapy. 
   
This Friday I was told by A that she thought it was best if she didnâ€™t work with me right now. I have a lot of other disorders and she says that it was very difficult to treat me for ocd when I had so many other issues getting in the way, so she recommended I take a break from therapy to get myself together. 

I guess Iâ€™m just a little upset. I see therapist as people who help you through mental disorders, so to have someone who is a trained professional to deal with mental disorders say that hurt. Iâ€™m not sure what to do right now, itâ€™s just been really bothering me.
