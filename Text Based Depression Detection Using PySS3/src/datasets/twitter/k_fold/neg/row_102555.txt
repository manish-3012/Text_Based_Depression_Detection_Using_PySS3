I get off work in 2 hours, and Iâ€™m done.My shift at work ends in 2 hours, and all Iâ€™m thinking about is driving my car off a bridge. Nothing is helping this pain, Iâ€™m trying so hard and nothing is coming of it, Iâ€™m a failure. 
Nobody understands whatâ€™s happening, nobody can fix whatâ€™s happening it feels like itâ€™s never going to change. 

I have nothing to live for anymore. 

I guess Iâ€™m just reaching out for help, for the last time. Has anyone really got past this? 


I was abused by a family members growing up, and in the past few years (recently gotten worse in the last months) have been absolute hell. 
Iâ€™m 21...has anyone gotten passed this? Please help me, I feel like I have no choice
