When am I am going to get it?I am approaching 18. I've started having suicidal thoughts since last year. I've decided I want to die. I feel as though I have nothing to live for. I refuse to get into my problems with anyone. Everyday feels the same, only slightly worse than the one before. Living is constant pressure, frustration and emptiness. It is slowly killing me inside. I just feel as though I am anticipating a change that will never happen. I just want it to end. I'm not sure how to go about finally ending it. I've thoroughly went through my options and hanging is the most realistic. I would like to overdose, but finding medication is difficult. Am I scared to kill myself? What is stopping me? help.
