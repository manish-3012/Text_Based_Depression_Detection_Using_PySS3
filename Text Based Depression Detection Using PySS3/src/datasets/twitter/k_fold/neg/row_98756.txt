How is life not hellDamn, I feel weak , and so useless. I feel like I dont have a soul I'm just a zombie. Just tough enough to survive 20 years so far. Havent accomplished shit all.  Have 0 energy , 0 passion or talents, horrible memory and focus or interest so I suck at everything literally. I'm so horrible socially I'll definitely die alone. Every job I've been at I got bullied/teased and just run into toxic people. Cant even find a job and I'm a college dropout in the first week. And most people around me are so doing so much better. It's not like I've never tried to change I have so much I just have fucking nothing to give
