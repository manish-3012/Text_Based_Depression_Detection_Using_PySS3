A lotive been living with tinnitus for some time now. i can't get used to it, i cant sleep and every moment of silence i can hear it right in my ear. i cant stand it anymore, ive cried and cried but it doesnt stop. i know people live with it and i might be exaggerating but i cant handle it. i did this to myself and i want to die.
