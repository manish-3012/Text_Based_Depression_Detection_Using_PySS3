I need help preparing for therapy.Hey guys, I have my first therapy appointment in a few days. I want to be as honest as I can with them, but I can't afford to get hospitalized. I am suicidal, I have a plan for a few months from now, I am preparing for it actively. I self harm daily, and I impulse attempted earlier this week. I want to give this the best shot that I can, and I know that they wont hospitalise you unless you're an immediate threat, but I don't know where the line for "Immediate" is. Any suggestions are appreciated.
