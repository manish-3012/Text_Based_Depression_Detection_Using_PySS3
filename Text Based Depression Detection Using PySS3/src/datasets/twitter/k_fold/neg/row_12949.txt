I want to die.I have what many could wish for. I have an apartment that I share with friends, one of them is my best friends. I have many other friends who truly care for me and go out of there way to take care of me. I have parents who love me and support me however they can. I have two sisters who I can consider friends. I am not poor. Iâ€™ve been in love before. Yet I feel despair and sadness perpetually. I keep telling myself I am going to build a life but I had to stop lying to myself. I do not want to be here. Iâ€™ve hurt people in my past and I shouldnâ€™t get to thrive. I thought I could do some good in the world to remedy my past but there is so much suffering and I canâ€™t save everyone, though I wish I could. I want to die. I donâ€™t want to see the suffering,  I donâ€™t want to cause suffering nor do I think should be forgiven of my past dealings. I have had suicidal ideation since I was very young and I have attempted suicide before. I survived my last attempt by chance alone. This time I plan on jumping off a bridge. It feels more guaranteed. I know my family and friends will be distraught and suffer. But I also see the good that will come of it. My life is not one I should live and before I do anymore harm to anyone else, I plan on ending it soon. I want to die and while I do not believe in God or an afterlife, I pray for those I leave behind. I pray that they find their own happiness and live their lives better than I could. I hope they make better choices and when faced with a decision to be selfish, I hope instead they make the choice to help their fellow man instead.
