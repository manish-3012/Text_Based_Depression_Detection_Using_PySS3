Whenever someone says I need to "follow my dreams", I think of suicide.It's the only dream that's left; to rest from carrying boulders of emotions, like Sisyphus, eternally, to the top of the mountain, only to fall back at the start. "One must imagine Sisyphus happy", as said Camus... but I've always been a dreamer.

Fernando Pessoa is probably my favorite poet of all time and "[Tabacaria](https://www.azores-adventures.com/2015/10/tabacaria-by-fernando-pessoa-%C3%A1lvaro-de-campos.html)" (written by his heteronym Ãlvaro de Campos) is one of the best representations of who I am and how I feel, specially its first stanza. Here it is:

"I am nothing 

I shall never be anything

I cannot want to be anything.

Aside from that, I have within me all the dreams of the world."

And I do. I've dreamed of so many things in my life. I've aspired to do so much. Yet, I'm nothing. I used to think if it is even worthwhile to live while being nothing... until I saw another poem of Pessoa that said: "tudo vale a pena se a alma nÃ£o Ã© pequena" - translated to English, "everything is worthwhile if the soul is not small." My soul has always been tiny, and yet, I have in me dozens of souls, all the dear people I've once met. "If I have seen it further it is by standing in shoulders of giants." I understood then how I managed to live 10 full years of suicidal thoughts and not killing myself. It wasn't me. It was everyone else.

Now, though, there's no one left anymore. The only reason I'm trying to live is because I feel I have a personal duty to accomplish first... but what my emotional side craves is rest. To live is to work, and I just want to take a nap. The pain is too much.
