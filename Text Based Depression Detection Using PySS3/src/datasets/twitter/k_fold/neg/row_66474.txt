Something different, I hopeI am not unfamiliar with suicide, the after effects, attempting it, living the tempt as if it is not there. Last night it happened again, and yet it was different than before and somehow familiar at the same time. In my first attempt, I saw death as hope, a new world. This time I saw no way out, nothing to keep me living but desire itself of wanting pain. Somehow it was unexpected feeling it, as if deep within me I always knew it will eventually lead there. I've tried over the years to be happy, to give life a chance. I've tried to fool myself with simple or sick gratification. Soon my birthday will meet me, I don't know if I want another year and yet the only thing that I seem to want now is the pain itself. My only memento left to living.
