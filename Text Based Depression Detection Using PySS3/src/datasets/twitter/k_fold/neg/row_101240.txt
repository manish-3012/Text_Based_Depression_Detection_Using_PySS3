Decided to hang myselfHaving tested the method to confirm it will likely work, hanging myself with my belt with some padding in between.

Most people don't realise you can hang yourself from a door. I'm not sad just hopeless and tired. Thank you to everyone one who has helped me on this sub, you are good people
