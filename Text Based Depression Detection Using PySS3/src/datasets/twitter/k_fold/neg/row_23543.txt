I /need/ help. Someone recommended posting here.This is just venting, but I donâ€™t know where else to go. I really hope this doesnâ€™t break any forum rules, sorry if it does. I feel like Iâ€™m a danger to myself, all I can think about every second of the day is suicide and how I could do it. My self harm is the worst itâ€™s been. No doctors take me seriously, Iâ€™m in the UK and just keep getting referred to talking therapy and mindfulness. Professionals donâ€™t take my threats of suicide seriously, they just send me home when I feel like I need to be under supervision. I think itâ€™s because I havenâ€™t done anything drastic yet, which makes me feel like I have to in order to get the medical attention I feel I need. Every avenue Iâ€™ve turned to for help has been useless. Iâ€™m tired of living in despair. I donâ€™t know what to do now.
