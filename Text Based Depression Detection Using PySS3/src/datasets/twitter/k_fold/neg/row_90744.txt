my sister (F 19) asked me (F 21) for permission to kill herselfmy sister/best friend (F 19) has asked me (F 21) more than once for permission to commit suicide. sheâ€™s told me that iâ€™m the only reason sheâ€™s still alive on more than a few occasions. when she asked me this i donâ€™t know how to respond. if i tell her â€œnoâ€ i feel like iâ€™m being selfish since i know sheâ€™s not happy being alive but i donâ€™t think i would ever be able to tell her â€œyesâ€.  she just told me that â€œright now itâ€™s not even because iâ€™m depressed.. i just doesnâ€™t see the point of livingâ€. i have no clue what to do or say. does anyone have a solution?

TL;DR my younger sister wants my permission to commit suicide. what should i do?
