I don't know what to do.Every day hurts. I am ruining my relationship. I am ruining my school career. I am ruining my life. I feel powerless. I feel tired. I can't see the future. I can't see tomorrow. I don't know what I will do, because I don't feel that I'm the one in control. I have borderline, and I'm sick of it. Can somebody tell me that life will get easier? Can somebody tell me what I can get better? Because right now I'm thinking of saving everyone around me from myself.
