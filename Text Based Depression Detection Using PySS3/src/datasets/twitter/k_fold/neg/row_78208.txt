I don't know how to keep going I've lost so much and it feels so pointlessI've lost everyone and everything in my life, I always try my best and have put so much effort into trying to get better but every effort is met with failure

I have so many mental problems, I have three personality disorders and I'm autistic and have OCD and ADD

I'm also trans and I'm going to lose my hormones soon, for the second time

I've been assaulted and spat on and shouted at 

I'm unable to leave my home because of how so much of this intersects, at some points it's been 6 month stretches without being able to go outside

I have no contact with my family and my oldest and best and near only friend ghosted me, saying it was too hard watching me try so hard but always fail
She was one of the only good parts of my life

I've been trying to access help through the NHS but there is nothing for anyone like me
After a suicide attempt I went to the hospital but was kicked out and the nurse told my roommate that if I want to kill myself they should let me

There are no resources for anyone like me and I've lost everything
I try so hard I do my best every day but it's never enough 

Every second is so painful and I'm so worn out i don't have anything left all I've been able to do today is look up ways I could kill myself I need help I don't want this life i try so hard
