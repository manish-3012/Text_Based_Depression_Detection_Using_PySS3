&lt;Trigger Warning&gt; I may delete this soonI just wanted to post this. I would rather not elaborate on it much really. It is just a letter to someone and I had to let it out. It is not healthy to keep it inside. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never thought I would be the person who had been in an abusive relationship. 

I only wish I knew what I did wrong. I know I am lazy, however, that is not a reason to tell someone to kill themselves and force them to sleep outside. 

I can not believe I kept going back to you. You were my soulmate. The one person I had ever trusted in my entire life, you knew my innermost secrets. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been a recluse, I know I never left the house. Even now I deal with agoraphobia. You hated my family so you never really wanted me to talk to them. 

I didn't because I did not want to upset you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was your fucking doormat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still study math. I lost the ability to do music.

&amp;#x200B;

You used to admire those so much, you charmed me so easily. I loved you so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I helped you thru school so you could become a Therapist. You were the only one who knew I wanted to transition but kept asking me to wait because you wanted to be the breadwinner and I was going to be your housewife. 

We were married for over a decade, and you finally got pregnant. I am sorry I never really liked sex, understand I hated my fucking genitals, you bitch. 

&amp;#x200B;

A week after you finally got licensed to be a &lt;would rather not mention&gt;  you told me, while you had been studying for your exam. You realized how much damage I would do to a baby boy had I transitioned. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had to work rather than be a housewife. 

&amp;#x200B;

I simply could not agree, and you said I would be better off dead and gave me those fucking pills to take. 

&amp;#x200B;

You know that I have brain damage from that overdose, thank god it's minor. However, that was my fault for attempting. 

I hate you so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate that I left a baby to live with you and the pain that you could cause it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish this hate would go away and I could know why you did this to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

What was so wrong with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so sorry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank god I have moved on with my life but the demon you created in me still lives sometimes. Well not entirely moved on, I will never see my son

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck you,
