I've become my worst nightmareMy goal in life was not to be who I am today: I'm lazy, mean, selfish and I wreck the lives of everyone around me. My friends and family have sacrificed so much for me and I've just forsaken them all. I can't think what to do. I think the only place I'm fit to be right now is prison. I can't hurt anyone in there. And if I'm hurt in there, I deserve it. I'm a failure. I let everyone I love down. I threw away any good qualities I had a long time ago. I'm a wreck and my life is a wreck. People like me are a disgrace and shouldn't exist.
I'm so sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone. I wish I was dead.
