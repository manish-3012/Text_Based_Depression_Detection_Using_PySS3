I am so aloneHow do I learn to like myself when I absolutely hate my own guts? Iâ€™m a socially awkward loser who cannot make friends. I isolate myself from every social setting Iâ€™ve ever had. I notice that this all started whenever I first entered high school. I graduate in exactly a week. Soon, I will be leaving these years behind. I fear that my college experience will be the same thing. If it happens again, Iâ€™ll probably end my life.

At this point in time, the only thing keeping me from actually going through with suicide anytime soon is the release of the upcoming Life Is Strange comic book in december. Itâ€™s the only thing I really look forward to in the future.
