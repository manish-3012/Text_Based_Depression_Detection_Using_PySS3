Last DayHey guys, major lurker here. Tomorrow is going to be my last day. I finally made it to university and made my family proud, and I hate myself for it. I haven't had a conversation with another person besides my mother checking-in on me two nights ago. I don't know what's wrong with me, but people don't want to approach me. To add to it, living in a dorm reminds me all too much of what it was like living in the mental hospital. I've never felt this alone in my life.

Tomorrow is going to be it. I don't have anything to offer, and I'm not providing anything that will be missed without me. This feeling of loneliness is eating away at me, so it's time to go.

Thanks for reading, I haven't had anyone to tell how I feel.
