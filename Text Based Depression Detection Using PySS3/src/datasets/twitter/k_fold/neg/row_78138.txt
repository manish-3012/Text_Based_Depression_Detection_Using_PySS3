II donâ€™t have anything and I donâ€™t want to have anything. Iâ€™m fucking nothing and never will be because it wonâ€™t mean shit anyway. Pessimism and depression is slowly ruining every aspect of my life and keeping me from improvement. If there was a way to surely go Iâ€™d take it- Iâ€™m afraid of hurting others but I hurt every day. The day my grandmother (who raised me most of my life) passes Iâ€™m going to anything it takes to go too. Iâ€™d say Iâ€™d wait for my boyfriend but heâ€™s going to end up a lot happier without me dragging him down. There hasnâ€™t been a day in at least 10 years where I havenâ€™t thought about going. (And plenty of attempts). Please just make this all end. I donâ€™t want this life or any life. Nothing will ever make me feel okay and at this point Iâ€™ve accepted that.
