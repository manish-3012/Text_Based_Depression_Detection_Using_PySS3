I tried and failed, but gunna try again.Hi all, I recently tried to kill myself by hanging.  I posted this earlier on r/AMA but i got a lot of negative feedback, hopefully the people here are a touch more compassionate.  By a complete fluke, my neighbour walked in about 30 seconds after id stepped off my stool to return a popcorn bowl.  Id been planning this for about a year, and i think im going to give it another go at the end of the month, and make sure my door's locked this time.  


I'm not irrational, i dont try and kill myself out of some emotional outburst, and its not a spur of the moment decision.  My life is actually quite good, I've got a good job as a concept artist, i own my own condo, I've got lots of good friends.

I was quite badly neglected as a child.  My therapist told me i have a form of low grade background depression; its just always there, like an itch you can't scratch.  It feels like being stuck at an airport with nowhere to go, just always in transit, never quite at home.    


Ive never had much luck in relationships.  Im quite handsome, im fun to be around.  Im compassionate and I invest in the people im close to, yet it seems the women i meet are more interested in using me to boost their self esteem and move on after 2 weeks.  I dont know how many times ive gotten something along the lines of "youve given me the self confidance i need to move on and find what im really looking for."

I've accepted that life can be brutal and unfair, that people can be unbelieveably selfish, and you have to be a boarderline sociopath to make it in this world.  Its just that, im not built that way, so there's really not a place for me here.  So i'm leaving.  


Thank you to anyone who's got some advice for dealing with something similar, however if I can't figure this out in the next month I'd really like to see what's waiting for me on the other side
