Iâ€™m a vicious heroin addict who has been clean for almost 9 monthsAnd Iâ€™ve never been has depressed, hopeless, sad, angry etc. in my life as I have been while sober. Every day I debate suicide and just want to end it all. I bought a bag of dope the other day and have been holding on to it and plan to use it to OD on purpose and just leave the miserable fucking world. Iâ€™m a burden to anyone who knows me: my family, my wonderful girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend - legit everyone. I wrote a letter to my current girlfriend, like a goodbye letter saying why Iâ€™m going to do it. My birthday is coming up and I think Iâ€™m going to do it on my birthday so I donâ€™t burden everyone with another date to remember.
