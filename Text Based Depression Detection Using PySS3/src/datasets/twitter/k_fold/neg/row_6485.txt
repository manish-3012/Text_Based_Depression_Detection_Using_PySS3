Seeing a psychiatrist in November.. will they send me to the psych ward?I plan on telling them how much I think about killing myself and how grim it gets. How I think about it at work, while Iâ€™m driving (just crash..), and when Iâ€™m alone. All the time really. Does anyone know or think they will immediately send me there? Or how does that work? Also, Iâ€™ve heard that some antidepressants can increase motivation which could be really really bad for me, because I might just do it. I wonder if theyâ€™ll give me meds but also lock me up. Anyone have any info?
