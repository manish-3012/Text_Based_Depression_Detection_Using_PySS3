No means no, especially when I say I don't want to be forced into a hospital and take medsBut we live in a society that believes they have a responsibility to force you, physically, into a place that feels like a prison. They can't take no for an answer, so whatever trauma you're dealing with now, will be exacerbated. And because you're a threat to yourself, you have no rights. You take meds when they tell you to, you only leave when they tell you to.

It seems like a massive waste of time, seeing as once my insurance says I have to leave, I'll be attempting again. Even more so because I feel like shit for being manhandled. Forced treatment is torture, and I'd rather kick someone's skull in than let them do that.
