Future ruined from divorce, what is the point of continuing?I am in the middle of a divorce and the lazy useless pile of flesh is getting half plus potentially permanent support from a 12 year marriage with no children.  This pretty much screws my retirement plans.  Basically having to pay her support will mean I can't recoup my retirement account and potentially that I can't even contribute to it because that is not a necessity to save for the future.  The thought of working the rest of my life and not getting to enjoy a retirement while still able to creates a lot of hopelessness.  I tried to be patient and help her, but she never contributed to the marriage and it is so unfair equitable fucking equals half.  I saved and did all the right things and now I am just getting screwed.  I am having a hard time convincing myself it is worth the fight to continue on.  I am not enjoying life any more anyway.  Plus I know it would hurt her, so I get some satisfaction from that.  I have heard arguments that I will find someone with savings and we will combine them and live happily ever after, I give that a low probability.  I don't really enjoy my job although it pays well and is stable that is about all it has going for it.  What's the upside?  Is there something I am not seeing?  I am going to at least wait and see what direction this goes, but if it goes the way I think it will I will be having my last birthday soon.
