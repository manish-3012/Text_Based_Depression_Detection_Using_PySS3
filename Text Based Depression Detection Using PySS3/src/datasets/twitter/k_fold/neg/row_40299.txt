Feeling my absolute lowestI have always been shit with money, recently was diagnosed with Type-2 Bipolar Disorder, so I figured that's the cause of it. But I can never seem to just fucking save money. Just found out yesterday my 16 year old brother has 14K in his brokerage account, meanwhile I struggle to keep above 100 dollars at nearly 22. What the fuck is wrong with me?
