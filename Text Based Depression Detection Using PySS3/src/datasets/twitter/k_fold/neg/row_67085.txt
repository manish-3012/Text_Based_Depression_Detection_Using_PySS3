Im too scared to go to therapyI don't know why, it's such a dumb fucking thing to be scared of, it's there to help me,  but it just terrifies me that I might actually have something wrong with me and that I'll be put on meds or something. I think of suicide daily and on my way to school stand facing away from the tracks until I hear the doors open to stop myself jumping onto the tracks. I started cutting myself yesterday. All my friends that know/saw the cuts now won't stop urging me to get help but I don't want to, I've had bad experiences with it before but they were caused by me being a worthless piece of shit.
