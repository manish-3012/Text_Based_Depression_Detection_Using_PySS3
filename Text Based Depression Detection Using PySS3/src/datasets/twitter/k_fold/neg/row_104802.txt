I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s nextIâ€™m 22 and I just started losing my hair. Iâ€™ve never been fully happy with it but people have started noticing my hair line receding. Iâ€™m short, only 5â€™7, Iâ€™m a minority (south Asian), and Iâ€™m just not attractive overall. Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend and donâ€™t have any sexual experience. I wasnâ€™t given any of the tools to succeed. I donâ€™t see the point in going on. My life will never be what I want it to be. It will always be me feeling not good enough. Iâ€™d rather just die now than stay lonely forever. Should I lower my expectations and live a miserable life? Or should I just opt out? Iâ€™m so stressed out over my appearance lately that I just want to give up.
