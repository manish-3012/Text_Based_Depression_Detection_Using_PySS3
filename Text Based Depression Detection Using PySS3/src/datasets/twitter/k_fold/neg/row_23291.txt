I am tired.Iâ€™ve lived my whole life with a narcissist mom who abused the hell out of me and my family. Whenever Iâ€™ve confronted her she told me I was too sensitive. Sheâ€™s done and said a lot of horrible things I donâ€™t even want to get into. 

I am angry all the time. I was bullied a lot throughout my school years and I feel so insecure. I take it out on other people sometimes. There was a point where I was being told to kill myself constantly. Maybe I shouldâ€™ve just done it. 

Many people say that when you deal with tough times itâ€™s supposed to make you stronger in the end but I feel like Iâ€™m becoming weaker. Any little thing seems to set me off. I am tired of living. I feel like I have no future. I canâ€™t even enjoy the one thing I used to love doing the most, which is playing guitar. There is nothing left for me.
