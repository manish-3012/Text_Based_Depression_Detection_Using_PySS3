i don't know what to doI'm 21. I've had episodes of depression since mid teens but it's been at its worst for about a year now. Sometimes I'm okay but sometimes I'm really not and right now I can barely think straight enough to type this. Earlier I had an argument with a kind-of-ex and it's made me feel awful and like she thinks I'm a horrible person. I talked to some friends about it but I feel like they're tired of me talking about her and think I should just get over it already but I can't, no matter how hard I try. 
I'm on anti-depressants and in the last few days, especially tonight, I've wanted to just take all the ones I have in one go. I can imagine myself doing it until I think about my mum finding me and that makes me feel even worse about myself because I can't believe I'd even contemplate hurting her like that.
My mind is just so jumbled I don't know how I can actually be happy again
