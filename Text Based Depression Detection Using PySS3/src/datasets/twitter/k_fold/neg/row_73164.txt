Help didn't help meI went to get help a month ago. They prescribed me antidepressants but, they're not helping just making everything worse. I feel like a burden to my parents, a failure to my friends. I just feel the need to go. 6th attempt is the charm right? My friend said I'm close to being free but, I'm not. She says what's 18 more years of life and I always say death. I feel as if she doesn't know I'm being serious. I couldn't tell her I'm serious tonight because she started cutting again. Her and her bf are going through some shit. I know I need help but, last time I went to help it was just fucking groups and talking and eating fucking shit food. I don't want to go back. I think I'm ready to go.
