Second last year of High School.. life feels like crapNo, I'm not suicidal but just depressed and tired.
I've always been an average student in class, I've tried to keep good friends and joke around and stuff and don't take insults and stuff seriously. I had a few friends in my circle when make me feel like a masochist because usually IDGAF if they say shit about me.. But lately I've been fighting back with insults because I don't know what to do. That's a different story though.

Since I've done my matriculation which is like 10th grade, I had to move to a college (Think it is called high school?) and it is about an hour drive away. In the first term I did great but as the syllabus racked up my grades started to fall horribly and I eventually got a B grade which is considered really shitty where I live. I lost my scholarship and my parents have to pay more now. I don't know why but studying stuff just made me feel tired and I was unwilling to do so. Ever since I joined this college I've been getting assignments and stuff that were so tiring and challenging that I rarely got enough time to do any extra studies. Anyway cutting to the chase I just hate that even after trying and trying I'm getting shit grades, you all must be wondering why it's such a big deal it's because my parents have sacrificed a LOT of stuff to pay for my school fees and make sure I get the best education possible and it seriously makes me sick and depressed to know that I'm paying them back with these shitty results. I have my finals in about two weeks and I am having final preparation exams. I promised myself I will try my hardest to get good results in this, I even joined extra tuition classes and tried to study more and more.. the exams are currently underway and I just got one result back which was even lower than the last term, I feel like shit now.. I don't know what to do.

Whenever I'm depressed I use my computer to play games, browse Reddit or watch TV shows and they keep scolding me for using it. I rarely (almost never) go out anymore. I know I have a computer addiction but when I'm on the chair everything in real life just seems to be a distant reality and computer games and shows feel like they take me away from the ugly truth.

I'm also about 36kg and 5'5 at 17 years of age, and I literally do NOT know any one else of my age group that is around the same weight as me. Even the skinniest people have more weight then me. I don't know why I hate eating food. I've asked my parents that I need to go see a doctor for a checkup or something maybe there's something really wrong with my body but they've been putting it off.

Life just doesn't seem interesting anymore, it feels boring and shitty and I don't feel any urge to go out make friends, talk to people or even care about myself physically or mentally. I don't think my parents know what I'm going through and I don't want to tell them that I'm an utter disappointment to them because of all that they've done for me. Even the tiniest of things make me really sad and when I'm alone I fight the urge not to cry.

My last chance to turn my life around lies with my final exams, two weeks from now. I need to do something Reddit, I need to do it now.
