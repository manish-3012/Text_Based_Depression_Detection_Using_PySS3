I just want to die, i didn't choose to be born here...Please help!

The people in Syria are about to starve!
We're literally dying slowly because of the economical downhill along with the lack of support and the religious discrimination by the society here in Syria against several religious minorities.
The economy is going downhill, the wages are extremely low (An average Syrian monthly salary is 50 USD) and we are having an inflation crisis.
We barely have fuel, electricity and money for food.
I am from a well educated family (Each member of my family holds at least a bachelor degree) and after graduation, the maximum wage for a fresh employed graduate is ~30-40 USD a month!
I have lost hope in my country, a lot of well educated Syrians are unemployed and being a non-muslim citizen makes it even more harder to find a job or do anything in general due to the people's racism against other religious/irreligious minorities as well as white minority here 
I have thought about ending my life several times, and still thinking about it.
We hope that our voice could reach your attention, as we really need it to get the life that a normal human being deserves.

All i am asking for is some information about countries i can immigrate to where i can continue my university education and find a job so i can stay alive, please leave me a tip if you know what should i do because i really need your help.

This is NOT a joke, i can provide proof if need, also this is not to seek attention or to ask for donations.
If you hear someone collecting donations for Syria, don't even think about donating, it's all scams, we haven't seen any actual help from any organisations (with a few exception to the red cross/crescent and the UN)
