Life feels like an insurmountable challenge that wasn't made for meI don't understand how people have the motivation to do anything. How people can face such hardships and still say life is worth living. I don't have the fortitude for it and get discouraged at the mildest of setbacks. Something is just inherently wrong with me and I can't handle this. I just want to disappear.
