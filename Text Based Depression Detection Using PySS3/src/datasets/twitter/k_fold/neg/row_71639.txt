There really is no point on going like this anymore.I have had a horrible childhood at home and school. Verbal abuse, divorce, bullying and beaten, you name it. Now that I am in college, I could see how handicapped and unfortunate I am.

I feel like my loneliness is a curse, and there is absolutely nothing I could do about it.I try to improve myself,be better,more open, but in the end its all not worth it. People either leave me, talk shit about me, or just avoid me. Really I am not gonna stand here and let this all happen to me. My sister says how she "instantly" made friends in college dorm and from there her fun starts.Wow, I wish I even had a chance, let alone luck.

For me, suicide is not an escape, but an ultimate FUCK YOU to life. I have thought about this for months, and have all my methods ready, so really no point on going back. Just so that people know that suicide is the only option for some people out there. I am not going to stand here and let myself be like this for the next 20-30 years, so its better for me to end it here. FUCK parents. I would not even hesitate to put 10 bullets on each of their skulls before I die. 

IF anyone here has anything different to say to me, you can even PM me. Could be just about ANYTHING, so don't worry about it. Your opinion is safe.
