I don't (think I) actually want to kill myself, but something's got to give.I've (24f) had depression for years, I take antidepressants but evidently the ones I'm on stopped working. Left my job because of my mental health, haven't found another one because of my mental health, and now have no insurance to treat my mental health.

While close, I'm not quite ready to pull the trigger on suicide. But I kind of want to attempt just so I'll be taken seriously. I want all of the no desire to live without having to die, if that makes any sense, but it feels so stupid to attempt just for the attention. Can't I show up at an ER, say I'm not well, and be admitted without having to get my stomach pumped or whatever?

Not sure if any of this makes sense but thought I'd write it out in case anyone can relate or has advice.
