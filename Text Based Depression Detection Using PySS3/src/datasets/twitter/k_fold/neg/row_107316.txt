Rage, despair, and nothingness: The only three things I feelThe nothingness is the best of the three.  At least it's peaceful.  I'm so sick of not getting what I want that I've learned to just not want anything.  Kind of like Bhuddists, I guess.  But if this is what they find fulfilling, then it doesn't work for me.

Then there's the rage.  Rage towards life.  Rage towards all of the happy people.  Rage towards my loving parents for bringing me into this ugly world.  And don't fucking tell me it's not ugly.  You lose all credibility to me once you say that.  This rage is dangerous.  It's a monster in my brain and it's clawing its way out.  It's taking over.  I can feel it.  I think I might end up hurting people.  I used to be so kind and compassionate, but life has beaten that out of me.

Then there's the depair.  This is is usually when I realize that I'll be like this for the rest of my life.  I don't fit here.  I don't belong.  I never did.  How can you tell me that some lives aren't worth ending? Yeah, you guys are all gonna tell me that I shouldn't kill myself, but when pressed for logical reasons by the suicidal people, nobody has anything real to say in my experience.  Some people are just born to suffer.  There's no way out.  Don't you realize that mathematically, the probability is that there are some people who are just screwed?
