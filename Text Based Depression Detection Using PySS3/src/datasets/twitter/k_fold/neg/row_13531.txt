One after another. Permanent side effects and now a disgusting virusI took Accutane last year. I got permanent side effects including: hair loss, eyebrow loss, seborrheic dermatitis, dry mouth/tooth decay and erectile dysfunction. I was already depressed but each of those made it impossible for me to go out at all, and Iâ€™m as suicidal as can be.
  
But now, I just got diagnosed with molliscum contagiosum on my genitals even though I havenâ€™t had sex in over a year cause of the ED.
  
I give up. Each of these things by themselves is too much. I canâ€™t handle all of them. I thought it couldnâ€™t get worse after the Accutane sides.. now thereâ€™s this. Fuck my life honestly. Can someone kill me cause I canâ€™t get myself to do it
