I'm almost 20 now, and I still feel like a fucking child and I can't stand it anymoreI guess the suicidal thoughts are coming back again after being somewhat absent for like, 3 or so months.

I met a new friend, who I just adore, she's the best, and if not for her and my other friends I'd be steadily decomposing now.

But it always turns out the same way: I get extremely attached, hell I'm already crushing heavily on the afformentioned girl, shows what a fucking creep I am, and then it all plummets down into me realizing who I am again, a guy who still lives with his parents in a disgusting home, disgusting neighbourhood, and without any sort of experience. I just want to be like them, they have their own clean homes and happy families but I'm fucking stuck here with this shit, and my parents who fucking fight constantly. Not too long back, about a month or so, my mother and father began fighting, and my mother then proceeds to yell about how my father had hit her when I was younger. And then nothing, the next day they're happy, they don't bring it up. And I can't stand it.

I just want this to be over with, I want to move out and i've no clue how to even get started, and I'm almost 20. FUCKING 20 when you have people moving out at as low as 17-18 to persue their academics, I'm here at fucking almost 20 years old, currently being a NEET.

I got grades I'm very happy with in college, that I've no clue what to do with. I couldn't go to the university I wanted to becaude my parents didn't like the distance, I freaked out and just ended up not applying to anything. And now I'm stuck, I just play games 24/7 until a friend is online or I just fall asleep because I don't want to acknowledge what my life's like. I'm so close to just ending it because i'm tired, I couldn't deal with a measly 19 years of this.
