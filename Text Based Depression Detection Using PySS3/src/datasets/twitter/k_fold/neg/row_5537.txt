I guess I'm right to think I deserve to die.Just a stupid tranny who at one point in time wanted to live, is quickly losing the drive to live and now looks forward to the sweet embrace of death. It's great when no one even cares to stop you, it sure proves that people like you aren't welcome in this world and your thoughts and desires of ceasing to exist are accurate. I'm right now thinking of how I can do this the most effectively, sadly the knives I attempted to use were all too dull and just simply left cuts. At this rate I may just be better off letting my anxiety kill me, although I'll end up buried a man in that regard huh? Not like it matters anymore, I'll always be a man no matter what I claim or look like. Who gives a rat's ass about my anxiety being set off by feeling I'm a man, or even trans.
