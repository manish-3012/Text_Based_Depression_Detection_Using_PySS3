it's really bad right nowi thought i'd gotten over it but it just seems to keep getting worse. it's really fucking bad right now, and i can't stop thinking about it. i feel like there's nobody i can go to and talk about this to. my phones at 3% right now and i don't have my charger... i wrote a long message to the people i love about how i feel. i hope they don't get the wrong idea. i don't know what i did to deserve this, but whatever i did do, i'm so sorry. i apologize. i don't think i'm going to end it, but i have thoughts. have a good day.
