i want to kill myself because i look uglyfirst of all, i'm sorry if my english sucks, english is not my main language.

&amp;#x200B;

i don't really know how to start this, i'm a light hispanic 16yo male and i'm hideous, because of that i never had or will have a gf, it got to a point that i don't even want to look myself in a mirror because i can see my reflexion. (i don't know how to describe me, but my face really disgust me), and i'm not ugly because im in puberty, is because my genes are trash.

the worst thing is that are friends and other people who says that i'm good looking (or decent), they just say it because they feel pity for me, because i don't find myself good looking or decent, and the worst part is this is not the only problem i have, i have been struggling with internet-porn addiction since when i was 8yo (i'm not joking), and i'm really addicted to that, i'm so pathetic that the most time i had without porn was like 23 days, and because of that i probably stunted my puberty (i readed an article about the how fapping messes up with your androgen receptors and how porn fucks up your brain, and that makes sense because i look like a 14yo and i'm going to be 17 in a few months), when i relapse i always end up crying or really sad and ashamed of me, and i have some anger issues (like 30 mins ago i punched the screen of my laptop because i closed my browser accidentally and i didn't save the draft, fortunately the screen didn't broke) and i get stressed and anxious very easily (something that leads me to relapse).

and i always do something to make my friends get away from me, and for a shy person like me i hate it because i have some difficulty finding friends, i literally ruined my friendship with so many people (even people that i miss right now), that is something normal for me to happen.

i just want to kill myself, really, i'm a fucking disgusting ugly subhuman that can't even stop an simple addiction or make friends, i'm a shame to my family and i deserve to die.
