So I'm trying to keep going. (It's long but please read)Lately I've been feeling pretty suicidal. Life would be a lot easier if it uh..ended. But I have a son, so I have to keep going.  

His mother left me, which hurts a lot. I can't sleep in our bed. I'm struggling on bills. A couple of years ago some *friends* got arrested for some burglaries and got mad that I wouldn't go with them on them so they said I helped. 2 years of court later, the judge is dropping the charges as not-guilty, since their stories don't match up and there's obviously no evidence. So that's encouraging.  

The problem is that I don't really know how to get started in life. I was hoping you guys could give me some advice on that. I don't have a vehicle or even a bike. I live quite a ways from town, and it's not exactly a large town with any half-decent career opportunities, so I'd need some shit job to save up so I can move somewhere better, but I doubt I'd get hired. I have quite a gap in my job history.  

Alternatively, I'd like to go into the military. The Army would be cool. I was in the Army once before but I left during basic training with a general discharge. With that said, I'm not sure they'll take me back. Especially with a felony on my record now (excluding the dropped charges, I picked up a felony in 2008 and completed pre-trial intervention for it). I'll go to some recruiters and ask them in a couple months, once my current charges are officially dropped.  

But in case that doesn't pan out, can anyone give me some advice on how to restart my life?
