i'm too depressed to kill myselfwhy would i deserve to die? wouldn't the suffering be exactly what i deserved? i don't think i'll die from suicide unless i get a bit better at some point.. haha i suppose the subreddit doesn't need to take any actions for me. i think i'll stick around and read your stories, instead. while i might be a tad unhelpful, i look forward to seeing your thoughts and takes on life.
