Update.TLDR at the bottom of this post.

I survived the attempt. It's all foggy but I passed out at some point soon after I commented saying that I took the pills, several hours after I took them, and was unconscious for several hours. I woke up covered in bloody vomit but I survived.

Some people have said that I am posting for attention. I understand why you feel that way. I've posted four times in the past month, three of those were in the past three days. But I've just been posting a lot because a lot has been happening and I have nobody in my life that I can talk to. I was posting for support. I understand that support and attention can be perceived as the same, but trust me, I was not posting for attention. If I was, then I would've wrote down every single thing that he did to me, every single thing that he said to me, every single way that he made me feel. I would want everybody to know every single detail so that they would pity me. I would post when I had flashbacks, when I had a nightmare, when I couldn't stop crying. But I didn't. I don't want attention. Honestly, the attention I have been getting is terrible. I've gotten horrible PMs (from u/Roachzilla and others that don't seem to be troll accounts so I won't say the usernames). I don't want attention, of any kind. People have been asking me for nudes, people have been telling me that I'm a slut and a whore, people have been saying that I'm asking for it. And I'm not saying this to make people feel bad for me, for how my posts have been received. I just want to say that I wasn't posting for attention. I just wanted support. I did not post anything after my first post for 20 days because I didn't want to bother anybody, but I've just been extremely suicidal recently and I needed support. Now I'm going to write down some of the details just to show why I couldn't handle it. He pushed my face into the dirt and the snow and raped me vaginally. He pushed me against a tree and raped me vaginally again. He shoved his tongue into my mouth; his hand was on my cheek and he was pressing his body into me in such a way that a tree branch was pressing into my neck and cutting off my air and suffocating me. His thrusting pushed dirt inside of me, and my pee has been brown/black and sprinkled with dirt and blood since it happened. I was breaking down from keeping everything to myself and not telling anybody. The flashbacks have been out of control, the nightmares won't stop, I start crying or have panic attacks at the drop of a hat, sometimes for no reason at all, everything has been triggering flashbacks. I just needed support. I just needed to vent and to get everything off my chest. I just didn't want to be alone. I just needed support. I just needed somebody to not only listen to me, but to hear me, to hear what I'm saying, to hear my concerns. I'm going to keep posting just because getting it off my chest helps me. If you feel that I'm being attention seeking, I won't reply to comments anymore. I'll just make the posts and then that'll be it. Making the posts helps me calm down, it helps me be less suicidal, so I don't want to stop making posts when something happens and I'm feeling suicidal. That's what r/SuicideWatch is for. It's for people to post when they're suicidal.

Also, I understand that it's frustrating that I refused to call the police. I'm sorry. But those of you who have ever been raped or been in an abusive relationship, you'll understand. It's terrifying to think of what might happen to you if you try to break away from them. I'm sorry for not taking your advice and for not calling the police immediately after it happened. I know that it seems so ridiculous and that I seem so stupid for not calling the police. I know that he's going to keep hurting me if I don't report him. I know that logically if I report him, he won't hurt me again. But I can't make myself fully believe that. I keep thinking to myself "What if he gets released from prison? What if he finds out where I live after getting out? What if he kills me? What if I get kicked out of my family for reporting him? What happens if I age out of foster care and end up on the streets because I can't afford a place to stay or find a place to work?" The what ifs were what was holding me back. I know I'm being irrational but I am terrified of him. I'm terrified of reporting him. And also, I didn't post for you all to solve my problems. I know that with something like rape, it's up to the victim to solve the problem. The victim is the one who makes the report. The victim is the one who testifies. It's up to the victim. I never expected you to solve my problems. I just needed to get everything out. Even if there was somebody in my life that I could tell, I haven't been able to say out loud "I was raped." There's so much stigma around rape. It's the only crime where the victim is blamed. It's the only crime where the victim faces more stigma than the perpetrator. Rape carries so much stigma and I cannot say out loud that I was raped. Typing it, making these posts, helps me get it out. It helps me. I wasn't looking for a solution. I know that I have to report him. It's hard but I'm working on it. I've been looking up the laws in my state. I've been making calls to hospitals and to women's shelters and to rape crisis centers. At some point in the near future, I'm going to the police station. I'll ask about whether or not my parents will have to be told. I'll ask about what protection they could offer me after reporting the rapist. I'll ask about the process, about testifying, about everything. I'm going to get a rape kit done tomorrow if possible, and I'm not sure when I'm going to make a police report but there is no statute of limitations in the state I live in for the class of rape he committed, so I have until I die to make the report. I appreciate the support that I have been given and I appreciate the advice that I have been given. I apologize for taking so long to follow it. I'm just terrified but the support that I've been receiving is helping me take the steps I have to take in order to report him and put my rapist behind bars.

Many of you think that I'm faking this. It's understandable why you think that way. 1 in 6 women are raped, which means that 5 in 6 aren't. Rape isn't something that happens to everybody, and here I am posting four times about being raped. I'm not lying though. If requested, I can send the moderators images of my injuries and they can verify that I was in fact assaulted. I'm not going to post the images for everybody on here to see.

TLDR: I survived my suicide attempt. I'm not posting for attention or for anybody to solve all my problems, I'm posting for support. I've decided to report my rapist.
