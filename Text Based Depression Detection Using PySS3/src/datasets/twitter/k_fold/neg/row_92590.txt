Love of my life left me. Why?I honestly don't want to think about suicide. I know it doesn't fix anything and will only bring harm to my family. I write here not because I want to suicide but because I believe there are some good people out there who will just listen to what I say and help me think about my future. Maybe my problem is nothing compared to the awful experiences other people had but that is just what makes me want to die. I'm sorry if I sound like a kid or somehow hurt others just by saying that. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask for help.

I have a girlfriend. I mean not just a girlfriend to me, we've been together for almost 4 years now. We met in college, spent almost every minute together. I mean it. We lived in dorms together, took same classes, we both weren't very social so literally almost every single minute passed together. We were really happy, our parents met, we were serious. Then we graduated and started working. We only saw each other once a week for few hours. We both live with our parent and very far from each other. Today, out of nowhere she told me she wants to have a break, that she is so unhappy but she is not sure whether this unhappiness is because of me or not. She said to me she cries in mornings because she is unhappy and she didn't tell me. We never lied to each other or hid something except this. I'm shocked. I mean this mind sound stupid but I felt like we were one. She is my greatest friend, my only true friend, she was like me. I could talk literally anything with her without hesitation. She was the same. I know. 

Now she wants a break. She says she needs to think whether she is unhappy because of me or not. I don't even get it. I ask you, whoever cares, 

Is there any possibility someone who is that close to me, like my mother, to just say I need a break, let's not meet for a time, which I cannot give you a precise one? 

I can't stop thinking but I just don't see the possibility. No matter what happened in my life, whether the cause is her or not I would have never left her because I know she is worth going through hell. I would never guess something like this would happen because I thought she was like me. We were one and even if life was shit, we would get over it together. I'm not the greatest guy, I know that but I feel like I don't deserve this either. I'm 23(2 days ago was my birthday), but I am pretty sure there will never be someone like her in my life if I ever lose her. I have lived my whole life with only one purpose which is to live with the people you love together to the end of your time. I cared only about love. Why would she even leave me? I seriously do not get it. Someone, please give me an idea why she might have done that.
