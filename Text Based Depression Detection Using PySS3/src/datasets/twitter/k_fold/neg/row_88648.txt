What to leave to my nephew/niece as a personal memory?Today, in the middle of my preparations for the ultimate day, I got the news my brother is going to have a child. 

Since I'm  never going to meet him/her, what should I leave as a personal memory? Something that would allow him/her to know a little bit about me.
