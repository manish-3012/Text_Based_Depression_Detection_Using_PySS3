Iâ€™m going to end my life. Whatâ€™s the best way to not make it look like suicide?Throwaway because some family and friends could recognize my account. Pretty much Iâ€™m going to kill myself but I donâ€™t want my family to think they could have done something to stop me. Iâ€™ve been suicidally depressed for about 11 years and itâ€™s finally weighed too heavily on me. Iâ€™ve attempt twice before but Iâ€™m determined to succeed this time. The problem is Iâ€™ve turned my life around from being a lazy shit to having a decent job and living in a different state so my family thinks everything is going better, but itâ€™s not at all. I still have ptsd, anxiety, depression, all that fun stuff. At this point I feel like I talked about my issues too late and Iâ€™m so mentally fucked that I rather die than keep trying. The good thing is Iâ€™m pretty alone so I wonâ€™t be hurting anyone other than my parents and brother. So Iâ€™m basically just looking for a way out that wonâ€™t hurt anyone else (I.e. car accident) but wonâ€™t look intentional. I mainly want to do this because I love my mom and hate that this will hurt her, but I canâ€™t keep going just because of here. Iâ€™m in pain day in and day out, itâ€™s reached the point where itâ€™s not worth it.
