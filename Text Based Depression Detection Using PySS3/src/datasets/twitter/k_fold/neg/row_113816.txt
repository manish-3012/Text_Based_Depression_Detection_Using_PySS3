There's no hope and no helpa few hours ago i was in the psychiatric hospital again (last time was 29 june). i had called a number because ive been out these past 3-5 days and wanting to take my own life. they phoned SOS, talked with them then they talked with me. an ambulance was on its way to my place. while i was waiting i harmed myself. when they got here we talked a little then they called a cab for me. when i arrived i didn't wait as long as last time (8 hours) 

the doctor came, a woman and another male nurse i guess. we had a conversation for not that long but i could immediately tell they didn't understand anything at all. i told them a little about what has happened. that ive been to the bridge the other night and so on and that now its all about just taking my own life and i don't know what to do anymore or where to go and that nothing helps. 

they didn't want to admit me to the psych ward since it usually doesn't work out for me or help me. they know medications hasn't helped either.

what ticked me off was when the guy started talking about routines and that kind of stuff. that "...you need to like bite it together and just do it etc..." which made me irritated. then they started talking about other random stuff. "there's courses of this and that", "you could go pick mushrooms", "there's courses for mushrooms", "yeah i think she needs to do something", "go to school and meet other people", "get a job and be around work people", and so on and so on.

i started to tear up eventually because i realised no one understands. not even these people working with this. when waiting for the cab home i cried in the waiting room.

im very close to doing it. nothing helps anymore and i see no future, just one way out.
