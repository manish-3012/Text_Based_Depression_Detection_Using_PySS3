I feel like I'm at a cross roadsMy life feels really unstable at the moment and I'm so unsure of the future and what it holds. On one hand I'm really trying to recover from my mental health issues but on the other hand depression and bpd is winning most days and my ability to function just doesn't exist. It's left me feeling like nothing has order or is definite and that really scares me. Being unsure to me is terrifying. But because I'm at this weird place in my life I've never been in before I feel like there are two options...either I'm gonna stick this recovery thing out and do my best or I'm gonna give in and end if all. I guess I'm just waiting for some sort of sign that will point me in the rihjt direction to go. Irs been a weird one because I got fired from my job and financially things are really hard which would make me feel like that's a sign it all needs to end but then at the same time I've just entered a new relationship with someone I've been in love with for years and that's something I really want to stick out and experience. I don't know where I stand anymore, with anything and my prozac is making me feel so numb and disconnected that irs making this even harder. Sorry, as usual this is just me rambling on to get things off my chest. I know this must not really make any sense.
