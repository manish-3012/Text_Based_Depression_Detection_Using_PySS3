RandomHello! I hope I am posting in the right section, I  don't  use reddit  often.

I am  just posting here because I  want to talk out loud (or write aloud ) without the  fear of being sent to a hospital. 

I  have felt suicidal  for a long while and I have made a few attempts. I  am  struggling  again because like many other people  with depression I don't  see any point  in living. But alot of my colleagues don't realize anything since I  do try to appear upbeat in front of them.

Everyone tells me to look on the brightside and I  do have caring friends, but as much as I love them, they can't  really live my life or feel what I  do.

I  am an international  in Brisbane and my insurance won't  cover psychologists but will cover psychiatrists. Unfortunately most psychiatrists either laugh at my feeling suicidal or tell me to talk  to  a psychologist.

I am going  to  live a month more and save some money for my family and then I  want to try again. Properly this time.I am  just tired. I don't  want my entire life to be in and out of hospitals for making suicide attempts but eventually  I  know I will succeed.

I just wanted to tell someone I did  try,  to be a good person and to not make other's  worry. But it just kept getting  harder and nothing seems to help anymore.

Thankyou for reading, if anyone does.
