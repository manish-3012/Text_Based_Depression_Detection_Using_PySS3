I really donâ€™t want to live anymoreI just donâ€™t wanna live anymore. I wake up everyday exhausted physically and mentally and this feeling just does not go away at all. Honestly everyday is the exact same day and itâ€™s just fucking driving me insane even if I go out and do something Iâ€™ll feel like it was the exact same and I cannot help it. I cry most nights just wishing I wasnâ€™t born. I used to self harm a lot and havenâ€™t done it since august last year but everyday I just feel like it doing it and Iâ€™m not even scared about doing it anymore. I just canâ€™t do this shit anymore. Iâ€™ve lost my appetite for fucking everything but still I get forced to eat food which makes me want to throw up. I hate life honestly and I want it to end. I know that one day I will eventually end up just ending it all and I feel like itâ€™s really soon. Even though Iâ€™m only a teen and Iâ€™ve got my â€œwhole life ahead of meâ€ I just donâ€™t want to live it, itâ€™ll be the same shit constantly. Fuckkkkkkk
