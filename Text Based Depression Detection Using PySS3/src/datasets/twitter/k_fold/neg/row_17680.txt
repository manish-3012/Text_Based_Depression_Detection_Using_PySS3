The most random shit, ive gotten myself into too.Long story short. I've gotten myself into football where I can't quit and a reading program where I cant quit. I fucking hate them and can't quit because I will fail school and fuck my life over from there. There is so much fucking stress in this stuff that I just don't know how to handle it. 

My parents told me if i fail there taking my college funds and buying something for themselves. 

I know it's lame but the only thing keeping me alive right now is video games. Yes I know its a fucking dumb reason, but they are the only reason I'm still wanting to live. There is nothing whatsoever enjoyable about life and I just want to end it. I know my future is fucked because I'm going to quit football and that stupid reading program. And that's going to fail me.
