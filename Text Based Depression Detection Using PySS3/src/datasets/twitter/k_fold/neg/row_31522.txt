I Have Decided to End My own life I sit and stare off into space and i think about killing myself or having someone else do it for me. I Haven't Been happy in so long that i forgot what it feels like. Everyone Yells at me including my parents. I cant take joy in anything so I Have No Hobbies, I Lost My Passion for Learning and now feel trapped in School. I Don't Have a single friend in the world. I feel dead on the inside I cannot foresee any future for myself being successful So I Have Decided to die but how will i do it? I Should Buy a Gun
