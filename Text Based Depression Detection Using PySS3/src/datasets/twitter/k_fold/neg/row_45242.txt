Is it selfish to kill myself even though I'm in great pain?Like the title states, I'm in a lot of emotional pain right now. I can't be happy about anything and life in general just doesn't seem worth living in this body (I'm trans, MTF). I feel as though I'm a slave to other people's desires and my body and that death will finally free me of all my pain. Is it just selfish to just want to die? I'm very tired and there's very little keeping me going. Is life really worth living despite this pain?
