Anyone else deal with people with a Jesus complex?Not necessarily religious types (though I get plenty of DMs copying and pasting a bible quote without context as if thatâ€™s gonna motivate me. Pro tip to any of yâ€™all: Iâ€™m not afraid of hell because Iâ€™m already living there)

Iâ€™m talking more about people, most likely narcissists, who believe themselves to be uniquely capable of curing your depression and absolutely blow a gasket the minute they discover that depression and suicidal ideation are, in fact, incurable.

And it doesnâ€™t make you a genius if you figured it out, it just means that death is the most beautiful thing in all of existence and without distractions, it becomes painfully obvious. You donâ€™t gotta do it yourself, but you sure as hell cant talk me out of it once I decide to go
