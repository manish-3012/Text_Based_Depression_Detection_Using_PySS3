Why get mad over suicideTo all the people on here thatâ€™s has never been truly suicidal, doesnâ€™t have a mental health issue or just wants to help why do parents or friends or whoever get mad when you tell them ur suicidal. I had this conversation with my roommate and his gf and they where like oh they just donâ€™t know what to do and Iâ€™m kinda just like ur first instinct is to get mad and yell are u that insensitive that u donâ€™t understand that person who is suicidal is in a highly volatile state. It honestly seems more like that person simply doesnâ€™t want to look bad, get u any help or support or take the time to understand it. Whatâ€™s ur opinion on the matter because that sounds so stupid?
