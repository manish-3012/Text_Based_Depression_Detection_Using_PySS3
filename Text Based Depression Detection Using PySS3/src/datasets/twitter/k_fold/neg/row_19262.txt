I need helpI need some help becoming happier. I have wanted to die for so long now. At school i have friends to keep me happy, at summer break it isn't the same. I am a mere child, 10 years old in fact. I've been sad a lot, happy quite a bit and rarely mad. Ever since i was 6 or 5 years old, life changed in a bad way for me. Can someone please make me happy? It's actually hard for me to be happy. (by quite a bit i mean like 24 or 15% ya know?)
