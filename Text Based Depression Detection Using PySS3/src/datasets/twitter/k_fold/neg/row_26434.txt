Mostly OK now but scared yesterdayAbout 25years ago I thought of suicide every day for about 3 years. I thought there was something so bad about me that the only way to get rid of it was to kill the whole thing. i thought I didn't have a right to breath. BUT I had 3 young children. I didn't tell anyone although I was seeing a counsellor for some of that time and also rang Samaritans but never told them. Eventually I talked to someone whose father committed suicide. She said that she thought I was the happiest person in the world. I didn't realize how well I can hide. She told me how devastating her father's death was for her. I just had to keep on going; it was what I needed to hear. I was involved with co-counselling and a parents support group and rang Samaritans from time to time. Samaritans and counselling helped me just because he were genuinely goodhearted people but I couldn't open up. Thought I didn't deserve, I think.                                                                               A little over 2 years ago I was in suicidal crisis. I had exhausted myself looking after my aged mother round the clock, then had an operation. It was too much. I was up at night howling and eating, then all day wanting to hurt myself with suicidal images coming into my mind unbidden. Eventually after trying to talk to partner and GP began self harm a little. After a few days felt a hair's breadth away from atleast risking my life. Rang for help and recieved it.                                                                               For the next 4 weeks needed to talk to someone daily felt unsafe and shaky. Gradually worked away from there with counselling twice a week and 3 other places to go on week days and helpline at weekends. Found it easier to talk and my self esteem was higher than in the past.                                                                               A little over a year ago while feeling mostly better, I became calm and hatched a plan. I thought it wouldn't hurt family too much if I wrote to all of them individually. It felt purposeful. I got out of that with counselling and with telling 2 almost strangers  who were kind and physically affectionate.                                                                                                                                   Currently don't want to die for sure. However part of me wants to hurt, harm kill me. I don't want to push that away as something I shouldn't feel anymore. It seems to me to come from a very young hurt child  inside me. I want to learn to take her in my arms ( the arms of another part) I see myself as a circle of adult me's plus this wild destructive child. So one of the adult mes can pick her up and atlast in that scenario she starts to want to contribute, it is like the taming of a wolf. She doesn't want the focus to be on her but she just wants to be included in a kind and purposeful whole.                                             However despite this, despite no longer self harming,not for 4 months, yesterday I really scared myself.                                                 While I was out I had a strong urge to do something lethal or atleast I was really scared of it. I wanted to put the details but realize that's not appropriate. I managed the situation but was really scared. I wanted to talk to someone I know slightly but they weren't around. Mostly it's because the relationship with my counselor is difficult. Often she doesn't get me. If she seems critical of me I collapse into feeling useless. She seemed to want to end but actually it's improved but I am thinking about something she said months ago. She's about to go on holiday. I don't want to be alone with this stuff that goes on in my head. She said that she thought maybe counselling isn't right for me. I wanted extra sessions for 3 weeks. She said that when I had extra sessions before I was dissatisfied with her and I can do that in one session. Actually I was interpreting things she said to me as critical and I needed her to be explicit about why she was there so that I could hold on to that between sessions. I just hope she gets me. Please don't tell me off for being so dependant; I just am. I know this is early stuff playing out. It seems the main stuff to me. Messy but important but my counselor gets defensive and tries to steer away from me being upset by what she has said.                                             Not self harming partly because my son is home and partly tried hard not to and got out of the habbit. that was so hard especially as she wouldn't give me extra sessions.                                                     I have put this here incase it's of use to anyone else and incase anyone's situation is similar.
