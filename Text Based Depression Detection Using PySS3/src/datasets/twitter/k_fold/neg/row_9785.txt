I can predict my future....... And it will end with a bang. Or a rope. Or a fistful of pharmaceutical candies. Or a swan-dive towards the bustling streets of Chicago. Or a dinner of drain cleaner.  


Not with a knife, or razor, though - stabbing and slicing is not my cup of tea.  


I need to vent. I really do. But don't I always?
