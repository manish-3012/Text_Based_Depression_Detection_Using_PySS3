I don't know how much longer i can do thisI really don't... every day gets worse and worse and I have to force myself to do all these things like work and school, otherwise i'll get in trouble. I never get a break, no days off. Just constant work and it never stops. I just want it all to stop, i want calmness I hate all the pressure that's on me. Being forced into quarantine and not having enough money to move out has forced me to have to stay home with my mother. She has a horrible victim complex, and she always takes out her anger and frustrations on me since im the only one at home. Everything that goes wrong in her life is my fault. Oh i tried to kill myself in the past? How could i do this to my mother how could I ruin her life like that? Oh we don't have enough money to buy this thing? I cost to much to feed and house. I'm only 17 and I can't afford housing yet but even when i can, i know that guilt that i'm ruining everything good in her life will follow me around. I don't want to live like that and there's no escape...I really can't stay here any longer, i can't handle it. I want to bash my head through a wall, i want to bash my head through a wall till i bleed out...I can't fucking do this anymore.
