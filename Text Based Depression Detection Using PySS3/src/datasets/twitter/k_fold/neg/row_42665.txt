I don't know why I want to die but I doI don't know why I want to die. When I read through the other posts here, I see a bunch of people leading these empty, pathetic lives that they want to escape from through suicide. I don't really have any explanation for these feelings like they do, but I know that it's impossible for me to keep living. 

I've made plans to kill myself next week. Whoever reads this is probably the only person in the world who will know how I feel and what I need to do. I've attempted suicide twice in my life, but those weren't sincere because then I didn't want to die, but to punish myself for the person I was and still am. Third time's the charm, right?

It's weird how peaceful I am right now, like I got some kind of endorphin rush while typing this. Not really relevant to anything, just something I wanted to share I guess. Well, peace out Reddit.
