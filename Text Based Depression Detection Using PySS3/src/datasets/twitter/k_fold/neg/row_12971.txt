What is the point of living?I'm so sick of living. Nothing gets better. There is nothing valuable I can offer to the world. I'm just a waste of space. I feel really selfish for being alive. All the time and money and things I'm consuming can be used by someone else with more eagerness to live. The people around me are strong and self-disciplined unlike me. They'll get over me if I'm gone.
