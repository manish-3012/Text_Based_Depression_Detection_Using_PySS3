Taking a step forwardI still feel like crap. I rarely experience joy. If I do its only in rare tiny burst. I am sad all the time poisoning every one that's around me. I am taking one more shot at professional help. I called the veterans crisis line and told them whats going on. But I left out some details like my recent failed attempt. If this doesn't work then I just received the supplies that I needed to take matters into my own hands. Thank you who helped me. If anyone has some time to chat, tonight and until I get to the doc. I'm trying.
