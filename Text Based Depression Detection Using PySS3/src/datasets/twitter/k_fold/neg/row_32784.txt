Do people really try to talk someone out of suicide to save that person, or the aftermath of what would happen after?People love to say "oh, your parents would be devistated. So and so would never move on. Etc" 

But what if those are the people that drove the person to want to die? What if those are the people that made them feel worthless day in and day out? And what if those people believe they would be better off with out the person committing suicide? 

I'm sorry but the more I contemplate suicide, the more it seems staying here is only to 'benefit' those around me. Everyone's reasoning as to why I should not go through with it has to do with someone else. 

They say suicide is selfish but I'm starting to feel that forcing someone to stay that is suffering every single day with out any change, just for someone else is selfish. 

It feels like the longer I stay the more in reminded that I'm burden to this world. I've for the first time in my life, regretted not taking my life sooner. There is one person I am staying here for but I am still only causing them pain just from being in their life. And the only reason I don't leave is because I'm not sure what the aftermath would do to them. 

I'm certain everyone else in my life would not only not be surprised, I know they would be relieved.
