I'm tiredThe only thing keeping me going is guilt. Not guilty in the sense that suicide is "selfish". I'm just in debt. 2nd year at college and I regret going at all, just for the fact that I now have a debt that's not just linked to me but also my parents. Debts not the reason why I'm tired though. I'm alone. I've been alone for awhile now. I've been putting on an act for everyone around me for years. I can't even remember the last time I felt anything real in terms of a relationship with others or a community. I don't care anymore. I used to hide in the realities of videogames to escape myself, create someone or something that was so much better than me and live out it's purpose. Thats become less and less effective. I think too much now. I'm not thinking clearly so this is all a mess it seems to me at least. It's late and I'm tired. I just made this account so that I could express something. I don't want to carry this weight anymore. I'm tired.
