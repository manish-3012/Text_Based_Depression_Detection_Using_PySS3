Tomorrow morningI'll be ending it tomorrow morning. Wrapping up loose ends between now and then. 

I've wasted the one life I had because I'm a fool. No one is to blame but me.

The only reason I'm posting is that I have the urge to tell someone, even it's anonymous.

I'm a little scared, but not terribly. It will take some will power and courage to go through with it, but I have confidence that I can do it.

Goodbye. I hope you realize that for most of you, there's a way to change your life into something worth living. Your job is to find that way.
