At this point, cutting and people talking to me are my only distractions from planning my suicide attemptI don't want to die, but can't find a reason to keep living either. I have a whole life ahead of me and i  only see myself failing it. Talking with other people makes me focus on other things then just my mistakes. Cutting makes my dark thoughts go away. My life isn't event terrible when compared to others and that makes me feel like an attention seeking asshole. I'm trying to find more stuff to distract myself, but i'm running out of options and i'm scared. I want to have hope, but hope is so hard to find.
