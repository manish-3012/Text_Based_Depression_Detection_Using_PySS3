Why is there no easy way out?As long as Iâ€™ve been suicidal, iâ€™ve always planned to overdose. But I work in pharmacy and I worry that an investigation would be done into my place of work. 

I want my death to have a minimal impact on the world so I donâ€™t want to cause trouble for my co-workers.

To clarify, I have a prescription from my doctor for the medication I would use. I might not give a shit about my life, but I would never steal meds.
