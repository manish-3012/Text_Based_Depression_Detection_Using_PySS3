im depressed, i guess; and neither feel like living nor dyingexactly what it says above: if i get hit by a truck i might actually consider that an absolute win.

I'm "mentally numb": I dont wanna care about anything anymore. not my work. not my future. not my past. not my family, they suck anyway. not even my usual "cave i hide in when everything sucks", video games.

you might guess im not having a great time. that's correct. all effort is meaningless. all results are meaningless: im gonna die anyway, so is everyone who ever knew me, or ever will know me. everything will return to dust, just how long will it take? the world will be shit anyway. nothing can change that. nothing will. even if something can, that will not happen. the only logical options are suicide or trying to ignore it, to drown it out in... anything. but of course, the latter dosent seem like a very feasable option right now. and as for the former, i am not made of steel - it is viable, though irreversable, and right now i dont really want to. maybe im just a little bitch.

considering my current state you might guess i might be on drugs to try numbing it out, or at least considering doing so. correct again. i am not taking drugs or alcohol, or tobacco, but that is because im 17 and have no way to get them now. but i am considering alcohol, if i can... and if i wasnt living with my parents, who would simply make my situation worse if i got drunk.
