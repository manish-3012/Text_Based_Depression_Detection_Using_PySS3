F 28 ukSo this is it I've decided today is the last day somebody i care about makes me feel subhuman i dont care so much when anybody else does it it hurts but its been always I think people can just tell them not normal as much as I try and I don't know how 
My whole life has just been fucking tragic from the get go it doesn't matter how hard I try how hard i work nothing I ever do is good enough I'm never good enough if he was like people would just be happier if they didn't have to deal with me it's not just they're treated like shit by people my whole life is just one massive shit stacked on top of another I've got to the point where I've lost all control I don't eat anymore I can't it makes me vomit I pretty much just live on those drinks they give to elderly people and anti sickness pills i cant even get stoned to escape anymore and i just want to feel something different i just cant handle any of these feelings anymore i was a sad kid and im a sad adult at nearly 30 I just don't want to be sad anymore I haven't washed in 4 days haven't consumed anything in 2 that didn't stop me spending a night with my head over the toilet I just wanted to be loved by anybody literally anybody but not even my fucking mother ive tried so many times I don't know anymore im scared for my dog there's a few times I should have died there's more than a few attempts i made myself nothing its not fair I've watched too many amazing beautiful People way too young who had good lives who would have wanted to go on living only to have it snatched away from them leaving behind broken families and I'm literally begging to be wiped off of this fucking planet with everything that I have left it's not fair nobody would even miss me im aware this is going to get found after the fact and i want everybody reading who might be feeling anything other than relief to know no that this was nobody's fault and it was always going to happen I've been trying for more than half of my life I'm just not well I'm sorry for what I said out of anger I'm sorry for how I reacted and if i wanted the leash i could have i love you please take my dog safe he loves you so much and i know you love him don't let your mum make him vegan I just wish I could have spoken to you one more time to put things straight beforehand
