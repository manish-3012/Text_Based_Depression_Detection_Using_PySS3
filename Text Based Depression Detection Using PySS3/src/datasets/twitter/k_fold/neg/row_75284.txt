Another friday night alone sitting in my room watching my shows all I can think of is killing myselfI'm so alone, and so stressed out in this house my hair has been falling out. No one ever bothers to talk to me on facebook or instagram or to offer to hang out. My only online friend has been using me for years for his own perverted needs, when I told him the other day I was fed up with it he stopped talking to me. The anniversary of my dad's death is coming up also. My life is so terrible I have no one.
