Suicidal Thoughts but Donâ€™t want to die?I am scared of death

Damn i must be useless asfðŸ˜‚

I have suicidal thoughts but i dont want to die. I have no hope, no motivation, No job, no education and no friends. Looks wise slightly above average (So dont know whats wrong with me)
Birthday today (early 20s) so massive loser + failure. 

Its the worst when family gatherings arrive so i have see how behind im from everyone 

I just sit at my room doing nothing. No direction in life.


So how do you keep going? like really?

Thanks you for reading my pathetic post.
