If I killed myself over a girl that doesn't know me, would police contact her about it?I was too scared to approach a girl in a college class.

Knowing she will never love me hurts so much, there's just no point in living. I just want her to acknowledge my existence, and if it takes killing myself then so be it. I'm such an ugly obsessed creepy loser, no girl will ever love me.
