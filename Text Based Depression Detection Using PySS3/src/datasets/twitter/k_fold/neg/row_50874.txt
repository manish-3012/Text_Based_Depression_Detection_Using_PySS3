Just the standard I donâ€™t want to be alive rantI donâ€™t want to be alive. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I feel like Iâ€™m too much of a wuss and too lazy and stupid to do it properly. Iâ€™ve been in and out of treatment for years, on and off meds, in and out of therapy. Nothing makes much of a difference. The world is terrifying. Iâ€™m anxious almost all of the time. I have panic attacks all the time. I also have anorexia. I often say that Iâ€™m not depressed and I almost always lie about not having suicidal thoughts because if I say I get depressed or have the thoughts doctors get locked on and focus on that and giving me antidepressants and talking about low mood and those things are the least distressing of my mental symptoms. I hate all of their meds. I donâ€™t want any of them. Theyâ€™ve always either made things worse or not worked at all. I am a burden to my loved ones. My partner has to cook all my meals for me a freeze them for when sheâ€™s away because Iâ€™m too useless to do it myself (sometimes I think thatâ€™s just because Iâ€™m too lazy). My sister has her own mental health issues and has been staying with me because I havenâ€™t been coping and I just freaked out and yelled at her and punched the car steering wheel. I didnâ€™t mean to. She didnâ€™t deserve that. My partner is away and Iâ€™m frantically offloading all my problems into her even though she canâ€™t do anything and itâ€™s just ruining her day. Basically Iâ€™m a piece of shit. My family would be sad if I died, the thing is I am starting to think it would be easier to have me go and them move on (however painful) than live with me hurting and holding them back forever in addition to the fact that I am just exhausted of being alive and I donâ€™t want to continue on. 
Iâ€™d love to live a normal life. I donâ€™t believe thatâ€™s possible. Here I am.
