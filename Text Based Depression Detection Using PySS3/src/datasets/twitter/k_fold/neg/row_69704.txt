Iâ€™ve started keeping a suicide diaryIt gives me some sort of comfort , I donâ€™t know. 
Its for writing everyone a letter before I go mainly. Evaluating all the details, the dates I could do it on, the proes and cons of different methods and so on..I also see it as a way to really think my actions through, to make sure Iâ€™m doing something I wouldnâ€™t  regret rather than on impulse, but then maybe Iâ€™m just sinking myself deeper. Anyone else has something similar ? Has it helped you ?
