I think I'll be good at suicideI say this because i really good at keeping it vague in IRL. I'm good at never explaining myself, and leaving it be. I think being vague helps with succeeding at committing suicide. So when i do, I'll completely wipe this account and burn and delete any mentions of my mental health. No suicide note, just gin shot to the temple. I think that's why i will be good at actually following through. I still have some time, my plan is supposed to take place in 3 years but i think I'll succeed.
