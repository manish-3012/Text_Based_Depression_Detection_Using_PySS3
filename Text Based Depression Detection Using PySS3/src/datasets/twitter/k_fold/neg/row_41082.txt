Close to death during strangulation incidentI was raped a while ago, during that I was strangled and it got to a point where I was about to go out of consciousness. (I stopped hearing things around me, went numb, and my vision started to go black) 

I wouldnâ€™t want that to happen to me again, but I want to die so badly. I canâ€™t help thinking how I wish they wouldâ€™ve continued choking me until I actually died. That part of it was almost peaceful, everything happening was so traumatic and itâ€™s just odd. 

Iâ€™m on medication and in therapy for what happened, but itâ€™s not enough most days. 

I felt so close to death, is this train of thought normal?
