I'm gonna flunk out of collegeI'm in shock and devastated right now. My professor said I plagiarized my research paper so I failed the class. I'm a fucking C average student and this will be the third class in my major that I've failed. I'm afraid I'm going to lose my scholarship or get expelled now for this.


I used four sources, one more than the rest, but I don't think that is plagiarism because I listed them in the works cited portion.


I just emailed him asking if I could turn in an updated paper with the proper sources and he said it's too late. Well that means my passing grade is now failing.


I don't even get what's the fucking point anymore. Even if I do manage to graduate (which will not be in 4 years, I guarantee that) my grades are so abysmal that nobody would hire me or let me into any medical school.


I just want to die right now.
