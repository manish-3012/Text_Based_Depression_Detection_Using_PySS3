The one that kept me going is almost over and I'm scared of what happens next.Ever since I can remember I've always wanted to do an MA in the humanities- I'm not sure why, but it's just something that stuck with me and it's a field that I am super passionate about. In many ways, it was this goal that stopped me from killing myself because it was something I desperately wanted to achieve and it gave me the drive I needed to keep living.

I'm about 5 weeks away from handing in my thesis and honestly I don't know what's gonna happen once I lose that drive to live. When try to think about my future, it's just blank.
