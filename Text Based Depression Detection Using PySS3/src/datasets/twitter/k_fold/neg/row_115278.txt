Struggling to stay aliveI have no real reason to be depressed. I have a wife and kids who love me. I teach and have many students who have said that Iâ€™m either their favorite teacher this year or of all time. I have friends. I have hobbies. Yet with all of this I constantly have thoughts of ending it. I have always felt unlovable since I was a kid(bad things happened to me as a child multiple times). Literally the only thing stopping me is not wanting to mess up the lives of my friends and family. Even tried to think of ways to make it look accidental, but I know that would still screw up my kids for life. Not looking for encouragement, just needed to say it I guess.
