Went to jump off the 10th floor last week. Still want to die.I've never felt so lonely. The only way I can get through a day is by distracting myself. I went to therapy for the first time today, and I've felt like shit ever since. It's too hard to retell people why I'm messed up. The only person I could ever turn to is my boyfriend and he no longer loves me. I feel sick all the time. I feel like I have no future, or if I do, it will be bleak and depressing and not worth living. 

I just called the suicide hotline for the second time, and I find them so useless. I never feel better after talking to them because they just want me to go to the hospital so a crisis worker can take over and just feed me cliches until I pretend I'm stable enough to leave. 

I just want a friend. Just one person to give a damn about me. Or even pretend to...
