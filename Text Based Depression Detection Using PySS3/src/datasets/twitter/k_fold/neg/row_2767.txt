I wish killing myself was as easy as conceptionI was going to kill myself last weekend now I am dead set on this weekend. I posted on here as well, and got lots of responses, but I still know that I need to die. I am extremely anxious, and staying at an Airbnb so that I can keep my job. I am going to go through all of my money, and then really be in trouble. I have nothing to live for. The only issue is that it seems to be near impossible to actually go through with it. My biological instinct to stay alive kicks in. I am going to have to jump in front of a bus or train last minute with no option is escaping.
