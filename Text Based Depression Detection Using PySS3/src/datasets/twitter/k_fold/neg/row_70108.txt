The only way I can trust to keep me from killing myself is going to sleep. The only way I can do that is with pills I don't trust myself not to kill myself with.Most nights it gets bad. Every night it gets bad is worse than the bad night before it. Tonight, I've screamed, read, and tried every worthless tip I could find do keep myself controlled so I can at least say goodbye. I'm tired of this. I'm 13. My mom knows I have mental health issues, but she doesn't have any idea how bad they are- I couldn't do that to her. The only real things keeping me alive are my friend *Ann, and being afraid of fucking people I've met's heads up. I have a cousin who's four years old. I have a lot of friends who know I'm struggling, but don't know it's nearly this bad. I don't want to mess them up forever by cursing them with having been friends with someone who killed themselves when they were a kid. They don't deserve that. I do. I live upstairs, where I could easily jump. If I go downstairs, I hit the garage, filled with power tools. I can't go to my parents. I can't. No one I know that I could go to without feeling worse is asleep.
