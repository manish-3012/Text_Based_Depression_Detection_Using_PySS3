I turned 24 a few days ago and I already feel like a failure. I feel like I am too late and feel like I have no chance to survive in life. I feel like giving up everydayEDIT ....

I know that everyone else has difficulties and maybe this kind of hardship feels too close to home to some but please, try not to just post 'This is so like me' becuase it is not helping at all'

A few days ago I turned 24 but I was not excited to celebrate my birthday. In fact, I was horrified and even embarassed.

This started to happen when I was around age 22-23 but I was already feeling like I was too late in life. Like I was too late to have my shot to be able to have a good future in my life.

I know that everyone goes through tough situations in their lives and everyone makes mistakes and have to go through obstacles.

Basically, shit happens to everyone. A lot and most of them come unexpected.

But I felt like this ever since I was a teenager - even though the world is very vast and has lots of things going on with lots of things happeneing at once, it is very impatient and wants things to be done **pronto!**

There are so many things going on and to catch up with everything is a nightmare and the world is changing incredibly and it is a lot of pressure on the competitive nature of the capitalistic world we live in.

I really wished that I had a grip in my life much earlier but I was a kid before - I was an idiot with no clear goal and well ... shit happened. **A lot**

Bullies, abuse and so much more and in the end, it scarred me and it scarred me for so many years that only now I wanted to take charge and actually do something about it but every day, I keep blaming myself for allowing these things to happen to me **AND** that I allowed myself to be such a weakling and make myself into a shadow of my own self and be a pussy instead of actualyl grabbing my own nuts like other people do and keep going and move on.


But I was pushed back in a way and I felt stuck for many years.

I did manage to eventually try to push myself to keep going back on track but half of my attention is always concerning that I started to get a grip on my own life too late so I feel that I am mostly battling against my own guilt and shame and embarassed that I am too late and should already just give up *(honestly, I feel tempted to do that everyday)*

Everyday, I keep making comparisons with everyone and often see everyone better than me. Better grades, better income, better lives, better possible futures, more happiness, more confidence and so much more 

*(it's what the competitive nature makes you do. It makes you always insecure and paranoid that someone may take your place and ruin your future. It's like a game of survival like the Hunger Games or the apocolypse)*



I feel like i am stuck in both my past and my future, afraid of both sides and afraid and confused on what to do. 

Stuck because I feel like I have a lot of baggage about my past self and looking deep into myself to look into my own shattered soul is a fucking nightmare and a job that will take forever and incredibly painful.

On the other hand, I am afraid of the future. I keep making countless and countless possible calculations and preparations for the worst like what if this guy is better than me. Should I study harder? What if I will not pass this test? Should I apply for a job already?

It's extremely infuriating and scary especially when you own soul feels broken and your mind against you and criticizing your every move *(it's trying to push yourself while trying to fix yourself at the same time while trying to battle against countless waves of enemies like the demons of the entire hell are after you)(

Honestly, I am 24 and I am still at university doing my bachelor degree. There are those days where I feel very embarrassed that I haven't graduated yet while people younger than me already did. *(that comparison in age. People love to praise people who are already in an advantage when they are so young)*

And I know that I have made many mistakes in my life and the shame and the guilt is very strong and very deep everyday but the worst part is that I have a poor habit of ruminating about those mistakes and unable to forgive myself or tackle it to make sure that I have the right strategy to tackle it if I ever happen to make that mistake again or avoid doing it.

Most of the time when I make a mistake, I go into a dark spiral of shame and guilt and sheer self-criticism and I end up in a cycle of criticism and doing those mistakes again and feel even worse in the process.

Sometimes I even ruminate about my ruminating habit as well which makes the burden and guilt much worse and this habit has been happening for years and affected how I look at myself and affected how I work and how I think during my studies *(which is the worst becuase the education system have "no mistake" policy and have a "pass or fail" mentality and also the most important thing in my life for many years so it causes a lot of anxiety and fear in my life)*



How can I break this habit? What strategies I can use to help myself from going deeper into the cycle of depression, anxiety and EXTREME self-hatred and self-loathing and suicidal thoughts?

How can I really and truly stop being afraid of the future and stop criticising myself for pretty much anything because I feel like I am at the bottom of the food chain and I feel like I have no chance to survive in life?

Honestly, I often feel that I should just grab a gun and shoot myself and save all the trouble from trying to push myself when it will be all for nothing and avoid all the humiliation and embarassed. Many people have already managed to achieve a lot in life and I feel that I was left behind and I feel that maybe I should just give up. I cannot risk experiencing further humiliation than I already have *(and people LOVE humiliating others. We know already how much we love to humiliate those who failed or suffered like in history class like Hitler or right now, there is a film being made about the worst film in history because love to humiliate those who were involved. I just cannot risk making myself go down that road and risk further embarassement for years to come)*
