These Voices just wonâ€™t let me alone.Iâ€™m so tired of the voices in my head telling to fucking kill myself and that I have no chance. They want me to get hurt as well to hurt others so badly and everytime I see myself in a mirror I start to act a little bit crazy in a psychotic way. Recently been to a psychology but canâ€™t afford the treatment and therapy for depression. I just think itâ€™s time to say goodbye. May 8th will be the day
