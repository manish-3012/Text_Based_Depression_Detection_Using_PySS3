Life is just a miserable struggleEveryday I smoke again, another day lost. Every day I smoke again invites more paranoia and more fear that I will piss hot if I end up getting a job the next day. Life is truly miserable. Stuck at my parents house. Too much of a coward to just get the fuck out. At least if I kill myself I won't have to face starvation, getting beaten, or being exposed to the elements. At least if I kill myself I get to have some control over the misery. I just don't want to be responsible for anything anymore. At least if I kill myself I won't have to be put to work.
