Not copingI'm having a really tough time coping with anxiety and depession. Most of my friends I reach out to just ignore my texts, it feels like nobody wants to speak to me and I'm all alone again. Its like nobody really likes me and all the effort and kindness I put in leads to nothing in return, I feel like just giving up. I feel like I'm done trying its just all too much chaos.
