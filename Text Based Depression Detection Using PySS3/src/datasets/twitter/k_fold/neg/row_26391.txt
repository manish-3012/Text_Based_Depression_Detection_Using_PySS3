Iâ€™m never good enoughIâ€™m a pathetic loser. Iâ€™ll never be enough. I grew up in a family where no one ever talked about what was wrong. We would just fight and then move on harboring all that resentment inside until the next blowout. But I never felt like I belong. Depression, self loathing, suicide. My entire life. Always just being told Iâ€™m too emotional, short fuse, looking for attention, suicide isnâ€™t real. Youâ€™re not depressed, youâ€™re just a petty child looking for attention.  Now Iâ€™m 34 years old and nothing changed. Still too emotional, too unstable. â€œStop acting like a childâ€. Youâ€™ll never find somebody if you donâ€™t change â€œ. Iâ€™m such a fucking loser. Theyâ€™re right. Iâ€™m too fat, too ugly, too emotional. Iâ€™ll always be alone. I want to die so badly but Iâ€™m afraid. Iâ€™m not even good enough to fucking kill myself. Iâ€™ll never be good enough. Not for my parents, not for my sister, not at work, not good enough to have a social life, to have friends, not good enough for a relationship. Just never enough.
