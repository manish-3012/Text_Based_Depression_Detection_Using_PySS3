lol my parents.jokes on my parents though for taking the wifi off for 11 hours, because they were mad i tried to kill myself the other day.
 i went to sleep early, was more calm, colored in my new coloring book with my new coloring pens, read my book i took in the psychiatric hospital to read more, the books called Sightings by Charles D. Taylor
i reccomend you read the book guys its about these people who left Vietnam as POWS and MIAs and werent actually missing they just did that so they could leave the Vietnam war.
