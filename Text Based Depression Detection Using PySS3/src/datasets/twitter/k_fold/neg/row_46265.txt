I've been thinking about suicide recently. Is this this a phase? Do people have dark phases like this? Will this feeling pass?Hello. I got here from the anxiety subreddit. I'm not sure what I want from here but here is my post anyway.

I've been thinking about suicide more and more recently. I have always dealt with a lot of anxiety but it's now just too much. I just want want to end it all. I don't want to feel like this and I don't see my feelings changing.

Often when I would get overwhelmed I would just cry and feel hopeless. Recently I have also been thinking about killing myself so I wont have to feel anything. I cant see a way for anything to get better. I feel like no matter how hard I try I will always be very very anxious about everything. All of these feelings scare me. When I come down from these sort of thoughts and I'm thinking more clearly I get very frightened about where my head is.

I don't have anybody to talk to about this. I have sought help from a therapist and was sent a questionnaire to fill out. One of the of the questions was about suicide and I answered that I don't have any of those sort of thoughts. I obviously lied. I was scared of being judged and I still am. I don't know what to do with these feelings. I sometimes try to rationalize them by telling myself I'm just going through a rough time but I've felt like this for a few months now. 

I hope this all makes sense. I don't know what to do with myself. Any help would be appreciated.
