Just got out of the psych ward.My last attempt I sent a message to my crush/friend/ex/? and she called EMS on me. I told her to fuck off and never contact me again (still high and drunk from the overdose which didn't even come close to killing me) and I don't know if it's normal or right for me to be angry at her.

I just wanted her to know it's not her fault but now I'm just angry, still just as suicidal if not more and scared.

Help.
