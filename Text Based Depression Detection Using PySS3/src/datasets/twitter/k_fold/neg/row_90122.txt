I just...I can't anymore.There is nothing that is going to bring me out of this hole I'm in. I tried so hard to be happy On my own-- be my own happiness because it's foolish to expect anything out of others. I'm twenty two years old I know how fickle and awful people can be. I just want this stop. I want everything to stop. I don't want any of this anymore. I can't do it. I can't be the person everyone expects me to be. I'm too fragile, confused and tired. I can hardly take care of myself anymore. I just want this to be over. I don't care who I leave behind at this point. Go ahead and call me selfish, fuck you. Fuck you for thinking everyone else is somehow STILL more important to me. 

I can't do this, I can't keep pretending I'm happy or that everything is going to be just fine. I'm so angry and tired at my core. ANYTHING would be better then this. I wish I could have stopped myself from even being born. 

I give up.
