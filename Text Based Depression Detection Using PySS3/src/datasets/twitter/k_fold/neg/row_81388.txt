What's the pointSo my best friend doesn't wanna talk to me anymore and my boyfriend and I are barely holding on by a thread. My mental state has slowly decayed and destroyed our relationship. I was just in the hospital about 2weeks ago. Was released and thought I could turn it around for the better but just ended up in a ditch. I have no car and am off on a leave from work. I'm gonna have no ride to work pretty soon and everything is starting to stack up. I don't see a future for myself at this point in time and I'm rapidly loosing hope. I've been smoking doing stupid shit that pisses off thoes who love me. I just don't care and rightfully so. Medication I've been taking is garbage and appointments are too spaced out to save me! My boyfriend doesn't wanna hear it anymore so I doubt the internet does either! Thus I will stay afloat til I cannot anymore.
