I hate living.First time in this subreddit. I need to get something off my chest.

So, for the past 4 years. I've struggled from severe OCD. Everyday... Everyday is the same shit. I swear, I wake up.. I have intrusive thoughts. No matter how silly these intrusive thoughts are they still affect me and put me through the worst fucking shit. I'm seriously fucking tired of it. I hate this world. I hate literally everything about it. From waking up to going back to bed. I can't stress this enough, it's seriously the same bullshit everyday. I've thought of killing myself multiple times but I never do it. I'm too scared. I'm REALLY scared to even try it. I have pills right next to me but I'm too scared to overdose. I really wish I could die. The only thing keeping me alive is being scared to die and my family. 
"Please talk to someone" is what I get a lot, I mean, I COULD talk to someone, but if I'm being honest I'd sound crazy as fuck expressing how ocd ruins my life. The thoughts are silly. I'd sound like i'm insane.
Well that's the end of that. Thanks for wasting your time reading my pointless feelings.
