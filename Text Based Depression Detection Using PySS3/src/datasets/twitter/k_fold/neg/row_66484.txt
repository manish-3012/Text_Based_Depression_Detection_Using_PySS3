ugghigh school is fucking hell. for the like 2% of kids who go to a bunch of parties and get a ton of girls high school is amazing but it just outcasts everyone. these kids who are super popular arenâ€™t smart and wonâ€™t amount to much after high school theyâ€™re just good looking and athletic but theyâ€™re treated like gods now

why does everyone always chase after clout and popularity and why do i always care what everyone else thinks this is awful and i canâ€™t take this anymore my friends all abandoned me for the more â€œpopularâ€ kids and now iâ€™m alone

nothing makes sense anymore
