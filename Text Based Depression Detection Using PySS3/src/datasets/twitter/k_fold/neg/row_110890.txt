I'm just so tired.I don't know what reason exactly for my post here but this past week has been the lowest I have ever felt. Maybe this shouldn't be on this sub but here goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I have chronic depression. If you don't know, it's depression that comes and goes when it wants to. In the past year I feel I have made incredible progress towards understanding my "condition", what triggers I have, the difference between when I'm just sad or when I'm actually depressed, etc.. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, it seems as though the progress I've made has made my depression worse in certain ways. Now that I am able to notice when I am actually depressed, it feels like there are two of me. It's hard to explain this to people around me, since they don't understand how it feels. When I am depressed, I don't want to live. I don't want to feel sad or empty or alone anymore and ALMOST every fibre of my being tells me to just disappear. But in the last year, considering my progress, there is a part of me that knows I won't end it. 

Between the part that knows I won't do it, and the rest of me SCREAMING to just go, my mind is being torn in two. 

I have 2 boys, a 2 Y/O and a 1 Y/O. I've survived this long because of them but they deserve better than I can offer.

I'm so tired of fighting with myself to live, I'm so tired of feeling alone and empty. I'm so tired of being miserable. I have never been so absolute on not being here than I am now.

My apologies if this doesn't belong here but I don't know where else to go right now.

Also, apologies if any of that doesn't make sense. I've never said this to anyone before.
