I'm FuckedSo, suicide has always been a bit of a problem for me, but it is really looking like a legitimate possibility, I'm not the type to get emotional over things, and honestly only see killing myself as a logical alternative should tomorrow go the way I think it might. I have a court date tomorrow that will quite possibly ruin my life, (background; I was getting rid of an old truck, uninsured, unregistered, when it died on me, I left it on the side of the road, I was going to get it towed but the police found it first, gave me three tickets, No insurance, no rego, and abandoning on private property without consent.) I'm almost 19, I make less than $30000 a year, fines could be between $2000 to $4000, depending on how big of a dick the judge is, I cannot afford that, on top of it my insurance is gonna skyrocket. A criminal record is going to keep me out of school, thus taking away whatever future I might have had. Everything is just falling apart. I only really see killing myself as wrong because my parents wouldn't be able to afford my funeral.
