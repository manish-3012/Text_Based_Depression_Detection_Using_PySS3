I feel like I'll never make a good friend again.I was almost totally isolated my senior year because I worked while attending classes and any time my friend group would hang out, it would be on a day I worked. I know they made group chats without me to plan outings, because that's the kind of people they are. I really only had two good friends who bothered to make time for me, and one won't ever speak to me again. 

How the hell do adults make friends? I've tried using shit like Bumble, but it seems like no one wants to be your friend before they jump into making out and sex. This is pathetic.
