I have type 1 diabetes and autismI don't sleep at night because I am too scared of not being in control of my blood sugars, I used to promise to myself as a kid that I would never get type 1. Guess what, had type 1 for my 16th birthday because it happened on my birthday, thanks life aka. genetic lottery jackpot!

My autism is pretty bad as well, might have something to do with me being born 4 weeks earlier, oxygen deprived, unhealthy baby, my mothers body rejected me because I wasn't supposed to survive because my mothers body knew of how much of a genetic failure I am.  
But yeah, my autism makes me only care about one pointless thing at a time, I can only care about the things that my head wants me to and I feel powerless. I don't want a life, I don't want a job, I don't want a house, I don't want friends, I don't really want to do anything really. Literally, my head had made me interested in the same few games I've played for years and I have not moved on mentally from that, I have also poisoned myself with pesticides which further fucked with my head, now I can't think properly and have even less control over my thoughts and I feel like my soul died.

So, whats the point? I did used to promise myself that I will kill myself if I got diabetes, I'm living one of the worst scenarios so I should do it. I'm feeling quite indifferent if I'm not counting the logical choice of ending it before I live to see more of my family members dying? What if my mum and dad dies? I'll be in an institution or alone in a council house playing video games being at the mercy of whatever my mind wants to be preoccupied with. Its over for me, I've lived my life and my diabetes has taken away my joy and peace of mind, I can't sleep anymore, I've never had a restful sleep in years I just want one day where I don't have to worry about my blood sugars anymore. 

My method will be slitting my wrists while taking a bath, thats my plan, date? Within 10 years, depending on what happens.
