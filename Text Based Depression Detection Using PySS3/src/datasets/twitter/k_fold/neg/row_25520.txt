I dont know why I am feeling this wayI dont really know what I hope to gain from posting this or why I am like this. All of my problems are caused my own actions (or lack of actions) so I know that they could be solved somehow but I feel unable to do anything about it. Like even the small problems seem too massive to deal with and I am just too tired, lazy, and self-pitying to do anything about it. I dont know what I expect to happen I think I just want to vent but I dont know if I will even go through with it. I probally wont like most things in my life but I dont even know. I will probally delete this I dont know.
