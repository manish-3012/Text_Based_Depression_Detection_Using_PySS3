I don't want to die, but I have to go to school if I want to live. And I'll rather die than try to apply for school.I'm just turning 22, just graduated an useless art school where I ended up by an accident after the prevous suicide attempt I did over being refused from a real university.

I don't want to apply for schools. I don't want to look for a job.

I just want to pay the fucking rent so I can live.
