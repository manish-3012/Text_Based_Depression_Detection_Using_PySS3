Well, I'm tryingMy father left my house long time ago, he tried to harm my mom so she left him. I'm proud of her. I had a step-father and he left us to. I'm not sad about it, I didn't actually accept him, I disliked him so I guess it's ok. But lately, my sister's anorexya and 2 of my mom's friends got cancer, I feel like I can't handle it anymore. I wanted to live a long and good life, studying forest auxiliary (google translate) and wanting to become a firefighter to help people, but I feel like I can't help myself anymore. I wanted to be productive all my live, not because me, I used to like live, but my firts goal was my family hapinness. Now it looks like an imposible goal, and my life looks usseless, as I can't keep anything up. I lost contact to good friends, the only one who I've talked to is a computer freak (like I used to be), but he does not care about my personal issues. I feel so ashamed of myself. I want to be strong, I want to be the pilar that holds my family togheter, I want to help other people, but I just can't help myself. I won't ever kill myself because it would be 2 hard for my mom and aunt, but I'm losing hope so quickly, I just want to become invisible or something like that.
It's so hard. I'm sorry for the long post, and sorry for my bad english. I used to care about my mistakes and so but actually I just care about my sister and my mother. Sorry if I've wittren some misscence words, but I'm drunk and hopeless. Listening to rock songs so I can get some hope. Just sorry for wasting your time and wanted to apologyze. Hope to see you soon. Thaank you ðŸ’”.
Edit: Actually I'd like to die with something like an overdose, so my family believes that it was my fault, not theirs. I was just a piece of shit, and I was so stupid. If nobody can cheer me up, I hope somebody can give me advice with how to kill myself and look like and accident. I wan't to suffer with my death, I wan't to feel my last feelings.
