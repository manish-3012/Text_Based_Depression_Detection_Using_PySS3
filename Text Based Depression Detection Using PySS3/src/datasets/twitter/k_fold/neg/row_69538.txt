I hope this doesn't get buried, but I've been having "finger guns" and intrusive thoughts.Hi there!

About a year ago, I made a terrible choice, and the consequential situation deteriorated my mental health. I was in this new environment for about 7 months. I lost a great deal of who I was to say the least, and more bad choices were made that others do not know of. These choices haunt me.

I do not seem to have explicit thoughts (I think?), but intrusive thoughts are becoming more and more frequent. Like mentioned in the title, occasionally I will put a finger gun in my mouth and go pew while on the toilet. Other times I imagine driving into cars or poles, and sometimes I hold my straight razor a little too long. The odd part is that I have many moments where I genuinely enjoy myself.

I do not wish to trivialize the horrible, inescapable feelings that others endure. I'm asking for advice and insight because thoughts are the seeds of action, and I do not wish to inadvertently sow oblivion's fruit.
