Had a chance to get help and I didn't take itI remember at a physical that I was taking, the doctors asked me to fill out a mental evaluation survey in which they asked me if I had felt any sort of depression or thoughts of suicide. It was more of a rating kind of thing. Before I could fill it out, my mom kept saying "no, he's very happy" or "he's fine", so I filled the paper in with positive scores. I was surprised at how very little say I was given, but I suppose it was expected since I never showed it. Flash forward, I realize how much of a bad decision that was. I've been contemplating suicide a lot more often now, and I can't open up to anyone. My heart just sinks at any given moment, I'm alone, got no one to hold or to talk to, I'm exhausted, unmotivated, hollow, and feel myself wasting away. Haven't gotten out of bed all day, and if I do it's only to get some food and go back to that same bed.
