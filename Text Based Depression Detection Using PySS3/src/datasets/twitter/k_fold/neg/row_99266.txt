im 28 years old with nothing to showtonight i fittingly made a noose out of a laptop charger and just couldnt commit. i shopped for guns. looked at buying sodium cyanide. I was looking at exit bags months ago. I just spent the last few hours watching people kill themselves on bestgore.com to desensitize myself.

im 5'11 330 pounds. i dropped out of high school and never went to college so i have few friends. The friends I still had turned out not to be friends and Im alone now. I moved clear cross country to be with a girl I thought loved me and she left me in 3 days with an apartment in a shitty area that I can barely afford. I really loved her, I really thought she was the one, she was the one. Ive known her since high school so it wasnt some stupid internet relationship. i dont do that. Despite being a drop out ive done ok because im an internet genius.

Ive left all my possesions behind twice now and now own 3 monitors, 2 computers, an air mattress, a blender, a scale, 2 bags and a couch. Financially I've made it to the end of my lease except for maybe not this very last month. I've been thinking about killing myself since november 5th of last year and I came close several times. I still just walk out in to traffic without looking because to take control of suicide just seems so difficult.

I dont know what to do anymore and I dont think any advice is going to help. Ive been on a trial period with a new job optimizing a google adwords campaign and its gone fucking berzerk, its not looking good and im not sure if I can turn it around enough to make my job viable. 

I cant commit to things for any period of time long enough to make something work. I have endless unfinished projects. Ive quit smoking 10 times, Ive failed to lose weight time and time again. im too smart for my own good and I see the giant scam we're all living in and it drives me completely nuts making me think i dont belong here. 

if i dont get this job im pretty sure im done. either way, i dont know if i can go on. im almost 30. i turn 29 in less than a month and i have nothing to show for it but a computer. some meager accomplishments. a handful of people that like me because of my technical abilities, shitty credit(i mean bad), and a bunch of unfinished projects.

nobody knows me. nobody likes me. im completely alone. i cant talk to anyone about it because last time it just got out of control. the only reason i can see for living life is just to see how bad things get in this sick stupid world. but i dont want to do that from the front of a 711 begging for change. ive just completely hit rock bottom. funny part is, i dont even drink and do drugs regularly anymore. i almost feel like i should since in those days at least i could numb out instead of this constant falling feeling i have. fuck. i hate what ive become. i was once great destined for great things. now im nothing and im so little nobody can even see that i am nothing. i just want to go away
