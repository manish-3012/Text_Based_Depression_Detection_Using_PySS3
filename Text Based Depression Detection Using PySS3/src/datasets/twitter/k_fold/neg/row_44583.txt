Iâ€™m just so tiredItâ€™s been coming for a while now. Iâ€™ve known that. I think my boyfriend has realized it too. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m not going to go back into the hospital. I donâ€™t want to get better. I just want to die. Iâ€™ve written a letter to my boyfriend and I have a plan. I just need to find a day no one will be home and find a good tree in the woods. I have triple Insurance that itâ€™ll work. Pills x alcohol, gun, noose. Iâ€™m not taking any chances. Iâ€™m so tired
