Sometimes I feel like I would be better off dead.I don't have anyone or anything, I've been through a lot as it is (tough childhood, abusive environment, etc.) and I've got nothing left to offer in this world.

I don't even want to have children because of my tough upbringing. Maybe I'm just victim playing, maybe I'm not, but either ways, I feel like I'm better off dead than alive.
