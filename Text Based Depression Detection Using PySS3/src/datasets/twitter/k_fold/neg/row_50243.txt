Killing myself over a girl I am obsessed with.I've been in love with this girl since I was 14 (I am now 17). I am truly obsessed I think of her endlessly. She used to lead me on a lot but now I don't think she wants my attention anymore she probably thinks I'm a fucking creep. I've waited out every relationship she's been in, hoping that I'll have my chance afterwards, I used to be so confident around her, now I feel empty after every encounter, thinking I'm not good enough for her. Which I'm not, I'm your average drop kick stoner, and she's an over-achiever with high ambitions. I ponder digesting razor blades just to be done with you. I love you so much.
