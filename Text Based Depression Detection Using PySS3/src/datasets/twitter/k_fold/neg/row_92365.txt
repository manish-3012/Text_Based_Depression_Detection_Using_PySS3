I just need someone to tell me it's going to be ago**I want to be put asleep**

I have cancer. Ovarian, stage 1B. I just turned 18 yesterday. I'm in high school. I have a history of deep-rooted self-image issues. I'm a girl. I've received one round of chemo. Two more to go. It was a real debate among my doctors if I should receive treatment or not. I have a loving boyfriend and mother. Today I started to notice more and more hair come out of my head. I'm afraid. I'm scared. Not so much my hair falling out but that fact that people might know, will know, I don't know I'm in denial about it. I have a wig. I'm afraid I'm going to wake up to my hair strewn across my bed. I want to hide. I just want to cut it all off, buzz it, and fast forward two months. How do I hope with this? And here come the tears...
