Thanks for now, SW.I called the helpline for my country after I got the number from SW and I felt better after talking to them. I've put away my suicidal plans for now. I was feeling very depressed after my 'friends' left me out of everything. I hope my present mood(after talking to a really sweet and concerned lady) stays for a while. Thanks SW.
