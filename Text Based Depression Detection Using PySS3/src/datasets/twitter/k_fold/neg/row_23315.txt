Why do I have to think about the aftermath of my death, but people in my life donâ€™t have to think about how theyâ€™ve treated me?I have been abused and neglected and mistreated my entire life, but every anti-suicide thing I get told always has some level of â€œthink of who youâ€™ll leave behind.â€ How is that fair? My parents have treated me terribly and frankly are a huge part of why Iâ€™m fucked up. Why do I have to think about them while theyâ€™ve never been expected to fix the way they treat me?
