I don't belongTo preface, I'm brown and short. Always surrounded by taller, more attractive people, I've come to the conclusion that I don't belong in this world. I would give anything to be white. I'm always going to be thought of as a terrorist. Whenever I fly, I'm always selected for a "random" search. I like to travel but at this point, I don't want to anymore. Whenever I'm in   
mainland Europe, I always face racism. Everything about being brown fucking sucks. People will always think that you're some loser working for tech support or a fucking terrorist. I clearly don'y belong in this world. I would rather die. I can't accomplish anything. I fail at the most simplest of tasks. I am too stupid to do anything right. I'm a minority and stupid. Sorry I'm not white. There is nothing I can do about the way I was born. I'm worthless and there's nothing I can change about that. It's time for me to put a gun to my head and call it a day. No one will miss me when I'm gone. I hate this world. Goodbye
