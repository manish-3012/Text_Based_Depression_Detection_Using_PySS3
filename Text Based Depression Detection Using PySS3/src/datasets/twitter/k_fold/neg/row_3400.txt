what am i missingi saw something similar in the headline of another post here but really ; what am i missing in life ? like what is so fucking great about being here that anyone actually wants to stay here ? and why do people keep telling me that i still have "so much to see in life" like they know there isn't anything for me to see ? it's like they know my loss would be more of a financial inconvenience than a genuine loss and they just want to keep their pockets full
