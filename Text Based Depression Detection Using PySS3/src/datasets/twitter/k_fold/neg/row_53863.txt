Lmao fuck thisPeople expect me to be okay with a shitty and pathetic existence of wage slaving for decades for no reason that I care about. Iâ€™m not interested in this stupid world and its drama so why canâ€™t I be offered a suicide pill? I have no place here and yet society wants me to keep playing their fucking game. I donâ€™t even feel bad about staying in my room all day everyday anymore because I never asked for this shit anyways. Iâ€™m going to do whatever I fucking want to and if this shit gets too painful Iâ€™ll gtfo. This world is fucking garbage and isnâ€™t worth participating in.
