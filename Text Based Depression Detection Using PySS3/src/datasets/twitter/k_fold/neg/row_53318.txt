I feel so uselessI just feel like nobody likes me. Iâ€™ve never felt this suicidal in several months. Idk whatâ€™s happened. All I have is my service dog. Still, I feel no point in life. No future. It can only get worse from here. 
I go to therapy but my therapist has been on vacation and I am going on vacation so I wonâ€™t have had therapy for a long time. I just want to vent in real life.
