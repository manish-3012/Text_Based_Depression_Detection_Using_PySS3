She'll either be my salvation or my destructionI'm almost 21M. My life so far hasn't been great, but neither has it been horrible. Sure I've had a fairly shitty childhood with my parents getting divorced among other stuff, but I was never really bullied in school, abused, etc. 

What I do struggle with is low self-esteem, quite bad social skills, excessive self-critique, excessive overthinking (especially when it comes to social situations and interactions) and recently loneliness. All of my relationships feel meaningless and shallow. My brother is basically a stranger that I happen to share an apartment with, we go weeks without saying a single word to each other. I've never really connected with my mother on a deeper level, I don't feel comfortable talking to her about my problems. I haven't seen or spoken to my father in many years. The vast majority of my friends, which I've know for anywhere from 4 to 10 years, feel like strangers that I just play video games with and have the odd meetup with. Being surrounded by such an environment throughout my childhood led me to my social incompetence (at least that's what I think). In addition to that, all of my "closest" friends are unmotivated. Half of them never bothered to continue their studies after high school, they don't go to events, social gatherings. We almost never hang out in real life. They've never showed interest in any activities besides playing games. They used to always complain about school and were just generally negative towards a lot of things. Throughout the years that also rubbed off on me. I became like them, I spent a minimum of 8 hours at the computer from middle school all the way up to end of high school, didn't have any hobbies, never attended any clubs, events, activities, nothing (also the fact that we were living paycheck to paycheck turned down a lot of opportunities). I've been trying to get out of this environment for a couple of years now. I want to try things, I want new hobbies, I want new experiences, I want to have deeper relationships. But it has always felt next to impossible given the life I've been living for the past 10 or so years, my social anxiety and my lack of social skills. I struggle the most with meeting new people, I feel like I can't be myself around them, that they will judge me, think I'm weird, etc. and it takes me a long time to gradually open up and show my true self. 

I've never had a girlfriend in my life, never went on a single date, not even really kissed a girl. Having a crush on someone just always resulted in emotional and mental strain. I never had the courage to talk to my crushes, I knew that I would never make any first moves. I've always wanted to date them, but at the same time was petrified of it and always thought that I would never be enough, that I was just a boring person and no relationship would last. I always ended up just criticizing myself over and over again due to that.

Now this is where the title comes in. Recently, I've randomly met a few people from my country when playing a game (it's quite a small country, so it's not common to meet other people living here).  To my surprise, they enjoyed playing with me. We ended up becoming online friends. Among them, there was this one girl, whom I instantly liked from the first game we had together. Over the next few days my feelings towards her started growing. I also learned that some of the people were from the same city as I was, including the girl. Even though at this point in time, the only time we communicated was when we played together, I already started having this urge to better myself thanks to her. I've picked up my one of my only hobbies I've ever had again, I started to work out, I've started trying to take better care of myself.  Over the course of a couple of months of me slowly starting to feel more comfortable with my new friends, we finally met in real life. Normally I would never have the courage to hang out irl with people I've met online, but this time it was different. Despite the anxiety (before our first meet up I was literally physically shaking due to stress), I wanted to meet her. I've never experienced this before. I would always be too scared and too shy to hang out with any of my crushes. And let me tell you, she is everything I could dream of in a partner, outside and most importantly inside. Now, for the last few weeks her, a few of the other friends and I been hanging out at least once a week, sometimes multiple times a week, partying on the weekend. I've never met so many people in such a short period of time and it feels awesome. I even had the courage to hang out with her alone for a couple of hours recently. I've always tried my best to avoid being with anyone one on one since then is when I feel most anxious. Despite that, I felt comfortable being with her within minutes. We talked, joked around pretty much throughout the whole time. We even touched on some deeper and more personal topics. All of this have to be the best times I've had in a long time.

However, this has also been one of the hardest times in my life. I want to be with this girl. I want to share my life with her (however boring it may be compared to hers), have new experiences with her that I've missed out on throughout my childhood and late teen years, I want to travel with her. But I again feel that I'm not enough. I also don't want to mess this up, so I keep hoping she will make a move. At the same time I know that if I don't in the near future, it will most definitely be too late, based on my past experience. I'm afraid to open up to her about my feelings, because I feel that if I do I might just push her away. It seems that she acts differently with me than with her other male friends. But at the same time, is seems that she only views me as a friend. And the thought on me never being able to be more than friends with her, never being able to share our lives and never being together is just soul crushing.  

All of this overthinking, constant emotional ups and downs, just the thoughts of me never being with her keep eating away at me. I've been in similar situations before, but it has never lead to me thinking about suicide. I feel like I'm getting into uncharted territory. I've already had a couple of mini "breakdowns". For the last few weeks I've just been considering ending all of this. Just to save myself from the all of this pain. As I see it now, I'll either end up being with her and living my best life or in a few years there won't be a life to speak of.

I'm sorry for the ridiculously long post. I'm not even sure if this is the place to post this as this might seem insignificant to some of the stories here. I'm also sorry if this doesn't make sense or I've done a poor job of explaining myself, I've never been good at telling stories and expressing my feelings. But this is just the result of years of bottling everything inside, years of gradual mental strain and emotional strain and never being able to talk about this. This situation just tipped it over, I just had to put my feelings to words as best as I could. I just had to share this with someone, anyone. Even if no one cares enough to read this or feels like this is insignificant, it just feels good to finally write my thoughts out.
