I just don't know what to doSo, some background, I'm 22 and Bipolar II with major depressive disorder. I've been on meds for six months and have been doing so much better. This Sunday just gone my 2+ year relationship with this amazing girl ended and all of a sudden it just... It feels like it's all come back. I know that I'm upset rather than depressed but my brain has gone straight back to old habits and I don't know what to do - I used to talk to her about this stuff and now I just can't.
