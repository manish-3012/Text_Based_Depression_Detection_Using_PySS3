All good things must come to an end I guessNobody read my last post but idc, read if you want. It's almost 1:30 am rn and I have to be up by 5 to get on a flight, but I can't sleep. I can't sleep with this self hatred in my head. Why did you have to say no to me?! Cant you see we're the same?! But maybe we werent the same, cause you cant even care when there's someone in front of you, screaming out in pain. Fucking lying, selfish, bitch.

Anyway, just lying here thinking about how I'm gonna die alone and how that just makes me wanna die more, and sooner rather than later.
