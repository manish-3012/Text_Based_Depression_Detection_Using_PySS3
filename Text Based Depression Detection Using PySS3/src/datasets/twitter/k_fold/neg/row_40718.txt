Deteriorating Health and No SupportI have heard amitriptyline is a good drug to overdose if I want to successfully commit suicide. Thankfully, I am prescribed this drug, so I will try to combine this with alcohol, Xanax, and any other downers I can find. 


I know that the aforementioned suicide method may not be successful, so I'm planning on buying some rope to hang myself after I have overdosed. I have thought about shooting myself and despite living in a state in the U.S. that permits gun ownership, I am not allow to own a gn because of mental health issues. 

For some background, my performance in school is declining, and I am past the drop date. Therefore, I will have three Fs on my transcript, and there isn't really a way to recover from that. Second, I have stupidly confessed my feelings to a co-worker, who is in a relationship, only to tell her I wanted space from her and nothing more. This has caused my coworkers to harass me at the workplace. 

I'm confident that I need to kill myself which I suppose sounds delusional. It would be better, especially for my coworkers and everyone I have injured in some way, that I be gone for good. I plan to commit suicide in the middle or beginning of April because that is when I can both, get a good supply of drugs to overdose on and the tools needed to hang myself.

I am a ridiculous person. I hurt people. I am hated. I am a piece of shit. I am stupid. There is nothing positive about my existence.
