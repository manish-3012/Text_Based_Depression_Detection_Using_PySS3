Sleep forever in the woodsIâ€™m tired of being the scapegoat. Iâ€™m tired of being gaslit. Iâ€™m tired of being threatened and bullied into suppressing my identity. Iâ€™m tired of living in fear of waking up and being taken against my will again. Handcuffed with a chain around my waist for missing too much school. Iâ€™m an illness my family wishes they could do away with. They say they wish they could work every day of the week. The urge to kill myself has been stronger than ever lately. I feel weak, like theyâ€™ve succeeded in breaking me down and that Iâ€™ll never escape to live my life to the fullest, free from them. They forced me to give up my friends or else theyâ€™d send me to the hospital against my will again. I still have panic attacks remembering how people screamed there. Not sure if I could actually go through with something more direct, and I wouldnâ€™t want to risk being hospitalized again, so anything where they could find me is out. Iâ€™m so sad for myself. I wish Iâ€™d had a better family. My childhood is gone. Iâ€™ll never be what I could have been. If only I had my license already. Havenâ€™t taken the permit yet. Should do that soon. Once Iâ€™m 18 and have my license Iâ€™ll drive and drive until I canâ€™t afford to buy any more gas. Iâ€™ll get a cheap apartment and any job that accepts someone without a high school diploma; Iâ€™m not sticking around here long enough to finish it. Once I have my own life where theyâ€™ll never find me, maybe then Iâ€™ll begin to heal and enjoy living. For now, though, lying here humiliated and broken down even further for the thousandth time, the woods are inviting.
