thank you, /r/SuicideWatchI used to post here just to keep myself alive for another day, and the replies gave me the support that I needed. from what I know, this subreddit has gotten some shit, but I respect it for staying strong, like every one of you here. I hope you all can find the things that keep you alive and hold onto them, as I did, and I wish you all the best of luck at getting help and feeling better. :)
