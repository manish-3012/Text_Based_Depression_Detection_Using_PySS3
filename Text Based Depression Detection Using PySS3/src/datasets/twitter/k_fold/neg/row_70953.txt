I don't have a reason not to kill myselfI have a full box of clarityne D, my school found out about my desire to die and they told me that if I mention that again I'm getting expelled, my grades suck, my English is terrible, my childhood dreams are dead, I can't move away, my family doesn't understand me and they often argue, my mom won't let me work one year to pay a good college, my dream careers and job can't be studied where I live, and my ex told me he loves another girl. Even after these few weeks he said we could date, and me sending him compromising pictures because I loved him so much he loves someone else, and my mom didn't let me continue talking to him and now he must hate me. I want to kill myself, I want to die, I can't stand living anymore, I don't have friends, I'm ugly, my personality sucks, I'm talentless and nobody will ever love me. I have been rejected by 8 guys, I was bullied all my childhood, I'm not happy, I will never be happy. I just want to stop hurting.
