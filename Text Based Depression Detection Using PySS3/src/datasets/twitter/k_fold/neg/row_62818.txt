Should I seek help?Lately I've been experiencing suicidal ideation again (this has happened before about a year ago but I didn't seek help) but this time the thoughts seem more frequent and I have found myself wondering about how I should proceed to kill myself.

I'm afraid of being on the road because I cannot see a car without having thoughts of jumping in front of it and sharp objects trigger thoughts of self harming.

I haven't made any plans though, is this a valid reason to seek help? 

I'm currently in a psychiatrist but I have no clue if this is relevant or how I should tell him.
