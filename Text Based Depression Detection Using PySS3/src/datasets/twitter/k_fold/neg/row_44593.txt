Iâ€™m thinking about suicideI hate the feeling of living in pain every single day, hoping it gets better or hoping it gets worse, just so the pain will stop so I can just not have to cry myself to sleep or hide my arms in my sleeves or tell my friends to not worry about he cuts or saying Iâ€™m fine when Iâ€™m clearly not. It hurts in more ways than emotionally, it hurts physically when I have to cut myself to deal with my emotional pain, when I starve myself for a week and then eat every meal I missed in one go, it hurts more than losing a loved one. It just hurts
