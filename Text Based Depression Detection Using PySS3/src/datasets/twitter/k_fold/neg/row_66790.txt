I never thought I'd make it past 21Even back when I was 10 years old, I always had that thought. I turn 21 next month and if something *big* doesn't change sometime soon, I'm not going to see 22. I'm thinking about going to the hardware store tomorrow and looking at rope. Hopefully the fear of it not working will disappear later this year.
