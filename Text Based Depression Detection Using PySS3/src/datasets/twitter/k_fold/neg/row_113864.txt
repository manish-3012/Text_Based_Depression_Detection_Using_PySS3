I think I might do it tomorrowI've been seeing a psychiatrist, taking meds, doing my best to focus on living. But I don't think it's working. 

I am an absolute failure with no future prospects.

I know no one really cares and barely anyone is going to read this but I just like putting it out there. 

Some people aren't meant to live, it just is the way and that's the conclusion I've once again come to.

I have a great window of opportunity tomorrow to kms, so I might take it. Hope y'all find peace
