Too tired to continue at this point.Everything is pulling me down. I'm fifteen, only go to school once or twice a week if that, mute, transgender, not taking meds anymore because none of them helped at all, have community service most of next week, and becoming an addict. I can't deal with the stress anymore. 

I spent today writing notes to the people who care about me. I know everyones going to be hurt, but I'm already hurting them by making them stand by and watch while my life falls apart. So I think this will be less painful than forcing them to see that. 

I want to hope there's something peaceful after death. Probably not, but....who knows? 

I don't know how I'm going out yet, but I'm thinking of overdosing. I imagine that being the least agonizing. 

I'm not sure why i'm typing this really. I suppose having one of my last days on record to some degree is comforting. 

I hope everyone finds peace at some point. Life just isn't my thing this time around. 


Xoe, out.
