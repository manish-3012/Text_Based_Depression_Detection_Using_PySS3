I hadn't thought about it in a while.This past year or so has literally been the best year of my life, mostly because I actually made friends somehow, and they actually seem to enjoy my company. I'm still depressed, but they make everything not so bad, even good sometimes. The holiday season is just making me think about it again. I know it sounds dumb and selfish, but seeing everyone happy with their families just makes things so much worse for me because I don't have that, and I never have. I hate how selfish it makes me sound, but I just want to have a happy family that I'm a part of for once. My parents and step parents are all going away to see relatives, leaving me alone again. 

I hurt myself earlier and now I'm just sitting in bed unable to sleep for the second night running. I hate that I let it all get to me like this, I usually just don't care. Sorry if this doesn't make sense and that it's dumb, I'm not really thinking perfectly.
