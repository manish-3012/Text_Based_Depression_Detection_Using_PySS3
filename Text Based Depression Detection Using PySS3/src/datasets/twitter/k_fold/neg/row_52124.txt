I'm completely washed up.My boyfriend is leaving me. We were in a relationship for a long time. We rent a house together. We had future plans. Dreams. Goals. And they're gone. They're all gone.
My body is in shock. I'm alone and not coping. My dog is cuddling up to me and the thought that he is the only one I'll be cuddled up to again is murdering me. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm finished. I have no redeeming qualities and the only person that has ever truly loved me is going. I lost my only chance at happiness. I'm not pretty, I'm not smart, I have no money...I'm done. It's over for me.
I tried to make him happy. But moving cities away from his family and friends was too much. And he doesn't want to to relocate with him. I'd do it. In a heartbeat. I'd do it. But he doesn't want me there.
I'm finished. It's over. I don't know what to do.
