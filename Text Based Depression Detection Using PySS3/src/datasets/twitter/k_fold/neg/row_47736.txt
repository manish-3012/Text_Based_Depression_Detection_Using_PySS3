A Calm DecisionI finally reached the point where I know this is what is best for me. It was not in the middle of a crisis, it was not during a dramatic moment, it was just a sudden, peaceful realization. Iâ€™ve taken the steps to make sure things are as easy as possible for my family. I even let my coworkers know where they can find all my passwords, so they arenâ€™t forced to jump through hoops to access the information I need. Itâ€™s strange to feel this way. Iâ€™m not doing this out of desperation, fear, or a desire to escape trauma. I just know this is what I need to do to finally have peace. I hope anyone reading this finds peace as well.
