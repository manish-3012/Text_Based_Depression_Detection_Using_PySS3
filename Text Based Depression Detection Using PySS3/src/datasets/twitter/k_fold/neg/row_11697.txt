Hate myselfI've had depression for 4 years. I've tried almost everything I can to cure myself but everything in my life has gone wrong. 
I've waited and waited and waited for some miracle or change of cicumstances to occur that will put an end to all the pain but I've finally accepted that I'm doomed to live a life of constant suffering and torment. Is that a life really worth living?
At this point I think the only winning move is not to play
