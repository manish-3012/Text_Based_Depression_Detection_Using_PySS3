Is there even anyoneI want to know if there is any one out there how just feels that it be better if they did die so that everyone can just keep talking behind their back. I donâ€™t care what they all think if itâ€™s behind their closed door. Narrow minded and selfish people all around the people that I remember as being open and willing to hear people. I just know that even if I was happy and everything was okay. There at least wouldnâ€™t be the people who attacked me in my ear cause people probably would have told them to fuck off better then screaming at them in the hallway at sehome.
