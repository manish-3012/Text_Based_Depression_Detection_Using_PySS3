i'm sick of being here i just want to get myself to do it alreadyi don't feel like i belong in my home anymore and everyone forgets im here even when my door is wide open. if i died tonight, no one would notice except my dog and my bf. they would be better off without me though bc all i do is bring everyone down. no wonder everyone else forgets about me, all i am is a depressing piece of shit. :/// i wish i could get these suicidal thoughts past the plan stage and just start working on implementing this shit. im so tired of being alive and im so tempted to relapse on cutting and pills again tonight but i made a promise to him that i would try my hardest not to.


i wish i never promised. 

it's so hard trying to pretend everything's okay when it's not. i wish i was normal and didn't think like this. i wish i had friends. i wish i had a loving family. i wish i was happy instead of sad and miserable every single day.
