I want to die. I repeat this every day.In my mind, out loud, sometimes in twitter (with an account with 0 followers haha). 
I can only  fantasize with my death. I just want to die pacefully. I get this thought like 10 times a day, or more.
 
If the situation doesn't get better, it would take me some time to find enough "material" in this hell-hole and the money to pay for them, but I will, even if is in a year... Nvm I can't stand a year like this... But again, that's the way I want to die and with those.
I hate being so picky even when is about my death.

Anyway, just wanted to write it somewhere. Is not really like someone can really help, unless you can send me the psichiatrist treatment I need or money to pay for it. (Sertralina and clonazepam, when I could find it my mental situation got so much better, but I have no money and in this hell-hole can't find them anyway).
