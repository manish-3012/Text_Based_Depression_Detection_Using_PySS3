Trans and fucking done with lifeFucking over it. Dysphoric constantly, can't even come out because 1) my parents are shithead conservatives and 2) im starting college, and I'm lucky enough to have ended up choosing the same college AND degree as my garbage bigoted high school classmates! 

I get constantly fucked over every chance i get and there's fuck all i can do about it, i can't even sleep because i have insomnia, i can't function because of anxiety and depression, my life's a joke
