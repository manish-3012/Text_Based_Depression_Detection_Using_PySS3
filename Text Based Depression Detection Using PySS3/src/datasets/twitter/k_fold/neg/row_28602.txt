Just tired of everything going wrong.After 38 years of hearing it gets better ., it gets pretty old. Crap keeps getting worse. I do have a kid i get to see on weekends.  Last weekend he said he didn't want to see me again. I don't think he meant it but still hurts. I try an be the funny guy  but i spend most of my time alone. In debt way over my head. Crapy job i haven't gotten a raise in 10 years i think the only reason they don't fire me is because i make so little. Just getting so tiered.
