College student looking for someone to talkMy name is Logan and Iâ€™m 21 years old. Iâ€™m a college student in my senior year about to graduate in May. On the outside, everything in my life seems fine. Iâ€™ve got good grades, I go to class, I turn in my homework, Iâ€™m good looking, I think, just a regular guy. 

But I canâ€™t even remember the last time I was happy. When I was a kid my parents fought and screamed at each other all day every day, so I got away as much as possible. I would bike 5-6 miles just to go to the movie theatre and escape. In high school I ran cross country and track, and I was a normal student, but I didnâ€™t really have any friends but one. There was one kid who I had known my entire life, literally my best and only friend, but one day he learned when our family was on vacation and broke into our house, stealing a lot of money and trashing the place. He admitted to doing it, and I remember holding my little brother in bed who was crying because he thought that someone was going to break in again. My parents were too busy fighting to care I guess.

So now I had no friends, and it was so hard to meet anyone. Now I think that maybe I have trust issues like I only see the worst in people or something. I canâ€™t get near anyone because everyone Iâ€™ve ever been close to has left or doesnâ€™t care about me. No one but me. I was really down for a long time, and no one cared. One night I was at the house alone and I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and I donâ€™t know what I was thinking, I just wanted it all to stop so I didnâ€™t have to cry anymore. My mother came home and found me right then, like the worst timing in the world, and I was crying with a knife and I told her what I was doing. She made me see this counselor woman, but I refused to talk to her. They sat me in front of some fat, rich, stupid, privileged woman who knew nothing about me and expected me to talk or something, but I just sat there not saying a word for every meeting she made me do.

I went to college, and it was more of the same. I have no friends. I go to class, do my homework, and sit in my room. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s fucking wrong with me but sometimes I hurt myself or go on a walk and punch a brick wall until its covered in blood from my hand. I barely eat anything anymore, Iâ€™m pretty sure I have anorexia. Iâ€™m 5 foot 10 inches and weigh about 110 pounds. Last year I went too long without eating and passed out, hitting my head on the floor pretty bad. I woke up in the hospital and it took me 6 months to recover. Itâ€™s just getting worse. I donâ€™t want to be around anymore, but Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to kill myself. Iâ€™ve tried everything, hanging, cutting, co-2 with a car. I just canâ€™t fucking do it. I donâ€™t know anymore. I donâ€™t know what would make me happy. I guess I just want someone to love me. But no one ever has.

I met a girl last year in school and we hit it off. Iâ€™m still a virgin and Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend, so Iâ€™m a bit shy, but Iâ€™m pretty good looking, so I went for it. For a while things were great, I worked up the nerve to tell her I liked her, and she told me she liked me back. We would sit up all night watching bad movies and talking until the morning. This went on for a while. One day I worked up the courage to tell her I wanted to kiss her and we did, (first kiss at 20 years old is pathetic, I know) and I asked her out. She said no and just left. All the time we spent just wasted. All the times she told me she liked me were a lie I guess. It was crushing. The first friend Iâ€™ve made in years just gone. But thatâ€™s what I get for putting myself out there. Just like my old friend when I was young. Now Iâ€™m 21, still a virgin, still have no friends, and Iâ€™m supposed to graduate and find a job, start a life? For the last 8 years Iâ€™ve been trying to find a way to die and I canâ€™t take it anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do. No one has ever told me they loved me. No one has ever cared. No one even notices me because I look so normal I guess. But Iâ€™m falling apart. Iâ€™m barely eating, Iâ€™m dangerously underweight, and Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to die. 

I donâ€™t know what the point of all this is, I guess I just have no one to talk to and I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t think I can kill myself, but Iâ€™ve been trying again recently and it just hurts so fucking bad. Iâ€™m just angry and sad all the time. I feel like I almost canâ€™t even get up in the morning anymore. Food doesnâ€™t taste good, even fucking masturbating doesnâ€™t feel good. I have no one to turn to.

What the fuck do I do? I spend all day putting on a smile so no one at school can tell. I canâ€™t keep doing this much longerâ€¦
