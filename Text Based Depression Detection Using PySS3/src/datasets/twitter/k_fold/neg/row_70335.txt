Problem Gambling is leading me to suicide26 years old. Been gambling ever since I turned 21 and have lost probably close to over 15 grand. The ironic thing is that I'm actually very frugal in life. I save pennies, rarely go out on vacations and get the bare minimum grocery shopping. I'm so obsessed with money that its hindering me from enjoying life and it's been a vicious cycle of me losing it over and over again. I want to be the one that takes care of my friends and family, but I'm the one the needs to be helped. I'm worrying everyone and have morbid thoughts to myself in my one bedroom apartment. I'm writing this in tears in the middle of the night, with lack of sleep for the whole month. I'm scared, have no direction or goals and just compare myself to others constantly. Called the suicide hotline twice. Never thought I'd be in this deep of depression. This is a sad call out for help....because I think I'm flirting with the line of ending myself. I'm losing it.
