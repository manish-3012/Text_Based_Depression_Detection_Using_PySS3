I think suicide is the only accomplishment I can achieve. I have never achieved any goal I've set out for myself. I wanted to attend college but couldn't because I was turned down for all the grants and loans and I never made enough money to afford it. I was never able to save enough money for retirement. Now I'm past the point of no return. I'll never earn enough to retire one day. I'll also never have enough to raise a family. I kind of dreamed of having a family after my last family member died 18 years ago. I'm tired of volunteering my time, I never get anything in return, not even a thank you. I'm tired of always hoping something better is just around the corner. There is only so many times you can be disappointed until you kind of give up on hope. I'm getting older, I'm less capable of doing things like I used to. My body is starting to give out. I'm tired of asking for help and it's always some generic bullshit along the line of just hang in there or just don't worry about it or money isn't everything. It's hard to not worry about it when you start getting health problems the free clinic doesn't have the facilities to treat it's time to hang it all up. I tried to fix all these problems, hell I even tried to leave the country in hopes of a better life. All I did was get arrested and sent back. Suicide is the only goal I can set for myself that I can complete. The only thing worse than living life like this is living life like this for one more day.
