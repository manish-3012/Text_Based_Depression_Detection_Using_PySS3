Anxiety, depression, self-hate, and jealousyI am pushing everyone who is good and loves me away.  
My boyfriend has been trying to be supportive, but I have been super depressed. I've also been projecting my feeling from an ex's cheating and abusive ways onto him, wrongfully. I was being crazy yesterday and liked all of his pictures on facebook and said "Cute" on all of his pictures with girls. I'm so awful. He broke up with me, obviously.   
That same abusive ex has been finding sneaky ways to contact me and for years has had a way to make my mind swim. He's now dating one of  my only girlfriends, who I've had to cut ties with now. I saw him at a public place the other day and I had a mild panic attack and went out the back door.  
My mom has been trying to help me, but when she knocked on my front door I told her to go away.  
I don't see friends anymore.  
I can't bring myself to clean my place.  
It's getting harder to keep my emotions in check at work -- which is the most awful stressful place.  
I'm seeing a therapist, but it's taking time and energy I just don't have any more.  
I don't think I can do anything any longer and I just want to die.  
I know it's selfish, I know people love me, but it just hurts so damn much.
