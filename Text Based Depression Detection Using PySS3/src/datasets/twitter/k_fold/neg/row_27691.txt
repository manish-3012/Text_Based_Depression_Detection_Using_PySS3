I'm sitting outside work crying in the carIt just kind of hit me again. The pattern of everything. I got fired from my last job for no showing and I think it's happening again, except I don't care this time. I feel like I'm just a gear in a machine, but if I'm taken out, the machine will continue just as well as it always has. 

I'm exhausted and tired all the time and if this is all there is ever going to be, then I don't really want to grind it out just to have small pleasured here and there. I make so much music under many names and genres because that's where I find the most joy, but not a lot really comes out of it and I'm kind of losing interest now. I was thinking of doing one last project and then dipping. 

I'm not sure people really like me. I feel fake like my personality is a sponge that just kind of absorbs whomever I'm around. But I'm not really out there much in the first place and find it difficult to understand why the people that like me do want to be around me. 

I've spent the last month falling asleep at 5am and drinking to speed up the process. I want the physical health issues to end. 

I guess I just ultimately don't see any potential in my future. I'm good at what I do. I don't have self esteem issues. My head's just sick.
