No motivationsI donâ€™t have energy anymore, I started playing Skyrim some days ago, I used to love video games but now all I feel is anxiety when I play, the same with music and books, everything that I used to enjoy just make me anxious now, because I canâ€™t stop thinking of how tired I am of life, tomorrow I got work and I dread that, i donâ€™t want to go, Iâ€™m tired and frustrated of my job, I donâ€™t want to do anything but I know that I have to, but every second I spent there feels like my soul is being sucked away from me, I donâ€™t have motivation anymore, I donâ€™t want to do anything, I have no dreams nor goals, I just want to disappear, but I canâ€™t, im expected to endure this torture
