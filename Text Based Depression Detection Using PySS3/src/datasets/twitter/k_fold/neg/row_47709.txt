All I wanna do is drink and smoke and stay in my bed until I die. 24(m) failure.Life expects you to work but when you are so broken and so numb itâ€™s impossible. Iâ€™ve been getting so much shit lately for staying in bed and calling out of work but Iâ€™m just so over this life. Iâ€™m 24 and and so woke and just didnâ€™t have a good childhood, depressed 12 years now. Iâ€™m left ultimately alone at this point, maybe see someone every few weeks. Shut people out. Whenever I force myself to do anything I usually need to drink to feel any emotion and not seem like a dead catatonic waste. All joy I got from anything is completely gone. the only reason I enjoy food is because we biologically need it. If I enjoy anything at all itâ€™s beautiful sleep. I can sleep for days and not leave my room. I used to be so outgoing and hopeful but itâ€™s all gone now. My antidepressants donâ€™t work, and I canâ€™t afford a therapist. I can get shit ones through my Medicaid but they just make me feel more alone and depressed. Fuck. I look out at the world and see the sunshine yes and see the trees and people but thereâ€™s this glass wall thatâ€™s always there. People are phony and fake and just donâ€™t seem to feel the things I do. I CANT KEEP UP anymore. Itâ€™s this huge rat race that I just gave up in. My mental deterioration will never let me become successful (yet I still have no idea what I want to do) and it keeps me from forming normal relationships. I wake up every morning and just stare into nothing for hours and hours until Iâ€™m forced to get up to work with fake people. Even working 2 days a week is so exhausting. My mind is set on continuing to get worse and worse until hopefully I have the guts to just end this suffering. I realized we are keeping ourselves here but 23 out of the 24 hours Iâ€™m suffering, other hour Iâ€™m sleeping or watching a decent flick. I wanna drink and smoke weed and be left alone. But unfortunately you need money to do that. So Iâ€™m just forcing myself to survive for legit no reason... Iâ€™ve done nothing with my life except working serving jobs, drinking, and being selfish. I hate myself and my life. Iâ€™m not even looking for help I just neeeded a place to vent. Thanks for reading if anyone did.
