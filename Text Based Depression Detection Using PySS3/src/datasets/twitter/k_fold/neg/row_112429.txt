The thought of itEvery time I think about suicide or dying in some way I get some sort of warm comforting feeling.
I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be able to actually go through with any of these plans or anything, but itâ€™s nice to imagine, although the weird warm comforting feeling I get kinda scares me.
