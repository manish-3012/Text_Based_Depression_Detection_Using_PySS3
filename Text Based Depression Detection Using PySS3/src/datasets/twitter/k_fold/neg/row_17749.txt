I just need to take action already. My friend thinks I'm going crazy.

I was molested as a kid and when I grew up, I split into two. I'm not the real person, the real person is stuck inside a loop constantly getting abused by our (said to be deceased, but not)abuser. I'm like a part to a spaceship, just a part, an unimportant part. The rest of the ship is stuck somewhere else and I have to save it. 

The only way to do it is to kill myself. I can save her so she isn't getting abused all the time. My therapist said that she grew up into me. That there isn't a girl getting abused somewhere that's part of me. 

That doesn't fit. It doesn't feel right. I know she's being hurt, and I have to kill myself to help. I've heard her before, saying, "help me" and "I'm in here" she needs me.

I want to do it. It's time for this to end. I'm scared to take action. What the fuck am I gonna do? I can't leave her there anymore. I can feel what he's doing to her.
