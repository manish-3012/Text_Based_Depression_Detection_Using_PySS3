I'm on the highway ready to jump.I think at this point I'm honestly just trying to put this off. I know to some extent I don't want to do this, not because /I/ don't want to die but because it's just the natural human response to avoid death, but god damn I want to die more then anything. 

I'm not good enough for anyone. I've been bled dry of all resources. I give and give and give and it's never enough. I'm never enough for anyone. I don't have any friends at this point, they all stopped talking to me long ago or were making my life worse, but at this point I wish I had kept them. Better to have a toxic friend then no friends at all.

I'm alone. I've tried reaching out but it does nothing. My psychiatrists/psychologists are unhelpful. I've been on two different anti depressants. I have no money. I can't get a job due to mental and physical illness. I can't even study at this point. I've exhausted every resource. I'm in constant emotional and physical pain. I just want to end my life. Or at least fall asleep for a really long time and wake up when things have magically started to look up.

I don't know what I'm looking for by posting here. I guess I just figured if I tried every option possible, then no one can say I didn't genuinely seek help at every possible angle.
