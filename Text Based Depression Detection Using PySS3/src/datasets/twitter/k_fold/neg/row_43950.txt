its casualJust casually want to die. I've been stressed all week and I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. Moving is stressful, life is stressful, when you completely make a dumb ass move that involves your bosses when it could have been easily avoidable its stressful.
For once I just want someone to have my interest in mind. For someone to think of me and do something for me that I don't have to ask for. I do so much for everyone around me, I try to be thoughtful, and people just don't even register that I'm a human with feelings, I'm not worthy of any simple thoughts. Like, "hey man, I grabbed your drink from the other room bc I saw you forgot it" instead of groaning when I ask them to bring it to me since they're up already or something. I shouldn't have to ask for the bare minimum amount of affection from those around me. I shouldn't have to keep repeating what's not okay bc no one ever listens. I feel like I'm in a full blown mental breakdown but everyone is looking the other way. Like I go to them and say "I'm struggling. I'm stressed. I can't do anything" and just once I want to hear something other than "I know"
I'd kill myself but I don't want the pity. I'm in limbo, and I'm screaming. But, hey, they know. It's casual.
