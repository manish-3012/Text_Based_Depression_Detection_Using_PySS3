What do you do for someone who can't or won't get help?I have a friend (14, female, Hispanic) who I've been worried about for about a year. She alternates frequently between being very depressed and a cheerful, cutesy demeanor. She is slightly overweight and is constantly overly worried about her appearance. She has been starving herself for about a month, only eating perhaps one meal a day. Her family is extremely unsupportive of her and tells her that she is ugly, childish, and stupid. She looks up to me, I suppose (17, male) because I try to encourage her as much as possible... She's really a great friend who I hate to see stuck in low self-esteem and depression. Last night she cut her arms (I believe for the first time ever) leaving a lot of marks... not deep or overly hazardous to her health, but it's another step towards suicidal behavior... I've had a few friends this past year take their own lives, and I'll do anything in my power to help her. I've tried to get her to see a professional, but her parents say that she's just exaggerating and won't take her to see anyone. I really don't know what I can do to help.
