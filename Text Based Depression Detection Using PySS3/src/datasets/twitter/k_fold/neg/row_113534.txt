What triggered the original, comforting thought.I find this ironic... 
Little bit about me: sophomore high school. 

And now the iron. As a sophomore in my school we learn about self esteem and one thing we touched on was suicide. Thought nothing of it until we had a visitor talk to us. She was a phone operator for the crisis center. She gave us more info about it. I really started thinking. These highly irrational thoughts just seem to getting more and more comforting. But when it really comes down to it. When I'm lying there with a fee tears and I come on here to seek comfort. People always are suggesting "call the hot line", el what do you do when that's how it really became Logical?
