I don't know what to do..I just feel so helpless.   
My problems ain't such as no money, unemployed, having a disability.. It's just my family and surroundings. I'm under 18 and even tho my monthly income would be enough to live alone, I can't since I'm under 18. My parents are treating me horrible and give me the feeling to kill myself every day and I'm really close to it. Everyday I'm in work I just love to stay there since I know I don't need to see my parents there.  
Sadly my father works at the same company so he visits me sometimes and just make me feel worse in front my work mates.  
I'm not sure if he doesn't know how bad of a father he is, but he just doesn't seem to know. He things he's doing the best even tho he just makes me want to kill myself.  
Added to that my parents are extremly intolerant to "unnormal" things like not being born in the same country we live in(even tho they're not themselve..), different sexual orientation and so on.  
Being a Bisexual Guy doesn't benefits any of that.  
Everytime I'm outside with my parents and they see someone who doesn't behave like a "normal" guy or girl, they just talk hours about ill they are and weird, making me feel even worse.   
My internet access is capped as well, I have none at phone and none at My computer.  
I'm not allowed to go outside of the city and if I leave the house in my spare time, they always question it and want to know exactly where I am and why, or don't allow me go at all.  
I just want my own life, my own decisions, and If I don't manage to live alone and end up killing myself I will at least know it's my fault and I fucked up.
