I don't knowI'm a 18 year old male, I've spent the past 6 years of my life constantly thinking of killing myself. 

I find it extremely hard to make meaningful relationships with people, mostly because I am a terrible person. A lot of the time I meet someone really cool and I end up falling for them, but become too clingy and lose them.

That very situation happened to me in the last 5 days. I met an amazing person that I comnected so well with. But like always I push them away from me by accident. But it felt so different this time, so much worse.

In all, I'm extremely depressed and am thinking of killing myself.
