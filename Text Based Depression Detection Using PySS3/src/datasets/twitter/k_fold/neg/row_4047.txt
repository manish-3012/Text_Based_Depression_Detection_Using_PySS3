I have no hopeI've been struggling for a few years and I've been holding onto my last few strands of hope given to me by my girlfriend. She essentially told me I'm fucked and not fixable and that we both might as well die. It's my fault. I knew I'd wear her down. It was just a matter of time. I can't stay here anymore.
