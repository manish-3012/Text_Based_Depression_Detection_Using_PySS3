At schoolI'm at school right now and I can't help but just feel inferior and useless. I dread my existence when I look at my classmates . I do nothing and am doing nothing in my life . I hope I can build up some gall to kill myself because everything fucking sucks. I know someone will say that I'm being irrational but really I'm not . I keep procrastinating on the necessary things and I think it's just because my subconscious knows that I'm gonna kill myself . Fuck
