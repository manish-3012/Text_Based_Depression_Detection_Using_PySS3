I feel much better. To be honest, I don't feel bad anymoreI've left a post here some months ago. I didn't realise that it actually helped me to stand alone. Now I feel better, have will to plan my future, and actually do something for it. Thank you all. I hope every single loved one here to be helped and be better soon. Now I'm leaving this sub. Thank you again, I love you all.
