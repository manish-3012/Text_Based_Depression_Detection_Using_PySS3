Didn't kill myself on the 19th like I had been saying for 2 years that I would but I still feel the sameI'm still not ok. I didn't have some big revelation that I wanna live or life is beautiful or anything, I just chickened out. I still feel the same. The debt, failure, loneliness, self-hatred, and every other reason I wanted to do it are all still there. Yes I've been seeing a therapist and taking meds it just hasn't helped
