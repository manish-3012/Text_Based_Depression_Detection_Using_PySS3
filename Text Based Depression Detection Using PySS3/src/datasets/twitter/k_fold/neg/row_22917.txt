I don't know what to doI'm not sure if this applies here. If it doesn't somebody could tell me and ill just get rid of it but I don't know what to do about my depression anymore. Well I suppose that's not entirely true. I know what to do I just won't do it and therefore I don't know what to do about that. I'm being offered help. I know that its what I could use but I just won't do it. I don't have any motivation to do anything worthwhile anymore. Like, I don't want help, I don't want to do anything productive, I just want to go take a dive into icy waters. I'm not sure if this is just my loss of hope or if I'm lazy or just an idiot. Probably a mixture of all 3. I just can't keep going anymore. The only direction I have right now is when, where, and how I want to die. I'd really appreciate more direction on what I should do about this problem.
