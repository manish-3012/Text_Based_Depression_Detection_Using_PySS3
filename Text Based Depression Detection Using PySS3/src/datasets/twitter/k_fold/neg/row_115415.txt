What if anything helps you feel better when you're suicidal?I have been suicidal on and off for many years. I'm scared of killing myself because of the unknown factor of what will things be like after life. What if being dead is worse than being alive? That's why I try to continue on. There's got to be something out there that can help us. I am currently reading a little everyday it helps to distract me a bit. I am reading from an author that also struggled with mental illness and attempted suicide multiple times; Phillip K Dick. Other things that help a bit are listening to music, going for walks, and eating something healthy like fruit. What helps you feel better?
