My girlfriend, or ex I guess, is so mean. But I can't come to terms if I'm crazy and imagining it... but really she is meanI finally broke up with her this morning. I had a bad dream and asked if she could hold me. Her reply "Fuck, I'm sleeping bitch, just shut up or go sleep on the couch."

Funny, this is my apartment. I have a job, I pay the bills. She sleeps and eats all day. We're lesbians, not that it matters except she's also a pillow princess and thinking about all of this... She contributes nothing and is causing me to hemorrhage all of my money and dignity.

Yet here I am.... 3 hours after kicking her out convinced it's all my fault, that I overreacted and that I'm a pile of shit that no one ever could or will love. I should kill myself. I should call her an apologize. I should stop existing. I want to die because I gave all of my love and it wasn't good enough. I want to die because I let her take so much from me. I want to die because I really do love her and don't trust myself not to go running back to putting myself right back in that weird love/hell/torture that I can't live without yet am miserable in. I have mental health issues, which I'm being medicated for but not seeing a therapist. I'm hoping the Welbutrin and Klonopin can take me down a notch. I don't want to die but I don't want to anymore either and I'm scared which of the two will win today.
