mentally ill, no skills, just a burdeni recently â€œtook a breakâ€ aka dropped out of college because iâ€™m too emotionally unstable to handle it. i have so many mental disorders itâ€™s fucking stupid and youâ€™d think iâ€™m lying. adhd, ocd, anxiety, depression, autism, a bunch of other shit, all diagnosed and medicated by a therapist iâ€™ve been seeing for several years. i feel like i havenâ€™t gotten any better with any of this in all of these years and at this rate of â€œrecoveryâ€ iâ€™ll die miserable anyway. now that iâ€™ve dropped out i need to find a job but thereâ€™s nothing i can do. i have absolutely no marketable skills. i canâ€™t work a desk job because i have adhd, i cant do any work with deadlines because i have adhd, i canâ€™t talk to people because i have anxiety/autism, i canâ€™t even fucking wash dishes in my own home because i have ocd. thereâ€™s no entry level job i can do.  the only thing iâ€™m good for is art but so what? i canâ€™t make money off of it. no one wants to commission me. no one wants my art. i feel like a fucking burden because iâ€™ve been living with my boyfriend whoâ€™s been really understanding about everything and taking care of me and supporting me but itâ€™s not fair. itâ€™s not fair that i lay around and cry all day begging people to buy my shitty art or even look at it. itâ€™s not fair that iâ€™m holding him back. lately heâ€™s even started to acknowledge this and is gently pressuring me to get a job. i look and i look and thereâ€™s no place for me in the world. iâ€™m useless to him and to everyone around me and i should just do them a favor and leave for good. i donâ€™t know a good reason why i shouldnâ€™t. iâ€™m not doing anything valuable for anyone.
