I'm no longer suicidalFor a long period of time I had been.

I've made some major changes to my life.

The most important steps were interrupting University, this has allowed me time and energy to get back onto my feet.

And joining various clubs. I joined a film society, Bjj gym, comedy club and drama club.

Most nights I will always have friendly people to meet and spend time with.

But most importantly I learnt to be content with what I have and never desire more. I don't desire more money, I don't desire better grades. I just flow through life and enjoy the experience never wanting anything but just enjoying the experience good and bad

I want to help others. If anyone wants my help they can message me. I'm not claiming to be some self help guru that knows all the answers and can fix anything, what I am claiming is I can be someone who can be here for you and not give bullshit advice like suicide hotlines or ring the police ever
