A frustrating cycleI am so exhausted from going through this endless cycle. I want to die, to kill my self. But before I do so I have to get things in order. I want to write a letter to my kids, clean the house and say my goodbyes. But when I think about doing those things it reminds me of what I would be missing and how much grief and trauma I would put my kids through so I think no I canâ€™t do it. 

Then I feel guilty and shitty for thinking about it and it sends me into a shame spiral. Then i get impulsive and think fuck it Iâ€™m just going to do it it tonight 

And we are back to square 1. I so wish I could have a terminal disease. That would make it ok to die.
