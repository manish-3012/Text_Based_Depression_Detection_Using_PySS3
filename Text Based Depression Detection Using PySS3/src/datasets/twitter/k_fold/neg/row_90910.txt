No doubt this post will get lostI have been having some bad thoughts lately, so just decided to vent a bit. Simply put, I feel like a burden to everyone: family members, friends, people I meet. And I don't talk about it with anyone in fear that I will be a burden to them. Everyone seems me as this happy dude who can make you laugh, but in reality I want to just disappear off the face of this planet. I don't even know what I'm trying to achieve with this post. Maybe just to leaving some note before I go? To be fair, I'm not even expecting anyone to respond to this, there are people who deserve help much more than I do.
