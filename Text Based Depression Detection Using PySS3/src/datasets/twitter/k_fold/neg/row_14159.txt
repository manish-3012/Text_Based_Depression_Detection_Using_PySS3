In relation to childhood sexual abuseI was abused as a child, ages 6 to 11, by a man who worked in our church. Yeah what happened to me was pretty bad, but I can get past that. What I can't get past is that I didn't tell anyone for over 10 years. I let other children go through what happened to me. I should have told someone. I could have saved so many other kids from what I went through. I thought about it when I was 14. But I didn't tell anyone. I have no friends. I've never been able to keep a decent relationship. It's eating me away. I'm so sorry I didn't speak up. I wish I could go back and act differently. I can't live with this. I'm so sorry.
