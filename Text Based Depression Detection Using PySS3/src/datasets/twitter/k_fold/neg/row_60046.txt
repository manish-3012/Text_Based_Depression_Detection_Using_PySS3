I feel so aloneThis is my last ditch effort. Iâ€™ve struggled before but got better. Now I live in an unhappy marriage, my husband said he wants to give up on me, I lost my little brother to suicide 3 years ago and it stills hurts me. I feel myself regressing. I just want to feel less alone for a little while. Because now I can only see one option.
