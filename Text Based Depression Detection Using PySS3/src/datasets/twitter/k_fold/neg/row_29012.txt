My mind is killing meI'm 16 years old. I now expect the judgmental thoughts to run through your mind. I expect my problems to be dismissed because I'm young, I can't possibly have gone through much. 

I'm not going to complain about my life- because I know that I can handle any obstacle that I get butchered with. I just don't want to anymore. 

As I said before, I am 16 years old, I moved out of my moms house, I'm completely independent and I still attend school. I have extremely good grades and I'm cool with everybody. I have everything going for me right? But ever since I was 8 years old, I wanted to die, I never felt like I was supposed to be in this world, all I've ever been feeling inside was my heart being torn apart while something constantly whispers for me to kill myself. I am suffocating and I just want it to stop. I'm hurting so badly. I can't breathe anymore.

I'm a logical person. I take every factor in for consideration. 
I haven't contributed anything in the world (the world is overpopulated anyway), I never will- I don't have a desire for anything in the future, I just moved here so nobody is going to be impacted badly by this- nobody even knows me that well, my family is just my mom, who absolutely loathes me (It's pretty serious, and I've accepted it), and my abusive brother who has tried to kill himself twice. 
I wouldn't be hurting anybody. I'm not significant to this world. I literally don't matter. I don't see the big deal in taking my life... so I'm going to and really soon. Nothing is keeping me here. 

What is the point in staying?
