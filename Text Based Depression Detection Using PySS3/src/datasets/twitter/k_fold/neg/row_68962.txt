I'm so tiredI'm sorry if formatting is weird, on mobile. 

I haven't really had good experiences with suicide help places and whatnot so I'm just hoping this is better. 

I'm Dex, 23, in a homeless shelter, jobless and mentally ill. 
I guess I can just rant about everything that hurts and makes me so tired. 

I have BPD (please don't say how terrible I am, I already know) and it really sucks. Everything is so draining and hurts all the time. I'm in therapy twice a week and 3x every other week. I'm going through the motions and trying what my therapist says to feel better but nothing helps. 

I was emotionally neglected throughout my childhood by my mother and sexually abused by my step mom from the ages of 3-10. No one believed me and in fact it became the family joke that I was abused. 

I had a partner from 15-18 who physically, emotionally and sexually abused me. My next partner, 18-19 raped me repeatedly. 
I'm currently married to someone who is pretty awesome but we're going through a really hard time right now with our relationship. 

I keep losing my jobs because I'm so mentally unwell and I feel like a failure. Being homeless sucks, being hungry sucks and I'm just so tired of waiting for it "to get better."

I want to die a lot. I'm tired of this life. I'm really done. I'm just going through the days and nothing is better. I'm just more sad.

Thanks for reading my vent. I appreciate it.
