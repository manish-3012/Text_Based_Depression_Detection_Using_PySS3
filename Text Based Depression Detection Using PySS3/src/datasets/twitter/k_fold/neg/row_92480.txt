i keep threatening my self with suicide but never pull through, it makes my life seem like a ticking time bomb that never gets set offi despise being alive, so i keep thinking that someday iâ€™m gonna lose it and go through with a plan, despite not actually having a plan. sometimes, even for weeks or months on end, all that fills up my brain is the thought of being gone and not having to cry or think or worry or breathe anymore. sometimes itâ€™s peaceful, sometimes itâ€™s torture. i donâ€™t know what to do with myself anymore. my friends would surely be upset by my death, but if iâ€™m dead, would it matter? yes, because their lives would be changed, with one person threatening their own life if i take mine. no, because i would be dead and wouldnâ€™t know. thoughts like that are what prevent me from doing anything, the unknown. one of these days, though, i wonâ€™t care anymore, and that will be the day the bomb goes off.
