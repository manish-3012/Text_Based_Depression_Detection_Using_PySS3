WhateverNobody will read this, but I need to get it off my chest. 

I don't think I really have a right to feel this way. When I was younger in school, I wasn't completely alone. People tried to be friends with me, but I was always too awkward, too uncomfortable, or too afraid to reciprocate. 

No matter what I tried, I couldn't interact with anyone without being awkward and uncomfortable. If I ever got close to anyone, I was too much of a trainwreck to keep them around. It's sad how many people have tried to be my friend, only to have me find some way to drive them back. 

And now here I am, as a working adult. My peers are all getting married, figuring out their lives. And I'm here, a miserable wreck who had to use the word "peers" because I simply don't have friends. There's no room for a broken person like me in their lives anymore. Just when I was starting to think that maybe I could improve, it's just not the place in life anymore where I can be anything but alone. 

I learned a long time ago not to believe anyone when they say they're willing to help. When they're there for me. I've made the mistake of believing that. I don't blame them, I don't blame anyone for trying. But there hasn't been a person alive who truly understands that there is no point. If you feel like I'm at the spot where you feel the need to tell me "I'm here if you need me," it's too late. I've already fucked up.
