HahaI'm so fundamentally unhappy that no matter how "good" I have it in life, I'm never really okay. I cry myself to sleep at night, I have thoughts of suicide every day. The worst part is no one knows. People always say "tell someone" well that's bull shit. I told exactly two people in my life  (as well as a few counselors/therapists over the years who didn't help even a little): I told my grandpa and my ex boyfriend. My grandpa doesn't look at me the same anymore, when he rarely talks to me anymore it's like I'm a broken doll or something, just pity. My boyfriend left me, specifically because of it. "Friends" pretend like I never said anything. Or cut me out of their lives. So before you tell me to talk with someone about it, just don't. They'll leave. They all leave. What the hell am I supposed to do. Can I please just end it. This is a joke. This has to be a fucking joke. Being born just to be this alone in life is so fucking cruel it has to be a joke. How fitting that I feel this all crashing down on April fool's day. What a fucking joke.
