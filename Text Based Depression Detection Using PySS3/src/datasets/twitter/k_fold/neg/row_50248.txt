if I kill my self , my father's love for us would be the biggest reason for thatI just don't see a point in any single thing . Seeing what my father's  life has been , I don't want to live then . And the helping nature that he has ( one where you cut your self for sake of others  ), if that's  humanity  ,then that sucks, if that's  what everyone  tells us to be holy work then humanity  is shit .

My father says he do it for his  love ones , of being in pain for your love ones is what world preaches  as holy duty then all I want it to be disconnected  for my whole life , then I don't  want to love anyone .
If that is what life is  , I don't  want  this life 

All I want is either to be a robot or be dead . 

I don't see a point in friendship , either it gives you pain or it demands  something  from you  , I have never felt joy in friendship  

People call the world selfish , but ultimately  someone  is doing  something  for the ones they love , even the love for oneself is bullshit  , why to go through pain for love of self 

All I want is either elon musk implant some chip inside me or to Leave this world and never see any pathetic  souls chasing love 
 
The irony is if I kill my self , my father's love for us would be the biggest reason for that
