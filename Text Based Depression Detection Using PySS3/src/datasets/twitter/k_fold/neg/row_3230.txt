I really don't care much for my life anymoreI'm full of self-hatred. I'm constantly lonely and depressed. I have OCD and I'm constantly bombarded with evil thoughts. I'm single and at a shitty job, and I don't have enough energy and motivation to pursue my dreams anymore. I find some solace in Jesus, but it doesn't feel like enough sometimes. I just don't want to do this anymore. That's all.
