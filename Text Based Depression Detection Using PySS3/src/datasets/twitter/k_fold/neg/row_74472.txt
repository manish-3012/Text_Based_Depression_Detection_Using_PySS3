How do I tell my momI swallow a whole bottle of pills last night and also skit my wrists this morning. I decided that if these didnâ€™t work, which it seems like they wont, I would get help. To do that, I need to tell my parents so they can take me to the hospital. I donâ€™t know how to tell them though. They donâ€™t even know Iâ€™m depressed, much less that Iâ€™m on my third suicide attempt. How on Earth do I do this? Iâ€™m scared.
