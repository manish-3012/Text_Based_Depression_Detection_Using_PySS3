Double college drop out, my only goal in life is to dieI dropped out of college for the second time, I failed almost all classes. I didn't failed because I'm bad at it, I just hate college, I hate that after all this bullshit, all I'll get is going to be a shitty 9 to 5 boring job I'll despise, and if I don't have a diploma I'll end working in a shitty minimum wage job.

It makes me feel so guilty, my parents gave me everything I needed and I'm still a useless piece of crap, I can feel their disappointment. Family problems don't help either, they fight almost every day. 

I have no motivation to keep going, I've been wanting to kill myself for about 6 years now. I kept telling myself everything would get better, but it only gets worse. I have IBS and ADD and that just makes me hate everything even more. 

I'm planning on hanging myslf on a motel room, I wanted to do it at home in my bedroom, but I don't I don't want my mom to find me, she has a weak heart. And I know I'll provably traumatize the poor motel worker that finds me, but someone has to find me dead, I just don't want it to be my mother. 

I guess that makes me egotistical and pathetic, I don't disagree tbh. If you are reading this, thank you, this will probably be my last time I open myself to someone. And sorry for the bad english.
