goodbye reddit and/or worldIâ€™m standing on my roof. probably going to kill myself, but hereâ€™s some background for whatever reasonâ€”

My girlfriend just broke up with me, and my parents expect me to become a surgeon even though i know i donâ€™t have what it takes. too much work, too much everything. my parents are both wealthy and expect me to do better than them, even though I have trouble getting up half the time.

I have no time to relax, Iâ€™m so stressed. My friends are distant; they know somethingâ€™s wrong but are too apathetic to care otherwise.

I donâ€™t want this pressure anymore.

this isnâ€™t really a â€œconvince me otherwiseâ€ post; if i wanted some kind of help I wouldâ€™ve called a help line.

i donâ€™t want that. just someone to talk to for a little while, until i decide this chilly northeast air is getting a little too uncomfortable
