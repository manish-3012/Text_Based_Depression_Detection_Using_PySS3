Feeling like suicide is the eventual outcomeSo I struggled with depression when I was younger (13-17), and now I'm battling severe anxiety (23). The notion of suicide has always been in the back of my mind, and occasionally when I'm at a real low point, I feel really content with the idea, but it always feels like "not yet". I feel like eventually it will be the way I go, but it's not my time yet. I feel like a ticking time bomb, and I'm just going to self destruct at some point.

I'm not really sure why I'm posting on here. I guess I don't really have anyone to talk to, or people who won't judge.  I don't live in my home country, so when I talk to friends/family there, the only thing they say is move home, which I don't want to. Then I feel like I haven't developed strong enough relationships with people here to really open up. I have a boyfriend who is very supportive (encouraged me to seek professional help, which I am doing - just a 2-3 month waiting period), but he's on vacation right now, which was a birthday gift from me so he could see his friends, so I don't want to bother him with this now. I've just been so stressed and anxious the past weeks and need to tell someone. Even though the thought that "I don't want to be here anymore" is constant in my mind right now, it still feels like not yet. So I dunno if it's even worth posting on here. I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest.
