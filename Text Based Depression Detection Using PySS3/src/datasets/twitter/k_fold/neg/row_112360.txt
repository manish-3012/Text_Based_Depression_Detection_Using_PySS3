Sometimes, you just feel like such an ugly, pushover fuck of a cunt. I'm gonna make this as short as I can, but I'm sick of living. 

My life has already been predetermined, I'm in a school full of materialistic rich kids, all of which are getting high grades (since they study of course) and I'm just here failing, watching them all go infront of me soon becoming doctors/lawyers/businessmen etc. while I knew deep inside me for the past few years that I would soon end up an unemployed dib-shit living on the street, I always had some form of unrealistic ambition to have the life I wanted in my dream world, but this ain't it mother fucker, it's called real life. I'm socially awkward as fuck, bullied, hate being seen in public, and overall the situation is fucking annoying to accept but I need to. I also don't have any friends at all. 

I fucked over my IGCSE exams (Certificates of secondary education), banks chasing my family every day to pay off a $500,000 loan (plus other minor loans), after my term in school I might get transferred to a public school, afterwards I stop there.

My family has no money to afford me entering university neither am I deserving of it, I'm a coward, I never face my problems head on, I always escape because it's the easy way out, neither am I brave enough to pull the fucking trigger.

I have not made any memorable impact on anyone in my life, no one cares and I'm not even mad about it.

In case you need to know, I'm 16, please don't give me the "boy you still got a chance, look at Bill Gates!" Bill Gates worked his ass off to make Microsoft a success, this goes to all other "motivational examples", I didn't accomplish shit. 

Fuck this shit..
