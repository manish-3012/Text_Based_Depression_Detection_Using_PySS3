Fed upI've always battled with depression. This week has been tough. I'm a good person, I work hard, I treat everyone the way I wanted to be treated. But it's been a slog as of late. God bless my landlord, I still haven't been able to pay June's rent. My phone and Internet are about to get cut off. I work my ass off but still can't get ahead. For years now. And just when I thought I was making progress someone went ahead and made a fake facebook and tinder account that was very slanderous.  It's been taken down since but I have been living my life as a good person and can't for the life of me figure out who or why someone would do it. I had managed to compartmentalize all of the bad thoughts but as of late I cant. I woke my poor mother up at 4am last night with a panic attack. I have withdrawn every penny available to me from the bank and I think I am either going to end it or disappear. My only concern is what will happen to my poor cat. The fake facebook me bullshit has destroyed the compartments and I'm ready to just end it now. I don't contribute anything to society and I know some people will be sad when I'm gone but life goes on and I know the people I love will realize why and remember me fondly. Life has become overwhelming and I just can't deal anymore. I'm sorry to everyone I've ever hurt and will hurt by doing this but I see no other way.
