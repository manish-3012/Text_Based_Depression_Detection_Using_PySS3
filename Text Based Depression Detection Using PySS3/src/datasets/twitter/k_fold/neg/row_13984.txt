Iâ€™m not suicidal...Iâ€™m not depressed, or unhappy, or anything really. But lately I feel that the logical thing to do would be to cease existing. I wonder if the real crazy people are the ones who choose life. 
I donâ€™t want to die in the least. I want to choose to not exist. Does that make sense?
