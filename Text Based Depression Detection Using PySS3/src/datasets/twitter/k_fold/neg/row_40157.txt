I feel like I should kill myself sooner rather than laterI'm so scared that I'm gonna grow up, become a failure, underperform everyone's expectations of me, and finally kill myself. If I do it now everyone will just talk about how awful it was that I died young and how I could have done such great things if I had grown up. Everything seems to think that I'm going somewhere in life, but I'm not. I'm not as smart as people think and I'm too anxious and passive to get the things I really want in life. 

I don't have a gun right now, but, if I did, I think it only really take on more giant "fuck you" from life to make me go through with it. If I wait too long I'll be remembered as an even bigger piece of shit than I am now. I really don't want to hurt the people I care about by killing myself, but if it's gonna happen eventually, then why not sooner rather than later?
