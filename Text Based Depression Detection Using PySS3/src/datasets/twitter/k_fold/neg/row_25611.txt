Anyone seem to always have that inevitable day or two through the week or month that bring these thoughts on?I seem to be there. And it seems to be a very real phenomenon for me. Just for whatever reason it'll hit me that I'm miserable and I'll want to get away. The problem is is that on the days that I'm happy I feel in the back of my mind that I ought to be depressed. I should be feeling down. 

When I'm feeling like garbage, I truly feel at home if you will. I feel this is right. This is how you should feel. This is normal. This is natural. And I'll just sort of sink into this feeling as I'm doing now. A numbness sort of comes on and I feel like a radio station turned to static. I  feel completely lethargic. Almost like I'm meditating on emptiness. I could feel worse. I could feel better. I just want to sink into this misery further though. Like receding into my own mind. 

I think about falling and what that slight instantaneous moment as you hit the ground is like. There has to be a brief instant where you feel something. Probably like what it's like when you fall in a dream. You get that intense rush and then bang! You're awake. I can almost swear that I do feel something in those dreams. I bet that's what it's like. 

I kind of have a fear that once you die you immediately go into another form of existence. Like when you fall and "die" in your dream and wake up. Fuck that. I don't want to press my luck. I don't want a double or nothing. I want it to be over. 

Just kinda rambling which I normally do on this sub. Thanks for reading if you did
