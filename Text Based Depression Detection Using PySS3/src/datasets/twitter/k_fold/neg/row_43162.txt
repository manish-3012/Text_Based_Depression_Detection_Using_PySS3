hfdHow does one ingest sleeping pills in order for them to work (suicide)? I've heard Rob Dyke comment something on that topic (sarcastically ofc) that when you take sleeping pills (again, to kill yourself) you should take them every half an hour or so, so that you don't end up upsetting your stomach and throw up the undigested pills.
