I'm uselessI'm 14, and I genuinely have no talents at all. The only thing I enjoy is music, and I suck at it. I only get up because I have to go to school. I just waste hours watching shitty tv and movies. I have a great family but none of my friends hang out with me outside school and I always get the feeling they'd rather talk to someone else. I'm fairly certain if I had a gun I'd have shot myself by now.
