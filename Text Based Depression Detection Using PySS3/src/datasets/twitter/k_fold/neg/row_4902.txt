Difficult lifeHey suicidewatch, I have a story for you. 

My entire life has just been one fail after another. As of recently my brother committed suicide and this has brought to light all the feelings about death I've had my entire life. Since his death, I've moved across the USA, lost all my friends, started working at a dead end job. It has caused my girlfriend and I tons of problems. I just cannot see a way out, other than death. I have given this a lot of thought and have tried once this past week with cutting myself. I woke up in a bathtub with just red water. 

No one in my family knows about my problems dealing with this stuff other than my girlfriend. I have reached an end point. I have no idea what to do. I have no money, I have nothing anymore. My use of drugs has changed my view of the after life. I am not scared to die anymore either. Sorry that is post is all random and scattered i'm just at an end. I need help.
