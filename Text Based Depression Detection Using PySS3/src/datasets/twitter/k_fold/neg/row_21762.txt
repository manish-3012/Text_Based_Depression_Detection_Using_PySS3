Please Help MeI'm sorry. I don't mean to bother anyone, but if someone could read this I'd appreciate it. I have the means to hang myself with right now and I've been contemplating it for a very long time. I was and am rather upset and I started writing down my thoughts and feelings into a diary, and it made me realize that I want help. Please, let me reproduce my entry below. Please, please, talk to me.

&gt;I am, and remain to be, a horrible, horrible person. I am short tempered, mean, ugly, and selfish. And I want nothing more right now than to die. Since yesterday, all I have thought about has been about hanging myself. I've been planning out where I would do it, too. I thought about the closet. I've heard of people hanging themselves there, but I have no idea how to do that. It's simply not tall enough to hang me. The tree outside might work. I wonder if the branches are strong enough? Maybe. I also thought again about cutting. It seems like that would help me. It remains a siren's song, so tempting. The feel of a blade and knowing that I deserve the pain, if there is any. I don't deserve to live. I am a horrible person. Everyone would be thrilled if I died. They might have a party with lots of drinking and drugs. I would not be around anymore to stop them. I should call someone. I want to call Gregory, my love, but what would I say? He hates me. He, too, wants me dead. I want to die. It is the only way I know how to make other's happy. I will someday eat a bullet and there will be parties. They will laugh and sing.

&gt;I miss Gregory. I love and miss him. And he hates me. What if he came home and I was dead? Would he be happy? Apathetic? Thrilled? No more Jody being a bitch. No more me. No more me. No more me. no more me. No more me. No more me. I hate myself. I don't know what to do. The rope calls to me. Should I listen? If I were dead, everyone would be happy. Everyone would be happy. If I called, what would I say? If I told him my plan, he would hate me more. He'd hate that I bothered him with something as pointless as my life. I don't want him to hate me. Please don't hate me. PLEASE DON'T HATE ME. PLEASE! HELP ME! PLEASE HELP ME! PLEASE! I need help! I'm trapped! Help me! Please, help me! Please make this stop! I want to be happy again! I want to be Happy! I'm sorry. Please help me.
