What do I do now :(Throwaway because my friends and fiancee know my other username. 

I've tried to commit suicide twice because I have always felt wrong being on this planet. I literally feel like a different species because I am constantly misunderstood. I have either borderline personality or bipolar as well, so whoohoo! It's a party up there. I've been in therapy for almost a decade, including 1-1's, group therapy, DBT, 2 mental hospitals.

I'm gorgeous and people take it as an invitation to touch me and say weird things to me. I am transgender which seems to automatically invite all sorts of nasty and thoughtless conversations into my life. Where I pee is a fucking debate on this planet, when I can have surgery, whether my gender/name is real or not. People hit on me and then get offended when they learn of my dick. UGH. I hate nearly everyone on this planet, and I have no idea how people are so rude and thoughtless. 

The 20 minute commute to my school is seriously taking it's toll on me mentally. I've been in so many near accidents because people think driving is a fucking game where you have to win. I feel like I've been slowly developing PTSD or something because I am always tense, on edge, and constantly worried what stupid thing someone else will do.

I come home and my fiancee is tired from being at work, meanwhile I'm in school dicking around with my time taking classes that don't count toward my major. I'm bored. I can't seem to get the classes I need ever. I feel mentally unstimulated, like I'm forced to participate in this rat race drudgery for what? I'm close to getting a degree in mathematics but I don't fucking care. I'm sick of feeling useless because I'm waiting around for school to happen, meanwhile my girlfriend kills herself to make a living.

My cat, my girlfriend, and LSD are probably the only reasons I am still alive and haven't tried to kill myself again. In the year I've taken LSD, I've seriously contemplated suicide one time, compared to having these thoughts weekly before. It's let me orgasm again after estrogen nerfed that one,


I feel defective. Worn out. Forced to be here, go to college, kill myself slowly. An object. A number.

I feel like it's my right to die and no one respects that. I get guilt tripped into living.

I feel like LSD has done amazing things toward helping me accept who I am, but I can't have it because "drugs".

I feel like I have legitimately 100% tried therapy skills to be happy and they don't really help

I feel lonely even though I am surrounded by loved ones.

I want to drop out of college, move north, get a job outside, and be happy. I don't ever want to get into my car and be tense, packed into a city with 1 million people. I could give two shits if I have a college degree, I just want to be happy. I'm going to have a talk with my fiancee when she gets home, and then probably call my mom.

Moms are the best, seriously call them once in a while
