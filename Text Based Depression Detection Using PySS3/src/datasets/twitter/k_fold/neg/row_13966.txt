Can't stop thinking about it----Sigh.

The last couple months have been really hard. And the last few days have been miserable.

I can't stop thinking about killing myself. Dammit, just to do it to relieve the pressure. To know that I won't have to feel this way again.

I haven't planned it, or anything. I don't think I'm actually suicidal. But hell, I just want to die. I'm just so tired of feeling tired, stressed, questioning every decision I make. There are drastic choices I need to make soon that if I make the wrong ones, I might be pushed into homelessness. And I can't make them. I'm just stagnant. I just don't care about my future, at all, anymore.

The nights are the worst. I just lay in bed thinking about dying. I just want it all to end.
