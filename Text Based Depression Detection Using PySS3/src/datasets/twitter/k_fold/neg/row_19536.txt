Iâ€™m at my wits endI have an amazing life, good friends, good family support (for the most part), just got a useless degree but am going to go back to school for nursing but health wise Iâ€™m at my wits end. From other people Iâ€™m attractive and intelligent, but I hide a lot of my medical problems well. 

In 2016 I threw up after eating ice cream at Creamistry, while itâ€™s probably coincidence, I been chronically nauseated, migraine headaches, sensitive to smells ever since. I throw up 5 times a day for the most part, itâ€™s affecting my entire life. I went from not being able to smell anything to smelling everything, even smells people cannot normally smell. I have zero appetite and little motivation to keep going. Iâ€™m 24 with a whole life ahead of me, and life is hard as is, and I canâ€™t imagine living through my lifeâ€™s hardships also throwing up and trying to hide it. 

Also, I been to several doctors, specialists and now am going out of town to a renown clinic. I just hope they can give me a diagnosis and treatment, but itâ€™s so hard to just keep going and waiting for referrals and appointments, getting poked and prodded to find nothing wrong, trying medications that donâ€™t do anything. Itâ€™s at the point where Iâ€™d rather be put out of my misery than to be throwing up or feeling on the verge of it every waking second. Not to mention arthritis in my lower back from a car accident and psoriasis.
