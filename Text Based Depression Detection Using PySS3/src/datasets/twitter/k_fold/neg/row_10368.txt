Im at school but when i get out in 2 hours. Im leaving this world.I dont know what im doing anymore. i got kicked out of a regular school and now im at a disobedient school, my family in broken, my boyfriend doesnt care about me. I've asked for help but my mom wont let me see a therapist because she believes in "home remedies" which include smoking an insane about of pot, getting the munchies and sleeping. Ive started self harming again, the voices are telling me its over. The figures are dragging me closer and closer to the end and i cant take it anymore. I have no friends at all, so i dont have to write any notes. Im just done with life. Its done nothing but fuck me up since the day i was born. Even my mom told me im an accident.... Nobdy will notice im gone...
