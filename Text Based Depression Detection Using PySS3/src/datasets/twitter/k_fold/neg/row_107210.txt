hey guysLast night, I figured I should be a stand up guy and welcome my ex into her new home. I bought her a tea kettle with some flowers in there since she likes drinking tea. I also wrote a nice letter. I bought new clothes to see her that night, last night.

Me and a guy I sort of know we go and hop to a bar. We get very plastered and we're relating all this bullshit about our exes. Well, he shows me his workplace. He opened a window and he fell asleep with his burrito, and I looked outside contemplating suicide. We were up a skyscraper, and I really wanted to end all my anxiety tonight. It was just an hour or two ago that I really wanted to jump out onto this rooftop two stories below. I decided against it.

Well, we take a nap and drive home. Barely at the first light, a cop pulls my friend over. I'm looking over and over and seeing that he's really busted. He had to get out of his car and talk to a cop. The cop got another to come. I stayed as long as i could and just left a few seconds ago. I feel so fucking horrible; I don't think this will ever leave me. While driving home, I wished I should have just ended it and left it all behind me so that he didn't get a ticket. It would have been just one less thing. I feel so bad right now because he was drunk from some of the drinks I bought him. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

Is there anything I can do?!!!
