People asked me what college I wanted to go toI just came back from a friendsgiving party and all anyone could ask was what college I'm going to. I'm a senior so I understand why. I told them I'm not planning to go to school, and when they asked why, I laughed and said I'm going to be dead before then. It ruined the atmosphere. I felt the hush just go in a wave through the room. I hate feeling like this when I open up any little amount. Every single time, I can physically feel the pity just suffocate me. Need it to end as soon as possible.
