The Blaring Exit Sign - A Memoir to Departure.When I was a boy... The first thing I learned about anything was that my dad was not around. It was my grandmother that told me this. 
It's the very first memory I have of anyone telling me anything about who my parents were.
At the time, I never understood why. I was told he was on drugs, and that he couldn't help it.
I didn't understand what any of that meant until much later in my life.
When I was a boy... the first memory I have of my mother is her swearing at her alarm and telling me to go downstairs to my grandmother because she had to go.
I didn't even know who she was, but I remember feeling like she didn't like me very much.
I remember my grandmother and grandfather raising me. They gave me so much love and care, but I always felt cautious around them, like they would not entirely understand me. My grandmother tried her very best to understand, and what she was unable to understand, she was willing still to accept. I know this now, but I didn't know it back then. 
When I was a teenager, I had already had several experiences with other boys. I was hiding this fact at home, but expressing it at school, where I thought I was safe. I met a my first boyfriend in highschool and I was just happy to get some love from someone. It felt nice to be held and kissed by someone else. I would message this boy every day on myspace messenger, and we'd chat and talk about this and about that. Whatever 13 year olds chat about.
One day, my mother managed to break into my laptop and read those messages. She brough them to me like they were drugs. She printed them out and layed them infront of me and confronted me about them. I was being interrogated by her. I felt afraid. I was scared. I did not want to be rejected for this. I wanted to be accepted and understood. 
She played it cool, wanted me to admit it. I felt mortified to admit it. Absolutely terrified to say it outloud - but I risked it and told her the truth. That I thought I was bisexual, that I liked boys. 
For a few weeks everything was fine, she seemed to try to accept it and be okay with it. At some point though, I don't recall where we were... I remember she told me that I needed to listen to her when she told me to do something, or follow her orders when she directed me, or else she would tell Rita and Chris, my aunt and uncle whom I loved so much. She told me she would tell them, and that they would never let me near their children again. My little cousins, who I adored and loved spending time with. I learned to hide and bottle myself up so deep that I couldn't find it anymore. 
Over time spent like this, I learned that I didn't go after boys or gay men because I really enjoyed boys or gay men. I went after them because they were a source of affection I felt like I needed and I was never going to get anywhere else. When I found that girls could show that affection too, I was overwhelmed with joy at that fact because I realized I could actually get what I wanted.
I always looked for love with everyone I could. I wanted so badly to connect to anyone and everyone on that level. I didn't want to be rejected. I don't know if it's because I felt rejected by my mother, or because I never had a father -- but even my therapist concluded something I already knew; In his words: "You need a lot of love, James... So much love."
I was taken by those words, I never forgot them. I just nodded my head when he told me them and I felt like I had a way forward now, armed with this fact front and center in my mind.
So began my search for someone to love me and someone to love. I looked high and low. Near and far until I found it. I went through many heart-breaks to obtain it. I weathered many storms, and endured many nights. When I found her, I thought it was over. The hard part was over, and now all I had to do was build a life with her. I just needed to get to her first. I was so close. I had to keep going. 
When I met her, I remember feeling a sense of joy and overwhelming sadness because I had endured so much for that moment. I never wanted to let her go. After our first meeting, when I had to let her know, I cried my eyes out in the back seat of my best friend's car because I was just completely taken over by joy and sorrow. Pain and pleasure. I just could not bear it in that moment and I broke down in front of these people. 
By this point in the story, I had already moved several times in my life. I had lost friends over and over again from distance and separation. I hated the fact that I kept losing friends. I hated the fact that I never had a stable home. We moved again. From Kentucky, back to Virginia. I went from being 3 hours away to being 12 hours away from my love. We spent many nights on skype together. We'd video call and chat. It helped in its own way, but it also made it hurt so much worse at the same time. 
One day, for about a month, she came to visit me and stay with me at my mother's house. We spent so much time together. Every day was a new adventure. We'd stay up all night talking and laughing, kissing, holding each other. Making love, day dreaming. Taking pictures. She had to leave eventually, and when she did I took to the bottle to curb it. It was bitter-sweet. 
Maybe just a few weeks after this, I found something out... She had been talking with, meeting with. Kissing another person. Someone I hated. She did this behind my back, under my nose. She lied to my face about it when I asked her before finding out for sure. I wasn't just hurt. I was breaking apart as a person. Inside, I was shaking. I was falling into pieces of myself, those pieces were disintegrating in my hands. I was dying inside. I was furious. I was enraged. I could smell smoke. All I wanted was to burn this whole fucking world down. I had my heart broken so many times by this point, I was so plagued with self-doubt, self-hate. Feelings of not being good enough. I wasn't good enough for my Mother, I'm not good enough for my Dad. Im not good enough for this girl either. 
Thing's got complicated here... I was on so many drugs, I was snorting Klodopin and Xanax, smoking weed, cigarettes, drinking to excess. I was trying to not feel things. I was trying not to think. I was trying to forget every memory I made of this girl. I was trying to destroy myself as a person. I wanted to die, I wanted to die, I wanted to die. I wanted to die. I wanted to die so fucking bad but I was too much of a coward to just do it. To go play in traffic. To jump off the bridge. To drown myself. To overdose. To steal a gun and shoot myself. I never had the balls. I still had one tiny sliver of hope that kept me going. Because she would still talk to me. She would still call me. She still answered when I texted her. I wasn't thinking clearly here.
I hurt her so bad, over and over again. I don't remember by the time of me writing this, I dont remember ever doing it. But she has recordings, video, audio, and chatlogs, of me saying it. The things I did, the things I said. The things I threatened. I became the same kind of abusor to her that my mother was to me. Reel her in, throw her out. Reel her in, throw her out. Gain her trust; Destroy it. Rebuild it, break it. Break her down, build her up. 
This lasted longer than it should have, and one day she left. She got smart and she left me behind and I never could find her again.
...
Somehow, then, we got back together. The story is less than romantic this time around. I'm still increadibly bitter about everything that happened. I feel distant and detached from my own feelings. I dont even experience them as my own feelings anymore. My mind is so fractured by everything I had put up with that I Just couldn't feel the same way about her -- Or about anything.
I fell into this depression that I had a lot of trouble dealing with, and understanding, or even accepting was present. I had gotten so used to dealing with this every day that I just could not cope with having regular emotions anymore. When I was annoyed, I was enraged by it. When I was happy, I was overjoyed. When I was sad, I was breaking as a person. Serious mental dysfunction and mood swings. 
I remember driving home from work one day and thinking about gaining 120mph and slamming into a building to kill myself. I remember when I bought a shotgun to protect our house, I used to think about putting the barrel in my mouth and pulling the trigger, anytime something got me upset, or I felt like I coulnd't deal with it. There it was again.
The blaring exit sign. 
The bright red text spelling out "ABORT" in a bold font.
The guard rail down a flight of stairs out the side of a building.
Some years go by, and the man that my girl cheated on me with has died. He passed away from a drug over-dose. I felt sad, not for him dying, not for me losing him as a person I once knew, but because I knew my girl cared about this person. I knew It was hurting her. I hated him for dying just for this reason alone. I spoke at his funeral, I met his parents for the first time. I felt so broken by it, but so relieved... I'm still happy to this day that he's gone. I never tell anyone this, not even myself, not my spouse. No one. But I'm glad he's dead. The world is and always will be better off without him. 
She hears his voice now, talking to him. Manifest in a coping mechanism -- Hallucenations. She's fragmented as a person. She's not the same girl I fell in love with, or the one that broke my heart. I'm not the same man either. I'm weaker than I was at the start. Im broken too...
By this point, we've opened our relationship up sexually to other people; This after long discussions and talks about fetishes and weird interests. But, to be honest its all a coping strategy for me. I felt so insecure with her. I never felt like I'd be enough for her or anyone else. So I opened our relationship up just to never have to worry about it again. If there are no rules, you can't break them. I figure I'd spare myself the heartache. I didn't figure I would wander far, maybe I'd have a bit of fun with the odd one off partner now and again. It's been good so far I mean. We had some laughs with it. We've had fun. She never found a main-stay partner, or someone she really had the hots for, but there were a few people she's had sex with besides me while we've been together. I love seeing her happy and I know it makes her feel good, so I'm okay with it. I never told her this but It always made me feel empty as a person, but throwing those vows of intimacy away gave me a kind of catharsis. Reducing them to mean nothing made me feel less scared. Like a controlled demolition, sort of thing. 
I'm still with her but I don't really know why. Familiarity? Fear of being alone? No one has stuck by me for this long. I feel like I owe it to her. 
Fast foward to present day. We've moved again, from the last city to the new one here on the East Coast. I feel hopeful but still depressive most of the time. I'm learning to be a better me most days, and I'm finding Im able to make people laugh, and smile. I can bring joy to people's lives. It's all I really enjoy about work is making people smile. I rarely get to do it due to the nature of the work. There's a girl there I particularly like. She's so kind, and sweet, and funny, and she thinks I'm just hilarious. She thinks I'm amazing. She tells me about how I'm amazing and perfect, and that I make her laugh and feel things she's never felt before. She tells me how much I mean to her and that she doesn't want to lose me. We've hit it off real well. She kisses me in a way I haven't been kissed since I was 16. I feel like a kid again around her. She just makes my heart sing. I just want to show her the world - Take her places. Have her take me places.
But you know, my life so far, has been one great tragedy to the next. She's married. I know. I'm pathetic, and I have weak morals for participating in this. It's sad that I'm willing to accept scraps from this person. She's going to leave soon, with her husband, to the west coast. She'll probably never think about me again once she does go. 
My relationship with my girl is falling out from underneath me. I feel like its a hollow shell of what it could have been and never really was in the first place. I'm honestly okay with it at this point. She deserves a lot better than I could have ever provided; Weak as I am. She deserves to be happy. 
Between that, the fact that I think its beyond repair. That it'll never get better. This girl I like leaving. I feel like shes the one for me. The one I want. I can't have her. I'll never see her again.
There's that exit sign again.
I think I might see myself out this time. 

Thanks for 26 years of joy and pain. Thanks for everything everyone ever did for me to try to help. I'm sorry I'm throwing it all away. I'm sorry if this hurts you. I hope you forget me. I hope you don't think about me for very long. I hope some of you feel relieved at my absence. I hope you breathe a sigh of joy when you hear I'm gone.
I hope those that love me don't linger on my memory. I hope those that will miss me won't miss me long.
I love you all so much, but this world has been too much for me. It's been too much from start to finish. I just can't take much more of this.
