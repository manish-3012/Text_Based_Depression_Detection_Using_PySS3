So lost and alone...I've shared my life story on here multiple times before, and each time I get the same generic advice, that things are going to get better, etc etc.

This year, and this month in particular, has been hardest for me, and I feel like I'm about to hit rock bottom. The last couple nights, as I've laid in bed, my thoughts are pre-occupied with death and dying, running through mental scenarios of how, when, and where. Last night, I decided that maybe writing a 'fake' suicide note might act as a small catharsis. It was the first time I've felt any emotion for months. Looking over the note, I don't know whether or not to call it fake.

For the past two weeks, I've been wanting, hoping for something to happen to me, so that I don't have to be made to look like a coward, so maybe someone would care, or shed some fake sympathy over yet another statistic. 

The thoughts have been there for as long as I can remember, they've only grown worse and more frequent with time. Two months ago, I toyed around with the idea of stopping by a gun store I pass on my way to school each day, but now it's gotten to the point that I have to take a different, longer route to school so those thoughts dont start swirling around (as much).

I feel like an alcoholic or drug addict: I've been to counseling, I've taken meds, and I've combined the two. It's been a revolving door for me. Things get better for a short while, but I inevitably relapse. There's really no rehab for these thoughts, no 12-step program. I've tried multiple times, but I keep slipping. I'm tired of slipping. I just want to quit while I'm still slightly ahead.
