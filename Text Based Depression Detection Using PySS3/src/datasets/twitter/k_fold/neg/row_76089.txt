I am just tired.3 days from getting evicted from my apartment and all I can think about is 

I am tired. 

I want to die , but I don't want to kill myself 

I want friends, but I can't talk to people 

I want to be doing fucking something and not be in a shitty rut of feeling sorry for myself and not being able to anything about it. I want fucking something in my life to matter.  I want some kind of stability and somehow that is too much to ask for. Talking to people on the hotline is the same thing&gt; It gets better. Really? REALLY!? When the fuck does it get better? I tried to make to be better and yet I am still fucking here.
