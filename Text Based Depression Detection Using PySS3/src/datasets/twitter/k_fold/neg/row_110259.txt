Absolutely want to dieTerrible anxiety. I want to go and throw myself under a train. Found a reoccurring damp patch in my house and it makes me want to die. I want to be dead so desperately. But my girlfriend is with me and I love her so completely and she's been far too kind and patient with me. I can't live like this. I've ruined everything again. Part of me wants her to leave me so that I can kill myself.
