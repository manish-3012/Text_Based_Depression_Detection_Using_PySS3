I'm tired of being called a useless leechI recently began my first year of college. I am double majoring in Engineering and Software Engineering and I have a total of 17 credit hours this semester. I drive 40 minutes there and 40 back every schoolday,  then immediately go home and take online courses and do homework. After I am done with that I look for jobs online and I have applied to 8 in the last 2 days then I have to clean the house, do the dishes, coean bathrooms once a week, flip and fold clothes, and do whatever random task my father assigns. I am watched on cameras to make sure I do this.

I got my learners and was taught to drive by being made to drive 4 hours straight on the freeway on a round trip. There was a 2 week period between when I was first taken out to drive and when I got my liscense. This was a month ago

After I do all of my chores and homework I have to try to figure out dinner, because sometimes I am made to cook it, sometimes ny dad makes it and gets mad if we ate without him (even if he gets off at 9-10), and sometimes he treats me like I am retarded when I ask about dinner.

I have to pay around 300-400 a month in gas and insurance on the spare truck I am allowed to drive, hence why I am getting a job. Everyday I am told that I am useless, a leech, a faggot, and a mistake. It fucking hurts. 

I have 1 friend, and him and his family have offered to let me live with them. But I could never do that. I would be a burden and anytime I stay close to somebody for an extended period of time they leave me... Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get that out somewhere.
