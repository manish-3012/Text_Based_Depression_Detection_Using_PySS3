thoughts at 3amI donâ€™t even see the fucking point of going on with life, not because of the quarantine. But i just literally have no reason anymore i donâ€™t have any friends just people that talk to me out of pity, iâ€™ve never had any social interaction for 3 years staying at home and doing nothing with my life. I come home, eat cup noodles and sleep. The only thing keeping me alive is how painful itâ€™d be to actually die and people nonstop making fun of me and I try making friends but since of my lack of social talking and my lack of going to school made me lack motivation with strict parents that keeping me inside because theyâ€™re scared of my asthma attacks and panic attacks. But iâ€™ll keep going because I donâ€™t want them to think itâ€™s their fault I died thanks for listening
