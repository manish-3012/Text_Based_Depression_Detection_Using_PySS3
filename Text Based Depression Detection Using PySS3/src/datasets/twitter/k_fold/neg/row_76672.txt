I'm basically a failure, lately nothing has been working out for me and the suicidal thoughts have been getting stronger2019 has been such a bad year. Nothing has worked out, I've lost everything important to me. I have been failing career wise, relationships wise and on a personal level. I don't even know what I want anymore. I keep having vivid and intrusive images of me committing suicide and I fear I edge closer to making that a reality everyday. I just wanted to vent, sorry for bothering you all.
