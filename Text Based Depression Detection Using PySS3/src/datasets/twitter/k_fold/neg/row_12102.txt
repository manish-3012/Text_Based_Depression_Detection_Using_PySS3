I'm not going to off myselfMy grand dad did that.  I won't let my mother lose her father and her son to the same thing.  But I am completely fucked right now.  Everything in my life is wrong.  I've failed out of college, I've gained 20 lbs back off of the 50 I put so much work into losing, I can't find a job, I'm still hung up on an ex.  I'm lower now than I've ever been.  I don't want sympathy or "it'll get better" crap, but I would love some links to motivational videos, cute pictures, or any other crap that brings you up when you're down.
