I was going to kill myself a few weeks agoSo as the title says near the begging of November I took my belt and tried to hand myself. I was using my door so I wasnâ€™t hanging completely, I was in a sort of sitting  position but my ass was not reaching the floor (about a foot about my floor). I was hanging for about Iâ€™d say 25-35 till I stopped because of the pain. I put all my weight on my neck and was making sure I wasnâ€™t supported by anything. I felt my head feeling like it was literally going to explode, and my eyes felt like  they would pop out. I was expecting to pass out a lot quicker within 10 seconds. What went wrong? I read stories of people who say itâ€™s painless and quick n peaceful, but as from my experience it was not. Kinda just waiting for the next opportunity to show itself :)
