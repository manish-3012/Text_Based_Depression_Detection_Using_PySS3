I feel like a drain on society.For a while now I feel like I'm not contributing anything to the world. Every few weeks or so, I'll get the inevitable question, "When are you going to do something with your life?" And my answer is always the same. I don't know. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I have no ambition in life. I don't want anything besides my basic human needs and therefore I'm not striving for anything. Sometimes I feel like it would just be easier to end it. Stop draining resources because I'm not being productive. I feel like every day I'm living is one less day that someone else could be.
