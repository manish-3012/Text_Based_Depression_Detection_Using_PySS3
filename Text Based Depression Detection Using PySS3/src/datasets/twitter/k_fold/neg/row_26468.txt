Probably going to die alone. Better to end it nowIm an Indian 20 year old male. I honestly believe that I am going to die alone or die a virgin. I believe this because I feel that im so ugly that I'll never be in a relationship. My friends have told me that im the suitable height and I would look better if i made my hair look better. Even my gay friend said im fine but I still feel I look ugly. I tried using tinder where i got 3 matches but then i quit it after finding out you cant spam the like button. During that period of tinder I found out 

Still after all this i keep thinking im going to die alone. Its probs better to end it now imo. Indian males are probs viewed on by society as perverts and no one cares about us. Even the sjws.
