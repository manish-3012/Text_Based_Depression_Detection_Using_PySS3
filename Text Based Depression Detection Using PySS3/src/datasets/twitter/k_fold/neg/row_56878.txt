Please not again not again not againI was feeling kind of okay for the past days and then suddenly today it all hit me again and it sucks how slowly you start to go back to that dark place where nothing is clear and you know is a matter of time before youâ€™re back there with no warning. 

Iâ€™m crying and seeing that other people go through life and suffer makes me cry even harder. Iâ€™m so sorry anyone has to feel like this, Iâ€™m so sorry, you donâ€™t deserve it. It hurts too much and Iâ€™m sorry someone else is hurting like this because it hurts like a bitch. It shouldnâ€™t have to be this hard. Why do we have to be in so much pain? I hate it I hate it and I hate that so many people feel like this!

I just donâ€™t want to be in this dark place anymore. I donâ€™t know if I want to die, I donâ€™t know if I want to live. It shouldnâ€™t be so hard to make that decision. Iâ€™m so exhausted, I swear Iâ€™m in so much pain I canâ€™t help but cry. And cry. And then cry some more until I give myself a headache.
