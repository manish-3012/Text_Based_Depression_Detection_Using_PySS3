It's Really Sad My Life Is OverWhen I was younger I thought things in adulthood would work out because the adults I knew seemed to survive okay. All were married with or without children and had friends and decent lives.

But it's different for me. There is no hope any longer. I've been an "adult" for a few years now in my twenties but I see that life will never ever improve. I will never have a romantic partner or a family. I will never make friends or have a social life. I will never be happy.

The only reason I say "it's sad" is because it didn't have to be this way. But maybe it did? Perhaps my specific combination of traits is incompatible with life. 

This has to be the end. If not now, when? Why bother to fight this for any longer for any reason.
