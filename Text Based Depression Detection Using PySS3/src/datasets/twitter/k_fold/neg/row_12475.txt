I still miss herSorry for anyone who doesnâ€™t care this is the only way I can vent 

So back in 2016 I had my first girlfriend who I caught feelings for really quickly, everything was great for 5 months but on The 27th of August 2016 I made a decision that I would regret 

I broke up with her because I didnâ€™t want to be â€œconstantly botheredâ€ because this was when I had finally saved up enough money to buy a computer and I was just caught up in it 

Iâ€™m so fucking selfish itâ€™s actually sad 

I later realised my mistake only for her to reject my apology because she had started talking to someone new. 

Ever since then I have been nothing but depressed and I still miss her to this day.

I graduated last year and still donâ€™t have a job, all friends have basically left because of how fucking pathetic I am because I didnâ€™t speak to them over the Christmas holidays and think Iâ€™m a loser.

Serves me right for being a scumbag 

I donâ€™t know what to do guys I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to or anything, my parents wouldnâ€™t understand because I told them how much she was in the wrong and they believe a pathetic self centred loser who hasnâ€™t had a girlfriend since I was 14 

Iâ€™m sorry
