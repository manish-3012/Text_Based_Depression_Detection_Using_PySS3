Need someone to talk to.As the title says it all I can explain in a little more detail. My father just recently passed away and I'm stuck at this crossroad in my life and have nowhere to go. Every time I take a step forward I take ten steps back, I'm just lost and getting closer to suicide. So I don't really care if this just gets lost. Just needed somewhere to vent.
