Nobody should care if a looser diesI've been a looser since I was little. There was nothing i was good at, not even talking to other people. I'm kinda poor, I'm ugly, I can't hold a conversation because of anxiety, everybody picks on me. Why would I live? Why? Reading a lot about people who did incredible deeds and thinking you will do that is pure fantasy, at least for me. I've been average or below at everything. I think I don't even have the guts to kill myself even if I contemplated it for such a long time. Live for what? Just to occupy space? For fuck's sake. Today when I was crossing the street I stopped in front of a car hoping it would not brake and hit me, end all of this shit. 

You know what will happen if I die tonight? My mother and father would probably cry and that's it. People would just front that they miss me and how it was such a tragedy. The end. I'm not expecting simpathy, but these things just emphasizes how worhtless I am. I don't even know why I'm posting this here. For what? Stranger's simpathy?Feeling good that there are people I'll never meet that care about some random guy's life?
