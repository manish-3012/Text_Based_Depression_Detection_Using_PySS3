I've relapsedHey, first time posting, sucks it has to be here. I'm 18 almost 19. I probably started cutting when I was 14 years old. I'd say my life is pretty decent, only thing is I feel lonely. I have no one to talk to in my house, I'm the only boy in a house full of women. So, If I have "manly issues" I need to talk about, I have no one to talk to. I love life, but I can't help but think that if I were gone it'd be all better. I am trapped in my room most, if not, all the time. Every other week I go see my friend cause my mom wants the house to herself. I just don't know what to do. I feel like a trophy, I'm just used when my mom wants to tell people I'm her only son, or when "manly" things need to be done around the house. I just don't want to feel this way anymore. Funny thing is, I want people to want me, but I constantly push them away because in the back of my mind I'm always thinking about when I die. Everyone thinks I'm selfish because I keep to myself. I'm just sad. Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I just don't want to feel this way anymore. To stop myself from feeling like this, I started cutting again, and it makes me feel better for a short while. I need help
