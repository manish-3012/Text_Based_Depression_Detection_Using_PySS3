What's the point of all of this? Life just feel monotonousAnd it's not just quarantine. Somehow I always feel like something is missing or lacking. Even when I'm enjoying something, it feels like I'm displaced. Before Covid and I used to hangout with friends, we would have an amazing time but somehow it always eventually hit me that this was all just a blink in our life spans. When I used to go outside, I would always feel like I should be somewhere else, there was more to life-even if I was having a pretty exciting experiences. When I am on conference calls or such-nothing feels real, all these interactions are calculated and really whats the point of doing a stupid fundraising call for some organizing. When I study (and I love studying and finding out new things), it just feels like there's so much information out there and i'll never be able to learn all of it.

I dunno, everything, even things I love just lose their meaning. society is a pile of shit. I've always felt this way and it's only gotten worse due to COVID.
