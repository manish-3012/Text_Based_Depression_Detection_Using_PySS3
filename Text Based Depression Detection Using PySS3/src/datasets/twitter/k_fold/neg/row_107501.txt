My life is fâ€™d iâ€™m so tired, I donâ€™t want to do this anymoreMy boyfriend and I have been going through a tough spot the past few months. We were on a break and I was really depressed and suicidal, telling him some stuff over text that warranted an emergency protective order. We ended up fixing things and are in a better place, but I had to go to court for the protective order and I have  to go to mental court, probation, domestic violence rehab, and do community service. On top of that I have to pay 2k for all this, which I donâ€™t have. 

I donâ€™t drive so I have my mom drive me everywhere. Sheâ€™s narcissistic and iâ€™ve had to deal with her abuse all my life and iâ€™m so tired of it. I tried to get my license, but I needed her to put me on her insurance, which i asked countless times and she refused to, then she complains why she has to keep driving me everywhere even though i could have been driving myself by now, but I had to miss my test because of her. 

Not to mention I have problems keeping a job because all I can get are retail and I have a spine condition that causes my back to hurt immensely no matter what I do. I canâ€™t stand for long periods of time without crying and becoming more depressed. I hate interacting with people because of anxiety. Iâ€™ve been studying to get my computer repair certification, but whatâ€™s the point anymore. 

I donâ€™t want to deal with all this bs anymore. Im tired of memories haunting me, dealing with my mom, all this court stuff. I just want to die peacefully and not deal with anything hurting me anymore.
