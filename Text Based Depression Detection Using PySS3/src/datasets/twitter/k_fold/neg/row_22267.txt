i want to die because i lost all my friendsLost all my friends due to mental illness, isolation, anger fits, etc. Usually my mom would exasperate things and make me want to completely die but she has been so patient with me lately.. i actually want to live because of her.. 
Finding out all your 'friends' turned against you is the saddest thing that i have to relive over and over again in my life. it's a big trigger for me because i was ostracized so badly in middle school, any sight of being left out really hurts me. and so last night i found out they all went to a friendsgiving without me.. 
It's my fault for neglecting my friendships in the last two years due to deep depression/ other issues etc etc etc 
In the end everything is my fault.
i lost my longest friend in my life this year too. 
I need strength to stay alive for the mom.. but i'm afraid i don't have it in me. :'(
