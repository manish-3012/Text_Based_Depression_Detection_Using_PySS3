Afraid that Iâ€™m not going to go through with it...Iâ€™ve had a 2 attempts in the past. Both times just ended up with me in a mental hospital pretending to be all better so theyâ€™d let me out of that prison. Nothing but regrets over not picking a method that actually killed me. 

The first attempt was an overdose on Xanax and vodka. In those moments before I lost consciousness I actually felt relieved and dare I say even happy. Then I woke up in the psych ward. 

The second attempt was to buy a gun and shoot myself. I was an idiot and called the hotline thinking I might be able to talk to someone, anyone. They sent the police. Got handcuffed and thrown in the back of the cruiser then taken to another ward. 

Itâ€™s been about three years since the second attempt and there hasnâ€™t been a day where I donâ€™t regret still being alive. The â€œdeadlineâ€ (heh) that I gave myself after I was discharged the second time was that if I turn 25 and still wanted to die, then I should go through with it. Well guess whatâ€™s in a month?

So Iâ€™ve been doing lots and lots and lots of research and I think the best solution for my situation would be a short drop hanging. I live alone so thereâ€™d be basically zero risk of anyone finding me. I also figure Iâ€™ll take a bunch of Xanax and alcohol again just before slipping on the noose to dampen any survival instincts my stupid body might do. 

As for the title, Iâ€™ve honestly been feeling pretty good these past few days and the noose thatâ€™s hanging from my bathroom door rn doesnâ€™t feel so appealing and Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™m not going to follow through with it AGAIN. Despite wanting to die more than anything, Iâ€™m too much of a coward I guess. 

Any advice?

PS please donâ€™t copy paste the hotline or tell me to go see a therapist. I am NOT going back to a ward.
