So I read through r/collapse late last night and now I feel like the only way out of a life of misery and suffering is just to do myself in now.I've had a long history of suicidal ideation and attempts, as well as severe depression and anxiety since my early teens. And that still kind of keeps me stuck in a shitty life -- I have only a handful of not very close friends, no relationships, poor ties with family, a crappy job, and a pointless art degree and career that pretty much makes me useless to the world.

And now r/collapse has made it clear to me that what I deal with now will probably be the best time of my life, compared to a future of suffocating and starving slowly in a fascist government. And all I can do is just watch in helpless solitude as everything goes up in flames.  A few posts even talked up suicide as a positive thing in such a situation.

That was late last night and I had some nightmares -- like the kind where you wake up in a cold sweat repeatedly. I feel completely fucked.

Honestly I'm just a waste of oxygen and resources. I'm not really worth anyone's time as I am now. And everything just seems to helpless and my life has been hell anyway. I'm sitting here with a bottle of ibuprofin that I was going to down. I chickened out and ate only five and got scared. Deep down I really don't want to do this but I feel like there's no other option.

I don't know why I'm posting this. This probably sounds insane. I guess I just need someone to talk to. I need help...
