Give me a good reason that life is worth livingBecause I cannot see one. I am not special or important. I will do nothing spectacular with my life. And even if I come to peace with that, life has no overarching meaning. So why should I stay alive when there is so much pain? I do not think I should. I think I should solve this problem once and for all. Iâ€™m in my third depressive episode. I can go to work and act normal, but the ideation is constantly here. I hate my body and I hate the work it takes to be â€œbetter.â€ And by better, I believe I mean deluded. Fuck this.
