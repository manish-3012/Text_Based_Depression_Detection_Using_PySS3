Give me one good fucking reason why I shouldnâ€™t jump off a bridge.Let me start off by saying I feel like my entire life after 12 years of age was just plagued in fucking misery. I have a obvious physical deformation that I constantly get made fun of for and it has led me to feel extremely insecure about the way I look, and until this fucking day (Iâ€™m in my early 20s) I still feel extremely insecure because of this physical deformation. I used to get bullied every single fucking day throughout middle and high school for this physical deformation that I fucking had that was so clear on my face. It affected me socially and I was hesitant to apply for jobs because I was limited to the positions I felt comfortable applying for. Fast forward to when Iâ€™m 18, my mom dies of cancer on the day of my best friendâ€™s birthday, a day which is supposed to be celebrated and filled with laugher, but instead I cried my fucking balls off and was handed a side of fucking depression. This was also around the time that I had broken up with my ex girlfriend and I was just in so much emotional pain. I dropped all of my courses and didnâ€™t return to school for another year and a half. When I saw my friends graduation and enjoying their lives, I was put on academic probation. I bounced back after a year and I havenâ€™t failed a class since, but I met this girl and we hit it really off really good for a year but until recently she really started letting me know how big of a fucking burden and how I annoying I am in her life and every-time I would make the effort to go see her, she would fucking tell me that Iâ€™m taking up her fucking time and that Iâ€™m fucking annoying for coming up. The depression that I thought I had overcome crept back up and hit me even harder than ever. I donâ€™t even want to fucking live anymore, I get told Iâ€™m a fucking burden and a nuisance by the girl I like &amp; my dad tells me Iâ€™m never going to amount to anything and I canâ€™t even think of a name when asked â€œwho do you go to for emotional supportâ€. Iâ€™m a fucking failure and I just want to fucking die, itâ€™s not like anyone fucking cares
