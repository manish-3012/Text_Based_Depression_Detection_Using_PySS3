Iâ€™m so fuckedIâ€™m losing my mind Iâ€™m 18 years old going on 19 in 2020 and I canâ€™t list the sexual assault and emotional/verbal assault my family has thrown me into. They refused to let me get a job at 16 because I had to focus on school. Iâ€™m in a ldr with a 20 year old who put me through a year of emotional neglect and told me it was my fault he wasnâ€™t emotionally there for me. Itâ€™s been a year now and heâ€™s made a bit of a difference and has tried to be here romantically with me but overall heâ€™s helped me with coming to accept that my parents are a dead end for emotional support and love. I canâ€™t get a job because I donâ€™t have any experience and my parents say no one will hire me because depression and anxiety are on my records along with a past suicide attempt. My dad said I have to go back to college and live with him until I finish college if I donâ€™t get a job in two months. I fucking canâ€™t go to college I canâ€™t be here for four more years. Hell I tried doordash but whoops too many people work for them now. I know my parents will kick me out if I donâ€™t listen or if I deny them anything so I canâ€™t just say no to college. If I canâ€™t find a job I have to end it itâ€™s my only option.
