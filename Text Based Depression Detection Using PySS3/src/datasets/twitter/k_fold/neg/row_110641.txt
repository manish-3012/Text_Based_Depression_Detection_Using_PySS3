EmotionsI've just recently turned 18 and I don't feel emotions anymore. The happiness of my life slowly dwindled away when I moved out at 15. I had loved a woman for 3 years but on the 4th year I felt nothing. We broke up soon after the fourth year mark of our relationship. When I'm with friends I try to act as if nothing's wrong but right below the thin surface I'm not having fun. I'm not truly laughing alongside them. The only thing I can think of now is taking my life. What's life without the emotions needed for connections? I can't cope with this life anymore. I'd appreciate any suggestions for anything. This is my first post on Reddit and I'm not sure what I'm expecting. I thought strangers would be the easiest to approach.
