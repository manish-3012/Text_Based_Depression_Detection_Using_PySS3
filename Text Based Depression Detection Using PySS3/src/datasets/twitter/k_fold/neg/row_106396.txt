No one cares about mePeople donâ€™t care about my life. Is it caring if you are raped and abused and they laugh and make fun of you for it. Is it caring if you try to get help and are disbelieved or again made fun of. Is it caring if you set a boundary and they donâ€™t respect it. How can I live my life with zero support. The only time ppl are nice to me is if I act like Iâ€™m some type of one dimensional being without feelings or humanity. People are such scum. They victim blame victim blame victim blame and ridicule you. What the fuck bother even being alive itâ€™s all pain and suffering no one will ever respect me or want me as part of their life with mutual respect and support. Itâ€™s always toxic and cloudy and Iâ€™m sick of being mistreated and trying to get help and being mistreated some more. Ppl are fucked up.
