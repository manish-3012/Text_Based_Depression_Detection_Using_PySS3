My feelingsI feel unwanted, like I'm a waste of space with no impact at all. I don't know about suicide but I know that I'm unloved and not special or talented in any way. I'm just a bunch of hopeless, non-impactful particles floating along ready to solve away in a useless job forever. I pour my feeling and my heart out to my girlfriend and she gives me nothing. She shuns me, she closes me off just because she's mildly annoyed. My parents don't care for me one little bit, my friends are all gone. I have nothing left and I don't k ow what to do.
