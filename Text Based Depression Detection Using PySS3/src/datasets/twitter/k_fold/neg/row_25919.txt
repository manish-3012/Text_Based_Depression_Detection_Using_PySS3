It gets better, but you have to be alive to see itI know people keep saying it gets better, and at some point that becomes hard to believe. But if you're at a point where things can't get any worse, you've hit rock bottom, it means its going to get better. My dad passed away few months ago, i dropped out of college, my boyfriend broke up with me and life is messed up in general. My best friend told me this "someone always has it better than you, but that also means someone has it worse. Things always get better, but you have to be alive to see it" and I've held onto these words. For all of you out there going through some difficult times, please take care of your health and focus on your work. Things will fall into place eventually. Good times are on the way!
