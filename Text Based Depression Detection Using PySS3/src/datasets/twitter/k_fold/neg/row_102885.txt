Need brutal honestySo Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that Iâ€™m a leech and a parasite and am friends with losers. To change my life (which I believe is possible with hard work and effort) I want to change but itâ€™ll take so long and Iâ€™m so goddamn lazy thatâ€™s the truth Iâ€™m drinking rn contemplating if I should hang myself tonight. I constantly feel suicidal if Iâ€™m sober and I do the same shit everyday expecting changes. I need to get off my ass but why bother idk what Iâ€™m asking. This is natural selection at its finest lol
