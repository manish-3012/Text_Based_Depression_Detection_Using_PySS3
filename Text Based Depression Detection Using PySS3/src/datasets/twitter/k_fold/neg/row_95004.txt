Just need a little support...Hi, so I'm new here. I looked very briefly at the rules and will do my best to follow them, but please let me know if I say something wrong.

I have had suicidal ideation since I was 13, which is a decade now. It's just a side effect of the depression, so I'm used to it. I've learned a lot of coping skills and am really good at controlling it these days. I've actually been doing really well lately, and it hasn't exactly crossed my mind for a few months. But a couple of weeks ago, a friend of mine had a brother who committed suicide. It was brutal on the whole family, and she and I haven't talked in a while so I offered condolences and kept my distance. Today, I heard about another aquaintence whose boyfriend committed this weekend. She and I haven't been close in a while either, so again, offer my condolences and stay at bay. Honestly though? I'm having a really hard time coping. I've always been quick to trigger when it comes to hearing about someone else who did it. I was surprised that I handled the first one so well as I did, but this one is making things difficult. I just feel...off. Like, a little dissociative, and more apathetic than usual. I'm afraid of what's going on underneath it all as the emotions bubble their way to the surface. I don't want to tell anyone I know because everyone is (understandbly) on high alert for copycats around here, and I know I fall high on the concern list for many of my loved ones. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest somewhere that won't judge me or worry about me, but that will understand what I mean when I say these things. I feel guilty, like I'm making these tragedies about me when they aren't even really mine, but I also know that it's perfectly valid with someone with my history to be struggling right now. I guess I just need some reassurance that I'm not alone here.
