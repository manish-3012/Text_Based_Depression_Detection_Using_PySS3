not suicidal but also not NOT suicidalI'm honestly at the worst point in my life so far. I'm a 16 year old girl and I just started my junior year online and I don't think I'm going to make it through. like not necessarily suicide but I have this feeling that something really bad will happen due to the stress. I'm mentally ill and stopped taking my medication at the beginning of summer and it destroyed me. I'm back on more two meds now but it's not helping and I'm just scared for myself. I've been fighting with my parents more and more and honestly I just want to die sometimes... I don't think I will do anything and I feel guilty just THINKING that because my best friend lost his father to suicide in may and it was really bad for him. Like I could never kill myself knowing that he would lose his best friend when he already lost his father. But yeah I just have this feeling I'm going to actually have a breakdown soon. sorry I'm rambling
