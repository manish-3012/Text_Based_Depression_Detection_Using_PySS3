Someone should hang me.Nah deadass though, iâ€™m tired of living. Everyday is a living nightmare, the fact is, nobody gives a fuck about me. Iâ€™m tired and tired of telling myself shit will heal because it wonâ€™t. Friends and family donâ€™t understand shit about me and itâ€™s so sad. I get left out of shit all the time like iâ€™m nothing. iâ€™m just convinced at this point people only care about me when iâ€™m dead in a coffin. itâ€™s not normal for a person to have suicide on their mind 24/7 and want to die. iâ€™m also ugly, a piece of shit, worthless, useless, and every derogatory term you could think of. my soul feels dead and iâ€™m just mentally drained. i see no joy in life no more, everyone and everything is the same to me. i shouldnâ€™t be comparing my life to others, but it seems like everyoneâ€™s lives is filled with happiness and joy. while me on the other hand, it is boring and depressing. i never felt so empty and alone in my life dude, itâ€™s like everyone hates me. honestly i donâ€™t care about anything anymore, just someone kill me so i donâ€™t have to see another light of day.
