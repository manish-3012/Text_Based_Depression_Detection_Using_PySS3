I want to go backNot feeling entirely suicidal today. Just thinking. I want to go back and change so many mistakes, and make things so that I didnâ€™t feel bad every day about all sorts of things. I wish I could go back knowing what I know now. Only thing is, I would be saying goodbye to the people I know now as they are. Things certainly wonâ€™t be the same, and maybe id miss out on meeting some super important people. I feel trapped, and I donâ€™t know how to move forward and want to go back.
