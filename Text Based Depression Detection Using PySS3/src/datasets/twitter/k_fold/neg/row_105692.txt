What do you try to live for when you have nothing?I think my 5 year relationship is coming to an end because I haven't been able to break out of my depression and my SO is sick of it. I don't blame him. But I have no family, and I have very few friends; most of them spread out across the country, far from where I am. I don't have much money, I'm still in student debt, so splitting with my SO is going to be difficult on many levels. I'm almost 30 and trying to start my life over at this point seems impossibly difficult.

I'm trying to think of a reason to keep living, but coming up with nothing.
