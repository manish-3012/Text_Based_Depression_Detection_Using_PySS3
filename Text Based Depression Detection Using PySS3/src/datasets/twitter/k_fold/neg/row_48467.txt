I Want to Die, but I Don't Want To Kill MyselfI want my parents to suffer. I want to die by my own hands, and have them know that my death is on them. It might have been my hands that ended it, but they may as well have given me the knife. I can take care of myself. I cook for myself. I clean after myself. I care about my own future, and I managed to work real fucking hard so that I don't have to pay a dime for my first two years of college. I have a part time job, but I don't have enough to move out. Plus, I would be a disgrace if I did because a good, Pakistani girl does not move out until she is married. I want to tell them I want to kill myself because of them. They deserve to feel guilt. They deserve to feel every bit of what they make me feel.
