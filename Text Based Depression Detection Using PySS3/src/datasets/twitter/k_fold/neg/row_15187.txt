I might kill myselfI used to have a plan, that the day my mother died I would too. I met friends finally and that plan was abandoned since I found other people to live for. I had long since accepted that I would do it someday. "I will kill myself" was how I talked. Someone I met in May has changed me more. Now it's "might".
