HelpI really need help guys. I don't know how common this thought is but i don't really want to die....i am just so angry and upset and ashamed of myself that it seems like the only way to end these feelings. My life has gone downhill a lot the past 6 months and now my ex gf wants nothing to do with me, my relationship with my parents is strained, my grades are terrible and i don't think there is any chance of me getting into the masters program i want. I just want this to be done. Everyday is painful. Even now that i'm on anti anxiety medication, i just can't seem to focus enough to pull my life together. It would just be so easy to kill myself, even though i'm scared too.

Any help is sooo greatly appreciated &lt;3
