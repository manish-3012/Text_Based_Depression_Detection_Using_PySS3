People don't understandI don't think anyone realizes just how serious I am when I say I want to shoot myself, I don't know if it's because of how my generation uses suicide as a joke or if it's because I usually seem like a generally happy person. Just because I'm unhappy and wish I never existed doesn't mean I need to make other people's lives horrible.

I use music as a way to escape my horrible thoughts but my mother has taken away almost everything...including my phone - which has all my music. Without it I've been forced to really just sit and stew in this pile of self hate and thinking about ways I could kill myself, at this point I don't care if it hurts or not just as long as it does it's job and kills me I'm good.

Saddest part is, we have a handgun in the house and I know exactly where it is but I'm to much of a coward to go shoot myself. What if I shoot myself and fail and my mother finds me and then I have to deal with all these other problems? I'm not scared of the dying part...I'm scared of the failing and having to live afterwards....wish I could just grab the gun and drive to a deserted field and shoot myself, if the bullet doesn't do the job then the animals that come to eat me will.
