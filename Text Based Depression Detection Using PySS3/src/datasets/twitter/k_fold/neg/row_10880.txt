STOP IT, things will not get betterIm tired of hearing that shit, i have no future the only thing i ever wanted to do is now just a dream, the only women i ve ever cared about doesnt give a fuck about me, i cant even get out of my house without having a panic attack, its been 12 long years of people telling me it will get better, im taking a shit ton of meds that just keep me like a fucking zombie, i lost all my friends cause i cant leave my house.

It will NOT get better, unless i get brain washed to let go of my dreams and stupid fantasies,i dont have a job and dont want one, just to be another mediocre human-being living a lie telling himself that "its fine" , dont have a girl and dont want one if its not her, i cant be with someone else, call it it whatever you want but ive been in love with her for 17 years.

IT WONT GET BETTER, give me one godamn reason and stop repeating the same crap, some of us are just born or become fucked up people, we cease to function and simply lose purpose.

Im certain my life will end with me killing myself or in some mental institution, its just stupid to read a story that you know its gonna end in tragedy
