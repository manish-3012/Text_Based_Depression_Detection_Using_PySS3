Doing it todayI got into a long fight yesterday with my mom because I aparently am a loser and i know it.
The guy who was right for me, the gem in a sea of durt of guys, decided that he didn't want to be with me. I don't even do anything- I have a meh job and don't do anything outside of work- have no social life - no friends. I can barely do my job at work.

I'm average looking, offer nothing to anyone. I'm no prize, just a lacking, sad person who can't make changes. 

So, I'm killing myself tonight because there's no point when you'll never get better - for 15+ years it's been like this- not ever gonna change.
