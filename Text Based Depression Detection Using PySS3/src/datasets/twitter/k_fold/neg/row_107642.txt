my ex girlfriends mom is racisttuesday during February break I go to my girlfriends house with my cousin her mom calls her in with her little brother to talk when she gets back she says her mom thinks she shouldnt be seen with me or any of our friends because we are black and shes Asian I want to talk do her mom but because she only speaks Cantonese and I only speak English no one is willing to translate for me and my ex believes I shouldnt talk to her mom because thats not the way they do things (meaning Asian parents ) however she proceeds to break up with me because her mother threatened her future (her mom is supplying her money for school and putting a roof over her head) (we are in high school right now ) I dont know what to do she wont make an effort to get better (shes suicidal) she wont let me talk to her mom and she wont try to talk to her mom because they dont have a relationship but she lets others dictate her life she told the school she was worried about me hurting myself and I promised her unless I was genuinely scared for her life whatever she asked me to keep between us I would her statements got me sent to the hospital and evaluated when at any moment I could have said she hurts herself and get her exactly where I was yesterday because of her yes I have suicidal thoughts but because I'm darker and cut less you wouldnt be able to see it but on her you can clearly see her scars on her body when she forgets to wear a hoodie I'm not angry at her i just want to understand her someone tell me what I should do
