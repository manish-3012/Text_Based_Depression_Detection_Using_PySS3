It is not the Suffering...I'm not planning to kill myself because it hurts, I'm planning to kill myself because of what is hurting me.

I'm so tired of feeling impotent. For the past year it's been nothing but trying and failing horribly.

A whole year of trying to make it work with this girl who doesn't reciprocate these feelings.

A whole 6 months of testing my capabilities and failing.

3 months, I've worked this job at a warehouse and they finally hired a guy as we're going into our business season. He's the rookie whom I am training and after 3 days, he already outperforms me.

For a whole year, I've tried to couch my thoughts and feelings into poetry. But everything I write is just future regret.

I've given my best in all of these endeavors and have failed at all of them. And I don't care what others say about how if I tough it through then things will get better. There are some creatures in every species who are the scum of their kind - bottom feeders, wretches and husks of their former selves. And we don't bat an eye when they die in nature.

Just because I live in a house doesn't mean I'm outside of natural selection.
