I just want it to be over.Hometown friends have given up even replying to me now.


The last thing I was told was "Complaining won't get you anywhere."
(context: "family" money issues, but I can't do anything about it and I'm not allowed to get a job.)
I look like a bum compared to an average kid at my school, people keep talking shit about me more and more, yet a family member can drop +$800 on a phone like it's nothing. I know I keep sounding like a dick here but my school bag is falling apart, my shoes I have to wear everyday are falling apart, and my 2 pairs of jeans are ripped. (probs. because I'm a fatass, but whatever.)


I already think people are talking shit about me, but when they actually say it to my face...


All of this is out of my control. I can't do shit about it.

**There's more to all this and why I want to die, and I posted a different thing here explaining it a bit more, go read it if you want, so just know it's not just this little thing, I guess.**

I can't imagine waiting all this out until next year. I've been waiting so long for a little ounce of hope but nothing has happened for so long, what's the point?..
(sorry for being annoying, i just want to talk to someone. also, please don't PM me, got some dude wanting to take me away and shit.)
