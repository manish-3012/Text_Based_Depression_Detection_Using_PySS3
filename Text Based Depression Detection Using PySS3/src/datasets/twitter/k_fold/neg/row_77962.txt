Can't even trust my self anymore. I know i have posted before and i have asked for help i just feel like i am wasiting everyones time. 

If I don't even have my health whats the point. To make a long story short my gastrointestinal tracts fucked and after two years of fighting and a college fund gone i am giving up. No i don't know what it is and none of the doctors know either. I am broke and broken. 

I am angry all time i think i am just pushing everyone away for when the inevitable happens. I don't want them to try and save me the idea of telling anyone i really know just makes me want to not fuck it up this time. They don't know about any of it and i am ok with that. The only thing that they should learn is whats left in the note. Hopefully they will all just remember how i bitched and yelled at them and learn to hate me. 

I just can't do it any more i just want to crawl into a hole or be put on display and mocked at least then people would learn the real me, the fuck up not as the fun guy but the one who's been faking it for as long as hes know you. 

I just want the ride to be over the ups the downs it all seems like it's filler till the end. 
I BOUGHT THE TICKET I WANT OFF THE RIDE.
