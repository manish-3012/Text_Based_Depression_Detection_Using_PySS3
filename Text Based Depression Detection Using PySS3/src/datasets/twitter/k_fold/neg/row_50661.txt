You don't know me butI'm not looking for "help" here, but I have nowhere else to go to talk about it, later tonight, when it gets dark, I'm going to hide and poison myself with methanol, I have no alternative methods as I can easily back out of anything else and it's hard to access anything "easier"
Anyways, so, I live with my parents(who don't support me), and they like to play around with my living situation, I've been kicked out, became to stressed to go to my doctor to keep on getting the hormonal medication prescribed to me(I'm trans), and brought back, had that happen another time, and now I'm being forced to move once again, I have no where to go, housing workers have been no help, everywhere has "waiting lists" and I have given up. Again, I don't want help.. I wish it could be easy and I could have a doctor do it for me, but I don't qualify as o don't have cancer, etc. 3 hours from now is when I leave to do so, for now I'm just going to suffer the mental torment I am going through. Goodbye
