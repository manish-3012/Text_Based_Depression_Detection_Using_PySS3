All i want is to feel safeTherapy is not an option. I think it would be if my parents believed in it more and if they could see how much I'm struggling. I'm 19, but can't afford it on my own.

I made a post on a different subreddit about how I was struggling with becoming sexually active again due to past traumas. I eventually just pushed myself to do it. I've been with 2 men since the post, a 51 year old and a 49 year old. 

I know they don't care about me, it's just sex. But just having somebody say they want to see me and having somebody compliment me is all I need right now. I actually felt safe with them and I felt actually happy. Those feelings I've been searching for since I was assaulted and it just hurts that there's nothing to it. I don't think I want a relationship. I just want to be around someone who appreciates me. I don't feel stressed or anxious, it makes me feel good to hear the things they say to me. 

I really don't know how I feel. I don't truly want to die but I'm just feeling so hopeless, just really getting to the end of my rope here and I need help. I'm lost. 

I'm scared. I don't know of what. I don't know why having sex is hurting me so bad after the fact. 

I really don't know where to go. I just want to feel safe and happy. That's all.
