sat on my window for half an hour and came back downstill living with my parent at the age of 28, have an low-pay job for 2.5 yrs, been asked for doing so called "scientific research" which in my eyes are total bullshit. Don't want to produce pieces of crap anymore, don't know what I am really capable of either. Don't even dare to quit my job.
Don't want to go any further in the path that will lead to my mental death, but when I sat on the window of my bedroom I just lacked the strength to make the final jump.
Now I allow myself for another morning, for there's some trivial job at workplace to be done.
