Oh and how the decline begins.So slow yet so effective... Beethoven Moonlight Sonata plays in the background. 

What a beautiful way to look back at the misery I've been living and the hard times I face. Haha! 

I sit here, smiling and sip my vodka knowing I will delete this thread in a few hours. Not willing to face the shame in morning. I love to put on the happy front. But no one knows the truth. It's beautiful!
