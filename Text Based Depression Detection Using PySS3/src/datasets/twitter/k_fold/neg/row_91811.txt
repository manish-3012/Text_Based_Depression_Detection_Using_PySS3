I'll never love myself.I don't want to live anymore. I have too many issues. I can't seem to solve any of my own problems. My suicidal thoughts are coming back to me in droves &amp; I really do want to kill myself lately. How can I become a smarter, better version of myself when I can't believe in myself? How can I ever find the right partner when I don't love myself? 

I just don't want to suffer anymore. All I do is work &amp; suffer. 
William, you didn't love me &amp; I gave you 100% of me. Every time I think I've cried all of my tears, they return when I think of you. I don't know what to do anymore. I hate having any free time to mysel because I introspect to much. I can't sleep at night because of the anxiety. 

There is no man out there that will ever love me or respect me for who I really am. I will always be a pretty face with a mediocre brain. I work so hard, but for what exactly? 

I need something to numb the madness.
