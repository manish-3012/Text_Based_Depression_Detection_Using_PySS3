Anyone have steam? Can you do me a favor?I'm not sure if this is the right place but this girl I met on steam awhile ago has been going through depression and recently her and I were bonding about our boyfriends breaking up with us but she was having a really hard time with it, she told me she has had depression since she was young and has been suicidal, I don't have access to my steam account right now but I checked on her page to see if She was ok just not talkitive since she hasn't texted me in a few days but she has been offline for 4 days now and I was wondering if somebody could comment on her profile and ask if she is okay? She is a really good person and even if I have only known her for about 4 months she has become a really good friend to me, but I'm scared her depression mixed with her boyfriend breaking up with her might have been too much, she told me she understands why he did it and that she isn't upset with him just that she is hurting real bad but she always makes sure to reply to me. I'm just worried about her, she was the only person who came to my rescue when I was being bullied to the point where I wanted to kill myself because of all the homophobic people attacking me and I just want to be there for her if She needs any help,

I can't log into my steam right now to check if she messaged me on there before she went offline a few days ago so can someone please just send a comment on her profile and just ask if she is safe or something? 

Her profile is
