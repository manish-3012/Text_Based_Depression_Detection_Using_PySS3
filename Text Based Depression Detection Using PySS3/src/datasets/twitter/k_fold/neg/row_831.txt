Losing myself and scared for my kidIâ€™ve been battling suicidal depression since 6 years old. I first tried and hanging myself at 7 and my dad caught me just in time after I had already lost consciousness. Then again at 10 by taking all of my adhd medication at once. Iâ€™ve had several more failed attempts. Itâ€™s not that I want to die but it feels right to me. I have a 3 year old boy and I know that I need to be there for him but Iâ€™m at the point of no longer caring who it affects or how. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m feeling like this and itâ€™s a little off putting. I can look at my kid hold or touch him. I always have to tell him everything will be okay when I know it may not be. I have it all planned and ready to go. I have lost everyone who was close to me and I try to reach out but everyone is just annoyed with me trying to vent. I am ready for everything to be over. I donâ€™t want to leave my son fatherless but I know I am replaceable. I canâ€™t tell his mom because I want to treasure the moments I have left with him. Iâ€™m only 25 but I know I wonâ€™t make it past 30. Everyone says it gets better but what about fighting this urge for 19 years. It has never once gotten any easier. I have tried counseling but it does no good. Iâ€™m right at my breaking point.
