ItchFor whatever reason lately I have been having ideations. I don't even really want to die, I know what that feels like as I have had it before. But lately I just want to hurt myself, but I don't actually. It does not make any sense, and I am scared to tell anyone because if they report me, I could face losing a job I applied for and my hand gun permit. I have never even thought about using my gun, I just have this constant itching and ticking in my brain that tells me to scratch up my arms.

I really need to start taking my meds again.
