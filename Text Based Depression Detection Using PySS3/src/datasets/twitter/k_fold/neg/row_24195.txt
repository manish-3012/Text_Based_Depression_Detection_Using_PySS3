I donâ€™t belong anywhereIâ€™ve tried for years to fit in but because of my depression and anxiety it feels like Iâ€™m fundamentally different from my peers. I try to fit in with people but I always end up fucking it up and never being happy. I donâ€™t belong here. No one has the energy to put up with my depressing bullshit. I just drag people down and make their life worse. Iâ€™m not gonna make it past highschool. I hate myself so much I deserve to rot.
