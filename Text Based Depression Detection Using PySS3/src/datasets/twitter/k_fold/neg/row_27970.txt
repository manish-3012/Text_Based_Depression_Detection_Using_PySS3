Too lazy for lifeI'm just too lazy for life.  I hate most things about my physical appearance.  I'm *kind* of skinny, nothing terrible but I could use some more muscle, but I'm too lazy to start lifting weights.  And what does muscle matter when you're short and have a small penis?  Oh, you're just getting muscle to compensate for your worthless, tiny dick when in reality it's not compensating at all.  I'm too lazy to go to college.  I'm too lazy to get a job to buy this I need just to survive such as housing and food.  I just want to sit around and do nothing with everything handed to me but I know that's not how life works.  I don't really understand why people want to work so hard *just* to live.  You have to struggle and work for things just so you can get by.  Why does anyone want to live to get by?  It seems very redundant to me.  Life is slavery.  You're forced into life and just expected to go along with it, but not me.
