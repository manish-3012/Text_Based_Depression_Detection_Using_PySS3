I'm not highly suicidal, I am just in a rough spot.  Help would be nice. I used to have two fathers, one stepdad and one biological father.  Recently, my dad went all crazy, broke a ton of laws and is facing prison time.  My stepdad died young and unexpectedly last week.  I have a half brother who is six and another who is 13.  I just keep thinking about how those two are fatherless and how badly I wish my dad were the one who would have died.  

My father is trying to reconcile with me after many years, but I want no part of him.  I tried hard to connect with him for the past year (before he was arrested and such) with no luck.  Now that he is in trouble he wants to have bonding time.  I am smart enough to know I don't need him in my life.  

I don't really think I am going to kill myself.  I am scared because I keep hearing the same line in my head, "Now its time to die, or Now it is time to kill myself."  Usually, it is when I am fucked up or finishing an activity and moving on to another.  Sometimes I get a text from my mom about her needing my help and things get worse for me.  

I don't think I am a high risk for suicide, I just want to know why I keep thinking I need to die.  Is this a part of grief?
