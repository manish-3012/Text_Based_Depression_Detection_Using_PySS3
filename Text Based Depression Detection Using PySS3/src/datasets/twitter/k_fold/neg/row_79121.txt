I know I can help myself but I cannot force myself to tryI have one other post, which is on r/offmychest. If you want more context, read that post.

Basically, for the better part of a decade I haven't helped myself with my depression even a little bit. I've left it up to other people to help me, and of course that is unproductive and unfair on everyone. I know that I'm hiding behind being a victim of my depression and that I'm the only one who can help me, but at the same time I feel unable to step up to the plate and actually make a change.

I feel like I'm teetering on the edge of collapse. I've struggled for so long and therapy has only provided temporary boosts in my mindset, but no positive actions or self-improvement. I feel like suicide really is my only option because I can't trust myself to ever take anyone's advice or to take the initiative to make my life any better. I'm absolutely fucking miserable and I know that I have the ability to change, but that isn't the empowering statement it should be - it's an acknowledgement that I need to be stronger, but I can't convince myself to do anything. The message that should be motivating me to being a better person is only making me more and more suicidal. What the hell am I supposed to do? Am I a lost cause? Because I've felt like that for more than half my life and it's beginning to feel like I should take my exit.
