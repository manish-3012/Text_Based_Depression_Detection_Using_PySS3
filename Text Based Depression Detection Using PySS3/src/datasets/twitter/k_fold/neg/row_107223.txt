need help with suicide threats from 27 year oldMy fiancee's daughter (Cindy) is 27 and bipolar type II.  She had a nervous breakdown about 18 months ago and has been living with her grandparents since then.  She has been seeing a counselor and psychatrist and has enrolled in school, last summer she was working outside a lot and seemed to be doing well.

In the past couple weeks she dropped her two college classes, won't leave the house, says she is sleeping with a knife.  My fiancee was crying and asking her to get help and Cindy just sat there watching TV and smiling a little bit.  Tonight my fiancee was planning on going over to see her, but when Cindy found out that another family friend was coming too, Cindy sent her mom a text saying she was tired of everything (Thursday is supposed to be her night with mom) and she was going to kill herself. 

I don't know how much of this is just manipulation.  She complains that things are just too hard, she is starting to pick fights with her grandparents and they want her out of the house.  She may be able to go live with her dad but he is bipolar or something too.

I called the local suicide hotline and they said we should try to get her in the hospital (which doesn't seem possible if she doesn't want to go) or should call the police for a wellness check and they can force into the hospital for an evaluation.

How seriously should we take the threats and what should we do?
