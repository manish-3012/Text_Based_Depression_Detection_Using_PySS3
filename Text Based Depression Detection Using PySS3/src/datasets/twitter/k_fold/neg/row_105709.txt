i just feel so unwanted and alonei feel stupid and selfish for even posting here again. but i just need to vent and i canâ€™t bring myself to bother the people i love with my bullshit anymore. iâ€™ll be honest i have been taking my med irregularly at best. iâ€™ve been making stupid decisions. meaningless hookups, stealing my dads car at 3am (i do not have a license), and honestly iâ€™ve somehow managed to stay clean from cutting for the past week or so but i have a feeling thatâ€™s not gonna last once i get home tonight. i donâ€™t care whether i live or die anymore. i donâ€™t care about anything. iâ€™m so sick of not being enough. i have no friends anymore. just people who act like they care and keep up shitty pointless conversations but then donâ€™t ever want to actually spend time with me in real life. iâ€™m apparently only interesting enough in small distant doses. just like iâ€™m only attractive enough for meaningless drunken hookups at midnight but iâ€™ll never be pretty enough for a real relationship. my last relationship was years ago and i can barely even remember what it feels like to not sleep alone. i just miss feeling loved and cared for so much it physically pains me. like i have so much other stuff i could talk about. iâ€™m in so much pain. my dad is constantly pushing his problems on me. i feel like itâ€™s my responsibility to make sure he doesnâ€™t get himself arrested again or drink himself to death. my mom basically gives 0 fucks about me ever since she got together with her husband. i have a tentative suicide date as of right now. iâ€™m not gonna tell anyone when it is because if i still feel this way by then the last thing i want is to be interrupted. i know iâ€™ll hurt my family. in particular my grandma aunt and little cousins who have become basically my only reason to live at this point. one of my cousins, her name is maggie and she reminds me so much of myself, well sheâ€™s 3 and i swear to god if i ever had a daughter (which iâ€™d never be able to bc my body is a failure in every way) iâ€™d want her to be exactly like maggie. sheâ€™s the light of my fucking existence and iâ€™m so scared for her because i never want her to end up like me. sheâ€™s so smart and beautiful and sensitive and iâ€™m gonna hurt her when i leave. but sheâ€™s young now and sheâ€™ll forget, so will her twin brother and older brother. for the most part theyâ€™ll all forget about me and theyâ€™ll be better off with my bad influence and energy. everyone will. and honestly thatâ€™s all i have the energy to type out right now.
