Self harm, taken awayIâ€™m my previous post, I mentioned that I finally confessed everything to my parents, unfortunately for me, they took away my cutting knife and rope, rope was not an issue, i still had spare, but as for my cutting knife, all I had was my hunters knife I carry for self defense. I tried cutting with it, but before I even pressed, I just touched it and started bleeding way worse. It was definitely more painful than me other knife, I donâ€™t cut for pain, I cut for the release it gives you, I am confused on what to do right now. Iâ€™m thinking razors but Iâ€™m not to sure. Also this cut still hurts even though I did it yesterday. Donâ€™t worry I got isopropyl and cleaned it up. If it helps in any way Iâ€™m 13.
