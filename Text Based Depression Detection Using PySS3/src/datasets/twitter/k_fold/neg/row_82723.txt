So I basically don't existSo I bought a gun yesterday. There's a waiting period so I don't actually have it, but once I do that's pretty much it. I don't have any family - parents passed away, sister committed suicide when I was 10, brother molested me from about ages 4 - 12. Extreme social anxiety so I can't even relate to people my own age and have no friends or significant other,  so it's not like I'm harming anyone by checking out. I had a decent job, but got injured and have been off on disability for 3 months - not one phone call, get well card or contact from any co-worker, people I interacted with for 8 years. It's basically like I'm already dead, so really what's the point of continuing on with nothing to look forward to and no one to interact with?

I don't  especially want to die, and I know that some nice people out there will post things like "we care about you" and whatnot, but the fact is that you don't know me, and would likely treat me like I was invisible even if you did, since that's pretty much what everyone else does.

Not sure why I'm even bothering to post this - I guess it's my form of a suicide note since I don't actually have anyone in my life to write a note to. Sorry to be a downer.
