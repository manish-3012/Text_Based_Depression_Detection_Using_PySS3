GoodnightI'm going to hang myself tonight. I know no one cares, nor should they. No one knows me, so how could anyone possibly care? I'm no one, anyone that says differently are just spewing empty words because I mean nothing to them. You can pity me, but you can't care about me. 

So what's the point of this post? There is none, I simply have nowehere else to share my last thoughts, which I felt was something I had to do. 

I won't be responding to any comments or pms, I just wanted to let someone know I existed.
