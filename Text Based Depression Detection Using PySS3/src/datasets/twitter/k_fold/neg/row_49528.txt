idkI don't know what i want to do with my life, i have no ambition or goals i want to achieve, i have no friends, nor a person thats just there when i need someone to talk to, the things i used to do to make me happy just isnt making me happy anymore. when i was younger i had so much motivation, i thought adults were so cool, that they could solve any problem they would come across, that if only i was older all my problems would go away.   


why do i even continue, just for that next dopamine rush? is it really worth it.   
I dont want to die, I just want to be able to look in the mirror and smile, to be happy, it just feels like something that is just out of my reach.  


It feels like im going into a downwards spiral from which i cant escape, no one to talk to.  
I cant remember the last time i got a compliment, the lasy time someone was there for me 

Am I just wallowing in my own self pity, am i just that attention seeking?  
too much of a coward to take my own life  
why am i going on this rant, for pity points, how pathetic.
