Getting things out of my brain...Iâ€™m not looking for sympathy or help. Iâ€™m just trying to get all these thoughts out of my brain so maybe they wonâ€™t repeat all day. Iâ€™m over 30 years old, and live with clinical depression. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed as bipolar, and cyclothymic. Iâ€™ve been actively depressed for about 2 years, with very brief periods (usually hours, sometimes up to a couple days) of normal or manic functioning. I know my triggers (failure, embarrassment, rejection, hunger, sleep) and try to avoid them. Last year, I went back to school to try for my bachelors degree. Yesterday, I spent the morning in a very rare light spot of no depression. It was nice. Last night, I had a bad stomachache (Iâ€™ve been down with the flu) and felt like my wife didnâ€™t care. She spent the evening talking about work and looking at her phone. I tried to steer the conversation to different topics, but got no results. This began a spiral. I woke up in a continued depression, tired of living around work and phones, and was subdued. After pressing what was bothering me, we got into an argument. Any time I bring up issues, my wife gets defensive. I felt this was no different. I said as much. I got clipped answers in return. She left to meet a friend for coffee, and Iâ€™m here wishing I was dead. I want to drive into a tree or blow my brains out. This is not a new feeling, but that doesnâ€™t make it easier. I feel it would be better for everyone if I was gone. Most of all, I keep telling myself that Iâ€™m worthless, Iâ€™m nothing, and Iâ€™ll never be anything. I should just give up because Iâ€™ll always be the trash I was born to be. That thereâ€™s no point in having dreams or goals because I deserve nothing and Iâ€™ll die alone. That I deserve to die alone. That eventually sheâ€™ll get sick of my shit and leave. That Iâ€™m a burden. That nobody wants me, and nobody will ever love me for who I am. I truly wish I would just die, and Iâ€™ve felt that way for a long time. When Iâ€™ve told my wife I feel this way in the past, she gets mad. She says itâ€™s bullshit. I donâ€™t feel that I can open up to her. I feel like our marriage is just a fancy cohabitation situation. I donâ€™t feel love for anything anymore, but I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s from the depression or not. I want and need to get medication, but I suffer from severe social anxiety. Calling to make an appointment is pure hell to me. Last year, I finally got the nerve to call one doctor, and was told they werenâ€™t accepting new patients. I havenâ€™t gotten the nerve to call since. I feel empty and also full of pain. I feel alone. And I feel broken. Thanks for anyone who read to here. I know itâ€™s a lot.
