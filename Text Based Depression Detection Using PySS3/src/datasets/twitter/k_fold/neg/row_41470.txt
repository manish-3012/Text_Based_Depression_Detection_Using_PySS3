I can't live with myselfI lost my dream Job (stock broker),my girlfriend, my reputation, my friendships, my dad and my best friend died and I'm currently in a severe depression. It's so bad that I don't shower or brush my teeth routinely. This is the worst I've ever been. I haven't been eating or sleeping and all this happened in the blink of an eye. I'm unemployed and in a severe depression it's hard for me to do the little things around the house I can barely take care of myself. Everyday I wake up is a nightmare. I worked so hard to get that job I went to a prestigious university and graduated with a bachelors and a MBA. I was in the top 10% in sales in the company I had an amazing girlfriend that loved me dearly and I loved her. My dad and best friend died on the same day. My reputation was awesome in the community I coached kids and was apart of many civic organizations. It's hard to believe that it is all gone and the worst part about it I'm so deep in depression that I can't move forward it's like I'm stuck. I want to move but I feel unmotivated. I know God is with me but I can't feel his presence. I really feel like ending it all I can't live with the mistake that I made it haunts me everyday. I really want to end it all. Suicide has never crossed my mind in the past as I was loving and living life. I can't believe that I'm so close to it.
