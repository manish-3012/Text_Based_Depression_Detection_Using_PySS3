Advice neededSo this troll is commenting on every single post I make in this group, and I see those posts, but I go to the post, and they're not there. They are obviously meant to be harmful, so naturally, they would be automatically deleted. That'd be great except thanks to that system, I'm unable to block this person. What do I do? I can't even see who it is, but I am certain it's one person based on how they talk.
