It's not the problems that make me want to die, it's that I've been a bad personIm selfish, greedy, spoiled, lying no good scum, who hides out here on Reddit. It's not about being sad, mad, depressed, etc. That stuff is independent of the bad things I've done and said to/about others. Somehow people have wanted me around, but it's weird that they can't see how much their lives are better without me being around. 

Pretty much waiting until they are apathetic, which is coming up soon. I've got the 'how', but am waiting for the 'when'
