i dont want to existim constantly fucking up. i feel like everything i do goes to shit and even things that i enjoy doing make me feel anxious and that im doung it wrong. more and more the people i love are getting distant and my mother doesnt give a shit about my health, all she can do is talk about herself and how she has it hard, but all i really want is for someone to tell me theyre proud of me and that they love me for me but no one does. im just that sode character used for eveyones benifits but no one ever wants to help me with anything i need. ive been thinking of suicide more and more this past month then ever before and i havent told anyone because im afraid theyll reject me and say that i dont have it that tough. im just sick of being a waste of space. im basically a dropout and have no chance of college and bet yall anytjimg im gonna end up some sort of addict. i make everyones life just that little bit worse so why shouldnt i just dissapear
