I absolutely hate this fucking world and my horrible life selling myselfI am 20 yrs old male. I have 0 family or anyone that will help me, I am going to get arrested because I can not pay a fine that I have 0 influence in making. I have been selling myself but the people are very stingy and just won't help me. I am so tired and exhausted of being miserable every second of my life. No one will ever help me and no one will ever say I don't deserve this. I can not do this anymore. This world is very horrible and fucked up. I am sure people will reply to this saying "don't kill urself" but the only thing that would prevent it is by a miracle someone actually financially helping me which will not happen so I am certain I will end up dead tonight.
