Friend just got released, what do I do?Hi,

A friend of mine, let's call her "Kate," whom I recently met with just got out of the mental hospital after spending 10 days there for attempted suicide. She won't be available to reach in real life since she is moving far away, to a different country somewhere in Europe. The only contact I can get with her is by going online and talking with her. I know little else than her recent release. I am unsure on how to comfort/help her, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

I will try to respond as soon as I can to any of your messages.
