I feel so trappedI moved to a new continent to live with my boyfriend, and things aren't going so well.  I've been struggling with depression and thoughts of suicide for a long time (before I moved), but now I'm all alone in this country with a boyfriend who doesn't make me feel loved at all and I just want to go home, but I have no money and I just feel so fucking trapped.  Even if I do go home I'll still be depressed and I just feel like there's no point anymore.  I've lived an eventful enough life, it just seems like there's no need for more... but I don't want to have to kill myself.  It's too scary.  I wish I'd just die in my sleep.  

sorry this is so incoherent, i just need help
