survival mode is all i know and iâ€™m tired of it.i live in a constant state of survival mode. just getting through the next 24 hours alive. i hate it. i canâ€™t kill myself iâ€™m too chicken and i canâ€™t even find things that make going to the next day worth it. my life isnâ€™t bad and i donâ€™t know why i feel so terrible. i just want to go away and i hate being me and being alive but iâ€™m scared of dying because i donâ€™t know what comes next. i feel awful that no one can help, not even my girlfriend because she tries and i feel like sheâ€™s getting tired of me and wanting to help. i know things â€œget betterâ€ but it does not feel like that. not at all.
