Iâ€™ve never experienced loneliness quite like this beforeI have no friends, barely any supportive family, just my mother who works for a crisis team (no, she is absolutely no help whatsoever) Iâ€™m diagnosed bpd so basically automatically forgotten about, my boyfriend shows me absolutely no support, and I love him so much but Iâ€™m honestly starting to think he doesnâ€™t love me, I want to die so bad but I have a 5yo. 

I hate myself, I hate my life, I hate everything about me, I hate the trouble and pain I bring to my family, I hate how annoying I am to my boyfriend, I hate what Iâ€™ve put my daughter through 

I have psych nurses, doctors and psychologists, Iâ€™ve done groups, therapy, bpd programs, safety plans ect, Iâ€™m now 23 and have attempted my life 6 times, I ready to go, but I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, Iâ€™m so stuck and I have no one at all to talk to about it
