the better i get the worse i get.i've been on meds a few months now, and what was a good thing has finally stopped working. like i knew it would. like what happened last time. meds dont consistently work for me and never have. and now that i've lost my job i can't afford to get on new ones, or even to get the old ones restocked, and even if i could, why do it? i've been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety and a host of over fucking shit since i was 11 years old, and it just like, at the end of the day, this shit is inside of me. it'll never be cured, only ever treated. with this newest batch of meds i felt better, had my first real friends in 26 years, and finally started to stop hating myself so god damn much, and yet, at the end of the day, i still wanted to kill myself. it just went from hating myself so much i wanted to die, to matter of factly realizing i've never wanted to be alive at any point in my life. there's never been a fear of being dead, or a desire to stick around for any reason, but i'm so afraid of the physical pain of death that i've mostly put it off (aside a few attempts here and there). but now, i'm sitting here jobless, having had to move back in with my estranged mother, with my world completely crumbled around me, and i realize that even if it get's better, i'm always going to end up back here, in this fucking tar pit of a brain. obssessing day in and day out about hanging myself from my attic bedroom while my friends talk to me about their problems and i feel more and more disconnected and unable to talk to any of them or help them in anyway. i didn't choose to be alive, and i don't see why i have to feel bad about not wanting to be alive any more, or why it's illegal for me to make one meaningful decision for myself for once.
