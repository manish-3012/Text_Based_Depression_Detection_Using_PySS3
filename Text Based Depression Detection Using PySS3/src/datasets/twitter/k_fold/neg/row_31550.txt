I am here.Evening everyone, 

I know some are in better places then others. I know some are in worse places then others. I acknowledge each and everyone of you are struggling with yourselves, the world and others.. 

I acknowledge, it's not easy. However, because of all this I also acknowledge that each and everyone of you should be so proud of yourselves for putting up the fight this far. 

I am glad that each and everyone of you are still here, and I value you, your thoughts struggles and demons... I don't care how full my inbox gets, but I want to get to know EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU that crosses this thread. I'm great at conversation if you just need some banter to try and forget, or are lonely or just want a simple chat. But I am an even better listener. Tell me what you want, I'll share my stories you don't have to. The conversation we hold is in your control. 

I will try and reach for alot of you who make posts/comments, but don't feel shy or silly for messaging me. I am proud of everyone here, and look forward to getting to know you all and gain worthy relationships!
