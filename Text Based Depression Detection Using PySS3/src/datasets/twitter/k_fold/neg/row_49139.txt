How do I help someone else through this?I'm going to try to stay away from specifics but how do I help someone that just tried to end their life? I'm.... lets just say my look on life is worse than theirs and I'm only coping because emotionally I'm pretty numb. I really don't know what to say or how to even approach them. Being completely honest I believe I would just make it worse trying to help.
