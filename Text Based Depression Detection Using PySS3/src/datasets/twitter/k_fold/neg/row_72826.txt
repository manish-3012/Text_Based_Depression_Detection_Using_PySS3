I just don't know what to do. I'm so tired.I'm 22 years old. Am Transgender, have had chronic pain for so many years, live with constant mental abuse, have no money, can't work due to my pain, haven't been given disability, don't have any way to go to a doctor who can actually help me. I just.. I don't know what to do. The pain I have is in my neck and shoulders, and on a 1-10 scale of pain, it's way passed 10. The only way I can describe it is the pain of death without the release of death. I've been depressed for so long, I cry every day for hours. I have constant suicidal thoughts, but I don't think I could ever really bring myself to kill myself. I have a phobia of death, and a girlfriend that tries her hardest to help me. She lost a dear friend to suicide, I could never put her through that, but I still have the thoughts eating away at me. I barely sleep, and when I do it's the most uncomfortable, restless sleep ever. I also only can bring myself to eat a meal maybe once a day. I'm just so tired and don't know what to do.
