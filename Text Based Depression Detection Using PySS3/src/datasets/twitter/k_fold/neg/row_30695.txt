I can run away, but nothing is stopping me.I can't deal with the reality of my health. The extreme anxiety that has caused fibyromyalgia. First it was Lyrica, now it's onto Benzo (Temazepam) drugs that can calm me down. I've started smoking and drinking. I'm only 20, this started when I was 10.

I'm a good person, and it makes it that much worse. I just want out.
