I can't figure out what's wrong with me.I just can't seem to figure out what's wrong with me. It seems like everybody hates me, including my family. I can't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy with myself or with my life. I have no friends, no girlfriend, and my family doesn't like me. Every night I hold a knife to my own throat hoping I can just end it all and not have to live like this anymore. I'm really considering ending my life and going through with it to stop feeling this way. I don't even believe in god but I pray everyday that my life will get better one day but it never has for the last 6 years. I think the only way out is to end my life.
