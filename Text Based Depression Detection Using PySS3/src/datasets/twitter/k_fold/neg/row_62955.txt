I need somebody to talk toI just lost a friend... I loved him and now i cant contact him. I hadnt even realized how much he meant to me. When i talked to him, i felt a presence guarding me. Now im alone, naked. Vulnerable. My heart feels like it weighs 10 tonnes. For the last couple of days ive been considering suicide. Ive considered it before but now the feeling is scarily intense. I feel like im dying on the inside. Every day keeps getting worse...
