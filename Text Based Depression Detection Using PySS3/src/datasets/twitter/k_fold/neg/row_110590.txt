A few thoughts.My first ever post. As my user name suggests I have scoliosis. I had corrective surgery years ago. Did ok for a long time. Now the fusion has started to twist, misplacing the Harrington rod. My ribs are twisting. Making it more difficult to breathe. My shoulders and hips are twisting, making it difficult and painful to walk or sit.
I've been doing good in pain management. I've been able to participate in life. I even joined a fitness class. 
Until my Dr left. I got fobbed of on a nurse practitioner. I saw her today. I'm still in shock.
She didn't know what a thoracic/lumbar fusion was, nor a Harrington stabilization rod was. She thought since I had had surgery I should have been "fixed." I guess like you 'fix' a dog. Idk. 
It was discouraging and hopeless. She prescribed 8000, yes 8000 milligrams of Advil per day for pain. That's more medication than I've ever been on in my life. 
She spouted some FDA rules and "itwasnicetomeetyouhaveagoodday"
I was like...wth just happened? 
I see articles wondering why pain patients commit suicide. I wondered why, too. I thought everyone had a caring Dr like me and if they followed the rules to the T...they should have been ok. This is what happens when you have years of medical documentation and follow the rules laid out. To the letter. You get kicked in the ass and put out with the trash to manage however best you can. 
I'm just writing some thoughts...but I don't think I can go back to laying around in pain again, not fixing myself up everyday, combing my hair or putting on makeup, going out to eat, cooking...that's a hobby of mine, going out to take photos. Another hobby. Or  not seeing my friends for dinner, cleaning my apt like I am accustomed to doing.
 I can't. 
I'm not sure I can go back to being in pain...a 6/7 everyday and all night. 
This nurse...also said if I had surgery...they are only doing 3 days of pain management after surgery.
I'm not sure I believe that. But I'm not having surgery so it's of no concern. I'm just telling you. 
Scoliosis surgery is vicious surgery. It's brutal. I've done it. I've worn a full body cast for a whole year afterwards. 30 pounds of plaster in the Texas summer. At least we aren't casted anymore. I'm fused from thoracic 3 to lumbar 4 with a 12 inch rod.
Plus I'd never have surgery at this hospital or with their Dr's after today. Out of the question. 
There's a specialist in Texas I have seen 4 years ago...but he is now out of my price range. 
So I feel pretty much lost and worst of all I've lost all hope. 
How can this be happening in the USA? 
I can understand why pain patients take their own life now. I totally am getting it.
I am a mom. I raised my daughter alone...well I always say God helped me. She's in college now.  She's doing very good. So I feel I don't have to worry about her to much. She knows how things roll around here pain-wise. She hasn't seen that person in a few years though. 
So afterwards I bought some rope at the local Lowes. They have everything. I've been looking at it and thinking. 
And I've decided that living in vicious, untreated pain is not for me.
I've also decided to report this medical moron to her supervisor and the Texas Medical Board for the ignorant advice of 8000 milligrams per day of Advil. I'm guessing mentioning any of the above would fall on deaf ears because of the uncaring, unfeeling FDA who has obviously made it their mission to eradicate people like me. 
I was born with scoliosis. I didn't cause a condition and need treatment. I also didn't need treatment for 31 years after surgery...as it started to fail. My understanding is most of the Harrington surgeries eventually do. Especially the ones done in the 70's. Yea. 
So that's my story. I know there are others out there like me who have done nothing wrong and I would like to hear from you.
