im gonna overdose properly this timefirst time i tried to overdose i only used the paracetamol that was in the cabinet. i took about 40 500 mg pills but only told the hospital i took 20 but they still treated it like it was serious. This time i plan on taking nearly 100 500 mg pills with alcohol and whatever else is laying around. However i still dont think that it will be enough and i dont wanna end up being in hospital again embarrassed that another attempt has failed so should i wait until there is more alcohol or take my chance and leave this planet tonight
