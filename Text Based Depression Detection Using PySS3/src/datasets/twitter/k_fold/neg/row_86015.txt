Crisis line uselessI waited for 20 minutes for the crisis line worker and then they just kept on telling me to go back into therapy or to ask my doctor to bump up my anti-depressants which are at the highest level i can be at due to my age. I'm 15 and really hurting.. i just wanted to vent and get some useful help but this is shit. I want to die so badly. I can't even take it anymore. I've been going through this shit since I was 7.
