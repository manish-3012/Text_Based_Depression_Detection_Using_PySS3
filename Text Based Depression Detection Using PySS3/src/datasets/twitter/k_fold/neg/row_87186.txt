I can never fucking get ahead. I can only get ahead if I'm like everyone else.Fuck, I cannot even use the internet because my wifi is so shit today. Where do I fucking start? I have no fucking life off the internet. No job, no real education, and only one working parent. I don't fucking eat anything at all anymore, I don't bathe, and I barely leave the house. The only things I care about are video games and my obscure as fuck fandom. Yesterday I had a panic attack because I saw new fan artwork (FINALLY!) and it was even adult content (also great) but the fetish was so shit that I couldn't jerk off at all...or at least not immediately. I had to force myself to masturbate to mind-break (raep) hentai and now I feel like killing myself more than usual. How the fuck could I throw away my morality just to get off? I'm fucking desperate for the shit that gets me off, that's why! I'm addicted! I'm so sick of this fucking cycle. I worked my fingers to the bone for my fandom and nobody in in the community gives a shit. Who the fuck even cares anymore about producing fan-content? Some random bitch from a dime a dozen anime has billions of pron pictures made of her and here I am wishing I still had a soul left to sell to the devil for some quality obscure fandom smut. An asshole that thinks seeing women getting sexually assaulted is fun is somehow a better artist than me. Every-time I try and do the right things and I try to live my own way, I get no pleasure. I need hentai to feel good about myself. I need this video game fandom to validate my existence. I need these petty things because there is nothing for me away from the internet. I hate them all. I hate all humans. I wish I was dead. Not even brave enough to stab myself in the stomach or swallow all of those pills. None of you people can understand anyways so why the fuck am I here?
