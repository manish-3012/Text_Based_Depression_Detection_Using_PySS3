I feel lost and I need to vent.Iâ€™ve been struggling with suicidal ideation for the better part of 10 years, it started when I was 12 and Iâ€™m now 22 and Iâ€™ve done all I can to search for meaning in my life. Iâ€™ve never properly sought out help because Iâ€™ve always felt that everyone in my life already has so much to deal with I just donâ€™t want to bother them. Iâ€™ve never really been able to open up to anyone no matter how close I am with them because Iâ€™m so afraid they will think I want to die because I donâ€™t want to be with them anymore. Over the years Iâ€™ve struggled with self harm and I frequently got into dangerous situations because I just didnâ€™t care about what happened to me, but four and half years ago I met someone I want to spend my life with, but I havenâ€™t ever really gone in depth about how I feel because again Iâ€™m terrified of anyone I love thinking itâ€™s their fault or that they are not enough... and recently I finally got into college and Iâ€™m about the end my first semester and I had to move about an hour away from home, itâ€™s not that far but I do feel quite isolated still... I have lots of kind classmates but Iâ€™m afraid of talking to any of them about my thoughts as the program Iâ€™m in is related to the death care industry... Iâ€™m afraid that someone will tell me that Iâ€™m not suitable for this industry if I have these kinds of thoughts... anyway... I just feel like Iâ€™m reaching a breaking point...
