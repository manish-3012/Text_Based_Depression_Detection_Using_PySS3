Hate death but despise life moreDepression ptsd bpd
They all drag me down with the people i love
I'm a leech, hurts like shit if you rip it off but slowly killing in the long run
Wish for death every second terrified of all these people in the world with the same mental capacity and suffering
If she exists hate hate hate god
Can't take care of my cat anymore can't do anything
Lying in bed takes up too much energy
Stopped doing things i love- reading drawing gaming socialising drinking eating
Less sad but more empty
Can't wash brush teeth get dressed eat healthy
Self harm still bleeding, been 2 days
Wasting time
Wasting money
Wasting love
Wasting life
Wasting

Frustrated because i am held down in life by loved ones
Can't study because of medical condition
Want to go in a coma and spend an infinite amount of time in my head
Nightmares are painful but bearable compared to real life
Shutting down not talking
My body only makes sound when farting, no voices
Want to fade away
Anger bitterness sadness disgust towards ptsd
Hyperventilation in a very slight amount always gasping for air all the time
Feels like I'm hungover even though i didn't drink
Look at others, look at me, see how much of a failure i am
Never doing productive work
Has tons of ideas of the 'perfect suicide'

My blanket is choking me
Shut the fuck up clocks
No more tic tic bullshit
I'm never going to get better
I prefer to die
Please
