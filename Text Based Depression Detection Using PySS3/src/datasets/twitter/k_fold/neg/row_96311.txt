AdviceHey, I'm a 15 year-old male that is honestly I don't know what I'm facing. I use to be happy I use to look at my life goals and think wow I'm gonna do it. But just recently as I became a sophomore and I start to realize the pieces aren't falling together. My life goal, or now dream, is to be an electrical engineer. But now I look and I'm still in geometry, I have no experience in work or math. No colleges will notice me or anything. I hate how I evaluate myself because of this system of school as if I'm suppose to go. Now I feel as if I'm going to be another pawn in this world that means nothing. A pawn that sits next to a desk all day answering phones. There's honestly no point in this world where your life is determined by other people's standards and ideologies. What's the whole point for me to continue on this life. My parents don't really care, my dad sees past me as I'm a mark of his mistake for leaving my mom. As for my mom, she only sees me as an atm machine from my dad. I'm the obscured child and no one notices me at all. I'm just a presence with no meaning or acknowledgement. The only thing that's keeping me going now is my girlfriend, which is honestly fucking sad, as now I realize nothing lasts forever. She just makes me happy and I don't want to hurt her by leaving this meaningless place because right now everything is going great for her. I don't know what to do. I mean I'm doing well in school but that doesn't even fucking matter am I right. It's honestly meaningless we'll all die soon for other people's benefit or loss but in the end we're just small insignificant beings on the pursuit of happiness which is a void that'll never be filled. I just really need to talk to someone or just some advice. I know this bullshit isn't as worse as other people but it'll help someone worthless as me.
