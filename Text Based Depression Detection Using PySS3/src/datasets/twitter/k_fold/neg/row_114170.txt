After thinking about it for 8 years I think I'm gonna do itI have PTSD, never going to escape who I was in the past. I tried it all, reaching out therapy apps life adjustments and I'm still here. Can't afford therapy, any of the free mental health services around me suck so I dunno. I guess it'll just be natural selection if I kill myself, good since all I'm capable of doing is bringing everyone down with me.
