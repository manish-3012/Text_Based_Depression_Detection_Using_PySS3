My last attempt, October 30, 2018Yâ€™know itâ€™s kinda strange and a little scary knowing how close I was to death. Just having everything end, and thatâ€™s it. No thoughts of the future, god or no god (Iâ€™m a Christian), not even life flashing before my eyes. Just seeing the forest kind of fading out and everything turning really slow. I couldnâ€™t even tell what was happening when I suddenly stood up. Itâ€™s like I couldnâ€™t see, but could at the same time. I had this weird feeling in my body and head. I couldnâ€™t really walk or really see anything for a few seconds. It was either blurry, or kind of pixelated. I canâ€™t really describe it. I was slouched limp against a dead tree, with a skinny rope and towel around my neck. At first I couldnâ€™t do it the first couple of times. But then I just hung. Yâ€™know youâ€™re doing it right when youâ€™re not gagging, but you feel a ton of pressure on your head. Just not being able to breathe, without small gasps of air or gagging is just really strange and weird. I was just slouching there, waiting for it to happen. I was thinking â€œYup this is happening, and Iâ€™m completely comfortable with it happeningâ€.  Then next thing I know my legs spring up. Thatâ€™s when everything kinda went weird, itâ€™s hard to describe really. Itâ€™s like pixelating a image a lot, and then blurring it out, well thatâ€™s the best way I can describe it. I think once I sprung up I was trying to get the noose off of my neck as fast as I could. I couldnâ€™t really remember that much, for a few seconds, like I was drugged or something. The strange feelings only hit me once i stood up, I guess it was my body going revival mode or something. This was my second time of course, first time I was no where close. The weird and scary thing is that I was a few seconds away from ending, maybe even milliseconds. I was on the verge of blacking out, and if I did that wouldâ€™ve been it. No one knew I was out in the forest, and it would probably take them a bit to find me, even though I was by the chicken coop. Itâ€™s just, I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m not sure what to think of it, it seems real but not at the same time. Just going through that it feels kinda foreign I guess, well thatâ€™s the best way of describing it. I havenâ€™t really told anyone I tried a second time except like maybe two people. And I donâ€™t talk about this bit but I choose hanging (well slouching) because itâ€™s the safest option (Ironic). You have the ability to stop yourself, or if anyone finds you after you black out, you still have a bit to go before you actually die. These thoughts donâ€™t really come anymore, but sometimes they come back from time to time, more likely if Iâ€™m feeling pretty low

So yeah, I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s just weird I guess.
