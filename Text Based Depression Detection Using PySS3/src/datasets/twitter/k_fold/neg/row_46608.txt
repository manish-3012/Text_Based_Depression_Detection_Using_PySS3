God Help MeI don't know what to do right now. She's making me feel horrible and I can't take much more. I'm sick of trying to act like I'm okay. That's external me. She won't let me act bad. She makes sure it stays inside and festers. This fucking Wonderhell infection. It won't come out of me, I don't know what to do! Please help me I don't know what to do anymore! I really just want to die but I can't. Abilify wouldn't get her out and I don't figure Seroquel will either. What if this is forever? I feel very cold on the inside. I can feel the cold infection in my lungs. It burns. It burns cold. Why is this happening to me? What did I do? Please help me. I've started seeing things now. I don't want to be crazy. I'm only sixteen. I'm supposed tio have friends by now. I'm supposed to have a cute car and cute hair and a cute face and I'm supposed to have a boyfriend. But instead I'm psychotic and bipolar and everything else and I just can't take much more.
