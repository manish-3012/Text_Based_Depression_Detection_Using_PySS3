I don't fit in anywhere and I just want to leaveBurner account. 

I've always felt like this. Ever since I was a kid, I just wanted to observe or be old and casually watch people have fun. When we played ball, I always was someone who preferred to watch and cheer others on. 

When I worked as a grocery store bagger, I enjoyed it to an extent because I just kinda glided through the store and observing shoppers. 

Freshman year of college was painful. New city, new people. I just couldn't connect with people (although it's a bit easier now since everyone is desperate for human connection). 

Even when I'm with super good friends, at the end of a hangout I always feel empty. Like there's something missing. Even if we talk about deep topics and bond about life, at the end I just feel so removed from the situation and I don't know why. Like an observer of the situation. 

Hobbies I love, I can get along w people a lot easier but at the end there's a wall somehow. 

Somehow I just don't know anymore. I've wanted to leave earth and just observe it from above ever since I was young (but it really hit high school). 

I can't shake it. I wish I could just be a spirit flying around through the air doing my thing. I don't want to be here, even if some memories were good. 

I know the whole points 
"Life is meaningless, but that means it's endless"
"It takes time to outgrow bad habits" 
"You'll find groups of people that love you for you". 

I know life is sick and disgusting but full of wonder and beauty. I know I have to keep fighting. I had to pull myself away from multiple suicide attempts earlier this year. I know I should try to live in the moment and enjoy life. 

But somehow the feeling always comes back. I just want to leave and gaze at the world. 

I have interests and hobbies and goals but at the end of the day it all just seems worthless. I guess that's the beauty of life but I can't help it. 

I want to leave so badly, so badly
