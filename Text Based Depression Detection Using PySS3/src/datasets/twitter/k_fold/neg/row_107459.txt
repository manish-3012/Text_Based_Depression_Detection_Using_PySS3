Here we go again...Hey, it's that 15 year old again. My last post was made during the end of Freshman year and I'm now a Sophomore. I've been moved to online schooling because of the frequent mental breakdowns I'd have at regular school, and I thought it'd help me. However, I'm now more stressed than I ever have been in my life. I'm really close to asking my parents to let me drop out, but I know they'll disapprove and call my lazy, trying to convince me with "making more money" and "being successful". I've already decided I wanted to change my field of interest from acting to forensic criminology, since I recently learned I have horrible stage fright (and vomited on stage mid-audition), and they seem to support it. However I'm not taking any criminology classes, since my school doesn't offer them. Anyways, I've found myself wanting to just stop everything the past few weeks and caught myself contemplating suicide at least twice today. My attempt count has gone up to 8, and I'm just slowly accepting the fact that I'm doomed to live a life of pain and stress until I die of natural causes. I don't know, I just wish at least one of my attempts had worked.
