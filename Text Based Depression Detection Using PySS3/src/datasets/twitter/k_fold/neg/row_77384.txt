Why i am like this...It's just, i don't know what i will do in the future, i can't do anything, i'm already 18 and i don't know what i should do, the only think i'm good, not that much still is to draw, beside that i have social anxiety and i'm very shy, i can't talk to people who i don't know and this year i realised that i have not even a friend, they just use me for money, or for homework for school, i can't mantain a conversation and i don't even want to talk about phone call. My parents are divorced and whatever I do I ended up upsetting one of them. 
I feel like shit and i think everything will be better if i die
