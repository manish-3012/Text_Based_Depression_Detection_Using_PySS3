I think about not killing myself every day.[19m] I've been through a lot of things like a lot of us have. Some days are just days for me cold, indifferent, routine. I hate my life it's a bland boring life that I made for myself I tried to step out and got pushed right back into it. Decided to start letting others in and trying to love again. I regret so much; my first relationship ended 2 months ago she always loved the 6th it was the day we met she made it a special day our day. I have been drinking and drinking and drinking these past few weeks I ended up dropping out of college.. I feel like a whole chapter of life just ended I still feel so broken I want help but nothing helps for more than a day or a few hours. Hell this is why she left me because I was too emotional, I have problems, I need to figure my depression out on my own... yeah truth is she was it; she made me happy. Now that she gone it's back to the old me the same old life that I had worked so hard to get away from just to be battered and beaten and thrown right back into it. Everyone keeps telling me it gets better I lie and tell them it is... hate is a strong word I don't like to use it to describe things or situations but I do really and truly hate MY life. I'm just trying to change something anything this feeling everyday it's not living.
