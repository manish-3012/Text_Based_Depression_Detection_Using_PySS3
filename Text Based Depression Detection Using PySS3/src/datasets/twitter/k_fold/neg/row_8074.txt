feeling unlovable and suicidali'm 16 and can't handle life anymore. i feel unlovable when all i have tried to do in this life is gain approval and admiration from others. despite that, most people i know consider me arrogant and full of myself, despite the fact that i consider killing myself every day. my family fights non-stop and degrades myself esteem everyday. my friends consider me arrogant and annoying and only put up with me out of pity. all of my romantic interactions have been complete failures, and the ones which have lasted for more than a few weeks end up with the other person despising me. i've tried so hard to change my personality, i've tried so hard to be less arrogant - i've read self help, I've gone to the gym, read philosophy, gone to see a therapist - but nothing seems to change the fact that my personality is essentially a repellent for genuine human interaction. at this point i just want to end it all because no matter what, everyone I meet will consider me arrogant or a bad person. all i have ever wanted is a genuine romantic connection, which will be impossible because of my personality.
