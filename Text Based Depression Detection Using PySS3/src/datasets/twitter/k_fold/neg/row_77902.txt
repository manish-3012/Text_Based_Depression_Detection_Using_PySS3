Update. Troubled Times.Hey guys, this is an update on how I am doing.


Currently not suicidal, thought about it today but screamed my head off where no one heard me helped. I am still currently in a depressed state, and have bullies at my night classes. however they will soon be removed if they try anything. Still without a girl (hey Its a problem to me). Also trying not to fail school. Other than that I'm back to the way I was a few months ago, not especially good but not terribly bad.

Thanks for the support.
