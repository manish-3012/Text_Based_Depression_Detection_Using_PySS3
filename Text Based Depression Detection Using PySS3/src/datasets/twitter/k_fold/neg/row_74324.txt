Giving me one last chanceThis is my first post and i really don't know why i'm doing it...

So as a lot of people from here, i've been suicidal for a lot of years,thinking about not being alive is kind of a relief for me but it always was more like a illusion...

Recently was my birthday, another shitty one but i think that maybe i can give me another oportunity before being serious and kill myself at least.

I want to give me one year to get thinks better,maybe found something that i can enjoy,someone or anything that can give me...hope...

If in that year everything seems the same or i failed and still hate my life, i will plan my death in the best possible way,so no one have to pay something or causing more troubles after it.

Sorry,i really don't know why i'm writing this, maybe i just need to express it,  have no friends or someone to talk about it.

Thanks for reading...and sorry for my english, is not that good.

Have a nice day.
