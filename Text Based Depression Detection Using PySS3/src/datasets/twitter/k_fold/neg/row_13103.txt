I almost took a bottle of pills. Too long of a depression, too many health problems, and people who get mad at me for it.Unrelenting Major depressive disorder for 9 YEARS NOW. I got sick 7 years ago with a debilitating illness that people don't understand /have no patience for. I have sooo much I am trying to keep up with with a broken body and diminished functioned but I don't LOOK disabled.

I have taken myself to the er for suicidal emergencies and been hospitalized 3 times.

I just cant do it anymore. I cant afford the hospital bills. I am truly exhausted and have exhaustd all hope and coping ability.

I cant take myself to the hospital anyway because my car has died for the last tie. I keep thinking of walking over to the railroad tracks near my house or taking a bunch of my many pills. but my fear is surviving and being more disabled and dependant on help than I am now.

The irony is that I was the one who always helped everyone else- even the ones who are being so mean to me now. There is no compassion from them. I am so crushedd and angry and especially one person my little sister who I took care of all her life and my other sister I gave them so much money over the years to help them. and I don't even want money from them. I just didn't expect them to be so cruel to me.

I have a son with a disability and that's why I never do it. but that's also why everyone gets mad at me. they get mad I had to have my mom take care of him when I was hospitalized or when I have been sick and otherwise could not get care for him.

Ihave spent so many hours on the suicide line ove rthese years. I called the other night and the woman just sounded like a bitch. it was like, I can't take one more person like that. She didn't say the name of the line, so all I did was ask is this_____? and she was such a bitch. And I am oversensitive to that. 


I did everything I could for so long to not kill myself. I am truly exhausted.
