I canâ€™t go on any longer, Iâ€™m afraid to try. Iâ€™m a mother. I have no where to turn. So I came here. Everyone says to find support within your family and relationships? What if you donâ€™t have that? Iâ€™m honestly terrified. I think about self harm any time I get minutely upset. I take great care of my daughter, but I know she would be way more stimulated with a parent who doesnâ€™t desire death. 

 I have a SO, but they donâ€™t understand. We donâ€™t talk about it, because it leads to arguments and judgment. So, I have to keep my emotions to myself. Because Iâ€™m heartless for not considering what everyone else is going through. Iâ€™ve been so deeply depressed that I consider suicide quite often, hoping it would leave everyone free of me and my worthlessness. Iâ€™ve tried therapy and nothing has helped, no meds have made things better, I just sleep consistently. â€œGo get helpâ€ appointments are so far out, expensive, or the quality isnâ€™t here because youâ€™re insurance isnâ€™t good enough. I have no option to work because childcare is too expensive, I donâ€™t have many friends, and I donâ€™t leave the house unless itâ€™s for necessities. I feel as though Iâ€™m going to have a break, and Iâ€™m afraid. I canâ€™t handle myself anymore. Iâ€™m alone for the majority of my time, and conversation when is here, is very sparse and unrelated. No one takes me seriously when I say, that I truly, wish I was dead. 

 Iâ€™m afraid I will hurt myself. Iâ€™ve made many attempts, more than one nearly fatal. I continue to wonder why I wonâ€™t die. Itâ€™s pathetic of me to reach out and ask for something here. Iâ€™ve been told that Iâ€™m selfish asking for help, that itâ€™s a burden on others for the childcare I would need, maybe two or three times a month, depending. Daycare in my area is insanely priced. I have never once neglected my daughter and I always put her before me. But my constant loneliness, lack of communication, help, and friends, has really taken a huge toll on me. To the point I know Iâ€™m no longer the woman I tried so hard to be. 

 I feel empty and alone. Consistently afraid of whatâ€™s going to come next, whoâ€™s going to leave, whoâ€™s going to push me down. I donâ€™t know where to turn. I donâ€™t even know my point of this post. Other than Iâ€™m afraid. Since I was 11 I have felt this way, and it has only gradually gotten worse. For twelve years I have been scared, hurt myself, and prayed I wonâ€™t make it until 30. 

 Iâ€™ve been through an insane amount in my few years of life, and I wish some of it wouldâ€™ve taken my life, and the majority of it could have. I want my daughter to have a mother who can focus on her, and not the mental illness that plagues her life. Iâ€™m a good person, I try to be. I help when I can. Iâ€™m religious, I follow and pray to the lord. But I am forever alone. 

 Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to hurt myself badly, or end up in a casket. I feel I almost need inpatient services..but Iâ€™m afraid to ask anymore. Iâ€™m afraid to ask anyone else for help. 

What if no one hears me? Is this it? Am I doomed to never get the help I need? 

 I just want it all to end.
