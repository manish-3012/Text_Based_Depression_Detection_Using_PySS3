Some bottled up emotionsI'm divorcing after a 3 year marriage that was fraught with abuse and infidelity, and when I fled back to the safety of my parents, they announced their divorce 2 weeks later. My mom cheated on my dad. From there, she has spun into alcoholism and I've become estranged from my dad. My sibling and I have no existing relationship. I struggle to be open emotionally with my friends because of the abuse in my marriage, and recently, many of my dearest friends have pulled back. Granted, they have all been tied up in their own ordeals, and I try to extend support when I can. Recently, I've been communicating with an attorney and that has made my ex livid. He's taken this out on me verbally the past 2 days in the form of calls and voicemails. I just, dropping the facade of a well spoken young woman for a second, I'm suffering, I'm in so much pain, everything hurts so badly, I cannot fuckin figure out how to cry out for help. I feel like a carcass all the time. I'm aware that I have a pulse and neural activity and I respirate regularly, biologically speaking, I'm alive. Emotionally, however, I feel like I am filled with rot and decay and nothing. I had no idea what to expect from PTSD, I had no idea that a smell from 13 years ago or the specific clatter that tools make on concrete or a million insignificant things were going to send me into a spiral. I have never been this fragile in my life, everyone kept telling me how lucky I was to be alive when I got home, but I don't feel lucky and I don't feel alive!
