After years of depression, all I've learned is that nothing changesWhen people talk about depression they often say that things will get better. Well it's been 6 years. I still want to kill myself. I've been to multiple therapists, taken multiple drugs, I've tried every thing. And I think I've finally concluded that it will never change. I will always look down at myself, I will always see myself as ugly, I will always hate who I am as a person. I don't think that will ever change. So suicide just seems like the best option. Everyone will be better for it
