i have the day planned when i'm going to attempt suicideaugust 19th thats when i plan to go down to the park and hang myself i don't know why i choose hanging as my method but when i think about killing myself thats what i always imagine. I'm scared and a part of me doesn't want to die but everytime i think about this life and the horrible mistake i made i don't see a point in living. I'm not leaving a note my family will know why i did it based on the date it has a special meaning for me. To be honest i don't even know if i'll actually have the courage to do it but i know i'm going to try starting next month i'm gonna start looking for the perfect tree down there and really get all my preparations in order. I don't know why i'm writing this just hope someone reads this and thinks of me on that day i guess.
