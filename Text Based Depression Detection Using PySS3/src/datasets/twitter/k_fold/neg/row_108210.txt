Iâ€™m preparing to do it if she leaves, Jesus Christ please donâ€™t leave me.Thereâ€™s this girl I like, I mean I really like like, like Iâ€™ve been dating her for about two years. She is my rock and my everything and she is the only thing keeping me afloat in my life. This past month has been completely fucking horrible for me. I got myself into fucking DCS state care and got separated from everyone and her and I feel like sheâ€™s gonna leave me because itâ€™s so much harder for me to come to her and support her and love on her and I want to marry this girl so badly I have 1000 saved up for a ring and I donâ€™t want her to leave I canâ€™t do it without her sheâ€™s the only good thing in m life plassd donâ€™t leave me
