TrappedIâ€™m 17 years old Iâ€™ve fallen into heavy drug use and Iâ€™m on medication for my anxiety and depression. I feel like Iâ€™m already at a really bad point at an early stage in life I just turned 17 a few days ago. Iâ€™m constantly worried about my future and my drug abuse + anxiety and how itâ€™s going to affect me in the future. I feel as if Iâ€™m trapped and stuck into a life of drug abuse and dark paths. I worry that I wonâ€™t be able to take it anymore or be to far gone and Iâ€™ll have to do it. Anyone else have this problem and make it out years later in adult hood or at least past the age of 20? I feel like 25 is where I meet ends, shit scares me to death sometimes man I know itâ€™s short but I donâ€™t wanna grow up i guess? Iâ€™m scared of it to be honest.
