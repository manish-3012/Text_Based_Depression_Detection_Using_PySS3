I'm sick of living a lieI don't think I can do this anymore. I've been keeping up my apereance for years, making my friends and family believe that I am okay dispite telling them how far my depression has taken me. I am exhausted, and I am beginning not to care about the concequences of ending my life. I love my friends and family, and if they love me, they will understand why I made this choice. I had hope for a long time that if I made righteous desicions then it would lead to a better life. Expirence tells me otherwise. It's taken me years to reach this conclusion, I should have done it a long time ago.
