All my life...So, for years... hell since I was, 11 - 12 years old... I've wanted to die... not necessarily suicidal persay.

I lost my father to suicide, I don't think id ever do it myself. But I often find myself dreaming of an accident, or someone else doing it at my work. Etc.

Dying, dying... dying. I don't know why... I stopped wearing a seatbelt... figured if a bad enough accident happens I can be done with it and just become a statistic.

I bought a puppy, for me, my family... my family doesn't want her, she is a lot of work. And they want me to sell her. Hurts, lost 2 family members this year, now a puppy after my last dog died of cancer 3 years ago. Puppy isn't dying of course, but if I sell her she is gone all the same.

My Newphew is 3 years old... eats from a tube, can't talk, walk, might have C. Palsey... my brother is a single dad, im an only uncle. 

Work is good, but my job is dangerous, stressful, chance of injuries, getting killed, etc are relevant.
Just my entire life, I've dreamed of just... dying.

Not by my own hand, that terrifies me. But from something I had no control over. I especially dream of dying while saving other people. I don't know what that says but.

I just, don't know... after getting my ass chewed for 3 hours over a puppy I bought to make everyone happier. Its just made everyone angrier, and myself sadder.

And been really thinking about it today.
