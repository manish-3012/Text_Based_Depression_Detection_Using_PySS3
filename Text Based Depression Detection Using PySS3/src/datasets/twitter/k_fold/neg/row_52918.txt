i don't know what to do anymorei want to die so much. all i can think about is suicide. i have a plan on how to do it, but i'm scared about my mother, i will hurt her by killing myself. 

i am a failure. i'm 23, graduated from high school when i was 19. i went to uni, but failed after 3 years, when everyone was finishing. 3 years of wasting time. i've started a new faculty in october, but it is not any better. i do not work, i cant imagine working and studying at the same time, because i am exhausted just by atending classes. i was hoping for scholarship in the next semester, but i have too low grades. i have no money, no perspectives 

three weeks ago i've found out that my boyfriend cheated on a few times and he was lying to me all the time. i packed my things and wanted to leave, because we kind of live toghether, but he started to crying and asking me to stay. i stayed, but i am hurt. i asked him four things that he must change. first, stop taking to the girl he cheated on me with (she was his best friend btw). second, start therapy. he also have mental issues, and it influnces me a lot. third, find a job (he has no job, no university, he is doing nothing) and fourth to stop drinking (he drinks 4 beers every evening, sonetimes more). and he did nothing of it in last three weeks. nothing. not even stop drinking. i love him do much, but i do not know how to talk to him anymore.

in the morning i've packed all of my things and "moved out" from his flat. i cant stand being with him and i cant stand being without him. i am do confused. 

i want to commit suicide on the following week. i am scared but there is nothing else i can do
