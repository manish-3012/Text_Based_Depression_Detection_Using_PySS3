The few friends I have have basically given up on me as I can't force myself to change for the better, no matter how hard I try. Well I'm done with it. I'm done with my lifeThe few friends I have in my life know how depressed and sullen I always am. And they always told me "Try going to the gym!" or "Be funnier!". Well I've tried everything in the book and forced myself to turn my life around over these past two years. And it's gotten me absolutely nowhere. 

I can't force myself to be funny because it never works and I just make the situation awkward. Dressing myself up better is like putting lipstick on a pig. Smiling more is pointless since no one else smiles back. I could go on. Meanwhile, they're prospering and living their lives to the fullest and some of them even getting engaged. Meanwhile I have yet to even hold a girl's hand at 26 years old. 

I haven't texted them in probably the last few months, and none of them have reached out either. But I don't blame them. I'm not worth their time anyway. I really just don't care at this point. The days all just kind of blend together and I can't even keep track of what day of the week it is because they're all so similar and equally uneventful. 

It shouldn't be this hard. It just shouldn't. Some people are just the lucky ones, so good for them. As for me? Idk. I might just not wake up tomorrow. Whatever the most painless way out possible is, just give me that. Bullet to the head, jumping from a building, whatever. I don't care at this point. And don't bother trying to convince me otherwise because nothing you say at this point will make me feel any better. They're just empty meaningless niceties. 

Goodbye.
