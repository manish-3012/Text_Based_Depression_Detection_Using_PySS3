Thinking I'll die alone because of my looksI have a genetic disorder that makes me 5'0 as a fully grown male. I'm 22 now and didn't really pay attention to it until high school when all my classmates had growth spurts while I didn't. I have had really bad luck with girls. I feel like life won't be worth living if I will be alone forever.
