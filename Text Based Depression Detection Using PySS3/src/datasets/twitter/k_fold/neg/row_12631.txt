Today I may kill myself.Some background: I'm 22 years old, in college. I've had depression pretty much my whole life, but didn't get diagnosed until I was 18. Spent two years in therapy before finally leaving home to continue college. Things were going well until I had a relapse last year. Everything started to spiral out of control and next thing I know I've been forced to move three times, failed to complete two semesters in a row and now failing just one month into this semester. My therapist put me on a waiting list for occupational therapy, but I won't be able to get any help for at least three months. I have an assignment due tomorrow, a midterm next week and I'm lonely. I have tried so many times to see the point in continuing but I feel I'm done. Nothing in life is enjoyable to me any more if it even was, I can't bear the thought of going back home (I hate my country with a passion). None of my friends have the time for me, and even the thought of my family doesn't take away the pain. For several years I kept myself alive because I didn't want to hurt my family, but I can't take it anymore. I don't care they'll be upset, it's not fair that I continue in this state just so they don't feel guilty. I can't bring myself to tell anyone about any of this, so I'm leaving this here so someone will know have read my thoughts. I'm currently expecting a call from my therapist, and depending on how that goes I'm going to summon up what energy I have to end my life.

Currently lying in bed thinking about my options. I have paring knife in the kitchen I plan to use. I live alone so no one will know to come for me (until my landlord comes to pick up the rent). My other option if I can't overcome my fear of how much cutting will hurt is to take a bus downtown and jump off a bridge there. 

Update: My therapist called an hour ago. I'll be seeing her tomorrow, and she's trying to get another psychiatric evaluation for me.
