How I wish, how I wish...I feel like I fell into a hole. And at first it was nothing to worry about, it was fun exploring that hole. I dug tunells in that hole. Creating a maze of it own. And before I realized it I was trapped in there. For years I was trying to find way out.

And when I did, I expected same old world on the outside. World I used to know. World I used to enjoy in.

Needless to say, It wasn't.

I was uncomfortable. I hated every damn second of that world. I jumped back in same damn hole. Far away from any expectation, far away from any responsibility.

Far away from happiness.

I was once again trapped in nothingness, but this time knowing that out there is not better at all.

I'm hopeless.
And If not today, my days are numbered.

Oh how I wish I never wake up again...
