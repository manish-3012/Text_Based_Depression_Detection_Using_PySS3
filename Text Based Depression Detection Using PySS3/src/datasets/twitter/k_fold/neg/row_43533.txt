I have some things to sayOrdinary people seem not to realize that those
who really apply themselves in the right way to
philosophy are directly and of their own accord
preparing themselves for dying and death. If this
is true, and they have actually been looking
forward to death all their lives, it would of course
be absurd to be troubled when the thing comes
for which they have so long been preparing and 
looking forward.
â€”SOCRATES, PHAEDO

I'm not scared to die. It's a choice I made. And I believe everyone has the right to decide whether they want to live or not. No matter what great logic you use, no matter how much emphasis you put on the beauty of life left to live, it will always be an absurd and meaningless existence that has no purpose. And for some, purpose must exist to go on. It cannot be created, it has to exist. And when it doesn't, I choose not to live this life with no purpose. Tell me why I am wrong.
