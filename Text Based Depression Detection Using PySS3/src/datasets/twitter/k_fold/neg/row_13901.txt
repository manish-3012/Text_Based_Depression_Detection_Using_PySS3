I just want to have something in life.I feel like I have nothing in life, I literally have nothing in my fucking day except school, homework, and my phones broken, I have no friends. I literally feel like I have nothing. I literally feel like nobody likes me, wants me, cares about me, or wants to be my friend, I just feel alone in the end and I just want it to stop. I don't know what to do and I feel like I just mess up everything. And if I were to fucking do it then people would say omg he was my friend but those people are the same people that treat me like shit to this point.
