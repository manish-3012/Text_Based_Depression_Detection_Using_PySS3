12th January 2021, my last dayI have decided that 12th Jan will be my last day. I found an efficient method to go through with. Itâ€™s kind of sad that I didnâ€™t experience so many things like a good relationship or having fun without feeling guilty, etc. But I think itâ€™s time I should stop being a bother and just stop being a coward or weâ€™ll become a coward and kill myself. 

Iâ€™ll be counting down till the 12th and well I guess this is a good bye I think. I canâ€™t tell anyone irl about this so I guess you guys are the only people who know for now.

Soon, Iâ€™ll stop feeling like a burden 24*7 on people and Iâ€™ll hopefully not exist.
