I deserve the very worstI just broke up with my girlfriend and the relationship was completely one sided, couldnt bring myself to love her and I ended up manipulating her for comfort and in the hopes that an ugly fucker like me would get a chance to lose his virginity, I have constant suicidal thoughts of going to the woods near my house and hanging myself yet I just can't do it, I'm honestly the worst type of fucking person and that isn't even the start of the horrid shit I've done, I want a good future but I dont work to deserve it, honestly tell me if you think I deserve life, because though I don't deserve the release of death, I would happily die any fucking day
