I wish I had a clone so I could die without consequencesWhen I get really low (which is more often that not these days) all I can think about is killing myself but I cant. I couldn't do that to my family, my mum especially. I just know she's not stable enough to handle that. But that doesn't get rid of the suicidal thoughts, it just makes me even more frustrated. Sometimes maybe I wonder if I actually do want to do it or if it's just the thought that's comforting, so I ask myself "if you could choose to die right now, with no consequences, would you? If you had a clone that would live your life for you and no one would know you were actually dead, would you go through with it?" And honestly I would. But that wont happen. So what the hell am I supposed to do instead.
