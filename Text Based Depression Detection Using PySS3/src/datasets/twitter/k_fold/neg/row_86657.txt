Debating to kill myself.I was the happiest I had ever been back 2 years ago, why? Because I was with the one person that I thought could be the one for me.. after a while she got pregnant and our relationship took a wrong turn. We were happy before this ever happened but me being selfish and controlling got the better of me by not being a mature individual when she was pregnant. I put her through hell during her pregnancy and i didnâ€™t even give my last name. I did so much wrong to this girl and after not being with her for 13 months while texting this right in this moment I still feel the pain, misery, sadness, guilt. The things I put this girl through who never let me down for a second &amp; always put me first. I took her for granted. And now I see the kid mainly during the weekdays Mon-Fri for at least 5 hours. Whenever I head over to her house, the thoughts, feelings, negative forces just seem to collide very slowly or all at once. Every night I think about what could I have done,  when Iâ€™m not sad or depressed I find myself way more mature than the person I was 2 years ago. I know I should focus on my son when I go there but itâ€™s just so hard to build a bond with him because I want us to be a family. (Not marriage) but take baby steps into working things out and see where it takes us.. but I understand that she doesnâ€™t want to. Recently, she texted me stating that sheâ€™s dating someone and it seriously breaks me every time because 1: she has a child, 2: how can you have time to date other people when you canâ€™t even work things out with me? (The biological father) before I got on reddit I was trying to sleep but I failed to because I kept thinking how I failed them (ex and son) she says â€œwhether youâ€™re here or not our son is happy with or without you.â€ I asked her, â€œdo you not appreciate that Iâ€™m the father of your own son and that donâ€™t you think I should be in his life?â€ She said â€œI can really care less if you were in his life, it doesnâ€™t matter to me.â€ Basically what Iâ€™m trying to get at is that she doesnâ€™t give one single fuck about me anymore and I even asked her â€œdo you even want me in the picture at allâ€ (whether visiting or growing a bond with him) and she says â€œno, Iâ€™d rather want you gone and away from us because weâ€™re fine without you.â€ Like do you know how much what you just said can destroy a persons will. I feel like she just says this without thinking or is just a cold-hearted person. I know this is long and youâ€™re probably tired of reading it but I havenâ€™t been the same person ever since we broke up. I know I have my rights as a father but knowing the system and the cost of going to court isnâ€™t worth It in my reality. I also googled â€œfastest methods of killing your selfâ€ and I felt like I needed to just end it all because I failed. Like how can someone date around and not give a crap about the biological father into raising their kid. All my friends that have kids (Iâ€™m only 20 and theyâ€™re roughly the same age) have at least one kid and yet the parents are still together. She says that weâ€™ll never be together and that Iâ€™m not worth another chance because I always mess it up and also Iâ€™m not really a good father figure. (This is what stresses me out the most). Before she was pregnant she lived in a house where they had many babies and adolescents in the home and she was very skillful and basically taking care of them and being â€œbabyishâ€ to them (loving, cute) she has very good experience and babysat before. As for me, i never grew up in a home that made me had to take care of any babies or adolescents until now. She points this out that I canâ€™t talk to him like heâ€™s a baby and I talk to him like heâ€™s an adult. (Idk man itâ€™s just how I am. Idk if Iâ€™m awkward with the kid or something. Iâ€™m just there, I do my best and try to adapt as much as I can) but she doesnâ€™t see that. I ask her for guidance a lot but sheâ€™s always moody. This suicide story is not because one girl. Itâ€™s about me wanting to take my life because I feel like I have nothing to live for. My own baby mama doesnâ€™t want me, she constantly tryâ€™s to put me down and is just cold.. so cold. I hate it. I hate it so much. I just donâ€™t want to be alive to bear life and what it comes with anymore.. I tried going back to school, it failed. I tried working jobs from fast food to warehouse, that failed, I tried dating. It failed. I honestly donâ€™t really want anyone else because I have a son. And that I feel like I have to work things out with the mom and be in unity.. but thatâ€™s not how life goes.. if you made it this far I humbly appreciate the time you spent in touching into someoneâ€™s life. &lt;3
