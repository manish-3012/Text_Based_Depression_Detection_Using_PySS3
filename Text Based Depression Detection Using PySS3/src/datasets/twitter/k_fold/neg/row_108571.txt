Becoming an old celibate man basically means there is no reason to liveThe average person will gouge at you think you a freak of nature, something out of a movie.

To them you are no longer a person but a phenomenon, a case study of what theyâ€™re happy they have not become.

Soon there will be no turning back and eventually Iâ€™ll have to decide which floor to jump off from. Or if I should keep up this starving of myself and eventually just rot away in my home.

In one way getting splat on the street will atleast get me noticed but on the other itâ€™s so shameful Iâ€™d rather just turn to dust in my bed.

Hugging the emptiness, the only thing in existence that has ever willfully wrapped itâ€™s arms around me.
