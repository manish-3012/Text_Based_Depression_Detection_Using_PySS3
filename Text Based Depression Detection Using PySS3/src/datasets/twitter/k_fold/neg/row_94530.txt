Itâ€™s my 21st birthday today, and the birthdays just keep getting more depressing every year.The title says it all basically.

I havenâ€™t had a birthday that I can remember where anyone actually celebrated it with me, and it pretty much always has resulted in me wishing for the day I outlive my parents, just so I can finally do it without killing them too. On my 18th birthday, I just took a bunch of edibles and turned my brain off, for this one, similar.


Iâ€™m a fucked up product of a messy divorce in which my parents drained about 2 million fitting with each other with lawyers, and fighting over my sister and I. My 4-years-older sister took her anger out on me, and my momâ€™s love was extremely conditional. Itâ€™s left me with fucked up sexual and romantic desires, and made me insecure and inept at socialization. 

Iâ€™m a strong submissive and really desire finding someone also into all of that, but the pickings are extremely slim, and Iâ€™ve usually just ended up with sociopathic women that will eventually kill me. I donâ€™t know how to have a relationship on equal terms with someone, much less play a leading role, and itâ€™s basically a condemnation to eventually marry someone that will destroy me, either that or to live alone, with nothing but my fucked up thoughts and weed.

I made somewhat decent friends in high school, at least those I could pretend were friendsâ€” but pretty much all of them have moved on with their lives and Iâ€™ve gotten more and more isolated socially. I went to college on the west coast freshman year, then sophomore year I transferred to a better east coast school, but I really donâ€™t have any quality friends at all, and anytime I try I just say the wrong thing and feel awkward or just simply get ghosted. I have a few guy friends but we just smoke and play Xbox together.

Sorry for the long ramble, Iâ€™m just having a rough night
