Oops...Yesterday, I rage-quit my job, was on the brink, but called my parents and told them they needed to come pick me up. I also handed over my revolver... Now, this morning, I feel like I've made a huge mistake. I really wish I had just gone through with it. Now I'm on my parents' radar big-time. They won't drive me back to my apartment. Feeling captive in this life has made me suicidal. Asking for help has made me more captive and powerless than ever before. If there is a God, I really hope I get the chance to kill him/her/it/them.
