Im not sure how to keep going anymoreI've never posted before so sorry if I don't know what I'm doing.

I've been debating this for a long time now and I honestly think I might go soon. All my life I've had poor health, mostly in my heart, and constant pain from other problems. I've lost all but two friends outside of my family and we haven't spoken in half a year. The majority of my family are culty religion nuts (I have nothing against religions) that live solely by the word of God and think I do the same. I'm in a mentally abusive relationship with my father yet I can't get away from him. My best friend is my grandmother who may not live through the night. These are some of the problems I have now and I can't take any more of them unless I want to end up either on my death bed or in the middle of nowhere walking as far away from my life as possible. At this point I just need some help with what I can do and maybe some chats with someone in a situation almost like mine.
