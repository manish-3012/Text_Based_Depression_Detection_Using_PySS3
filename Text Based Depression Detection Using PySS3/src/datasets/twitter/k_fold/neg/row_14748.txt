They donâ€™t love you like I love you.I already wrote a note the night before last night. 

Yesterday my husband talked to me about the possibility of separating. I donâ€™t want that. I know Iâ€™ll be utterly depressed, and I can only last in that for 10 days. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with ptsd since back in Feb. I had to chose the hospital, and my husband took care of the kids. I did a out patient treatment program after that. I came home after everything, and he told me heâ€™s been angry and annoyed with me for a long time. Iâ€™m doing my best at being functional. My nightmare still happen. I take rx, and go to therapy. 
What Iâ€™ve been trying to live as isnâ€™t good enough. 

I donâ€™t want to leave my kids, but itâ€™ll be better if they grow up with one parent. Iâ€™d be dangerous olive with them. They have grandparents near by. My beloved rejects my affection daily. I have a heart ache, and head full of terrible shit. I do my best to be present, but Iâ€™m tired of being in a world thats BS. I never felt safe. I trusted my husband, but its only lasted 10 years. I never tried to change him. I accepted him. I realize now that the life I made is unhappy and unwanted. 

I hate that Iâ€™m a fool in love with someone who doesnâ€™t want me. Iâ€™ve never been  rejected by a lover before. It cuts deep. My children are sweet. I just donâ€™t want them to be the oneâ€™s to find me. Iâ€™ll have to go to the field or the woods.
