Lost and ashamedI don't know what's stopping me. I guess I'm just overthinking it. Every day I want to die. I have no friends. My family lives about 6 hours away so I don't see them often. I call them every week but we are not close. School is a huge drag. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I've tried so many things to make friends and nothing has worked. I am just that unlikable. At best men use me for an easy fuck. I'm literally human garbage. I want to die just to make other people upset. Maybe then they'd actually notice me. Maybe then they'd care. At least for a little while, until I'm forgotten. 

I'd like to give my family some money and maybe my car somehow. Honestly with how poor they are even a few thousand dollars would be better than having me be alive and being a useless waste of space. I'd like to find a home for my cat. He deserves someone to take care of him.

I'm most worried about messing up. I don't want to deal with the aftermath of a failed attempt (hospital, possible disability, etc.). I don't want to send my family all my money and then not have it work out (I'm sure they would not send it back). But I've got to try sometime. Can't die without trying, unfortunately.

I don't know why I'm so scared of even trying. Can't be worse than my current experience. I wish I could just pay someone to shoot me in the head. I'm such a loser. I wish I could be better.

Disclaimer: I've done the whole round of treatments: therapy, meds, inpatient and intensive outpatient hospital programs. Recently started looking into therapy again but I did it for 5+ years in the past; I don't think anyone's going to tell me something I haven't already heard before.
