My dog died today, the only reason why it was still worth living...He was already really old, 13 years already, he got very sick two months ago because some bastard poisoned food and he ate it, as a result he was also half blind and half deaf, he's been with me since he was a puppy, all the memories are coming to my mind and I'm getting really depressed, the suicidal thoughts are coming back again and I stayed away from them for a few months and I thought I had overcome them but no, I think I've hit rock bottom now.

I want to die now, my dog was what kept me alive and what cheered me up in those bad days, now I don't know what I'm going to do because I'm also a pussy and I know I won't have the balls to kill myself...
