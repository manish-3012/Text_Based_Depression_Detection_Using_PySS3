Well I think this is finally the end for me.My roommate (old friend) who I was living with is moving out. I haven't been able to get my own place. I lost my job because my car died (transmission) and on the verge of becoming homeless. He's pretty much the only person I have. I have no support otherwise, nothing. I've been trying my hardest to rebuild my life but constantly getting kicked while down. I'm battling severe depression, bipolar 1, anxiety and PTSD. Next to no hope for me making it out alive. He'll be gone for a few days and have an empty apartment to myself. It's the worst feeling in the world to have everything crashing down around you all at once. Especially when you've put your all into life and got nothing back. It is what it is I guess. Just another worthless nobody gone forever. For no one to notice.
