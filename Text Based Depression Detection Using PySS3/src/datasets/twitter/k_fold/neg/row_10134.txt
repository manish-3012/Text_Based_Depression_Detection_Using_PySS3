Chronic back pain got me contemplating suicide at age 23I've been suffering from severe and chronic back pain for more than a year now. My entire spine is deformed, I had a slipped disc herniation back in September 2019 and I think I suffered another disc herniation just recently when I moved forward too quickly.

Now I'm just 23 years old and my therapist told me that I'll be unable to live without painkillers by the time I'm 30. I tried everything. Gymnastics, meds... Nothing helped. I went to the gym almost every day even before I had my first slipped disc. I can barely sit on my ass for longer than ten minutes, I can't lift heavily anymore, I can't do physical labor, I can't sleep properly because of the pain.

My life is fucked. I'm a useless sack of shit. I can't ever work properly and despite me being able to walk, I'm pretty much bedridden at this point. I will get a prescription for strong opiates and down the whole package. I can't do this anymore. Life is not enjoyable with this condition.

TL;DR: 23yo, severe and chronic back pain, can't deal with it, am committing suicide very soon.
