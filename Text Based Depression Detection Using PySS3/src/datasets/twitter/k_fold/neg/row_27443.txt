The elephant in the room- rantIâ€™m going to make this short or else Iâ€™d be writing a novel.
Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for a very long time, even before I knew I had depression. Iâ€™ve attempted it more than once in the past year. My first â€˜officialâ€™ attempt left an elephant in the room that is still here to this day. 
For the first and last time, I decided to slit my wrists sometime last year.  Perhaps it would have worked if I waited a few more minutes, but midway through 17 year old me panicked. I begged my brother to take me to the hospital with blood soaked arms and he did. I was put on suicide watch and made my mom miss 2 days of work. Which she made a big deal out of, though I understand. My mother refused therapy and refused to get the medicine I needed to help my lack of potassium.  (We have another elephant in the room, her name is â€˜Eating disorderâ€™- yay). 
After things simmered down, my brother and mother no longer talked to me and I was ignored for months. I could tell they dreaded me by the insults they gave me when I did try to speak with them. Tensions were high in the house for a while and eventually, I had to shove everything under the rug as well if I wanted to speak with my family. 
 I want therapy and lord knows I need it, but I will only succeed in making my mom angry by mentioning it. Which I find amusing, seeing how she has also claimed to have depression several times (Sort of off topic, but this was revealed when I found messages on her phone that indicated she was cheating on my dad. When confronted about it, she faked swallowing pills as a â€˜suicide attemptâ€™. We freaked out only to have the doctors tell us there wasnâ€™t anything in her system and then blamed us lol.) I donâ€™t know if her own suicide attempt makes her doubt me, but itâ€™s come to the point where even I tend to doubt if I truly have depression or am just exaggerating it.

Anywho-Itâ€™s a bit strange, but the idea of taking medication sounds like a literal dream. Though Iâ€™m afraid that at this pace, itâ€™s going to be a while before I am able to receive it with or without family support.
