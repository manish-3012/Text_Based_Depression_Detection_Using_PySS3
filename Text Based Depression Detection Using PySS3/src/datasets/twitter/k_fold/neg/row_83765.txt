My friend told me that I'm the only reason she hasn't committed suicide, what do I do?Today I had a really long phone call with a friend I've known since kindergarten (we are now both about to turn 14) and in the middle she admitted she had been thinking about suicide and I'm the only reason that she decided against it. She was a lesbian and now is considering herself asexual (still going by female though) and I've known for a while that she probably has a crush on me. I'm straight. I don't know what to do. If she finally admits it to me then what can I say without ultimately pushing her across the edge. I'll admit that I haven't been in the best mental health either but none of us are in the current situation so I don't know if she's serious. It's not like her to take things like this lightly so I suspect she is. I don't what to tell anyone about this since I know her parents are pretty strict and might not be as understanding as they should and if I talked to my parents, they'd go straight to her's. What should I do?
