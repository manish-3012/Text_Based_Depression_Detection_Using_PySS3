regrets are killing meI made so many wrong decisions in life ... and I can't bear the regrets. I should have done everything differently. I feel like I am not competent to live on this planet. I did my part and failed miserably. I developed social anxiety over time, I let money and societal expectations determine my decisions, but was too ill informed too make the right ones... I don't have any friends left, no valuable degree, no life partner, ... Why prolong this useless life? The only thing I can think about is all the wrong decisions I have made in life.
