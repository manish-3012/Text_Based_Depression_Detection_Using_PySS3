i canâ€™t remember my life without depressiongranted, my memory is shit, but for as long as i can remember, iâ€™ve wanted to die. in the past 2 or 3 years itâ€™s just been getting more intense and i feel like iâ€™m getting closer and closer to finally committing to killing myself. i want nothing but death and my only fear is the toll it will have on my sister. no matter what i do and what changes, i feel like an outcast.
