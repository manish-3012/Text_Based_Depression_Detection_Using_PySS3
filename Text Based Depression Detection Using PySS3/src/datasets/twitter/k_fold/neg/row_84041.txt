I just can't.I was supposed to go to the doctors today to talk about my suicide attempt last weekend and sort my medication out. But the thought of it makes me so anxious, I haven't got out of bed all day. I still want to die and I wish it had worked. 

I'm off work next week but the thought of going back makes me want to cry. 

Do things ever get better?
