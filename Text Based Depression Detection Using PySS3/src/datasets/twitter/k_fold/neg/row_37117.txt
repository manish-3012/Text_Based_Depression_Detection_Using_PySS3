I'm feeling lostI'm crying as I'm writing, but I've been crying the last 3 days anyways. 

Recently I had a Covid19 test done, and havent returned to work - they need a negative result. I've been home by myself while my s/o works. With the holiday weekend, I've been more depressed and stayed/slept in the computer room. As each day passes I become more tired, empty, and alone. I can't bring myself to eat. It's been about 3 days. My bf has only texted me while I'm in here. He says he cares but doesn't come in the room. He also had a holiday weekend off and won't see me. Only came in the room once to put food on the floor. I feel like a dog right now. I think I'm done.
