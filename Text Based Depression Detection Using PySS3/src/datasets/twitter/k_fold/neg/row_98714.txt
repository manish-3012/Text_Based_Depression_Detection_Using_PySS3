Created a life I can't leaveHi.

It took me an embarrassingly long time to work up the courage to post here. I guess I saw it as a sign of failure, a sign of giving up, but I don't now. I just want someone to PM me, just to listen and respond. I've somehow created a situation for myself that I can't see a way out of. I don't want to get into it in this initial post, but I really want to talk to someone.

I know this seems like a cry for attention, but really, its a cry for help. I'm aware enough to recognize that.

Thanks.
