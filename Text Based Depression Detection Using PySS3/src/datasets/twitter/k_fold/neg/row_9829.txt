I will not commit suicide todayI think I have convinced myself that this is the only way. I'm always sad everyday. I hate the feeling when my heart begins to sink. I don't want to feel anymore suffering. 

People say that suicide is selfish. But they don't understand the pain inside. It's not selfish because the pain is unbearable. 

People say that when you commit suicide, you are weak. I disagree, it's not weakness or strength either. When you commit suicide you give up EVERYTHING. And most people are afraid to die. 

I just want to sleep forever and I don't want to think anymore. I don't think counseling will help because in order for it to be effective you need to help yourself to recover as well. And I just don't think I can convince myself to get better. 

I will not commit suicide today, but I think the time is coming.
