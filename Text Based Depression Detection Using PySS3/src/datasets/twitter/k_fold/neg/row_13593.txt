Is there a way to escape the cycle?I've been in therapy half my life for depression, (10 years) and they've only reaffirmed my initial beliefs. I've changed so much on their word, self sacrificed physically over medications that didn't work, reinventing myself too much and too far, leting myself be cheated and used again and again, but nothing changes. I've turned to philosophy and the pragmatics of some religion and wholeheartedly convinced myself a way of thinking to keep this thought process at bay. I'm the one everyone comes to when they need help. For a while, that's what kept me going. I always seem to have the right words and actions for others, but nobody has ever had them for me. I don't know if I'm just damaged beyond repair or why I can't think my way out, but I'm desperate for a suggestion. I hate attention, I hate that I'm making a post here, I just want to hear something new.
