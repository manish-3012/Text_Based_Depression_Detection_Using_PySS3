I donâ€™t want the life that I have anymoreI canâ€™t seem to catch a break. My mother gave me a life I never asked for, with mental and emotional abuse as well as just straight up lies all the damn time. 

I was bullied severely in secondary school from which I still have PTSD. 

Four years ago, my dad died. I was 19 and at work. He collapsed from heart failure on the bathroom floor. I only found out later that when he collapsed, my mother never called an ambulance and he probably could have been saved had she done so. Instead she went to a neighbour with zero medical training to help. 

The job I work earns me a pittance, and I canâ€™t find anything else because corona. I hardly earn enough to pay bills, but I manage to. Iâ€™ve never been in debt in my entire life and I intend not to be ever.

Then my partner of six years leaves me for someone else back in July this year. Iâ€™ve been effectively trapped with them. I applied for social housing because my wage is so low, but theyâ€™ve denied me because Iâ€™m not on benefits, Iâ€™m not in threat of violence, I donâ€™t have children and I have â€œadequate housingâ€. I canâ€™t afford private rent, so now Iâ€™m screwed. I have nowhere to go. 

I donâ€™t want this life anymore. I havenâ€™t been happy in god knows how long. I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore. 

Iâ€™m literally living for my cats currently. How sad is that? Not family, no friends, no nothing. This isnâ€™t a life. Itâ€™s just endless, needless, suffering.
