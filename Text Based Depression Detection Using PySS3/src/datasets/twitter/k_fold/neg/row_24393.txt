Not really living, but I guess I am still aliveMy mind does not undersand how is that I am not killing myself now, instead, I am waiting a few years because of my parents. I can't work and I don't have the motivation to keep living... I would rather be dead, waiting for the time to kill myself gets boring and makes people think I want to live.

I have what I need to kill myself, I should just try to die, instead I just pass the time in things I don't really want to do, but I do to keep my mind occupied. 

What's the point if I am going to kill myself anyways? I made the decision years ago and I haven't changed my mind since then. I am stacking benzos, and antiemetics for my future suicide attemp (hopefully it's not just an attempt).

I don't really get why other people choose to live. I don't care if "it gets better", I don't want it. I don't seem to be able to make the final choice because many things could go wrong, fuck.
