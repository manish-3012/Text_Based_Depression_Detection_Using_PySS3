Feeling suicidal but im only 12 helpOk so most or all read the title and i dont know what to do im thinking of suicide constantly because of my school bullies and how i have almost 0 real friends in school also my parents are divorcing but that hasnt affected me too much. And the bullying isnt that loud type or physical but they constantly talk about me behind my back or insult me straight one kid even tried to destroy the connections that i had with 2 friends and for one it worked also theyre constantly imitating me and making fun of me but never when the teacher is around and the worst part is the teacher thinks im making the things up and when he doesnt the other students lie and say i was the one who started there even was 1 girl who told me she could help and i confessed to almost everything but later she joined in on the bullying too also my siblings are constantly calling me fat and retarded and my mom used to do something about it but now she doesnt care anymore and my dad is very strict and saying that im too soft also my dog basically my only friend had to be given away and even i think im a pussy for thinking about suicide when 1 im too scared to do it and 2 i dont even do self harm or anything else because they hurt
If i had a way to end it all quickly (unfortunately shotguns and poison cant be reached very easily by 12 year olds) i cant do anything and i dont know what to do i have a good life but every night is start considering suicide, thinking about it and sometimes planning for it any advice on what to do?
