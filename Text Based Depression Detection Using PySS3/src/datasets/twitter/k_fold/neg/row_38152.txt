Why is it every time I meet a girl I want to kill myself?Was just at a party hosted by my friend. Had the usual socially awkward experience followed by the usual kinda sorta good time that came along with it.

Met two girls that were into me. Even exchanged instas and kissed. Wound up being such a cuck that I couldnâ€™t even get their attention afterwards. Wanted to go stick my gun in my mouth or go take a dive into the redline. I could get as far as the altar and get fucking ran out on because Iâ€™m such a retard autist haha. 

But hey thatâ€™s life, eh?
