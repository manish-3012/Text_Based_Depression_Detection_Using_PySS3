Spiraling and no one to helpI find myself mentally spiraling every single night, in a pattern of self harm thoughts and actions. I want to die, I want to let myself go, but I'm scared of messing up and ending up in the hospital during a time where they are slammed with the pandemic. I feel like I would end up dragging out my suffering, and I would want to make sure I succeed if I do it. 

I feel like no one in my life cares and I'm withering away. Can't sleep well. Can't eat well. I've been drinking and smoking every single day for a bit now and don't want to stop because I can't deal with the sober reality.
