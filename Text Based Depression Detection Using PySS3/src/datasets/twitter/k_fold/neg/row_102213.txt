I almost died last night.I almost died from alcohol poisoning last night. Yesterday I started drinking at 11 am - 11:30 am and didn't stop until that night around 9 pm  9:30. I also drank an entire bottle of dxm cough syrup to. I drank big glasses of wine and took shots every half hour pretty much until last night. I was blacked out and then I came back. I felt a switch go off in my body and I couldn't breath or talk, walk ,move do anything. Everything stopped. I had to tell myself to breath like in, out for a little while until I tried to get help. I realized then I had no control and to force myself to breath. I fought with everything I had. I remember putting my face in a garbage can shortly after and puking. I Instantly felt better. If I didn't puke I think I would of Died. I don't know What to think. After all my suicide attempts and then this. Thanks for reading If you did.
