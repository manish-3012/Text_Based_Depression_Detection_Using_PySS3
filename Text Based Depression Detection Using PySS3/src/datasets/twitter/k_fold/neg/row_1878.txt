I am in so much pain right now it's almost completely unbearableI'm in such intense emotional distress and being dead feels like a comforting option to end my suffering. I know it may be an overreaction but being alive and pretending things are okay when they're not for so long feels like torture. It just hurts so much, I'm very empathetic and I overthink about others and it burns my soul to watch people suffer and not be able to help because I can barely help myself anymore. My stomach is constantly in knots, my heart is racing, and I can't even think straight. It's just too hard to clear my mind of the injustice I see around me, good people being hurt/punished while cruel people are rewarded. Why is some of humanity so relentless and quick to sacrifice others? I don't want to be around it anymore. I have no one to tell this to, so I'm venting on the internet. Thank you for taking the time to read this, if you did.
