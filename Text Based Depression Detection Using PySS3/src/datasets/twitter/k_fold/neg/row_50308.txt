I don't think I was so close to the end, ever.I just can't stand me anymore. Life has been full of shit. I went through a breakup, now my ex spreads horrible lies about me which are taking all of my friends away. I am being harassed by a friend of the family and do not know what to do. I started self injury again, after almost one year of not doing any harm to myself, which was a very big deal for me. Now it is destroyed, gone and worthless.

 I smoke more, I am constantly drunk. The memories of my history of child abuse is destroying me inside, I can't sleep because the only thing I can remember is what happened to me back then.

I feel alone. noone wants to talk to me anymore. I feel horrible about myself, and I think I am starting to hear voices. And I do not want to contact professional help, they will just lock me away in the mental hospital again which is one of my biggest fears. I feel like I have noone to talk to, I am lonely, I am hated, I am fat, I am ugly. 

And tonight I am just sitting here crying my eyes out. I want to end it so badly. I want to disappear and I think noone apart from my family would even care.

Just please, anyone, please do something. I do not know what. I just need someone, anyone, to know that not everybody hates and ignores me. Please.
