I wished I got the virus and dieActually I just wished I could have the courage to open my mouth and confront sexual predators when I get harassed or assaulted or bullied, so that I donâ€™t have to carry these burdensome thoughts of shame guilt and regret. I hate People 

I donâ€™t have great social skills, and I have so many many many devastating issues that makes me unable to get along with people. Partly my mental disorders, partly my issues. 

I hate myself. I wished I wouldnâ€™t. I think this is killing me the most.
