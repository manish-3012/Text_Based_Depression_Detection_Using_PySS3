Suicidal girlfriendOk so long story short - i met this girl and we hit it off. Been together for a few months now. Everything seemed fine. 2 days ago she starts messaging me super dark stuff about how she "doesn't see herself living for much longer" and how she knows where and how she'll do it, etc. This is my first time dealing with somebody who seems so serious.. i read that if they have a "plan" then they are long past the initial idea of flirting with it and they are close to doing it. She wanted to be alone all week except for yesterday. I finally get to hang out with her and find out if she really feels like this or if this is just some sick cry for attention.. well, she seems committed to the idea still.. so i passed this information on to her brother.. he's been in contact with her family and we are trying to figure out what to do. Apparently she's been depressed for years and years and it's finally come to a head.

Any advice would be awesome.. i don't want her to hurt herself and her family..

The idea of an intervention has been brought up but if that goes south then she'll probably speed up the process. I have no idea what i need to do..

Thanks..
