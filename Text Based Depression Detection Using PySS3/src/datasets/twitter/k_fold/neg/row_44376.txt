Should I go or should I stayI have been having really suicidal thoughts lately and my depression is probably at its worst right now.
I keep wanting to end my life but then the thought of my granma and my girlfriend pop into my mind and I dont ever wanna hurt them in that way , especially my girlfriend because her dad took his own life when she was younger....I honestly dont even know what I'm typing, I just feel like there's a lot on my mind and I don't know how to let it out
