I made an idiot of myself on the first day of workHey guys! I can imagine a lot of you reading all of these posts, so i'm gonna cut short to save you some time.


I was at work today. Just finished school, and was looking for a job shortly after. I'm lucky I found it! It felt really good to get on with it.

However, i failed on the first day. I missunderstood the assignment, and I *failed* the entrance exam. I'm going it again tomorrow - but I feel like shit now. I thought i was a good, and a smart person. Me failing was the complete opposite. I am nowhere near the person I want to be, and I have never really been.


On top of that, I feel like everyone hates me. People tell me i have tons of friends, but none of them call me or talk to me unless i call them first.


Pretty much the only thing I can feel good about is that I'm pretty good at making music. I hope that's my future. If I don't kill myself before then
