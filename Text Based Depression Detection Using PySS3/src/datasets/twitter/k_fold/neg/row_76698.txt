help with relapsingim self-harm sober one month, and i feel like relapsing and killing myself. my whole head and body aches, itâ€™s not that iâ€™m sick though, itâ€™s the same feeling that i got before when i would get depressed. i look at my friends, and i realize that most of them donâ€™t even care, like they donâ€™t reach out to me, and when i do, they brush me off. i donâ€™t feel like iâ€™m fit to live. iâ€™m trying not to cut but like ahhhh, itâ€™s so hard and itâ€™s making me feel worse.
