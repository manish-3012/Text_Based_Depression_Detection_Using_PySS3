My partner's ex committed suicide a week ago.My partner and I lived on opposite sides of the country, the night she was flying here to stay for several months her ex ended her life. She was suffering sever depression and my partner was there for her and didn't want to leave her without anyone to talk to, so they never truly separated which I accepted. There has been many suicide attempts over the last months and it was getting to the point where my partner was drained and was caught between leaving and continuing to stay.

The real issue is now she is very hurt obviously and is struggling with the loss. If there's any advice for her that'd be wonderful. Her ex was her closest friend for 5 years and I guess she feels as though she let her down.

As for myself, I am in an awkward situation. I feel quite hurt in a way I didnt expect. I'm kind of haunted by questions about her ex, did she feel any pain? did she feel happy at all before going? did I in any way cause her death? If she had of tried to find something to motivate her would she have overcome it? I can't talk to my partner about it and I have explained that to her. It's all too overwhelming for me. I haven't really confronted death before, especially in such a strange position. 

I feel as though I want to know the good things about her ex, so that we both, mainly my partner, might remember her for positive reasons. Do you think this would be a good idea? I'd like to sit and laugh with her and share some small memorial.

I'm quite lost with my emotions, but any advice would be great. Also, I'm posting here as I'm not sure where else to post.
