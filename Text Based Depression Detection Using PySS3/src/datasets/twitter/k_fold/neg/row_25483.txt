Todayâ€™s the dayIâ€™ll be gone not too long from now. Hoping I donâ€™t pussy out. I feel itâ€™s now or never. Once I say goodbye to everyone I have to go through with it otherwise Iâ€™m just a fucking pussy. Iâ€™m a pussy for doing this anyway but honestly I donâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™m tired of living for everyone but myself. I am so fucking pathetic.
