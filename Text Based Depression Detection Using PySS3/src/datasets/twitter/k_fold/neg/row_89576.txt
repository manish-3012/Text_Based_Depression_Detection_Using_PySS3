New plan: starvationI know what I can do. It came to me in this beautiful moment of clarity. 

My anorexia nearly killed me a few years ago. I went to the ER and had to get my gallbladder removed and everything. Hair falling out, 90 pounds, the whole 9 yards. 

I loved when I was in full restricting mode. I felt so much control. 

I'm going to starve. It will happen gradually. Drinking water for 2 months until I'm underweight, and then it's just a waiting game. 

I can feel all that control again. Over my eating, and my death. 

I won't fail this time, because I know I nearly succeeded once with the same method. 

It's perfect and poetic and I feel so relieved that I finally know what to do. 


It's so simple. 

I just have to be patient.
