Panic AttackHallo, does somebody know what to do when experiencing an anxiety/panic attack? 

Besides that Iâ€™m not sure what to do, my whole body is aching and Iâ€™m about to hurt myself because I donâ€™t know what else to do anymore, my lives really been a mess lately. I barely have contact to other people anymore. I know that my family is worried about me, but they donâ€™t really care anyway.
