Iâ€™m sick of myself.Iâ€™ve been holding on for so long and Iâ€™ve despised myself more and more every day. Iâ€™ve held off killing myself, made every excuse not to die. I canâ€™t even get past survival instincts when I try. Iâ€™m trying to get my degree, canâ€™t find a job because I havenâ€™t worked in three years and resume gaps look horrible, have been getting by on my student aid, and still live with my parents. My mom is starting to threaten to kick me out despite all the effort I put into helping our family and getting my education. Itâ€™s not her responsibility to help me anymore as Iâ€™m 21 now. I live in a high cost-of-living city, donâ€™t have to funds or resources to move out, and itâ€™s hard to find cheap apartments or roommates here, so Iâ€™m stuck fearing that Iâ€™m going to be left out on the street. A minimum wage part time job while Iâ€™m in school wonâ€™t even be enough to get s roommate or apartment. I have nowhere to go, no car to sleep in. Iâ€™m so tired of all of this. Tired of myself. Iâ€™m never going anywhere in life and this all seems like a waste of time. I just want to die. I keep trying to find ways to survive, but Iâ€™m reaching rock bottom and starting to consider truly taking a cord over my door and getting this over with. Iâ€™m so lost and I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do. I hate myself.
