why do people lie to me so muchi was going on dates with a person that i liked and i was really happy because it seemed that they liked me too up until tonight when they told me they actually thought i was very unattractive and my body was gross

why the hell would you lead me on like that?? if you think im ugly then dont fucking go on dates with me. this has happened to me once before too and i really dont understand it, all it does is make me have awful trust issues.

im having a hard time wanting to stay alive at this point. im kinda planning to either swallow all my medication with alcohol or jumping off a building and i dont know what to do. i just dont get why people lie to me
