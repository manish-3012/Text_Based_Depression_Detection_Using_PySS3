This is a post about a man named Luke.Luke, a man I met on Omegle around 7:30 pm, committed suicide around 8:30 pm.

Luke had severe mental issues, he had panic attacks around 5 times a day. He and his girlfriend were having some issues, both feeling sad around their significant others. He had 8 panic attacks today and had one right before he committed suicide. He was very worried that his girlfriend would break up with him the next day because of what was happening with his relationship. I tried to help him and offer support to get him professional help, yet to no avail. He was grateful for all my help, and my support meant a lot to him. His girlfriend broke up with him right before he committed suicide by jumping off a building. His final words to me were 

" By the time I have sent this last text I will probably be near the ground so I hope you have a great life and thank you very much."

For the little time I knew him, he seemed like a great person and would've been a great friend.

Rest in peace, Luke.
