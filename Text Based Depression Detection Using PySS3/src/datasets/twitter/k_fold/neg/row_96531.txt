I'm 42 years old, and I don't feel any betterHow long do I wait for life to be worth living before I accept that I will never be happy? Do I wait until I'm 80 to off myself?

People have been telling me since I was in my 20s that I have my whole life ahead of me, just wait, things will get better. They don't. I'm more than halfway to the end of my life, looking forward to even more years of unhappiness? No, thank you.
