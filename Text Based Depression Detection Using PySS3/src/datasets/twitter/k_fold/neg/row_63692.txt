Do y'all know this feeling of emptiness?Do y'all know this feeling of emptiness?

Your stomach feels so fucking empty but at the same time you feel like you have to throw up?

Your head feels so light and you feel so weak? 

You are so dehydrated, didn't care to drink in a few days?

Lying in bed and are so fucking tired but can't sleep?

You just feel this bad feeling of emptiness?
