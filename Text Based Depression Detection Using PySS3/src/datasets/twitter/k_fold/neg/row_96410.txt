Why even bother trying anymoreI dont have anyone left. He is the only one I would even consider talking to but he's done with me, thats really fucking clear. i don't want to bother him anyway. i've been the crazy ex girlfriend already to someone else, i dont want to burden him with that as well. he doesnt deserve it.

why does no one ever want a future with me? the first said he didn't see us being together. you said you weren't ready for the kind of committment i wanted. all the others just faded away after getting what they wanted from me. just a warm body.

i think about doing it. ending it all. and i feel calm wash over me. i wouldnt be such a burden to anyone anymore. they might be sad for a little bit but then theyd all forget about me soon enough. he'll find someone better and he'll marry her instead and have babies with her and i will be but a distant memory.
