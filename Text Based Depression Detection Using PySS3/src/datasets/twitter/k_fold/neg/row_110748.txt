it breaks my heart going thru this subredditit breaks my heart going thru this subreddit seeing so many young people already giving up on life, myself included. why are so many people suffering? why do they continue to suffer even with years of therapy, medication and trying to be better? how the fuck am I supposed to believe in a god who wants the best for us all when I see this shit? what the fuck is the point, can someone please give me a reasonable fucking response?
