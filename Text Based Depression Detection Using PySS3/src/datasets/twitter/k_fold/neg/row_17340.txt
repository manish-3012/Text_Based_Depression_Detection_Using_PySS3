I am doing it tomorrowGuys, i have reach an end. I have tried, really tried. At first i didnâ€™t want to leave my mom like this but i really cant keep going on and i hope she will go on. I am going tomorrow morning to buy a rope and then to a forest to hang myself. I always though this was just a phase but i know now it is my destiny. Nobody wants me in life, friends, ex or even my mum. She must be sad she has someone who is like me. I hope you all find better luck than me.
