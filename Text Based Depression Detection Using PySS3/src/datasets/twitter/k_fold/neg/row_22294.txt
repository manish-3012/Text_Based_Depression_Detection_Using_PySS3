I feel so lost and i donâ€™t know what to do anymore.Iâ€™m 22 and I have a 2 year old son. Heâ€™s so perfect and I love him so much. But heâ€™s the only thing I feel is keeping me around. My husband hates me because I have a low sex drive and Iâ€™m not physical enough. Heâ€™s right to hate me. We havenâ€™t had sex in a few months. I hate sex sometimes. I hate all physical stuff really. 

Iâ€™m not romantic enough. Valentineâ€™s Day came and went. Weâ€™re not a â€œclassicâ€ couple with flower bouquets and spontaneous kisses. I donâ€™t like that stuff. We arenâ€™t compatible. We married too fucking young and now weâ€™re both trying so hard to make it work because we do love each other, but Iâ€™m a fucking asexual or something god knows what the fuck I am. And heâ€™s â€œnormalâ€. 

I was so depressed for so long. I cut myself and starved myself and would literally hit myself just to FEEL something. Then my son was born and everything got colorful again. I went to school and started my degree. Life was so good for like 1 year. Then it progressively got worse and worse. Now i feel back to the way I felt when I was 17 and alone and scared. Iâ€™m sitting on my bathroom floor crying while I write a fucking suicide post on reddit. 

I stopped thinking about death for SO LONG. I actually got uncomfortable with the thought that Iâ€™d live longer than my early twenties. I never thought about it until my son was born. But he made me want to go. 

Now itâ€™s just dark again. Heâ€™s my last thread and now that heâ€™s more independent, walking and talking a little, I feel like he could be without me and live an ok life. 

My mom is a great caregiver for him. My sibling love him. Heâ€™d be surrounded by love. 

Fuck Iâ€™m such a bad mom for wanting to leave him tho. I donâ€™t have a valid excuse. Iâ€™m unhappy in marriage? Fuck me just get a divorce right? We tried and we both got even more depressed. God fuck I feel like im surrounded by black fog and i just want to fucking die and make it go away. The sun came out after 20 years of darkness just to tease me into thinking Iâ€™d have a warm happy life with my son, only to rip it from me and make it even worse once he was older. 

Idk what to do. If I explain this to anyone IRL theyâ€™ll take away my son and put me in a hospital. It happened when I was a teenager and almost again just before my son was born. I wonâ€™t be taken from him again unless itâ€™s on MY terms. 

And what if I go to hell or something. Iâ€™m not religious but you never know. 

I have syncope and faint sometimes, and I want to be forever passed out like that. Like, a coma sounds better than death. I just want that floaty black feeling I get when my brain runs out of oxygen. Itâ€™s so sweet compared to this fucking life I have. 

Iâ€™m so ungrateful my life is glorious. I have a nice home and a healthy son. Iâ€™m in school and my family is generally happy. 

I donâ€™t want to die but itâ€™s my only other option if I donâ€™t want to live. What the fuck am I supposed to do?? I donâ€™t want to leave my son but I canâ€™t go on anymore. Iâ€™m so tired and alone and sad and itâ€™s so dark. I feel so fucking edgy saying these things. I havenâ€™t felt like this THIS BAD since I was a teenager. God fuck.
