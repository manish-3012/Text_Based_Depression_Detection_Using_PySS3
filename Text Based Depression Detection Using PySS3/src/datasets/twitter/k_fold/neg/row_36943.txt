Trying not to leave too big of an impact.So, I'm planning on shooting myself, and as much as I dislike my parents, I think it would be a good idea to do it somewhere away from the house, so I don't leave a mess. Would it also be wise to call it in to the cops beforehand? Any recommendations on a general type of area so as not to disturb people? I already have the gun, I just don't want to be shitty about it.
