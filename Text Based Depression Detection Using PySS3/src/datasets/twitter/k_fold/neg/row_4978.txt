I have no controlI have a long history of bad habits, some with consequences, some without. I've always had an easy time coping with struggles, because of some traumatizing experiences I've had. But last winter, I broke completely. I slit my wrist, but was saved by my caring mother in due time. This I have put behind, it's just another scar on my soul. 

Last night my best friend and his significant other broke up, and I sadly used that to my advantage. In the flow of alcohol and high mood, I spend the night with her, I betrayed a close friend in one of the worst ways possible.
I woke up this morning feeling like how I did, when I was hospitalized, empty, angry and confused. I want to cry but I can't, I want to hurt myself but I can't make myself do it, I feel like the biggest asshole ever.

I can't tell him, I can't do it, I'm too weak

Me and her have made a deal to keep it between us, but I don't know if I can trust her, or if I can trust myself.

Because in the end, I have no control over myself.
