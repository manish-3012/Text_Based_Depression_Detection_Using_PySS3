I want to bash my head against the bathtub until it's a bloody pulpI got kicked out of a top school 2 years ago which made me the biggest loser in the eyes of my parents and my older peers

My boyfriend throws things at me and calls me names but I feel like I can't leave because I'll literally have no one else

Fuck. I just can't take it anymore
