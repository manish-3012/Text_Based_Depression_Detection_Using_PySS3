No more fucking aroundThis weekend is it. I've had a change of plans in how I'm going to kill myself. I'm going to take the pills I have and drink myself to the point where I'm close to passing out, but I'm going to have the noose around my neck. I've finally found a spot that'll be sturdy enough to hold me. From there I'll just keep drinking until I pass out and let the noose do the rest.

I'm so tired of this life and how much pain I'm in. Every single day gets worse and I can't handle it anymore. Life isn't worth living
