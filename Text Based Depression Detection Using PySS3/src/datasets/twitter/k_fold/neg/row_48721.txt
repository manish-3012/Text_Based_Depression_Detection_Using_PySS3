Guys, it's been two years and growing; but I've realized that suicide my be the only way I can be happy.I am not a funny guy. I am not interesting or entertaining. Iâ€™m that one guy who has zero to contribute to the conversation except my presence. I really have tried but after each attempt I am left no better than feeling stupid or worthless. My group of friends care about me but I think just because Iâ€™ve been around them a while. I look at their situation and see myself as someone who is easily replaceable. If I left, all I would be is an empty spot on the couch. Conversations would go on, activities would resume and the world will rotate as if nothing happened. Even when I talk to my family it seems distant in conversation and emotion. The only feeling I get out of the conversation with them is anger or nagging about how Iâ€™ve disappointed them again.  I have tried finding someone special to be with, a girlfriend but never had any success. Believe me. I have tried hard! but after all high school, two years of college and no successes, I just feel lost and done. Iâ€™ve only kissed two girls. This isnâ€™t a sudden feeling, it has been growing for the past two years. The one person who has made me feel best in the past two years I havenâ€™t even known. If Iâ€™m no one to others and myself, what is really the point of carrying on. All I see in my futures is student loans and work. Life, it seems, is just not meant for me.
