There are Some situations where death is the only way out, this is one of themI live in poverty with two abusive parents who canâ€™t hold on to money to save their lives, who blame me for everything wrong in their lives...
I used to think that Iâ€™d get away from them and get better but itâ€™s like nothing turns out and I always end up back in hell with my two demons.


Suicide is my only way out at this point... I know that theyâ€™ll twist the narrative so no one ever knows it was their fault  but I donâ€™t care...

I want to die so fucking badly that I overeat in hopes that Iâ€™ll have a coronary, I pray for a blood clot, I hope to be caught in a firefight, a nuke accidentally goes off near me, anything I just want to fucking die
