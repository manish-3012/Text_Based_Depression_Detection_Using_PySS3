I'm going to kill myself.Everyday is just too much for me, I just wanted to write this down somewhere before I "departed", and I didn't feel like looking for a pen and notepad, also before anyone tries to say *think about your friends and family" or "you have so much to live for*, I don't have any friends and my family hates me, and I have no reason to live, even if I did I would probably just kill myself in year or 2 anyway. I just felt like I needed to put this out there before I'm gone, so I guess if anyone that does know me reading this, then I guess I will have to say goodbye.
