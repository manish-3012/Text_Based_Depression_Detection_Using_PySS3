i want this cycle to endi almost killed myself last night. itâ€™s been my third attempt. i really donâ€™t want to exist anymore. i seriously wish ive never been born. 

i feel like i cant act like myself in front of my friends or theyâ€™ll leave me. if i share too much with someone i spend the rest of the day panicking and considering disappearing. im seriously the worst person, im selfish and i constantly try to change but im still a piece of shit no matter what 

i donâ€™t get along well with my parents, even when i was a kid they hated me, they would constantly say that if it were legal to kill me they would. despite that ive known them for so long that itâ€™s hard to imagine what life would be like without them. i have never felt like ive loved my parents but if im away from them for too long i start to miss their toxic habits. it makes me feel disgusting 

i try so hard to be different things to please people that i feel like i donâ€™t even know who i am anymore. i try to be funny, be nice, be quiet, anything positive iâ€™ll try to make it who i am. but i never feel like any of it is me. sometimes i feel like all i am is depressing all the time. i cant go a day without feeling horrible, sad, and wanting to get rid of myself. 

every day i tell myself im gonna get better, im gonna try harder to be the best person i can be but at the end of the day i go bad to feeling like trash. i always go back to feeling horrible no matter how many times i try to change. ive only ever told one friend how i really feel and he said it seemed like i was obsessed with hating myself and putting myself in toxic mindsets. i really think he was right. i always go back to my terrible ways because what else is there to go to? being awful is all i have 

i always split on my friends too. i go from thinking theyâ€™re the best to thinking that theyâ€™re all fake and that they hate me. ive never told them this because i donâ€™t want to hurt them. everytime it happens it makes me realize that they donâ€™t deserve to have such an awful friend in their lives . i seriously have no idea why they ever wanted to be friends with someone as pathetic as me in the first place 

sometimes i wish i never had any friends so i could just kill myself without anyone caring. and honestly when i think about dying im scared, i really donâ€™t want to but it feels like something i need to do. i cant go on with the pain every single day, and really does someone like me even deserve to live? the world wouldnâ€™t even care if i just disappeared, everything would keep going on and no one would be all that bothered about it. 

im sorry for complaining but i needed to get all this out.
