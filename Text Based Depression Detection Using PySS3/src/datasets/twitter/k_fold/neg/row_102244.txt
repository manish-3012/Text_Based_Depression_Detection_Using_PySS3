I know what you're going to say, and I still want to kill myselfI tried to kill myself twice this year. Once on April the 14th and again on the 20th. I feel unwanted, and worthless. The only people that will touch me only do it because it's convenient, not because they have any care for me that would incite actual intimacy. My therapy and pills don't make the days better. Whenever I make myself happy it's just temporary until I can't bottle things anymore. I'm only desirable and liked when I'm happy and charming, confident and sweet. I can't be like all the time though. Because it only takes a little nudge to open the bottle. Because there's no point in talking to me when I'm down, because I'm not desirable when I'm down. 

I help people all the time. People who are sad or distressed. I'm really good at it, and I have a great talent for empathy. So I know everything anyone would say when talking to me. I know what you'll say to make me feel better and I know that I still want to kill myself. I want to never feel again because it's not worth it no matter how many times I fool myself into thinking it is. I just what to kill myself and I hope I can manage to soon.
