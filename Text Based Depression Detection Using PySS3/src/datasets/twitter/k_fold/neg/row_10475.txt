I'm still here and I don't know why.As I sat in my car completely alone last night, I had finally come to peace with dying, and the thought of not being here. I relished the certainty, something I haven't had for quite some time. I smiled to myself, and grabbed my pills. 

40 Xanax later, and I'm still here. I can't even kill myself properly. I'm trying again tonight.
