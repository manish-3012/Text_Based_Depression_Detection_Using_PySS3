I donâ€™t want to die but Iâ€™m done with everythingI know this might feel like Iâ€™m just desperate for attention but Iâ€™m just so done. Iâ€™m always stressed with homework and school. I can never focus bc Iâ€™m too addicted to my phone but itâ€™s my only escape from reality. My parents are always mad at me bc I never practice the piano or finish homework early. I barely get sleep. I just donâ€™t want to live like this anymore but I donâ€™t know how to turn my life around. I know that Iâ€™m too young to be feeling like this and my life is too good for me to be feeling like this. I have friends, I have way too many possessions and my family is mostly good. I donâ€™t even know if this is the right subreddit to post this on. I just needed to vent on how done am I with everything. Iâ€™m meeting with my school counselor next week to talk about my feelings but I just needed to tell someone before and I didnâ€™t want to put this burden on my friends.
