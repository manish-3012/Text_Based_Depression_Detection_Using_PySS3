Once I hit a certain goal, I will probably kill myself.Giving myself around 116 days to complete it. That'll be before or around my 20th birthday. Tired of myself, tired of the world, tired of feeling like a burden, and tired of being fucked up. I just want to go to sleep, and never get up again.

I've got Windex (with Ammonia), more Ammonia, and a plastic bag as options. Nobody will probably read/care, but that doesn't matter I guess.
