I'm planning my 3rd Suicide attempt.I've tried overdosing twice, and it's clear that is not going to fucking work, so I'm going to try something a little different: sleep deprivation. I'm certain I'm going to succeed this time with the amount of coffee and Monster energy I have at hand.
This has started yesterday. Every successful all-nighter will be posted here. And if it does not work, I will go to ridiculous measures to ensure mortem.
