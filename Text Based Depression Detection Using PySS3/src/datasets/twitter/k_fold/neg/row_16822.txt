I need someone to talk to please help meI want to die so bad. Killing myself is all I think about lately. The thought of dying feels comforting but terrifying at the same time. I feel like Iâ€™m meant to kill myself. I need to die but Iâ€™m scared.

Iâ€™m in so much pain and Iâ€™m so overwhelmed and no one cares. Nobody even suspects that Iâ€™m depressed or suicidal. I just need someone to talk to who also has depression and who understands how I feel. Iâ€™m desperate.
