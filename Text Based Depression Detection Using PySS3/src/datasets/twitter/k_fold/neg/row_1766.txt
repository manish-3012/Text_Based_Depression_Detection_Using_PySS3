I could kill myself right now and Thisinformation overabundance has become chaotic. in the mass of human existence the input of information is too much for one human mind to comprehend when the mob bands together. the overload is too much to bear, and the fallout is an enormous weight on the psyche of generations of newcomers. who are we, anyway? strangers in a crowded room, waiting for something. Waiting for a new day without the screaming and elbowing of fellow tormentors and agony of painful expressions. 

Release me from the cramped suffocating inexistence that surrounds this life, please God. I believe in my only flesh the sanctuary of imprisonment, my eyes the only surveillance of these atrocities out in this cold, dark, space. With an empty, absent, thoughtless God that weeps from nowhere for no one in the sounds of silence bound in confines beyond fearful skies.
