i think i may be finished or i may not beim sick. not physically sick but emotionally sick. depression is what sometimes a doctor may call it. i have bad days then i also have really bad days. 

today is a bad day. i ache when i have no pain. i cry when there is no tears.i feel sad when nothing is hurting me emotionally. im loud when there are no words exiting my mouth.

you may say what about good days. they don't exist. you may say they have to exist well they exist as much as the monsters in my closet or my closest friends (which i have none of) i have no friends i ran them off. they don't like me as a person. i now don't even think i am a person. everyday it takes me a long time to wake up. i lay there wishing id die but then i hear my mother yelling my name because it is time to get up to get ready and go to the place i hate the most (school). 

i think about killing myself every day but somehow i manage to never do it. but to be honest one day i sat with a bunch of pills next to my computer ready to be thrown into my mouth and to be swallowed slowly causing a quick and easy death. but it did not happen.
