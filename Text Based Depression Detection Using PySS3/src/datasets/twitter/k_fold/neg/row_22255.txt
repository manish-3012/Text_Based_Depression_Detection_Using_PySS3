I dont want to become an adult.I'm currently 16, struggling with suicidal thoughts for almost two years now. I know I wont be able to deal with the responsibilities of being an adult. The world scares me, I'm scared of everyone and everything, only feeling happy when I'm not awake and just sleeping. That's why I try to either work myself into exhaustion by drawing the entire day, doing piece after piece, or sleeping for hours even when I'm not tired, it's when I dont have to worry about anything and can just not exist. That's why I planned a way out before turning 18, faking sleep problems so I can get sleeping pills to take enough to not wake back up. 

I know this is only a ramble, but I need somewhere to get this off my chest because my therapist is on holiday and I dont want to tell my mom to not worry her.
