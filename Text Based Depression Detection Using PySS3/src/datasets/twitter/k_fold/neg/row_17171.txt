I hit an all-time lowI just really need someone to talk to. I am 19. Have a final tomorrow. Not even gonna show up. I cant study even though I like my major. I feel really stupid and incredibly disappointed and without energies to keep going. Never had a gf. Not any true friends. I just feel a little bit of happiness when I'm drunk. Thinking about suicide every single day. Thanks reddit for existing...
