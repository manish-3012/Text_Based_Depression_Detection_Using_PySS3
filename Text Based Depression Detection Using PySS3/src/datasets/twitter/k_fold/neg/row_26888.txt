Getting by, this helps me for a while (long text)Came to reddit to find some help from suicidal thoughts, created account just now, dont even want a reply from anyone, just want to let everything out somewhere.
I come from a big family, my parents were never married, lived in a pretty poor country, my parents used to drink almost everyday, lived with my older sister, twin brother and little sister, my parents would almost kill each other every once in while by trowing plates and other stuff such as knives at each other, police would cone and take my father for a day or two and he would walk back home (50km or so) and it would repeat , my mother was usually the one causing that, used to taunt my drunk father and use us as human shields from time to time, would sleep outside once in a while, moved to a bigger town, was poorest person in class so felt embarrasted, never had money to do anything so never hanged out with people, was very smart, top 10 in school, was told that education decides how you do in life which i learned later was bullshit, in the end never befriended anyone.

I did not or maybe could not think about it as I was pretty young then but my father was very bad with people but he still very much loved us, never really showed it but I kind of understand that now as im older, it all changed at some point, moved house multiple times, moved away from my father with my mother and siblings, my father became a lot better a few years before he died of old age, I probably only talked with him for less than day during the time that I had known him, we spent time together(not in fun way, more like doing work or eating together, or getting driven to school) but we would never really talk, there was never something to talk about, my last fond memory of him is when we ate breakfast he made without saying anything, that was probably when I understood him a bit , just the two of us a year before he died.

most of the bad stuff happened before I was 12 or so so after that it was pretty good, I remember the time when I waas between 12 and 18 as my best years as I somehow did not worry as much about anything and I have pretty good relationship with my mother as everything changed and I know my parents loved me it was just a bit weird.

I dont even know if i was sad or not when he died, i tried to be normal in front of people so learned to fake tears, as i grew up to be pretty bad with people (maybe genetics) never really cared much about anyone, never really had a friend, I try to pretend to be fine however recently that has been pretty hard, it is almost as if i have another personality when im with people that help me get through the day until im at home.

My sister suffered from deppresion however she was seeking help im pretty sure she would have commited suicide by now if she didnt have her son. as for me im currently in college, lived with my sister for a year then got kicked out(she helped me move out but i felt like getting kicked out, I do not blame her or anything, situations happen) as she and her boyfriend had a little unplanned accident which will need a room, she didnt ask for rent, only living expenses, was in the middle of a course on my second year in college, could not get a loan, so I "cant affford to live" working part time job which covers part of my current rent however it is not enough, had some saving so using that to make ends meet, i know i will lose my job in a month because my course is gonna end and we have to train guys for next year, tried getting government help finding a job but have been told they wont help while im in college.

I live in a small town that closed multiple factories and shops so there are a lot of people looking for work and pretty much no work, cant afford a car, so chances of finding a job are slimmer than aluminium foil, no idea what im gonna do in a month when im out of money and cant afford food/rent.

As indicated previously, my family is poor so i dont even dream of getting help, one of my brothers is pretty well of however i was told by my sister that he never really considered me family (he was 20 when I was born so we never really communicated) I have a lot more half-sibling however i dont even know their names.

I had anxiety for most of my life which makes it very hard for me to do anything, it takes me an hour of mental preparation to go shopping or get a haircut, I probably could not even do that if I was not responsible from my siblings when I was younger which forced me to be an example however it makde me very tired of everything. 

Been depressed for last 2 years, my anxiety prevents me from opening to people and sometimes I just burst like this to random people online, this probably is the only reason why im not hanging somewhere, every time i try to get help from someone my voice doesnt come out as I feel that everyone has it hard, some people most likely have it a lot harder than me, people who are responsible for someone like fathers who support a family and cant get a job, so I feel like someone like me who has no purpose and never really connected with anyone is not worth the support that could be given to someone who deserves it.

I am currently broke, unemployed, depressed, have anxiety and no friends, been showing fake smile(I never really learned how to  smile naturally so im told that its creepy when I do) to people i know to get by and forcing to do stuff like looking for a job knowing i wont be taken as there are hundreds of people applying for any position who have more skills and experience.

Cant seek for any kind of mental help because of my anxiety, besides googling and chatting online, been having suicidal though since I was 8 but always hid it very well, im 20 now and been having them almost every day for the last year and know that it is getting worse and worse, It is not like I want to die, It is more like I find it easier not to live, I believe that after death we are in the same state as we before we come to exist so nothing really matters cause in the end we wont feel or remember anything we just dont exist.

This probably also helps me not to do it with the excuse that if I fuck up I will just die anyways s might s well just spend all my money on a plane ticket to some random place nd just "exist" until I die somehow, so it is like this: "why try when it doesnt matter after you die", "dont want to kill myself because that will cause grief to people that still have to exist for a while after im gone" and " why kill myself when i can just go on and in worst case scenario i will die suffering which once again doesnt matter after you stop existing".

I know that if my financial situation changed I would be just fine, I even had goal at one point for a week however I realized that I wasted the years of my life in school, college and doing nothing productive because I didnt have any kind of dream, goals at that point and though that by doing well in college I will easily find work.
If I spent a year working towards that goal now I might be able to start making money out of that, would always be told that i would just find something to do and it would work out, however it didnt, I was just going with the flow and thats how im where i am, 

I am probably gonna be fine for another month until im at the point of fucked up when my fear of making other peoples lives hard(by not being able to pay rent, making them feel bad for me or even try to help me), fear of talking with people and me being unable to do anything clashes with each other. Will probably continue posting my thoughts like this somewhere, maybe go chat with people on CALM website, never done anything like this post before. Maybe someone enjoys reading this, i dont even know if this has any purpose besides letting myself type everything out, maybe it is a therapy on its own, I hope i get by somehow and can look back on this in a few years.

I often talk with myself, im bilingual so I sometimes even have 4 types of thoughs, 3 in english 1 in my native language which in itself is very weird from time to time, its like there are 4 different people with the same life but different attitude arguing, one of them is suicidal and pessimistic, the other one is the one that I use when im in public or have to talk with people, the third is fucked up, i wont even post what that though thing says as its too fucked up, something "mild" would be going to a store, wrecking havoc(without harming anyone) nd then slicing my throat. now that i think about it one of those personalitiy things is writing this, not sure which one it is, probably the end it all one, been writing this for an hour which will probably will let me fall asleep tonight, might be able to skip suicidal thought tommorow even :D 

 if anyone reads this, dont worry ill be fine for while at least and probably just gonna go with the option3 of trying to live and in worst case scenario just die because im homeless or something, my suicidal thoughs probably come from the idea of me causing trouble or grief or dissapointment to people i dont even care about which is pretty ironic. 

I have also been thinking about the future from time to time, at one point in my life i was hppy to live in this time, but when I think about it we live in the time of change, a revolution of sorts, when jobs are becoming scarce simply because everything can be done by few people controlling machinery, robots, self driving cars, automated checkouts and self-service computers so most people who need to work until they get qualifications for work that hasnt been replaced yet are in shitty situation with not much hope, when you look at it, those few huge companies like Amazon are pretty much forcing franchises to close because you can buy anything online, making a lot of shop irrelevant, amassing huge amounts of cash which they just absorb to expand, but they dont employ many people as almost everything is becoming automated instead, so it will only get worse.

Also recently found out that i have another shitty situation in my hands, i currently live in UK, came here once again by going with the flow, however my home country recently started conscripting, I had no idea about that as I was away, then found out that they dont even send letters or call or even have to inform the people who have been put on the list to conscript, so I am also on that list, im currently studying but they dont care, they can move the date but i would need to spend days trying to get document which I would need to translate by people who do that which would cost me a few hundred pounds and send it back and i would still need to spend 200-300 pounds to go back to my country and go through multiple checkups, however i dont have that kind of money as they only provide 50 pounds for travel expenses, failing to do that will cause me to get 200 pound penalty after which I would still need to go back which once again is impossible because of my situation, cant get loan for this either because my financial situation sucks, after failing to pay the penalty you get another 200+ pound penalty and can get jail time after that, it seems there re no exceptions and they dont care about "financial situations", the amount of cash a conscript gets is 300/month so it doesnt really feel like an opportunity, and it seems that even if i got through the checkups there is a big chance I would not get taken in for the training as im at the end of the list, they conscript only a few hundred people(out of thousands on the list) a year because most of the training centers are full because of volunteers there (simple put anyone not on the list can volunteer to get payed more than someone on the list so a lot of people do that) however even if I dont do the training (9 months) I still have to go back and spend the few hundred (which i dont have) to go through checkups after which I would need to come back home and would not be able to afford rent. 

So even if I find a job I still have another shit sandwitch which would require me to spend hundreds on translating document to move the date of checkups, then once I finish college I would need to quit my job (which i just got) to go back home for a month for checkups without a place to live and money to travel, or I could find a job pay penalties, however I would still be on the list so in the end I would have to repeat that every year hoping not to get jail time. I been eating noodles for the past 2 months spending 20 pounds a week on food, I am using a 5 year old phone that barely works, fixed my computer recently but it seems it will only work for a year at best, last time I bought clothes was a year ago. I feel like my situation is getting worse, not sure when is gonna be the point of "well it can only get better now".
I am probably gonna have updates here, dont worry if i dont or dont reply i might just create another user as i sometime create random accounts.
