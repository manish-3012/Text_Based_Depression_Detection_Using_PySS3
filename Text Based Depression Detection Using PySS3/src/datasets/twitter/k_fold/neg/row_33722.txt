Troubling time, seeking someone to talk to before it gets any worse, preventative measures.Long story short, I was an ass to my girlfriend and she dumped me. We are friends now but itâ€™s not the same and I really just want to be back in a relationship with her. I canâ€™t sleep, I donâ€™t have an appetite and Iâ€™ve lost a lot of motivation. I feel like Iâ€™m just falling apart. It was about 3 months ago now that this had happened, we were dating over a year and we both thought that one day we would be married and have children with bright futures.

My college work is slipping. My first semester I intentionally failed English 1302 Advanced College Rhetoric in order to grade replace it thinking nothing of it. Now I have failed College Algebra. Iâ€™m not dumb, I was top 10% of a 6A high school in Texas, I just have no motivation to do my work and itâ€™s scaring me. I feel like Iâ€™ll never accomplish any of my goals with my current 2.8 GPA and Iâ€™ll never get into law school. Iâ€™m losing friends and I donâ€™t necessarily have the best social skills to branch out and meet new people. I drink to go to sleep and very rarely does it work. Iâ€™m heavily addicted to nicotine and canâ€™t get off of my Juul. I go through a pod in a day or 2 ( 1 pod = 1 pack of cigs) and Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s all going to catch up and hit me at once.

I feel like i would be much happier if I had someone to talk to. I miss my ex so much and I just want to be back with her. She was a perfect match for me and i completely fucked up everything. I took on a car payment adding stress and I just took it out on our relationship and destroyed everything. Not to mention I also wrecked that truck about 2 weeks ago, perfect representation of how that truck affected my life; complete wreck.

I really just need someone to talk to who isnâ€™t going to get tired of this, who wonâ€™t tell me to just cut her out of my life and move on, I need someone who understands what itâ€™s like to have everything fall apart at once and not know where to begin feeling better. If it makes it any easier I am a Christian but I donâ€™t feel like God has ever been on my side. I just want to put an end to these feelings now before they evolve into something worse. I have a family history of clinical depression.

TLDR; life is falling apart and Iâ€™m trying to feel better, preventative measures before it reaches a point of no return.
