Letting it go slowlyI've already made up my mind to let myself wither away. I'm only 35.

My life has gone downhill like crazy over the past year as I suffered some health problems and did some very regrettable things. I prefer not to go into vast detail but I've hurt the person I love most emotionally beyond I believe what can be repaired. After fixing some of the health problems I suffered and I started finally feeling better the damage was already done and it was too late to show her how much I loved her. She says she is afraid of me and doesn't think she would ever be able to get past it. She said she has grown to hate me and it makes me sad to think the person I love most in the world despises me and no longer wants to be with me.

You can call me selfish I guess to just let myself die cause I can't be with a person I care about. It was only solidified this past week as I looked on tinder/bumble/okcupid and pretty much every other dating app/website there was, some of them I paid for but noticed the moment I did the "likes" just vanished, figured they were scams but now I know they are.

I don't think that I'm bad looking and that is why I couldn't find anyone to at least match with and talk to, I mean I'm 5'11, 158 lbs, went to gym regularly, had around 12% body fat. Face wasn't bad with my beard, hair was meh since I've been receding since high school. She always said I was attractive I never believed it and now I know it more than likely to be true.

I'm afraid my children will never understand the reason why I let myself go down this path. I'm just trying to make every day of theirs enjoyable until my body finally gives out. I've pretty much stopped eating and starvation should start to set in within a week. I'm also on TRT (testosterone replacement therapy) since i was diagnosed with BPH and low testosterone last October. I know once I stop taking my shot my levels will crash hard and the massive depressive episode I had one time from being off it should occur again and I'm hoping that is the time in which my brain doesn't try to stop me from just popping a bunch of pills and drifting off.

I told her before that without her I'm nothing and I'll be dead, I guess she didn't take me seriously. She's gone and has no plans to even come back or even give me a chance in the future so whats the point. She was my other half and saved me from essentially committing suicide back in 2005 by joining the military and going straight into infantry as I felt useless and worthless.

You can call me whatever you want I guess, selfish, crazy, spoiled, bratty, a sociopath or narcissistic like she has in the past, but I as she knows, whenever there was something that I truly wanted I ended up getting it and I'm not going to deal with being without so fuck it.
