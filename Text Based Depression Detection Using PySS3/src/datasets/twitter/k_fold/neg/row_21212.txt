What's the point in livingWhat's the point of living. I'm always scared my fiance doesn't care.. I've become co dependent and its unhealthy. I do not have parents that are really in my life actually not at all. Ik constantly sad and stressed. I never feel good enough. I'm not capable of anything. I'm 20 and dont resp smart enough to do anything l I'm always scared and I'm just so idk empty? Depressed? Sometime I rather just disappear. I'm tired of being afraid and alone.
