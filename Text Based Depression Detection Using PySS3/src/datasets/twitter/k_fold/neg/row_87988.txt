15 year old, Asperger's, failing grades, and unexplained attendancesI just feel really stupid and ignorant. As you've probably guessed, I'm a 15 year old kid living with Asperger's Syndrome. I have been just feeling so depressed lately. My grades absolutely suck, we're working on 3 major projects in my school, I've gotten detention TWICE for stupid reasons today (first is just failing to get one little detail on an assignment, the other is attendance, which I haven't missed any classes), my Spanish teacher is an ABSOLUTE PSYCHO and is a total asshole to me, and it's even gotten to the point where my Dad is extremely pissed off that I'm so depressed. Please.... I need to feel happy again, people of Reddit. Help me.
