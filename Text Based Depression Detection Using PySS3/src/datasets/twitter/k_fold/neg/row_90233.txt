It hurts too muchI just got out of a serious relationship a few days ago. He was my bestest friend and the person I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. Iâ€™m kind of an introvert so now that heâ€™s gone I donâ€™t have anyone anymore. Literally no one. 

And not to sound over the top or dramatic, but the pain of losing him is honestly so unbearable that I donâ€™t know how long I can do this - want to do this. There are other reasons behind my longing to end my life, but losing him has really pushed me to the edge.
