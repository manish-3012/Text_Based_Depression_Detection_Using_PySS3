Putting a bullet in my brain on my birthdayIâ€™m honestly tired of everything in this world. I want everything to end, just to disappear. Erase myself from peoples lives and not exist anymore. My birthday is up in two months and times go by, each day, each moment makes me want to put a bullet in my head every waking moment. Just gets worse and worse, Iâ€™m sorry for everything. Just please let me end it already. 25th birthday and Iâ€™m going end it. That way I go out the same day I came in this pitiful and disgusting world...
