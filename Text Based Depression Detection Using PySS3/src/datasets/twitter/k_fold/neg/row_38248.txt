My Plan to DieI'm 21 years old. That's about a fourth of my life (if I'm lucky) and I feel like the years are only destined to go downhill from here.

I live on a couch. My mind is not as healthy as it once was, I smoked so much weed that my memory is fried. I'm a skinny small-boned fuck that women love to use for sex. Most of my friends don't like me anymore, and I'm pushing the ones I do have away.

My dad was a heroin addict for half of my life. I think in true fairytale format, it's time I follow in his footsteps with one lovely, lethal dose of heroin to the vein. I plan to go to NYC and study the behavior of the locals, see who's shopping. I want to be in the ground or wherever the fuck my family puts me before 2021 begins. I graduate college then, and I don't want to even begin considering a job search.

I really hope someone in here can help me figure out a way out, because I don't want to stick around. Making money, music, traveling, sex -- those things don't do it for me anymore. I'm done.
