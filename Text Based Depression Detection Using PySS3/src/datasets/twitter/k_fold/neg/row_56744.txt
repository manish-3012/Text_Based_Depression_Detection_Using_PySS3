Only posting this here because no one else cares or responds to meI'm just trying to air it all out here. I don't think I'm suicidal despite having suicidal thoughts at times (though I may be exaggerating or being dramatic) I think I'm pretty normal. I have an ok job, despite the fact that I travel a lot but I work with guys that are all my age and their all really good guys in general so it works. I'm ok with what I do, I'm good at it and I like the people I work with but I get no satisfaction out of it. My longest actual relationship with a female is 5 months, I'm 25 (M), I don't know what to do anymore. I guess im just lonely what ever respond if you want I dont care
