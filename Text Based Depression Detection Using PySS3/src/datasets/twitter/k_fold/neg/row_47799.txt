What if there's no escape from existence?One of my biggest fears about ending my life is that there's no guarantee of peace after this life ends. What if it doesn't all fade to black? What if my awareness doesn't cease to exist, what if it continues on forever, just in a different form? Note, I was raised without religion... yet this thought plagues me. Does anybody else ever think about that?
