Been thinking about killing myself almost every night lately for the past month.I especially think of the impacts and ripple effects that would occur if I did go through with it. 
A good friend of mine recently killed himself just a few months ago and I've seen first hand the effect it has. But I feel like I need to do it, like I'm on a time limit that if I don't do it soon, I never will and I'll be stuck in this form until my natural death comes for me. 

Tonight an old memory of another good friend of mine from high school popped in my head. She called me late at night while she was stationed in another state telling me she wanted to kill herself, she had the method ready but called me as a last ditch effort to save her. I talked to her all night while trying to get ahold of her CO and mom and was finally able to talk her down. Six years later shes married and has a beautiful son who brings a smile to her face unlike any other. 

The thought resonated with me because I feel like I'm in that same position now but I don't want to put my best friend through that ordeal. Having to lose sleep over me when she has work in the early morning. Having to suffer through the complaints I throw at her. Forcing all this emotional baggage onto another person doesn't sit well with me because I hate being a burden. If I just offed myself I'd be a burden on their minds for a little bit but they'll all move on to new things and the pain won't be as bad anymore. But if I stuck around who knows how long they'll have to put up with me.
