iâ€™m conflictediâ€™m conflicted on whether i want to end it all today, or wait it out a little more. although, iâ€™m leaning more towards just getting it over with. my life is a complete mess right now, and it seems like i canâ€™t get anything figured out for myself, and just one bad thing after another, the next one always worse than the last, keeps happening. and.. it just doesnâ€™t seem worth it anymore. and iâ€™m so tired, of everything. just.. wanted to spill somewhere, since i donâ€™t have anyone else to say it to.
