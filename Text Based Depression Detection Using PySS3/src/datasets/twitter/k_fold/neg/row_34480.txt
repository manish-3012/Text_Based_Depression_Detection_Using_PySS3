I was molested when i was younger and now i will never be free from this mental traumaIt feels like my mind has been tainted and i will never be able to trust people in my life. I cant tell who is going to hurt me so i isolate myself, i want to have a day where i dont think/feel my past but my mental health is deteriorating quicker and quicker and i now doubt i will ever be free from this. Right now dying feels like the less painful and the option where ill be at peace. I'll still find it hard to do but i feel like tonight might be the night where i go through with it i have a plan and i dont feel scared. Right now any time i dont spend on this feels like delaying the inevitable
