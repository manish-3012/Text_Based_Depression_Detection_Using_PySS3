Is there really a point to me living with severe anxiety and OCD?If Iâ€™m too scared of being hurt or inexplicably scared of doing something wrong because of OCD irrational worries, despite not having a desire to, what is the point...to live in fear and uncertainty and self-hatred and depression? My head is a constant whirl of never ending anxiety. I go to therapy and use counseling apps and have been hospitalized and been to an outpatient program. Yet the days Iâ€™m happy and calm are limited and always quickly end. Iâ€™m really tired.
