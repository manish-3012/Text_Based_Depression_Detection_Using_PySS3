Getting from one day to another is getting harder and harder.I feel so tired all the time. At night I don't want to sleep, and in the morning I don't want to get up. I don't know why I keep going back out into the world each day, I can't remember the last time it made me feel happy. 

At this point the only reason I'm around is for my family, I don't have any personal desire to keep living. I guess I fear the pain of death as well.
