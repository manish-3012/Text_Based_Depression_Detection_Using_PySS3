Feeling like everyone would be much happier without me.I'm not sure I can keep feeling this way. Have you ever felt like if you disappeared or just died that no one would even notice. Not even the people you hold so dear to your heart. I've been screaming for help for a year and no one even cares. No matter what I'm wrong. For once I'd like to be acknowledged and respected. I just want to feel loved, I just want to feel anything other than despair and distrust. At this point in time I'd prefer to not exist at all than continue on fucking up everything and everyone else's lives, I'm only bringing them down. I wish I could take back all the hurtful things I've done to people, I wish I could rip out the parts of my brain that cause me anxiety and hold memories that I wish didn't exist at all. 

Most of all, I wish my wife loved me like I love her, I wish she had the same feelings for me that I do for her, I wish I could know for sure whether she's being faithful. I wish I knew how to trust her. If my marriage and family collapse, I'm as good as dead. I'm terrified that these past 6 years were for nothing. 

Just need someone to talk to. Someone to help me understand my mind or understand what I'm going through.
