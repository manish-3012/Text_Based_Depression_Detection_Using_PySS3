All aloneFirst year in college, I hate being introverted, I have no friends. My childhood friend decides to ditch me for his new group of friends. I lost all motivation. I feel so lonely, everyone has a someone to hang out with, while I'm all by myself. I'm envious and mad. I feel so betrayed. I'm all alone and I can't see a reason to keep on living. I really can't deal with all this situation anymore
