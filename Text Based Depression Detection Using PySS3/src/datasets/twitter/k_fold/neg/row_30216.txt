How do i get rid of the feeling like the world hates me?being bullied as a toddler by my older brother through my mid teens. then bullied emotionally by my stepfather. bullied in school from 6th through senior year of school. after i graduated i started being bullied online in fandoms. when i went away to university i was teased in the dorms. i'd come home from holiday breaks and be bullied by my older brother and step father again.. the bullying and the hate doesnt end.either from the cosplay community, fandoms, writing community, females that get annoyed that i wanna make friends.. saying that i'm too clingy, desperate, annoying. i can't stand the hate anymore. i just want the hate and bullying to end. female friends that i thought were close to me have all left. some just blocking me on facebook, saying they were never my best friend or just drifting away.
