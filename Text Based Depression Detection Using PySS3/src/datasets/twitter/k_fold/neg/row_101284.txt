I'm evil and I love itI'm planning on taking 9000mg (30 pills) of XL Wellbutrin crushed into water probably this coming Tuesday. A case report of an OD has diphenhydramine in her system which I don't think is a bad idea. I spent last Thursday finding the right sleeping pills but Canada only has that so thanks, Justin. Crushed too btw.  

No idea if that will work, I'm going to bag my head and elastic it just in case. JUSTIN CASE!  

What I leave behind will be horrid. My shit dad and religious mum will get #rekt the most. Brother will be worst too but my four year old sister wouldn't remember a think (hopefully for her). Grandma will be devastated.  

And, I lost care of that. A part of me wants to be able to witness the reactions of everyone. Instant attention for the pathetic attention whore I am. The thought of my ex realizing I can't trust for shit being on antidepressants for three years and my dumbass self wanting some proof of love thrills me. That egomaniac who snickers whilst staring when I try to talk in class and fumble my words, idk he'd probably make a tribute Facebook post about how much he "supported and miss" me. And, everyone else that laughed at my jokes but talked shit behind my back can receive some of my depression. I will stare into the eyes of those who look in our yearbook and see the weird tryhard who responded to their suicide jokes with a smiling, "wow, me too!" When my name isn't called in the grad ceremony after the cutie I teased around with is called with her surname so close to mine, oh that's satisfying. My therapist who postponed my Monday appointment to a TBA date will be a failure.  

I honestly let my wrath free, along with the other six. I'm already dead.
