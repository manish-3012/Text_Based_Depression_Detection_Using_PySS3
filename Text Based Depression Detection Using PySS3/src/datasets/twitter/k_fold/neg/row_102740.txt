I just want someone to listenIâ€™ve been suffering from mental health issues, not diagnosed yet bc Iâ€™m not allowed to, since I was 13. 19 now. I do my best to change my thinking pattern but it always comes down to: â€œI want to die because I canâ€™t take this anymoreâ€. 
I donâ€™t see the point in living. I canâ€™t seek professional help because I am not allowed to by my parents. I canâ€™t simply move out, I live in a country where the culture doesnâ€™t allow that and no relative or anything will support me. And itâ€™s a pandemic. I canâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™ve written out a note twice this pandemic. I just donâ€™t have the means to actually do it- not enough pills, slashing my wrists is grim and I donâ€™t want my siblings to find me like that. Please donâ€™t give me any advice. I just want a viable reason to continue when Iâ€™m so tired and in such a toxic environment.
