Not feeling great 28yr old personMy dad is dead my mom is recently disabled and I was raped two years ago. He broke my cervix but thatâ€™s not enough evidence despite him raping another girl. I have a lot of joint pain in my neck and shoulders and havenâ€™t slept for four days wo the help of alcohol. I jolt up because my arms hurt or go numb and I clench my teeth. I tried to go out w a coworker and saw my summer ex bf w a new girl. She owns a bar, I make $500 a week after 40hrs...he kept dancing around our heads w the baby. Like I see bro...

I feel depressed and worthless most days but the holidays were especially rough. I called out all last week for stomach and nauseous problems and have been wailing and crying about my dad at night w nightmares when I finally close my eyes. This is just the tip of what keeps me up at night. Not even close to all the hell ive had to endure. Some people get all the good luck some get all the bad. Thatâ€™s what I tell myself.

Iâ€™m safe today because self preservation kicks in. I do not have a plan but please donâ€™t ask because then Iâ€™ll make one. My dr would not give me xannax so that I donâ€™t become addicted. Idk anyone who needs it more then me at this point. People need it from one of the horrors Iâ€™ve listed. I used to look forward to a future. I try to push forward and see if I can make some happy happen into my life to balance out some of the bad. At this point I do not see much of a future. Iâ€™m doing my best. I could do better.
