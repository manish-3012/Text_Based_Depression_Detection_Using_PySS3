Does anyone has will to live?It's not that I want to die, I just don't see the point of living. I hate to feel the pain. I hate to feel like there's no way out. But I just don't see how to stop feeling this way. When I imagine my life one year from now, I just don't want it. There's no good future, nothing positive that comes to my mind. Even if try to imagine the best case scenario of my life from now, I feel numb. It doesn't even seem possible. I don't have what it takes to get there. It's been years that I felt like I don't have reason to live. I've been just supressing that. But still I don't see it. I look at the things life can bring and I don't want that. I don't see a reason to live, so if you see one, please enlighten me. I'm tired of trying, I'm tired of working on myself. It's just too much for me. I'm not very good at writing and there's so much stuff going inside my head that I can't express, but I'm feeling really bad and at the bottom. I have stuff that needs to get done, but I just can't, it's like I'm paralised, but not doing my responsibilities makes me feel even worse. I have no energy, I just want to lay on my bed forever and perish in a peaceful way. I wish I wasn't like this. But I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
