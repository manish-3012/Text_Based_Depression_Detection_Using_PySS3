College has left me completely broke and I have nowhere else to turnI just ended college and since I graduated my life has gone completel to shit. I was laid off about 2 months ago and finding work has been extremely difficult and I have had no luck finding a job, my girlfriend of 5 years left me, and my best dog just passed away. Honestly I don't know what to do anymore and am at the end of all the fight I had left in me. My motorcycle was just reposessed yesterday and in 2 weeks I am going to get kicked out of my apartment. I just want to end my life. My girlfriend was supposed to help me through the death of my dog and instead she didn't even bother to help bury her when she died. I have had this dog since I was 16 and I am now 24. I have no family members so there is nowhere I can go for help.
