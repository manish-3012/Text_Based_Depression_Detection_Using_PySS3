Doesn't matterAll I do is make mistakes. All the bad events in my life are my fault. My friends don't really care about this, my family don't talk about it (as if I'm a nazi or a secret abortion. Just their little secret.) I don't have a girlfriend or a boyfriend because I'm ugly. I manage to convince myself every day that I look OK, feel OK, &amp; are OK. I am always amazed, in the event that something works out for me. I hate myself. Everything I am is an illusion, but in 40 minutes I'll feel fine again and go back. Fuck it, I'm not even really depressed.
I'm happy during the day, I'm cheerful during the night, I play video games with my friends. I'm not depressed, I'm just overreacting. Still going to post here because I don't fucking care anymore. I never really did. I have no power over anything. I like to think I'll stand up &amp; won't just take it, but I am and will. I sincerely hope everyone who is alive today feels my pain. They must. Then they can try and bully or harass me. But they won't, they'll have killed themselves.

I just don't want to be like this anymore, and if that means not being, so be it
