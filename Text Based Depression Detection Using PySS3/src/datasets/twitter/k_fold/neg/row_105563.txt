Don't exactly want to die, but I'm not really bothered by living either.I've been getting healthy. Taking my meds (almost) every day. Found the right combo of medication. Seeing a therapist, etc. The usual. 

Until tonight. I can't seem to find a job.. the one I desperately want I know I won't get. I haven't got a single penny to my name. I just feel useless and without direction. WTF am I to do with my life? Not to mention the fact I've gained 40lbs and can't seem to shed it no matter what I do! 

I've got a little bit of Klonopin prescribed to me that's left. I never wanted to abuse it again (I've had some close calls) but I can't help but love the numbness it gives me. I've taken 4.5mg and currently drinking a bottle of wine. Hoping the husband doesn't find out. I just moved back to the U.K., too, so the MH care here is.. well.. shit.

Anyone been in this spot? Does it get better? Does anyone even know what they want to do with their lives?
