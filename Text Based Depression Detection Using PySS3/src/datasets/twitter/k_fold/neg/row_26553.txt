I feel like I'm not helpingI wanted to be a psych nurse all my life even through my own hospitalizations (never inpatient). I am one now but I feel like I am not helping. I am still suicidal as hell, I sleep around and those feelings go away temporarily. I eat and they still come back. I thought they would go away but they haven't. 

I ask people if they are suicidal and when they say yes I take the proper steps to implement interventions but am I really helping? No. 

I come home every day and just want to end it. My parents told me in March how they would never get over it and my attempt traumatized them. My friend says I can't because his dad committed suicide and I just can't.

I can't go to the hospital because I am a fucking nurse. Fuck this. I feel so done and worn out
