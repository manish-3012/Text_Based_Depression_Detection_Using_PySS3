I need to put myself to restIâ€™ve crashed my motorcycle today. I donâ€™t know how, but Iâ€™m mostly fine.

It was the most beautiful moment of my life. I know itâ€™s sick to think that, but it felt good to see people approach me to help me after the crash, the feeling of my body being dragged by my bike for several meters on the ground, looking at the sky while this one song played in my earphones.

Iâ€™ve just felt emptiness for the past years.

I donâ€™t want this second chance. I want to get on my broken bike, bring it up to speed one last time and then just end it all.

Iâ€™m going to therapy in 8 hours knowing that Iâ€™m going to lie to my therapist because otherwise Iâ€™m going to be forced into some facility.

Thereâ€™s one another person in my life that I could talk this out with, but this person has more important things to do now. Itâ€™s killing me and my selfishness is too.

I just donâ€™t want to drown anymore, please.
