I'm this close to start cutting myself again.Its been a couple years since my last cuts, I didn't stop because I was feeling better, but because the cuts were just too messy physically, mentally and socially relative to the momentary relief they provided.  


I hope that when I start cutting again, it feels as good as it once used to.
