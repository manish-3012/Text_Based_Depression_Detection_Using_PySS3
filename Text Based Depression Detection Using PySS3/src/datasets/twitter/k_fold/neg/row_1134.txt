I hope my family reads my reddit posts to understand more clearly why I've done it. I hope I do it soon.I mean, they have no idea what is going on on my mind, if I don't leave anything they would just guilt themselves thinking they're the ones who caused it, and that's the last thing I want. Now that I think about it, I really regret posting some mean shit about some people on Reddit, especially on this subreddit, and especially my family. I just don't want to turn temporary arguments into permanent wounds (yeah ik that sounded really cliche). I just dont wanna write in my native language because it makes me feel like what I'm typing is more real and it just makes me sad. I mean, its real either way, but writing in another language kinda gives you an illusion. Its hard to explain idk i hope you get it.  
I dont really know what to say. its too much to type into one thing.
