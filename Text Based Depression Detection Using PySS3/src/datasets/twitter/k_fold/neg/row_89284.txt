i don't want to kill myself, but i don't want to live eitherwell, things are messed up. i have everything a person would want, a girlfriend, a great job, a mother who loves me and a few incredible friends.. yet, i'm not happy at all.

i'm always feeling the lack of something that i don't even know what is. i kinda feel hopeless. everyday i wake up wishing i would be dead by the end of the day. i just can't handle the pain and the hollowness in my chest anymore, it's just too painful. i never liked myself, but the last days have been being the hardest ones so far. i feel like i'm already dead inside.

i just can't help myself, but think that all i do is to hurt people and push them away. i just can't handle it anymore and the worst part is that i can't even talk to someone closer to me about it, because i'm too afraid to end up being a burden to someone i love.
