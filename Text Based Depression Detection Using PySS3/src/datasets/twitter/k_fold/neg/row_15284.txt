Mental illness is taking me overI have been on this subreddit so many time before (under different accounts). I always come back when things are bad for me again. They are so bad right now. I feel so suffocated by my own mental illness. My situation is bad too. I have been contemplating suicide tonight alot. Im so angry and hurt inside. I feel afraid of everyone. I saw my birthday on the calendar and wrote "The worst day of my life" on it. I hate that I am here. I hate ...HATE the people who have caused me harm. I don't think I've ever felt loved by anyone, one part because the people I'm supposed to trust hurt me. The other part because I am now suffering the long term mental anguish that comes from abuse. There may have been a few people that loved me at some time in my life, but if no one talks to me I don't know any better. My siblings ignore me entirely. 

I am painfully lonely. I see couples and families and I just die inside .I'm very happy for them. But I feel like, why am I left out of that? I've tried. I also got into therapy and tried really hard to change the way I behave in relationships. I feel confident that I am capable of loving someone in a healthy way now. I see people who treat eachother like shit yet they will never leave their side. And I get sad because I think...why not me? Why do these people who have no regard for others get all the love in the world?

Even without a relationship, just having a family who gives a fuck would mean the world to me. Just someone who would try to make an effort, be a part of my life, let me feel safe and loved by them. Friends.. and I wish I had those. Or some kind of community. 

This isn't even the worst of my suffering, but right now when I feel this vulnerable, it's all I can think of. I am in need of someone who cares, to pull me out of this dark space..and they aren't there.

I hate so bad that any of us are here in this group. I wish no one would suffer this way.
