My best friend recently told me he's been feeling very deeply suicidal; how can I help? We just started uni together this year. I knew he struggled with depression, but it was only this week that I heard (from my friend himself - his boyfriend had mentioned it offhand before) that he's been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while now. This week has been an especially bad one. I am terrified for him and I don't know what to do. Every moment I'm not looking at him, alive in front of me, I worry. What is the best way I can be supportive in this situation? Is there anything I can do to help him?
