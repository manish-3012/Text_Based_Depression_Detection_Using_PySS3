I've decided to end my life at Dignitas within the next 2 yearsMy mind has been broken for years due to a brutal childhood where both my parents hated me. My body is now succumbing to an incurable disease ... so I've decided to start saving up to end my life at Dignitas in Switzerland. I plan to be off this shitty fucking planet by 2020. 

Every time I feel stressed out now I think of Dignitas waiting for me and I feel better. Of course I'd rather I didn't need to save up to kill myself but I don't know a painless way to do it.

Best of all, I'll sneak off to Switzerland without telling my shitty family. They've ruined my mind and body so fuck them.
