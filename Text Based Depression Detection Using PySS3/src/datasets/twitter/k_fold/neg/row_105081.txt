I have constant thoughts of ending my life. I made work decisions and mistakes in the last couple of years that led me down a spiral. Have not been able to recover. Marriage went to shit, it had been a struggle for years. I have a 15 year old son that I feel guilty about for not being the father that he needs now. I am depressed barely functional in daily activities and feel inept. I have someone that loves me and wants me to get better but I just donâ€™t have the drive or motivation or just feel lost. My ego might also be a problem. Where I was and how Iâ€™ve fallen and to start at a lower place at 50. Sleep is a problem. Ruminations, constant fatigue and negativity. Lack of motivation. No goal or purpose. Have lost my passion.
Meds donâ€™t help. Therapy, canâ€™t keep a constant train of thought. People that care donâ€™t seem to understand. I donâ€™t even understand. I am handsome, look fit. Can be helpful and joyful with others. But inside I am full of guilt, shame, apathy, low self esteem and self sabotage. And my world that I used to be in control off, used to travel and enjoy the outdoors and be very active physically and healthy...now Iâ€™m just barely hanging on. Canâ€™t barely function one day at a time. Food shopping is extremely difficult. Any decision is difficult. Driving Iâ€™m distracted all the time. I have work opportunities that are physical that I used to enjoy. Now I feel too weak or distracted or inept.

How do I recover? How do I gain control? When I donâ€™t even want to go outside? Or be around people? Or pay bills? Or even take care of my basic needs.
