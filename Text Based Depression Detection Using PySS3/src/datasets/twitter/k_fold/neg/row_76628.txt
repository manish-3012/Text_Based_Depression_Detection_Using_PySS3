How long do I need to keep on failing before I can just give up?I was so selfish to have children. My first child ended up in the nicu when he was born, and I almost died having him. He had medical issues and would choke and have difficulty breathing every single day. He was at high risk of dying from the flu or even a cold, and was at high risk for SIDS. My second child, my daughter, died shortly after she was born, and I also almost died having her. Having to help a choking child that canâ€™t breathe every day for years on end and having to worry about any little germ  is exhausting. He had gotten much better over the years, and isnâ€™t as high risk. I also have an abusive husband, so 100% of child care is on me 24/7/365. Weâ€™ve been separated for almost five years, but weâ€™re still married and he still controls me. I tried to get a divorce at one point. The week I told him I had gotten a lawyer and wanted a divorce, he went out and bought a hand gun. So we stay married. I think heâ€™ll kill me if I divorce him, possibly in a murder suicide. Heâ€™s threatened to shoot me before. (Thereâ€™s no help available, so donâ€™t be delusional and suggest it. Iâ€™ve asked the police for help. I live in a small town, and was told a protective order is just a piece of paper that would make him angrier.) I was abused growing up. I was raped multiple times as a teen. The first time was at age 13 by my step brother. That lasted for years. Iâ€™m just giving this background to show how messed up I am. A traumatized f#%*ing mess. Iâ€™ve been to years of therapy. Iâ€™ve read self help books. Iâ€™ve tried 12 step programs. I went on antidepressants for a while. Iâ€™m just a mess. I had no right to have a child when Iâ€™m like this!!! I feel guilty about it EVERY DAMN DAY. Itâ€™s getting worse as he gets older and he can â€œseeâ€ me more. He says Iâ€™m weird. He says Iâ€™m a slacker. He says Iâ€™m fat (Iâ€™m actually not even that fat... but getting fatter by the day). Today he called me an idiot. He talks back to me. He lies. He doesnâ€™t want to do much other than play video games online. THESE ARE ALL MY FAULT. I know that. Because Iâ€™m so messed up. Iâ€™ve never gotten mad at him for telling the truth, so I honestly donâ€™t know why he lies so much. Sometimes I try to delusion myself and think itâ€™s because his father lies CONSTANTLY about EVERYTHING, but I have my son most of the time. Itâ€™s on me. And I donâ€™t want to hurt him by killing myself and having the other kids taunt him and say horrible things like â€œhaha your mom killer herselfâ€ or â€œeven your mom didnâ€™t like youâ€ or whatever else horrible things they might come up with. But I feel like I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m trying to be a good mom. I try to talk to him about things. I try to encourage him to play sports. I try to get him involved in things and have kids over (pre-pandemic), but Iâ€™m too messed up to be a good mom. So how long to I have to stick around and keep failing? Now weâ€™re isolated due to the pandemic, and he canâ€™t have friends over, and I canâ€™t keep distracted by going places and doing things, and Iâ€™m having a hard time doing anything.  Itâ€™s excruciating struggling through each day and failing. Being a good mom is SO important, and I donâ€™t want to live with the guilt any longer. I donâ€™t want to keep on struggling and failing and seeing the damage Iâ€™m causing. How long do I need to stick around and keep failing? Whatâ€™s the point? I see lots of posts where people say â€œcut ties with your toxic momâ€. Maybe I should just cut that tie for him.
