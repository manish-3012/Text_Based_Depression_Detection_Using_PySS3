I feel like my life is overFirst off, a backstory on my health - I have two arguably chronic conditions ruining my life; type 1 diabetes and SMA syndrome. 

I thought I had something to live for; my mum, the most kind and gentle human being Iâ€™ve ever known, and I couldnâ€™t bare breaking her heart. Iâ€™ve attempted before and was hospitalised, and her face as I came round was one Iâ€™ll never ever forget. But lately, as selfish as it sounds, all I can think is â€œI wonâ€™t be alive to see the aftermath this time, so why should I care?â€

I had to drop out of uni, I have no job, I have one friend who actually cares about what happens to me (but only if I make conversation first), I donâ€™t have good health or even a positive outlook to cling to, I donâ€™t have a significant other and I donâ€™t have any children. Iâ€™m 21 years old and I feel so alone and utterly deflated because nobody understands what itâ€™s like to go through this. Everyone my age is thriving, enjoying themselves and getting to experience life. Whereas Iâ€™m in pain every single day - mental and physical. 

I feel like my life is over, it almost was before I was diagnosed with SMA syndrome, and a big part of me is ashamed I hadn't slipped away. Why do I continue to torture myself every single day? 

I guess I just want somebody to care, other than my mum. She knows I suffer, but she doesnâ€™t know the extent. And Iâ€™m too frightened to tell her.
