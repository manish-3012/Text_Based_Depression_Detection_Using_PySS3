I feel so lost.Iâ€™ve been battling with anxiety and depression for quite some time now, and itâ€™s just getting worse. Iâ€™ve tried therapy, it hasnâ€™t worked. Meds help for a little bit, but they donâ€™t work all that well either. 

At my age (14) I feel like I should be happy and carefree. But Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m a bit of an outcast at my school, and Iâ€™m very shy. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you all :)
