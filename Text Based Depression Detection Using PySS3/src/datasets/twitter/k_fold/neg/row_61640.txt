Thinking about killing self for over a month. How to stop these thoughts?Right now I am between years at university and I am finding it hard to find another distraction in my life to stop me from longing for a purpose. It feels like killing myself would be easy. Does anyone have any advice on stopping these thoughts?

Edit: I managed to find a project to distract me from my thoughts- I joined a cycling group. Thank you to everyone for the advice It was a great help especially those who mailed me.
