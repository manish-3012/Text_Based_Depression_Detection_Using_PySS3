Help?Can anybody tell me if they get the following thing happen ever ;
I went to my girlfriends house to meet some more members of her family, had a couple beers and it was alright. But i got home, sat down and it instantly felt like I hadn't even gone out like i couldn't remember things about the day, no happy thoughts or anything, making me feel shit, again, like always. 

That's the thing isn't it, this life, is so fucking repetitive. Of course I have dreams, i dream of moving out with my girlfriend into a flat and having a kid, i dream of making my own little online graphics design store. But with this mindset, I'm not doing fuck all. 
I need this to change. 

Suicide seems appropriate to end the cycle of boredom but nobody really wants to kill themselves.
