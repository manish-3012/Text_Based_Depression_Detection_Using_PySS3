Sick of failing at life, I want out.Friends, family, pets, therapy, nothing seems to work. My brain is still fighting against me and my heart is still broken. I want to die, I just don't know the best way to do it.

I'm exhausted from doing this for years. Being on a roller coaster that I can never get off, where life gives you a high moment only to come crashing back down and remind you that you're worthless and can never stay at the top.

I want to be done with it all. I want my emotions to not rule my life. The pain to end. I'm a burden to everyone around me and a stain on humanity. Happiness and good fortune were not meant for people like me, I should never have been born. My death would correct that mistake.
