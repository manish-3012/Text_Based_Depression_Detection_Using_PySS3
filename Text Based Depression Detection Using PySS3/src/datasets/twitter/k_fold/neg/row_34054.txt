My friend is suicidal and I'm not able to help her. I need help.My friend is suicidal, hasn't been taking her medication for a few days, has been in multiple confrontations with her mother that makes her home life a living hell has been talking about killing herself once her mom leaves the house. I don't know what to do and could really use some advice. Thank you in advance.

Edit: I've tried giving her the resources to contact the suicide prevention hotline and the runaway safeline but she is refusing to call or message them.
