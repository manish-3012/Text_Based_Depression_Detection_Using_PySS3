I dont know if im lucky or unlucky that my country doesnt allow firearmsBecause if they did, i would be gone by now. I swear if i have a clean and easy way of death, iâ€™ll do it in a heartbeat. Why not other ways? Im afraid of heights, i cant pull a knife across my throat without hesitating in pain, i cant gurantee death with a car crash or overdosage. Thats all. Thats all thats keeping me alive.
