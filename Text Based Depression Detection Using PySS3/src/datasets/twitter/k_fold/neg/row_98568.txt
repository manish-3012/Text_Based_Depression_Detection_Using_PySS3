I wish I was never been born. I just want to leave this world because how useless, ungrateful and incompetent I am.Do you know how hard it is to live when the only thing you know is to take from others without giving a single about them?

I know it is bad...it is evil but I can't stop myself from doing it. I always make myself feels good while making other people suffer. To my family, to my mother, to my brother...I am really sorry. 

I keep lying to them without them even knowing it and what's worst? Even though I know I am a piece of shit, I keep continue doing it just because I want to feel better, lazying around doing nothing, and making them suffer...WITHOUT THEM KNOWING IT.

Please someone just send someone to kill me. I can't even take my own life because how much a coward I am. I don't want my existance being a thorn to someone close to me...I really really do. But I don't have ANY self restraint. Just a worthless human being.

I don't know if I can call myself a human anymore. The things that I did...it just pure evil in my eyes. People think that murder, stealing, rape are really bad crimes but for me lying to make myself feels good is just worse and lying to make myself feels good over and over again without feeling any remorse is the WORST. 

Why I was born if my existance only bringing pain and suffering to other people especially the one closes to me why why?

Please...I just want all of this coming to and when I woke up. I don't want continue living in this world, I just don't.

I hate myself. Incompetent piece of shit who only knows how to play video games, watching youtube, doing some stupid shits like that. I can't change...tried it like millions times but with no result. I just want to end my life once and for all.

Feel free to mock me, despise me in the comment. Only you who read my post knows what a garbage I am. Not even the closest person to me know about this.
