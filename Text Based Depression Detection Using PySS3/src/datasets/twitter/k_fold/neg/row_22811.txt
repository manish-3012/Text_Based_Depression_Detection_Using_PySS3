ScaredIâ€™m afraid that the relationships that I have for the positive benefit for the people that actually know and have been apart of my life as my peers and people that genuinely care about me. Are all going to fall to shit cause everyone is afraid of the people who raped and molested me sexually in school. Are will to try and hurt me again cause they have done it before and they want to make it into me not letting go of something that wasnâ€™t as big a deal for others then it was to me.. if I wasnâ€™t as scared now as I was then of these people who attacked me and didnâ€™t just take advantage of me at a party. And I didnâ€™t mistake her for a friend or wanted to drink with her or want her in any other way. I know that she was put up to this by the male who bullied me and took his after school activities as a way to try to bully people that were trying to fit in for actual school sport. I know that these people have been trying to hurt what Sarah and my friends do think of me cause they want their reputations as cool kids. Over then reputations of the kids that actually tried to go to sehome.. and not just use it as a place to make fun of people. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair to say my friends bullied people when all they did was be bullied and told not to hang out with me cause their racist prejudice.
