Feeling particularly foul and misanthropic. Bring it on, quasi-shrinks.Remind me, why are we doing all this shit? Whatâ€™s the point? This world is a cruel joke; a glimpse of how beautiful it all could be, spoiled by drooling crowds that prefer to bypass reality and pretend it is all pieced together for them personally.

Besides, how am I to know you all even exist? How do I know youâ€™re not mobs in some Matrix-esque simulation? I try to believe there is something in my fellow man that sets us apart from the insects (hell, the trees) but the buggers keep getting me down.

I have too much to lose these days; too many hours spent getting my proverbial shit together. I donâ€™t take risks. And now weâ€™re not talking comfort-zone, see-new-people risks. I want to take the real risks. I want to challenge the fucking shit that holds my face down in the dirt, I want to shoot the people that I want to see dead. All primal shit like that. No after-thoughts; instinctive hates and passions. And I am held back by the ingenious trap into which I was born and raised.

**tl;dr:** just write something tangentially related to the title, like everyone else.
