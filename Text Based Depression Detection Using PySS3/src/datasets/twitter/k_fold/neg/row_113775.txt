Forgotten, or purposely neglected - story of my lifeI've felt pretty low these past few days from every problem imaginable all at once (mother pushing my to the brink and all i need is space away from this bipolar bitch), but the nail on coffin was when my SO told me prior that there were numerous exams and won't be able to chat with me until a later date. I love my SO, so much that I have bent over backwards for him and try to be as understanding and supportive as i can. So i said basically it's alright. But..truthfully, I'm at my lowest, i need the support and encouragement and SO tells me doesn't want to even communicate with me. And I see my SO on IMchat periodically through the day and liking FB posts but cannot even muster a hi or hello or morning to me because SO said "busy with exams". I really feel like i lost everything. I want to die. I do not have it in me to continue. There is no support, i give up. And to that prank text, very funny..my death will be quite funny as well actually.  Even my family tells me to go die on a daily basis. You all win. I lost the game.
