My social anxiety is killing me.Sorry for the broken English, not my first language.

I'm 20, I had really fucking bad social anxiety all my life, it's a miracle if I even manage to post this without shitting my pant or deleting the whole thing. 

It's ruining my fucking life, I only have one friend who is almost like me, I don't talk to anybody except my family and my only friend, I'm pretty sure I can count the number of time I've talked to somebody not closed to me with my fucking fingers, I keep losing touch with the few people I've known because I never talk to them, I have no idea what I'm gonna do with my life cause I'm too much of a fucking coward to seek help.

It's not the only reason I want to kill myself but I think my social anxiety is the root of my depression. I want to go to a therapist but I'm too scarred to take a fucking appointment, I so mad at myself for being like that. 

My family told me that there gonna take an appointment to a therapist for me but they still haven't done it, I don't blame them, I should do it myself but I Just can't cause I'm too much of a baby to make a fucking phone call. I'm fucking 20 but I feel like a child who need there mommy to do everything for them.

It's almost been 3 years that I'm a NEET doing nothing with my life, I feel like I'm gonna explode soon and kill myself, my life right now is just living with my parents doing nothing all day until one day I won't be able to continue living like that, so I'll just kill myself.

Feel like suicide is the only thing I can do right now in my life, I have no future.
