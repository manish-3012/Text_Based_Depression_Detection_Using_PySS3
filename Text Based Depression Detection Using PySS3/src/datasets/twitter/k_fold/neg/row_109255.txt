When do I take my thoughts seriously?Iâ€™m sorry if this is wrong sub for this question. 

My soulmate died tragically when I was 19. For years, I struggled to see a future for myself. I was constantly afraid I was going to die in a car wreck or something just like he did. Now, Iâ€™m 42. Never married. I havenâ€™t dated for 7 years. had a hysterectomy in December. Met a man in January who lied. He broke up with me on Valentineâ€™s day. Since then heâ€™s lied, manipulated, emotionally/psychologically abused me, and has cyberstalked me for the past 10 weeks. 

I had little hope of ever finding love before meeting him. After the abuse, Iâ€™ve had a hard time moving forward. Iâ€™m just so tired of going through life alone. Back in a place where I canâ€™t see a future for myself. I wonder if Iâ€™m going to die soon, like the universe or god or whatever is telling me that itâ€™s all over. I know some of this is normal after trauma, abuse, and major life changes. But how much time do I give to this being the short normal down vs. something much more serious?
