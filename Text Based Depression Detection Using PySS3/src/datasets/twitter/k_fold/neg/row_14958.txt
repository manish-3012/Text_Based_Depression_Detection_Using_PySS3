Apparently I'm super tough.You know how the toothpaste bottle says to spit it out because it's dangerous. Fuck that I've drank the whole thing. Still here. I've drank fucking carpet cleaner. Overdosed on Tylenol like 200 times, electrocuted myself in the chest with live wires. Overdosed on oxycodone. Overdosed on sleeping pills/antidepressants. and about 1000 other things I'm not even thinking of. I take suicide attempts in stride now. Nearly every other night I try some new thing that never ends up working. It almost makes me laugh at this point. People are like don't take too much of that. I feel like laughing in their face. Because dying is goddamn hard man. Then there's people out there who have died from pushing too hard on the toilet. Lucky bastards.
