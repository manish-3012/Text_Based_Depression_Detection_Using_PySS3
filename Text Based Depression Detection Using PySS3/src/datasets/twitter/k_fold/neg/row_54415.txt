Spent my morning trying to reassemble my gun, but couldnt get the bolt back together so...I spent the rest of that time trekking trough 26 acres of my land finding the *perfect* tree. It's huge, strong and I should be able to climb it so I can get some sort of 'drop' after I hang myself. I also left a new blade so when I do kill myself I won't botch it. I also ordered a jig so I can get the gun working asap. So either way, one of my plans ***will*** work. I'll either blow my brains out with my rifle and hollow bullets or I'm going to cut my wrist and hang myself. *Cutting my wrist because I already messed up hanging myself before. This time I will be too far from my house to make it back while bleeding out if I pussy out of hanging myself.

Death is peace my friends. Wish me luck in the coming week!
