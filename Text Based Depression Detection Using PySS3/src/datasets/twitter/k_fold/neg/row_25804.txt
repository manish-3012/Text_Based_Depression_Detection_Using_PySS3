I am a horrible humanEveryone sees me as soft, but I just can't hold in any more emotions. Guys my age 15 are meant to be seen as strong, it's not like that. Today I had the worst day of my life, starting with waking up and the day began, I watched tv and played video games on my laptop for a bit just wasting time so the day would end. I then do some of my homework and almost finish it but I had to eat lunch which postponed my homework untill later. I ate lunch and talked to my friends and played some games with them untill I got bored and left. Then my mother texts me and asks if I have fed the dog, and for a day I havn't fed him, I was bashing myself up because I completely forgot because they were out of the house. (My mum and dad are divorced and I live at my dads house) 

I was so hurt and I felt like the most corrupt human being on earth for forgetting about him. I love him
So dearly but how can I forget.
And then after dinner I started finishing my homework realising that I was struggling so I asked my dad for help and I was really tired and he felt like I was ignoring him. He stopped helping me and stormed off into his room and no goodnight at all. Now I am lying in bed thinking about how meaningless I am. 


Please I need to talk to someone.
