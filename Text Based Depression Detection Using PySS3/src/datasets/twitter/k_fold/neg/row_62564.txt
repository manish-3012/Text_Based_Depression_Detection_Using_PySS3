I just need to find the courage to do itI can't live in this world. I can't be happy in it and I have no desire to keep doing anything at all. I'm still going to work but that is insignificant. I just wish I had the courage and the mind to just lay out in the cold in the woods where I can be alone and at peace and slit my wrists. Most other ways of dying are too extreme or torturous. 

I just can't do this. I don't want to do this. Of course you can't let anyone know or they just fuck up the dynamic, the only thing I have to look forward to. It would be easier if I had nothing. But I don't want to die in dire circumstances. I'd rather go while I still have what privelages I still enjoy, while I still have the basic necessities of life. Then it could be done in total peace. I just have to meditate on it. How it will feel, the fear, etc. Eventually I will hopefully be at enough peace to do it.
