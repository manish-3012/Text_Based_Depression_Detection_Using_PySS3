all the signs are thereif you know someone who committed suicide, what pushed them over the edge? was it something specific? i have had warning signs for several years and a few attempts, but lately it seems like all the symptoms are coming together and more severely. in my level headed state, this worries me that the tiniest thing could send me into that final depression. i want to know what to look out for. i have a history of repeated childhood sexual abuse, witnessing violence and death.
