I'm autistic (Aspergers) and I want to dieFirstly, my first language is French, so please excuse me if I make mistakes. I've read this topic many times https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8dlyio/autismaspergers_is_a_death_sentence/ and it exactly summarizes what I'm living since several years. I'm just 17 years (18 in October), but I already want to die. I live in Switzerland, but I don't think that anybody wants to help me. I already had talked about my suicidal thoughts to my psychologist, but I believe that he didn't took me seriously. I want to get hospitalized, but my parents don't want to. I really think I'm about to die. Live as an autistic person is extremely hard. I'm really sure I would be much more happy, without Aspergers and autism. But Aspergers is a permanent disability and disease, and I don't see why I shouldn't kill myself. I'm tired of living this shitty life. My wishes are just living a normal and happy life, having a girlfriend, making good friends but I feel like nobody understands me and appreciates me. I don't think I would live until 20 years. I curse autism and Aspergers, which is responsible of my terrible life! I already lived a serious depression several years ago, but fortunately my depression has went away. Anyway I'm still very sad and apathetic. I'm already thinking about euthanasia, which is maybe possible in my country even for people with ASD! Please help me, I don't know what I have to do.
