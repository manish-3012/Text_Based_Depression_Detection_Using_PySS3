Everything is in order (long)Sorry in advance for how long everything is, but you only get to kill yourself once.
I feel relief and happiness for the first time in years at the prospect of ending my miserable life. I have tried taking antidepressants, talking about my feelings, religion, faking it until I make it, basically everything I could think up, but I can no longer live. I have always been told that "things will get better" but my depression started in middle school when my father and stepmother (who I loved like a mother) got divorced because he had relapsed. Throughout the divorce, my stepmother told me that the thing they fought about the most in counseling was me. This caused me to feel that the divorce was my fault and I became depressed. I understand now that it was not my fault, but the damage has already been done. Since then, not only have I not been in contact with any members of that side of my family, but I have also experienced a series of depression that periodically returns. As everyone knows, this is very common. People who experience depression once are more likely to experience it again. Right now, my depression is back in full swing. I have tried to continue living, but I find it to be completely exhausting, and I am too tired from trying not to kill myself to put forth real effort into any of my relationships. Instead, I have started fighting with my parents again, which is something I haven't done since high school, and the intensity of the fights is at the same level as those that occurred during middle school. I know these fights are my fault, but I cannot stop them. I have just given up. The only thing that brings me any happiness or relief is the prospect of killing myself. I've created a will, planned out my funeral, packed up all of my stuff, and made sure everything is in complete and total order. I have come to the conclusion that I don't think I am someone who is meant to be happy and I have accepted it. I am so tired of delaying death to continue to be miserable. I never tried to kill myself when I was younger because I held onto hope that things would get better, but they simply did not. High school, college, and "the real world" all suck. Life is just not meant for me and that is okay. Goodbye
