Caring too much and feeling empty.Iâ€™ve been crying for no reason a lot of times late at night sometimes even thinking Iâ€™m smiling. I feel tired like getting out of bed is a chore. Like everyone will leave me and when Iâ€™m out Iâ€™m public I think everyone is looking at me and judging me. I was to therapy before but I couldnâ€™t tell the therapist whatâ€™s wrong and how I really feel. Every day is the same. I want to end it but I canâ€™t. I feel more sad and faking a smile is getting harder and harder. Even tried to cut my hands a few times but Iâ€™m the end of only scratch them with something really short to leave a red line with a little blood and then cover it with some bracelets. I am smiling with tears in my eyes. Iâ€™m feeling empty and I overthink almost every word I say and think at the worst things every time. Iâ€™m talking bad about myself. I donâ€™t wanna be here anymore.why am I like this, what made me like this. I feel there is no use for me after all. Iâ€™m scared of growing up thinking about how I can fuck up all my life. I feel like I am a disappointment. I canâ€™t think straight anymore. Every time Iâ€™m trying to think about something serious I end up feeling like I have a hole in my chest and it getting bigger and bigger. I have nobody to talk this to, I want friend but I canâ€™t have friend because itâ€™s too hard to me to talk to a person. I probably have anxiety but I donâ€™t care anymore. I want to sleep but I canâ€™t and I always feel tired or oversleep. I think things too much and sometimes care less.  I feel like Iâ€™m drowning and the worst part is that Iâ€™m feeling this way for almost 2 years and not even a person knows all of this. I donâ€™t even know what I have, Iâ€™m sick and I know this but Iâ€™m scared to talk to anyone about this.
