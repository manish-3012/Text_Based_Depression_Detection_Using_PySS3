Hurt that never endsTheres not much to say. I don't want to die. I just want the pain to stop. Even when the emotional pain isnt at its worst,its still in the background. I'll be months removed from the situation and having a laugh and then out of no where it pops into my brain,that pain and hurt. A deep pain that echoes through a lifetime. You never leave my mind. Even when laughing,the pain is still present.
