Three friends killed themselves in the last three yearsThree people in my life have committed suicide in the last three years, with the most recent being 3 days ago. Since their deaths, the love, care and positivity around them has been massive.


I do so much to help others, and I do not get any of this positivity. I am the butt of every joke at family parties, my friends only want me when I can do something for them, and nobody has noticed that I'm sick.


If I die maybe finally I'll get that love and attention the others did. Maybe people will realise how much of a hole I have left in their lives. 


Maybe, but I doubt it. Either way, I can't keep living when I am this pathetic. Whatever happens next happens.
