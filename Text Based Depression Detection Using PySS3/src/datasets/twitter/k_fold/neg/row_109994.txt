I WANT TO FUCKING KILL MYSELFIt's not even about wanting to die, it's about for once in my life having control over it and fucking ending everything for everyone's sake. What the fuck is wrong with me? People don't get attached to me, they get TRAPPED with me. I am a fucking leech. I want to kill myself so all of this self loathing go away and I don't have to worry about being an awful fake human being that cries over EVERYTHING

Damn, being alive is so fucking SAD. 
I thought I'd post something more insightful, but then I guess I'm not into deep reflections anymore. It doesn't work anyway. Now I just wish I wasn't a fucking piece of garbage that needs to erase their existence. Damn, I love my child. Wish I wasn't toxic.
