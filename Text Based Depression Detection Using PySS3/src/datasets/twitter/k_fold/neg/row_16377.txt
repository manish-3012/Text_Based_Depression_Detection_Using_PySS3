My friend/coworker took her own life SaturdayI'm not really sure if this is the right place for this, but an amazing girl, Maryash Shulman took her own life Saturday night. Everyone is devastated, and being someone who's contemplated and attempted the same thing it really hit me hard. I miss her. I miss her every day I show up there and don't see her. It feels empty and cold now. She didn't really have a family, she was an orphan from Russia(we're in the US) and what family she does have here can't really pay for the funeral. Her fiancÃ© is at a loss, understandably. We all are. Ive never lost anyone so close before and I'm having trouble keeping my head up and not thinking about it. I just hope she's in a bette place now. This rant probably doesn't fit here and I apologize if it's a mess and all over the place. Thanks to anyone who reads
