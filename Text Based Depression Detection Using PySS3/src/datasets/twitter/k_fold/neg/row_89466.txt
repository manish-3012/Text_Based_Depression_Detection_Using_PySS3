Helping my brotherI'm at a total loss at the moment. My brother lives on the other side of the country and called the other night to say "good bye". He said he had a plan and when I said I would call him tomorrow he said he wouldn't answer. 

I panicked and called the police, who ended up breaking down his door and taking him to hospital. He's recently been abusing many substances and was high at the time of our phone call/the police intervention. After this he called to say I'd abused his trust and he would never speak to me again. He also threatened that as soon as he gets out of hospital, he will go through with his plan. 

Was I wrong to call the police? Will the hospital keen him there if they feel he is unsafe? My family are on the next flight, but I'm worried he will do something silly before that.
