TiredHey, I don't really know why I'm posting here but I don't know where else I can go. My friend that I usually talk to about this stuff has alot going on so I can't really talk to her about this. I've been feeling really fed up with everything for the past few months. I don't want to deal with other people anymore. I feel like I'm really messed up in the head and theres nothing I can do about it. I have really bad paranoia and anxiety and have trouble trusting anyone. I try to pretend like I'm fine but I really don't feel fine. I'm sick of living this way and I don't want to anymore. I tried committing suicide twice in the past and both times failed. I think I'm going to try to OD sometime this week. Even if it doesn't kill me at least I can get a break from everything and everybody.
