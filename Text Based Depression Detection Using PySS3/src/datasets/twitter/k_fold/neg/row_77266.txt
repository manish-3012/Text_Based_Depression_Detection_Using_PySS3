Chronic migraines and wanting to dieI have been suffering with chronic migraines for about half a year, they are almost there every day. I actually donâ€™t know how to cope with it anymore, I took pain medication way too often and now it doesnâ€™t help anymore. I still have to wait months for a specialized doctor. Does somebody have the same problem? Itâ€™s really hard because u cant really live that way. I just stay at home all the time because Iâ€™m scared that If i go out the migraine will come again. My social life is dead.
