ThinkingI got home from the hospital 3 days ago, and I want to go back. I hate my life and Iâ€™m so tired of living here. The hospital wasnâ€™t even fun either; I just felt.. safe? I donâ€™t know. It was so boring there but just thinking about my life is even worse. I donâ€™t even want to try anymore. It as if all I do is cope with life and I just donâ€™t understand how anybody is contempt with living. Iâ€™ve wondered before if theyâ€™re faking it like me, and that maybe Iâ€™m just not as good at faking it as them. Either way I really donâ€™t enjoy a single thing about my life and I know they have at least something. Sometimes I donâ€™t even feel human and Iâ€™m pretty sure that feeling of complete emptiness is whatâ€™s gotten me this far. Iâ€™m not a bad kid, and I try in school. I get good grades but I canâ€™t take it anymore. I also left home awhile back and while that did help a little bit Iâ€™m still feeling like shit and I hate it. Iâ€™m homeschooled now and Iâ€™ve tried so hard to keep myself afloat. Iâ€™ve done a lot to try and recover from depression too but maybe I just have a bad personality. Iâ€™m not negative, but because Itâ€™s so hard to feel happy Iâ€™m always let down. I hate my family and I hate myself. I wish they wouldâ€™ve helped me sooner because I think itâ€™s too late now. I was diagnosed with dysthymia with double depressive episode at the hospital so I donâ€™t expect to get better. I did before but Iâ€™ve tried and tried and tried and nothing ever changes. My family might as well be strangers, I have no hobbies other than drawing (which I only do to pass time) and, like my hobby, my only skill is art. I hate art but I do it anyways. I donâ€™t see myself getting better and I cannot see myself enjoying life no matter what happens. I didnâ€™t attempt suicide to get into the hospital, but for awhile now Iâ€™ve been planning on running away to jump off a high area. It probably wonâ€™t happen but the thought makes me feel better. I hated childhood and I hate being a teenager. Iâ€™ll probably hate being an adult too. Nothing seems good and Iâ€™ve already lost hope. Iâ€™m going to either drop out of high school soon and kill myself in a few years or kill myself sometime soon. I truly hate life and itâ€™s been nothing but cruel to me thus far. 
Iâ€™m sorry for writing this. Iâ€™m just feeling god awful.
