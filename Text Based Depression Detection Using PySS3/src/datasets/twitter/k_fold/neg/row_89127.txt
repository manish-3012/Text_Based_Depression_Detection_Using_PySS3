One day soonWhen my life is ripped away from me and back home I go over seas. I will see the end my final senses used to breathe. Salty bad blood within me. I will leave I will hear the waves of sound as I come crashing down. From a plane once I came, is how I'll leave and like a leaf. Ill fall with nothing but the ground to catch me. In my hand Ill have it open. A palm read and a destiny spoken. In the other taped together a seal unbroken. The release.. release and be it the ground I kiss or steel upon my lips, I will find my peace. One way or another I will fly I will fall, I will die.. Please God dont let me live again I should have never been given a second chance or a third. 

I will fly like a bird

I will scream like a crow

I will die a coward. 

Ill be free from this birth.
