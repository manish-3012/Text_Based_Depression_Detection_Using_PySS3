My mother, the alcoholicNot using a throwaway because fuck it. Iâ€™m a 27 yr male, Iâ€™ll be 28 on Friday and homeless on Monday. Happy fucking birthday. 

Recently decided to move from California to Las Vegas as I accepted a decent sales job out here. Not great money, but something I can work my way up in. My mother and stepdad were helping me to get out on here and land on my feet. Until I didnâ€™t get the job. With my move, my schedule conflicted and the job told me they couldnâ€™t fit me into this monthly training class and weâ€™ll have to try again next month. 

My stepdad was angry and disappointed, feeling taken advantage of. Not my intentions to use him for money, I was scared of pulling the trigger and moving due to depression. 

Now my mother on the other hand is a recovering alcoholic. My stepfather has already kicked her out of his home several times for drinking. When she drinks, she turns into an unrecognisable monster. She has been sober, great and loving for months now, but the other night she had an obvious set back. Cue the monster sleeping on the couch, screaming at everyone, denying she was drinking, saying horrible things. We get into a fight, she blames me. Needless to say, my stepfather was livid. 

He tells her to get out, and says he is done with both of us. I remind him I have nowhere to go hence me moving out, he tells me to figure it out with my mother. Most of my furniture and possessions are still in California. I cannot afford to move them alone. My lease is up on Monday. 

My mother is angry with me for â€˜throwing her under the busâ€™ instead of trying to hide the fact she was drinking. She hates me. Iâ€™m sitting here trying to think of what to do. I canâ€™t live with her, I canâ€™t live alone yet. 

I want to die. I want to go back to my apartment in California, drink a nice bottle of rum with a few handfuls of antihistamines and sleep. Please let this nightmare end
