Think twice before trying to kill yourself.As you might expect, the human society isn't very kind to suicidal people. Because psychiatric hospitals have a hard time earning money from true mentally ill patients,  they label suicidal people as mentally ill persons who are incapable of taking care of themselves, since suicide is a leading cause of death in the world and dementia is not, it's an easy cash grab for doctors and instituitions.

As i've reported 10 hours ago, i've tried to kill myself by hanging and my brother found me with the face and window support on the floor and a belt tied on my neck. He called the hospital for an ambulance to pick me up.

Luckily due to the covid-19 situation, i can just run, which is what i intend to do if they actually send an ambulance which i think it's not coming for at least a couple more days since they couldnt pick me up yet.

So yeah, **only attempt to kill yourself if is that what you truly want,** it's the last of the last resorts, and when no one is nearby, because you are going to end up locked for an unknown ammount of time and the stay will only further downgrade your mental state.
