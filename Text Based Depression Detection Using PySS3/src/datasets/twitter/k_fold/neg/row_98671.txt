Where did it all go wrong?I truly am a failure, I'm not just saying that. It's the truth.   
Growing up I was an excellent kid. Always stayed out of trouble. I was constantly student of the month, always got A's, took honors/AP classes, almost never missed school. Family, friends, teachers and even I had great expectations for myself. I was full of potential.   
I was a happy kid for the most part. I was excited for life and everything it had to offer.   

My main goal was to serve in the military. That didn't happen so my backup plan was to attend college. I was only able to attend one year. Had I been able to continue school I would have graduated with my architecture degree this past year.   

From freshman through senior year I had periods of depression, but nothing major. Depression became more severe and chronic after college.   

Now here I am at 22, unemployed and living with family. No will to go on. Just wishing I was dead.

Only comforting thing is knowing that I can end it whenever I choose to.
