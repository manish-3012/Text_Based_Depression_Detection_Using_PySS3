New lifeMy life has been a non stop fight against the incoming storm that is my depression. Therapy only helped a little and I don't like the thought of pills making me happy. 
So instead I've spent the last 10 years of my life trying to leave a mark on those around me. I've learned religion to help those who believe, I've learned some music ability to give people something to enjoy. I've coached sports for my brother to help them. I've given my last Nickle to help. 
I've received nothing in return and I'm fine with that. I originally thought I wouldn't make it past 20. I turn 23 next Saturday. But I've been thinking of suicide since the start of this semester. 
I just feel nothing left in me, I feel oddly satisfied with everything. Gf somehow ended up pregnant despite birth control and I just found out today and I'm happy that there will something of me that could hopefully be positive. 

I wanted to disappear to night and I did so I called gf one last time to tell her I loved her but she never said it she was too busy crying. And this ate at me, every car that passed by I hoped it was her and I wanted to see her. So I stopped walking and waited. Once my phone died I grew even more regretful I couldn't even listen to one last song. Then she showed up, my feeling of wanting to commit suicide hasn't left. I feel numb to her crying in my room while I'm locked in the bathroom. I'm charging my phone now and just waiting for her to fall asleep so I can try again.
