My husband saved me.My husband and I had been getting in a lot of arguments lately. I finally couldnâ€™t take it anymore. He went for a walk, I left a note and drove to the train tracks. A half an hour and no trains came. My husband called and called and texted and I finally answered. I finally told him where I was and he came to get me and I just cried and cried. I told him I was sorry I wrecked our relationship and that Iâ€™m such a horrible person and deserves this. 

Then the man Iâ€™ve known and loved for probably close to 10yrs cried and Iâ€™ve never ever seen him cry before. Worried that he had lost me. 

He said nothing was worth that and that nothing is ever that bad. Heâ€™s never held me so tightly before. Ironically a train came by as soon as he hugged me.

I think weâ€™re in a better place relationship wise now but I canâ€™t stop thinking about what a horrible person I am to do that to him. I canâ€™t stop thinking about that night and am trying to hold myself together.
