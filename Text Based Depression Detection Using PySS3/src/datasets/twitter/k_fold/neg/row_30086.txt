My anxiety is overwhelming and I cannot last much longer.I obsess about having diseases that I have a very low chance in having. I just left my relationship of 2 years and she's with my best friend now. I can't deal with working these shitty jobs, but I'm in too much debt to get help. I don't even know if I can go into work tomorrow. I need 12 hours of sleep to even function now. I am trapped and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm even starting to lose interest in my own art and music. I can't do this anymore. I feel so fucking alone, like I'm screaming down an empty hallway and my own echo is deafening me. It's fucking driving me mad. I don't see myself lasting another month.
