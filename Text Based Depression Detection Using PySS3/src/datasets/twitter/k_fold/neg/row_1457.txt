I have so much hate in my heart.If you could look at me you would never guess that thoughts of suicide are running through my head. You would see a young pretty girl who gets everything she wants and has no care in the world. But I don't know what to do anymore. I need help, I know I do, but I don't know how to ask for it. I can't pull myself out of this one. I want it to be over. I can't be living like this anymore. I'm so quick to help others but I often forget that I need just as much help. 






It feels really odd to me writing this, but this is my cry for help. I've never admitted to anyone of my depression, just myself. I've already accepted my disease, but I'm scared to tell my family. I don't think they'd understand. The only things that have kept me from succeeding in the past was thinking of my future, thinking of my college years in the very distance and seeing that all my troubles would vanish. Now that I am very near to my college years, the little girl stuck inside me is very disappointed.
