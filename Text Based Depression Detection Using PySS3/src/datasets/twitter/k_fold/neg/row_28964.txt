A possible outcomeHello, this is my first time posting here, but I'm extremely young so I feel like I'm gonna get judged. I'm a 14 y/o Canadian high schooler who's likley going to kill herself tomorrow.

I've had thoughts like this for maybe two years now, I've attempted suicide once before and have self induced fainting spells just so I can get a small sample of death. It's all very much.

I belive I have a panic disorder due to the fact that small things can set me off to a point where I peel back the skin of my hand, that's always fun to explain.

When I tell my "friends" I feel this way they think I'm kidding, but it hasn't been a joke for awhile.

I would love to get thearpy, but I dont know how to ask. 

Everyone in my life leaves me. My parents left me after I was born for drugs, my adoptive mother dosent care about my feelings and constantly says things that takes blows to me. I feel out of place in my friend group, in my life.

I dont belive I will ever amount to anything really, I'm so extremely mediocre at everything.

Before I sleep i get really bad intrusive suicidal thoughts, but now its constant. So I think I'll take to bus to school, and just not show up to first, or second, or third, or forth, and just walk along the city and find a nice bridge to jump off, or maybe drown myself in lake Ontario. 

The only thing stopping me is my dad, and my friend alex. They are the only things that matter to me, and I hate being dependent on others. But I dont want to hurt them.

I dont want to die, I really dont. I just don't want to be in pain.
