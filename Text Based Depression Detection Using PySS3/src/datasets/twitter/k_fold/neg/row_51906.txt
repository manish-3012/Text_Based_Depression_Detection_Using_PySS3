I have to visit my suicidal father today. Need a bit of advice.My dad has always been suicidal, as have I, which makes it an extremely toxic environment for me. I've already decided I'm getting wasted before I do see him.

He's been suicidal since I've been born. Tried to kill himself and broke his back instead when I was 3, and crawled home for my toddler self to see and report to police. My mom, divorced to him, encourages I should see him since he's now on hospice (reluctantly) but I'm feeling sick to see my father like this.

He's ill with HIV and just crippled in general. He can barely speak or move. I know, though experience, he's just going to talk about the past and his pain and wanting to die.

He's asked me to even write his will, since he's going blind.

I'm not sure how to handle this anymore. I myself just want to die to avoid this pain. I don't want to see my father like this, but I have to and I want to be drunk to do it, and even my fiance agrees (because of my anxiety and depression) it's for the best.

I'm just scared. What if he kills himself after I write his will? This is such a horrible feeling.
