Why is this happening?My life is pretty fucking shit. I grew up without my father, who abandoned me and my mom plus said that 'I will never accomplish anything.' I spend 10 years of my life with a drunken alcoholic and my mom was too afraid to leave him cuz he had money and we've got no other place to stay at. I repeated 7th grade once and 10th grade once. I don't wanna go to school and my mom is thinking depression is just an excuse so I won't have to do things. My boyfriend abandoned me suddenly, and now I'm jealous of the thought of him fucking someone else. I am constantly abused by my fam.

 I think I'm gonna do it sometime soon. I used to believe that it gets better but it somehow just gets worse. I think swallowing some pills will do the trick. I've got nothing else to live for.

Unless someone can convince me that it gets better? Cuz I've lost almost all hope.
