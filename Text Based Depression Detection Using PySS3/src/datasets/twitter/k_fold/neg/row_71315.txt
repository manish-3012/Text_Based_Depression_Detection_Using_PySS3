I feel so fucked all the timeHello, it has been 2011 here for almost 2 hours now. I'm not sure what I hope to gain from writing this. I feel so incredibly fucked all the time. I went to watch the fireworks of new years on a bridge with some people I know. All those flashing lights on the sky, and I really wished to jump headfirst in the ice below. I don't even know why. I think I've felt fucked for a long time. I'm rather young so it won't matter if I tell my feelings to someone in person, because it will probably just be considered as a phase or some shit. I drink myself shitfaced on every opportunity because I like to forget myself. Also I probably couldn't write this if I were sober. All my days are filled with quiet desperation and I just want to die most of the time. I do sit in school so I probably don't have a real future either. I daydream about suicide all the time. I don't have any close friends 'cause I can't really be honest with anyone. So I guess advice. Or if someone would like to talk to me would be fine too.
