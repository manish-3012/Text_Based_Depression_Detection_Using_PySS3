Lose my kids or lose all my friends and communityFor the last 7 months, I've been prospecting for a motorcycle club, a support system for veterans who, like me struggle with mental health. It's hands down the best cultural fit for me. I don't fit in anywhere with normal people. Normal people are all like another culture where I don't belong.   
My kids mom and her family are terrified or COVID. She's said that either I cease all activities with the club, which would disqualify me from membership, or not be able to see my kids again until there is a vaccine.   
I'm starting to resent her and the club for their combined lack of flexibility and understanding. I want to leave it all.
