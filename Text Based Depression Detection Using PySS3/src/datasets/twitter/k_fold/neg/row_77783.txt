God, I hate constantly switching between feeling fine and worrying that I'm going to just freak out and kill myselfFrom Jekyll and Hyde: The Musical:

&gt;But how can I deal with a foe I can't see

&gt;Who whenever he wants takes possession of me?

&gt;In the battle of wills that is raging inside,

&gt;Will I end up as me, or as Hyde?

I'm applying to jobs so I can leave my situation, but what if no one will hire me? I don't want to stay here. I don't think I can. My suicide plan works better without snow on the ground, and snow hits hard where I live. If I don't do it in the next few months, I'll have to wait until Spring.

I'm running out of time. Either something changes or I make it change.
