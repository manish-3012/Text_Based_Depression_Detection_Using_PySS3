Concerned about a friendI have a friend whose been dealing with depression for a while now, probably about a year or so. Tonight they got me really worried in regards to the things they were saying, as they sounded quite suicidal. Iâ€™ve been trying to help them for a while but often I donâ€™t know what to say. I think I handled the situation tonight pretty well, although I donâ€™t know how to move forward in regards to giving them support. Theyâ€™ve never outright mentioned that they would kill themselves, and whenever I try to touch on the subject they just say that theyâ€™re fine and try to end the conversation. Any advice or help is greatly appreciated, if you need any clarification feel free to ask. Sorry that this isnâ€™t a very thought out post, I kind of rushed it, you can imagine why.
