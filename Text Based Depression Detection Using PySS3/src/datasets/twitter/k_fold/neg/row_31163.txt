The Valentines Day Massacre Hey Reddit,


Simply put, I am tired of life, being alone, and being rejected by everyone I try to be close too. I have no family, no friends, no job, no hope of ever finding happiness. I've tired for almost a year to find a job, and setup a life. For some reason no one wants to be around me. Even my old friends stay away from me. It is not like I don't try to impress them and be a good friend.. Yet, they still left. 


The only thing I feel now left to do I kill self. I've already told those who matter that I'm going to end it. I've made plans, used all my money to buy really nice good, high quality wine/beer/champagne, and have laid it all out for tonight. 


I am going to eat till I can no longer eat. Drink till I am so drunk cannot stand. Then, I am going to run a bath, get in, put some anime on, eat all my sleeping pills, smoke all my medical marijuana, drink more, turn the shower on, and then cut my wrists. Once I fall asleep there will be no turning back. Hopefully hell waits for me, so, hell is the only life I've ever known.


I just thought I'd see what Reddit has to say. You guys have made me laugh, and have made me wish I never bothered posted anything. At any rate. Have a good mates, and you too ladies. I'll see you hell!
