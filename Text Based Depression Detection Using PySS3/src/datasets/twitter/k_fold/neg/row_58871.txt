There is no actual solution for suicidal peopleIâ€™ve gone to therapy but it has only resulted in me talking about my feelings with the therapist telling me to find a hobby. The second therapist made it seem like Iâ€™m a liability and that she would send me straight to the hospital if I ever mentioned I was suicidal. The third therapist also made it seem like it was my fault for being suicidal and wasnâ€™t so kind. I have been to the actual hospital where they just toss you with the other patients who arenâ€™t mentally sick and treat you indifferently or ignore you. The crisis center is also a dumpster fire of people with the same problems as you but expects you to get better by yourself. Whenever I opened up to my relatives or people who I thought cared about me, they just blame me for being suicidal and expect me to repress my emotions and expect me to serve others. In other words, youâ€™re fucked. You are expected to deal with your suicidal thoughts on your alone. My medication is not enough to stop these thoughts. I thought of getting a dog, but itâ€™s too expensive. There is no real solution for suicidal people in this world. They just tell you to suck it up and cheer up. Suicide is my inevitable fate at this point. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve learned after trying to get â€œprofessional helpâ€.
