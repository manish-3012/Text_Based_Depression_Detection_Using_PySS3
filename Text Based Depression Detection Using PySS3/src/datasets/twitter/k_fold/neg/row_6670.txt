Realized today that getting back to normal wasn't normal.I went through divorce recently, lost my wife, 2 kids and really nothing physical such as houses or furniture. I got so low. It was a new low that I thought I couldn't reach. I've tried to kill myself once before by overdosing on random meds from the medicine cabinet... didn't work, obviously. Saved me rather easily. Managed to lie well enough that they didn't rule me as "suicidal". 

Ive always felt this way. Sometimes it just gets to the point of finally acting on it. What a life. 

I envy people who are depressed for a reason.
 Because I am not. I don't know why I'm so damn sad and dead inside. I just don't know. God I just hate it. I actually get to the point where I wish people who loved me would die so I could die too. Them feeling incredible sadness is something that stops me a lot. I mean, it's selfish to keep me here like this. I just don't want to be.  Therapy, meds, all that bull, it doesn't help, just numbs me up, guess it works tho, hard to slit my dumb wrists when I can't think straight. I just want to be gone of this stupid world. Such bull how everyone else is running through life so "happy"... yea... I post here hoping someone will someday somehow change my mind and help, friends, family, strangers nothing seems to help, gotta try everything. If I survived twice then maybe I will find comfort someday.
