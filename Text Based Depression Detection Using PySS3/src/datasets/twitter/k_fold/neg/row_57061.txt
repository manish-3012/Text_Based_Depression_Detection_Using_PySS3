Iâ€™m a cancerAll I do is hurt other people and take their time and resources. They could be enjoying themselves but instead they have to waste their time on me. I tell them that itâ€™s pointless, that Iâ€™ll never get better, but they keep trying. Iâ€™m a tumor on society and I need to be cut out before I hurt anyone else.
