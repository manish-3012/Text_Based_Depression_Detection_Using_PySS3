How long can one run away from the truth. The reality of your circumstances.. Iâ€™ve been good at bullshitting for about 10 years but now Iâ€™m just so tired. Iâ€™m broke, jobless, hungry, and staring at the ceiling all dayIt really is a dog eat dog world. I have so many regrets.  Iâ€™ve learned how naive I was for so many years. How trusting and helping so many others backfired and now when I need help, they all turn their backs. 

Survival of the fittest. And I knkw im not fit to play this stupid game for much longer.
