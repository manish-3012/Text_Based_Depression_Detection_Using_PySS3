Just an uplifting postHey everyone.
I just wanted to to provide some encouragement for everyone who might be looking at r/SuicideWatch for whatever reason, whether it be that you are suicidal or a friend or family member is. Last night I almost killed myself. I was in a really awful place in my head. I thought there was no way out, no way to change my life. I thought I would be better off dead. But instead of doing something irreversible, I decided to talk to the people close to me, and then go to bed. Today, I was able to make some positive changes is my life, and it feels so good. I feel really free. I know it isnâ€™t that easy for everyone. Not everyone can just make a positive change with the snap of a finger. But I implore you to try.
The world is a better place with you in it. I know you may read this and say â€œwell they donâ€™t know me, Iâ€™m the exception because I suck.â€ Donâ€™t listen to that little voice. Thereâ€™s people out there who care about you. And thereâ€™s people out there you havenâ€™t met yet that are going to care about you. Thereâ€™s people on the street that youâ€™re gonna make smile, even just for a second. And think of all the joys ahead.
I got a sticker to put on my laptop that says â€œthereâ€™s so much joy ahead.â€ It reminds me that Iâ€™ll miss out in so much if I leave this world. Think of the beauty of just a little blade of grass, and little drops of dew on it. The wings of a butterfly. A forest brook singing to itself. The face of that one person who you adore. A city street on a sunny day, buzzing with energy and excitement. The way a pet looks at you with love in its eyes. The friends and significant others and family you havenâ€™t met yet, and the ones you have. And just so much more. Think of how beautiful the world is, and how much youâ€™ll miss if you leave it. I beg of you to think of all of that before you do anything drastic; the world is so beautiful with you in it.
