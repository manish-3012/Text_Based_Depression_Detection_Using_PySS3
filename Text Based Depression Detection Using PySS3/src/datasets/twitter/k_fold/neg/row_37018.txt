28/m I'm spiraling out of control. I need guidance.My life isn't bad. I have a good life. There's little reason for me to be so depressed. I have a story about how I got here, but I want to keep this moderately short. 

I absolutely hate where I am in life. I like my job, I'm a carpenter, but the people I work with are horrible. At every job. I worked with one man in 4 years who mentored me, he was great, but has since retired. 

I have no time to do the things I enjoy. I strive to get an 8 hour job, and they all start that way, but quickly turn into heavy overtime. 

My wife doesn't seem very supportive. She tells me she's sorry, and she wishes I was happy, but this is life now. 

I'd say the major culprit is my coworkers. I can't stand it. The way the talk down to me and yell and shit. I'm sick of it. Every job has been the same. 

I'm so scatter brain right now. I want to delete the thread. But I'm submitting now.
