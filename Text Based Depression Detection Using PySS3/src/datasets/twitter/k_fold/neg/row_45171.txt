I began cutting myself for the first timeThe past week has been too much for me emotionally. I've never been in this state of depression before. I hate myself so fucking much.  I literally can't talk to anyone about this without being called "over-dramatic" or " a pussy".  The shitty past week, combined with family issues, was the last straw for me. I cut my left arm twice now as a result of the amount of self-hatred I have for myself. I wish I could go back in time and fix the mistakes I made and regain the dignity I had for myself. Fuck my life. I'm the dumbest fucking idiot alive.
