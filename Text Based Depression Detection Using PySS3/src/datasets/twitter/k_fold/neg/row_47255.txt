The Final NightI've been thinking about this the past couple of weeks. A few months ago, my girlfriend left me, and I started a spiral depression.

I turned 23 and I officially just started college, but I had to move back in with my parents in order to pay for it. Now all I see is negativity, for everything. I can't stop thinking that all this is just pointless. At first I didn't entertain the idea because my family would be sad, now it's just "yeah, but they are stronger, they will get over it". I just don't see why to live. There is no point,  we die anyway. Everything is dark, light is just shit.

 I'm at a party with my close friends, and I'm miserable. All I can think about is how much fun my ex is having without me, or how I'll never find joy. I just don't know how much longer I find it worth it to hang out here
