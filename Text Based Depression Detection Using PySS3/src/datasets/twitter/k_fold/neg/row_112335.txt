I've reached my wits end, I'm done and ready to leave this earth. Too much pain...My phone is broken, otherwise I'd be calling a hotline. I walk the thin line between life and death and the only peace or comfort i find is thinking about suicide and ending my pain. I need someone to talk to, I cease to see the point in continuing on. I want to die. The organs in my body can be transplanted into 7 different people who desperately want to live and need what I have to live.
