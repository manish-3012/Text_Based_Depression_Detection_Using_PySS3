Feeling very low right nowSuicide has been on my mind a lot recently. Lost my job and have had to turn to sex work to be able to feed my dog as I am having no luck trying to get another. 

Feel so worthless and like a total disappointment to my family. 

Depression is something I have been suffering with since I was 10 and I am usually able to deal with the suicidal thought as they come and go, but this time they arenâ€™t going away.
