Life simply sucksModern life simply sucks, i dont want to spend most of my life working at a shitty job, i dont want to be "normal", i dont want to fit into this sick corrupted society.  Modern life doesnt seem appealing to me at all. I just want to leave this sick world, no i dont want to cope with this insanity. Its not me who is insane, its society. Why should i keep living, if this world is destroying me?
