Um.. No idea what to do, but a guy just told me he was going to kill himself. Basically i'm a trader in TF2, and I had a guy added on steam who I was doing a trade with. He backed out of the deal we were doing, which is fine, but then he said this:


* (removed): i've made a decision that im prob going to do so.. sorry for wasting your time

* IM ACTUALLY A CRATE: lol its no problem mate

* IM ACTUALLY A CRATE: wasted none of my time

* (removed): well i think its kinda innapropriate to say

* IM ACTUALLY A CRATE: hm?

* (removed): im probably going to commit suicide

* IM ACTUALLY A CRATE: ...okay then

* (removed): so.. cya

* (removed) is now Offline.

Here's his steamID: (removed)

He's still online, I don't know if he was just trolling or if he's serious. I've reported his account and put the chat log in the report. 

**UPDATE** 
 
He posted a thread, please direct yourself to there:
