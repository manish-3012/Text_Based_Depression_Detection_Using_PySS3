I don't know how to fix myself, and wanna end it.With all of the stress going on with this COVID-19 virus, on top of isolation from friends, no local friends, alcoholic problems, and no real feeling of self worth, I just wanna end it. My dreams are literal pipe dreams, my family has no confidence in me; I just feel like lying down in the middle of a road so a truck can end my existence. Please convince me why I should stay, I'm running out reasons to go on at this point.
