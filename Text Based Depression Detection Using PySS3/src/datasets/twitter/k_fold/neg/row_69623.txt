January 15th95 days.  Iâ€™m scared but excited.  Iâ€™ve been thinking about my plan for a long time, I just needed a date.  I have plenty of time to change my mind, but I donâ€™t think I will.  At least, I donâ€™t want to.  I just wish there was a way to do this without destroying everyone.  But there will never be a way around it, so why bother worrying anymore?

See you then
