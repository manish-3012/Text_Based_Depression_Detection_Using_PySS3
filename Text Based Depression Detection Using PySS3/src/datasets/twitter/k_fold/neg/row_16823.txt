Dead insideHey im not sure why I (25m) post this on reddit, maybe to beat some time.
Anyway my best friend of 20 years and my femal best friend of 12 years hooked up last week. I pushed him and its my fault, but I can't stand seeing them. I always wanted her to be happy because shes the only person I truly trust, shes the one important person for me. And I fucking hurt her, my bestfriend told her he doesnt want to try it because hes afraid about the friendship and some mentioned cause of me. I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I feel something for her I can't explain, its something I dont know but I feels so real. It doesnt matter, im not good enough for her and never will. My head tells me this all the fucking time, and I don't want it anymore. Im garbage and a waste of space. But the good thing is Im numb most of the time, havnt eaten in 6 days and im not hungry, not anymore. I also feel way less pain. My hands are swollen and bleeding from boxing vs a wall, but no real pain. I cut in my flesh and it doesn't even burn anymore. Its like a part of me died, and now im just existing. After she told me about their kiss, my chest felt impaled, like really, a cleaving wound, but now all is left is nothing. At least I did one good thing, and changed my last will this week in her favour, my last chance of doing something good for her.

Im sorry, I dont know why I wrote it but I got nothing left in this world, maybe just to write it down
