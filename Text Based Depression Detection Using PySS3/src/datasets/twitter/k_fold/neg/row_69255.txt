I'm so upset with National Suicide HotlineMy boyfriend is suicidal. We've been together for more than 10 years. Several friends of his have committed suicide including one very recently. He was injured in early December and it has been very very hard on him. He's been really angry at me the past couple days over minor things. He has a pattern of threatening suicide when he is upset. It is never a threat in terms of if you do or don't X, I'll kill myself. It is that he is so overwhelmed by emotion, typically manifesting as anger that he wants to kill himself. He just blew up at me and ranted about how I'm such a horrible person and I make everything 10000 times worse. The only tangible claim he can make against me is that I have an attitude. If I say that I will go, that doesn't change anything. He just told me that he thinks about killing himself, researches it, plans it and just doesn't have the nerve to do it. He just left to drive around "on icy roads and would drive into something if he had the nerve". This isn't the first time I've heard anything like this and I don't believe it is a legitimate threat. But I know he's suffering immensely and I don't know what to do. I called National Suicide Hotline for the first time a few minutes ago and before the rep gets much information, she asks for his name. I tell her his first name but don't feel right giving his last name. It feels like a violation of privacy. She then tells me that the only thing I can do is call the Police. I ask what good that will do, that I don't think law enforcement is the right step to take. Then she asks what I expected when I called National Suicide Prevention. I told her that I expected an opportunity to talk to someone and get some perspective. I was really put off by her tone and what felt like manipulative tactics. I asked to speak with someone else and she said that no one else was available. I'm sooo upset now and don't know where to turn.
