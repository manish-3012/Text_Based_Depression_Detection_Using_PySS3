I'm so tired of lifeIt just keeps going and going and going.  I hate my fucking job.  I don't want to go to college because I'll fuck it up just like I fucked up high school, I know that for a fact.  It doesn't matter what anyone says, I know me, I WILL fuck it up.  So I'm stuck here.

On top of that it's almost impossible for me to talk about my feelings with anyone, and when I do I get the same fucking solutions.  'Go back to college' 'Get a GED' 'Quit your job and find a new one' 'Find a hobby' 'try dating'.  If I had any motivation to do any of those things I would have done so already.  I have so many fucking hobbies I lose track of them, and I still feel like a pathetic piece of shit.

Nothing changes.  Day after day after day I go to work, come home, cry, play with my stupid puzzles, go to bed, it just keeps going and going and going.  There's no fucking end in sight.  Every day I wish something could just fucking take me out like a bus or something.  Maybe an aneurysm I don't know just fucking make it stop because I'm too much of a pussy to do it myself.

Gosh I'd love to go get some help but I'm fucking TERRIFIED of saying anything about my feelings lest they put me in the psych ward.  I've been there before, it's easily the worst experience of my life and I wish never to repeat it.  If anything it makes me feel worse.  So now I don't fucking trust anybody.  I guarantee when I stop feeling so emotional I'm going to delete this because it embarasses and worries me.

I just want it all to stop
