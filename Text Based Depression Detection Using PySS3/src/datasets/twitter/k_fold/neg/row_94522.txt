Every morning I wake up, I have to talk myself out of killing myself.Been a redditor for a long time. Never posted anything. Not sure why I am now... I don't have nearly as hard as a life as a lot of people. Yet sadly here I am... I'm ashamed that I can't be a happy person.

Little bit of back story-
Since the age of 13 I've had a drug problem. My family was in shambles. I turned to everything I could. I overdosed on ecstasy twice. Was arrested a few times with weed and different drugs. 

I was actually at the top of my class scoring a 28 on my ACT, and being accepted into our voyagers program which was simply for the Students they felt excelled in their school work. I was also the only student in the history of the program to be kicked out... I certainly was troubled as a young man but never thought of ending my life.

All that aside, about a year ago I was in a bad car accident. Completely belligerently wasted, going about 105mph on a 45mpg city road and flipped my car about 8 times. Was in ICU for two weeks suffered several broken bones and pretty sever head trauma. For the severity of the crash I made it out alright. However this last year I have noticed a change in myself. 

I feel almost bipolar at times. Can snap at any minute. Can't stand to be around my friends or family at times. And the depression and anxiety have been ridiculously overwhelming. For the past 6 months every single day I try to talk myself out of killing myself because I know that it's an extremely selfish act and I would absolutely crush a lot of people...

But I truly think that my accident has changed me... I have done quite a bit of research and it certainly is possible after head trauma, but I don't have the money to seek help... Nor am I the type of person to go asking for it. Everyone I know thinks I'm the toughest person they have ever met, little do they know it's all just an illusion... I'm a broken man on the inside, and I just keep my fingers crossed that a freak accident will take me out one of these days soon.

I know this is poorly written. And I know im rambling, I apologize if anyone actually reads this. I've been sitting in my car outside the gym for 2 hours contemplating wether or not to keep this life up or not. I hope everyone can find happiness in their lives.
