I donâ€™t know why but I feel happy even when Iâ€™m planning on suicide?Iâ€™m planning on ending myself tomorrow. Iâ€™ve cried so many years and have put so much pain on myself these past week, yet the days leading up to my suicide I feel happy. Itâ€™s almost as if Iâ€™m finding the concept of death calming.
