my life is going great...so why am i not happy???in my vulnerable moments I constantly find myself writing these posts or talking to a friend. there, i have the opportunity to say something, to say how i really feel and i just can't. i can never find the words to explain this pain so i say nothing and continue to suffer in silence. then i think would it probably wouldn't make a difference if i did have the right words.

i have so many great things going on in life and it means nothing to me. i still feel empty. im tired of waiting for things to "get better." i don't care anymore. i'm tired of fighting for another day. my soul is tired. it's like i lost my kick, the little drive i did have to care.

i just want to die. i don't wanna suffer anymore.
