Suffering is the only emotion I feel I have control over and for that reason I continue to uphold it.It is the most empowering feeling. The only emotion I will ever be comfortable in, it is predictible, it knows what makes me tick and I have full control over it.

The same way I have full control over killing myself, there only true life critical thing in my life I will ever have control over.
