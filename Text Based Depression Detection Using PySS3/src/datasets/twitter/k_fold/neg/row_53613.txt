I really feel like killing myself nowI had thoughts like this before but never before,when I think of the crap I have to struggle with every single fucking day,I just dont wanna deal with it anymore because it always gonna be the same and nothing gonna change,i'm a guy and 22 with no friends,whenever I try to make friends I am treated like crap by both genders,guys dont wanna talk with guys and girls my age dont even wanna hear about it,I talked with a few girls that are about 16-18 and some of them judged me calling me about just because I tried to talk with them me being 21 and them 16,I dont wanna live in this sick world anymore,I am done!
