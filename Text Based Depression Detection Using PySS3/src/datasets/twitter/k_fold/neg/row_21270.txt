What now?About a year ago, I sat in a bathtub with a knife in my hand taking solace in the fact that it would all be over soon. The only reason I stopped was the text I got saying "I love you" from a girl. 

Tonight, I spent 4 hours crying after explaining how I feel to her and having her reject me, so there is no hope for me. So where do I go now? I graduated high school today. It should have been a happy day for me. But today just had he floodgates of bad news open up. Now I just feel empty inside. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I feel sick.

I'm just a husk of a person now. Showing what has been.
