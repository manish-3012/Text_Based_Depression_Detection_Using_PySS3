HurtingI never hoped that I'd be in this head space again, but I've been thinking about it recently. I'm quite behind in life and I've been bringing a lot of negativity and emotional baggage into my relationships. I know they're tired, I'm tired, and I'm always apologetic whenever I have moments of extreme sadness.

They don't deserve it. They don't deserve the pain of having to worry over someone and seeing them gone forever. I could feel everyone's desperation to see me improve, but I'm lacking the warmth. Nobody I'm comfortable with is available when I need them the most, and it's unfair to call out for them. I feel alone, and though I'm still holding on to hope, I hope that I'm strong enough to still be around for Halloween.
