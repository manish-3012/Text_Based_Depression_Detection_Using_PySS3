I've lost all motivationIt's been happening for a long time, slowly losing interest and watching life pass me by, I'm unemployed, got nothing from university and no longer scared of how much I think about either ending my life or dying via accident or in an imaginary conflict. 

I can't bring myself o care about the future as from my viewpoint I don't think it will happen, the only thing keeping me here is my family and friends but I can't speak of this to them. I've tried and my own father stated "it's normal for your age", I've tried therapy and it hasn't helped.

So the question is should I stay or should I go?
