Very sadMy boyfriend seems very sick and tired of me after a fight about a bill payment for our wedding.  Yesyerday I even thought he ghosted me because he didnt open some of his accountss whole day but sent me just 2 emails... today he chatted me a bit asking if I am working to resolve the payment issue and then bam again offline. He seems hurt maybe. Can you advice me what to do? Do you think he still loves me?
