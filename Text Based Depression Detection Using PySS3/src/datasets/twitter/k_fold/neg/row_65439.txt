The temptation to inject heroin and be done with everything is extremely tempting...I have it all prepared.
All I have to do is inject it and Iâ€™m out of here. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it before I fell asleep and once I woke up Iâ€™m still thinking about it. I keep asking myself questions about reality but nothing is making sense. 
Weâ€™re all going to die anyways so itâ€™s not that big of a deal. The people who care about me will move on with their lives eventually and then theyâ€™ll die sometime as well.
All I want to do is inject it, I have all the supplies to do it. Itâ€™ll be quick and easy, Iâ€™ll simply fall asleep and not wake up ever again.
Why do people live on this planet to find purpose? Itâ€™s all a delusion. The fact that weâ€™re living on this huge rock in space doesnâ€™t make any sense. Obviously someone put us here for a purpose but why? I keep asking this question but I canâ€™t find the answer and I need to know the answer but itâ€™s freaking me out.
The more I think about injecting it the more I want to do it. I donâ€™t think if I went to the psych ward nothing would change. Iâ€™ll still want to die. The psychiatrists and therapists will simply use delusion to make me stay alive. Weâ€™re all delusional to be living right now. Why? Because every human who want to be alive is trying to make purpose of their lives so they feel like theyâ€™re in control. There was never a purpose. Itâ€™s all delusion.
