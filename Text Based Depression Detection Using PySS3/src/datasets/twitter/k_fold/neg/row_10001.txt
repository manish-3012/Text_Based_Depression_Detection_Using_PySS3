What happens if I go to the ER for being suicidal? I'm in Florida, so Baker Act?I have no money or insurance. I have been afraid to call my father to ask for money and didn't get far talking to my brother. I am late on rent and I guess homeless is next without help or suicide. Even if I had money, that wouldn't solve the loneliness and anxiety that has brought me to this point.
