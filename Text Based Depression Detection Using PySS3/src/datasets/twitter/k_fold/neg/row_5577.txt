My last breath. Thank you. 06-15-2020.My last breath.
It is time. 

After 22 years of my life here I am.
Oh have I waited for this moment for a long time now.
I feel different knowing that all of it will end today. The pain, the suffering and the trauma. All of it will vanish within an hour.

Weirdly enough, I actually feel "happy" for the first time in years, knowing that I can be at rest. 

I have no one left, no one to visit my grave, no one to be sad from my passing. No one who'll remember me in a few years. But it's okay, at least I know I tried my best. I tried making everyone around me happy while I myself was being eaten inside out from my own thoughts and feelings. Gutted. Murdered. By my own feelings. 

I have nothing more to add since probably no-one will see this anyways. 

But if anyone of you see this, remember this day. 
Farewell my friends.
