I was distractedA recent experience has made me feel comfortable enough to know what I want and its not life. I was going to do it a few days ago but I got distracted and I realised that I wasn't happy being distracted from it. I will be going tonight, light up some spliffs get nice and toasty and relaxed, it'll be over. It doesnt scare me in the least it doesn't even excite me.
