Life is purgatory. I don't desire anything other than to be dead. I don't want to recover. I just want rid myself from the world, so I can be forgotten eventually. I'm thinking about performing the act very very soon.I've devised a plan to kill myself. There is no need to keep myself alive. For one, none of us chose to be born, therefore no one should be obligated to live. 

It is baffling how much I don't care for today's politics and problems. In fact, I care about them just as much as I care about myself. 

Life doesn't matter to me. For me, I'd consider myself dead already, entrapped in this vessel that prevents me from disappearing. Instead of the sweet bliss of death, I am forced to roam this purgatory-like world, well, not for long.

Someone like me is not made for, nor is useful to society. I am a person who is unproductive, unintelligent, and not skillful in anything known to man. To top it all off, I am also a self-destructive person who doesn't care about other people and refuses any treatment or help. I am not someone anyone should be interacting with.

I am already doing the world a favor by weeding my DNA out of today's gene pool. And if I kill myself that would be another win for humanity as a whole, nobody would have to interact with me again, I would never affect anyone ever again, you all would never see me post ever again, that would be a pleasant future indeed, Although you all will disagree since this subreddit is made to prevent suicide, not encourage it.

I don't want to, nor do I have the energy or patience to go on with living. I do not fight the desire to die, because I agree with it, rightfully so.
