How long do these thoughts lastFor the last 2 and a half years it's been nothing but fucking bullshit. Sure I can make people laugh, sure I have some friends, but what's the goddamn point? I know these people say shit about me the second i turn around, I know that I'm an ugly bastard that's just going to be alone for a long ass time before I settle with someone who I don't find attractive just so I can say I didn't die alone. 2 and a half years of crying over nothing and wondering when it's going to start getting better. The suicidal thoughts never end, I think about it daily. I can just imagine the bastards tweeting some bullshit like "another suicide at our school, guess nobody learns" I can imagine them all saying stuff about how everyone loved me, and no one was rude. That's the only reason I haven't gone through and done it yet, because I think it would be a waste if I didn't get to see how everyone reacts and fronts on some bullshit like how much everyone loved me. I probably end up doing it anyway, just to get away and end the constant worrying about "oh I wonder if she actually likes me" "am I texting her too much" "why doesn't he stop being a cock and staring at me like he wants to fight"

Anyways, sorry for such a long and rambling post, I just can't really articulate these feelings in the most comprehensive way because I'm crying haha. Maybe someone here can give me a reason to not take a toaster to the bathtub.
