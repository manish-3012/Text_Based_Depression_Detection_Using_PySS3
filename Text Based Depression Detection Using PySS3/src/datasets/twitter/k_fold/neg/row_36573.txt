I need someone to listenI am in such a weird space anymore. Iâ€™m a 24M with so much more than i could have ever asked for in this life but I feel so broken. Iâ€™ve wanted to die since I was about 7 years old. I wandered through those years battling myself over and over. A Suicide attempt and years of alcohol abuse. Iâ€™ve been sober for over a year now after going to rehab and now Iâ€™m just sober and sad. I take my medicine but it doesnâ€™t work anymore. I am tired of trying to be happy. I donâ€™t think I will ever be happy thereâ€™s something wrong with my brain.  Thereâ€™s just been this cold presence walking with me lately and itâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been telling myself this whole life. Iâ€™m sorry for ranting but nobody listens to me. Nobody believes me. I feel so alone sitting here right now writing to you all. I have always felt like I didnâ€™t belong in this world.  Like I was placed here accidentally and now I have to go through the motions everyday. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I just want the pain to stop. My soul feels so broken and misplaced on this earth.  Iâ€™m ready to go.  My heart has been hurting for so long and things arenâ€™t even that bad. Iâ€™m just at war with myself and Iâ€™m done with it. Itâ€™s exhausting doing this everyday.
