I've lost all hopeI have nothing left... nothing is worth it anyway... I found my blade... I promised him I'd never use it on myself again... he broke a promise too... I guess we'll be even... I just wanna see him one more time... I want him to hold me but I guess he can't now that he's gone... goodbye world... no one is gonna miss me anyway...
