I desperately want to die but i don't want to hurt my family.I've been thinking about this for years, the pros and cons of living just don't balance from my perspective. Long story short, things have gotten bad recently, quickly, and the only reason i can think of to live is so that my family doesn't have to deal with my death. I'm not happy, i haven't been happy for years, my only choice is to end the suffering, and my family won't matter to me when I'm dead, so why continue?
