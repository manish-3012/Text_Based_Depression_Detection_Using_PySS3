This World is a Shit WorldI hate being alive. I hate how things start to look up, then bam back at less than zero. I hate being surrounded by assholes all the time. I hate that I'm too weak to just break up with my boyfriend, cut out my friends and family, and just take my life. I have so many ways to. But that 'What if I fail?' haunts me. If I fail, I'll be out of college, having wasted so many thousands of my family's money for tuition going to nothing. I'll have no friends. No relationship. Nothing. I'm just a failure and burden to this world. And my mind has yet to change for the 19-1/2 years I've been alive. I'm sorry for wasting your time if you read this. Just wanted to vent...
