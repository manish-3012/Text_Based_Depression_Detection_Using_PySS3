Are the unemployed supposed to kill themselves?I need money to live and I need a job to have money. So if no one will hire me does that mean I should kill myself?

I've been out of college for a year and have been unemployed the entire time. I've applied to hundreds of jobs and received hundreds of rejection letters. I don't see the point of continuing. It's hopeless and pointless.
