I'm not doing horrible, just not good enough to be aliveI had some stuff as a kid that screwed me up but nothing horrible and I'm just off. I have a hard time talking to people and people have a hard time talking to me. I don't want to impose my problems on people, I guess I should more. I kind of feel like life's not worth living anymore, not in a "ah this is so painful I hate all of this" type of thing, more in a well i'd rather hop off this ride than stay on it. I'm seeing a therapist but I'm in this way of thinking so far I feel like she's having a hard time or doesn't really know how to get me out of it. I saw a psychotherapist today and he's an absolute dickhead, made me think well if what's waiting for me when I get "better" is more of this dumb shit I'll pass. I feel like I'm going to vomit.
