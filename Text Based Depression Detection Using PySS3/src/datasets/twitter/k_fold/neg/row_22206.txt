BYE SEE YOU NEVERHOPE YOU ALL ARE HAPPY

I GAVE ALL MY LOVE AND KINDNESS TO THE WORLD AND WHAT DO I GET?

I GET CHEATED ON, ABUSED, LIED TO, MANIPULATED, SCREAMED AT, TOLD IM A WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT

BY MY MOTHER, MY SISTER, and the LOVE OF MY LIFE WHO CHEATED AND LEFT ME. I WAS THERE FOR THEM. I GAVE UP CLASSES AND QUIZZES AND STUDY TIME TO BE THERE FOR FUCKING STRANGERS. AND I GET TREATED LIKE DIRT AND THROWN AWAY

NO MORE. FUCK ALL OF YOU. ENJOY YOUR SELFISH LIVES. STOP PROJECTING ONTO US THAT WE ARE SELFISH BY LEAVING THIS DISGUSTING WORLD - NO. WE ARE FUCKING BRAVE. YOU HAVE RUINED US AND WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO LEAVING YOUR HELL. ENJOY TORTURING EACH OTHER FUCKERS
