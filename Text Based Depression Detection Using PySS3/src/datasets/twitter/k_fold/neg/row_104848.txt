Over itWall of text idk Iâ€™m not feeling very coherent. I moved away from home and started over, Iâ€™ve hardly made any friends, my anxiety keeps me in the house which defeats the whole purpose of this lifestyle. My relationship is falling apart, and my period is super late; pretty sure Iâ€™m pregnant and going to have to get an abortion. I never want to go through that experience. Last night I was supposed to stay up to study for a midterm for a class I never go to, but instead caused a fight with my SO and just went to sleep after because I felt so depressed. Woke up very sick, and unable to study properly. I have maybe 20 minutes to study now, for a test that is most of my grade. I can maybe wing it, but maybe fail horribly. My parents are bankrupting themselves paying for my school, but wonâ€™t let me drop out or take a leave of absence, because I told them I donâ€™t want to take out shitty loans and ruin my future, I would rather do what I want without a degree, which is feasible. But everyonr would judge me and my parents would never forgive me for embarrassing them. Iâ€™ve screwed up my life and I know I can fix it but I donâ€™t really want to. I just want it all to be over, I am tired of mental illness making me ruin my life then giving me energy to fix it before i just fuck it up again. Iâ€™m stupid and lazy and Iâ€™m tired.
