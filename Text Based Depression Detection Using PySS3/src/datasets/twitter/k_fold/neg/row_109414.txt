I just want to stop existingI need to vent because I don't feel I can talk to anybody about it anymore. I just feel so alone all the time. Even my friends, I feel like I can't talk to them, I feel like I already just come off as such a sensitive, and sad piece of shit, that even broaching the subject of depression and suicide would be too much. I feel like everyone has their own internal suffering and it's just not fair for me to unload my personal baggage. 

But there are times I just want scream how I feel, I want someone to listen, to understand me, to care... but without it being a burden for them. But I really don't think that's possible... there's just too much to unpack. I feel so deeply alone and it's getting to me really bad now.

I like sleeping so much because it gives me a break from my head, from reality. I now try to go to bed early because I look forward to that. How fucking pitiful is that? I smoke weed constantly now because it softens the harsh self-loathing I feel when I'm sober and it helps disconnect me from my real world issues. I just try to get through each day now. I'm not excited by life anymore, there are times where I can forget myself, and be "happy" but when it comes back to me it just feels even worse. And I'm so insecure about what people think about me, and how I'm perceived that I just project my own self-loathing into how I think they feel about me.. so it just becomes this shitty feedback loop. Nobody could ever actually like me as a person, or want to be around me.. they just pity me. I'm just too exhausting to deal with, I really truly believe that.

Suicide has always been in the back of my mind and I'm thinking about it more and more now. It's becoming more attractive and I know that's supposed to be a "bad" thing... but it's comforting to know I have this "out" waiting for me if the suffering becomes too much. I just don't know how much more I can take, especially if things stay the same. I want so badly to go to bed and never wake up.
