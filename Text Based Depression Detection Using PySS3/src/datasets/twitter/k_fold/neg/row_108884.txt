I just have trouble seeing the point anymore.Every single day, I think about why I even bother carrying on anymore at least once. Sometimes, like right now, it gets so hard that I don't sleep, and my eyes well up. My life isn't even bad, I just don't feel like I've earned it. I attend college, but my study habits are horrid. I've been falsely accused of plagiarizing, which doesn't help at all. I hardly ever do homework, can't fathom why I don't do it, I skip class despite always telling myself that I need to go, and I just generally don't feel like I belong anywhere. I hated every aspect of life back home, but there's no way I can carry on this facade here for much longer. I'm taking this as a sign that my medication isn't working anymore, but I just don't know. How the hell can I make myself appreciate what I have without dwelling on why I shouldn't have it?
