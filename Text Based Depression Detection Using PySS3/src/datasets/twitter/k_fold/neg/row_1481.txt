I hadnâ€™t cut myself in 5 years, i just threw that down the drain.Theyâ€™re not that deep, but now that iâ€™ve started i donâ€™t want to stop. i want to keep going, and deeper. It didnâ€™t hurt it felt fucking amazing and now iâ€™m going to go look for a razor instead of pieces of my broken mirror. If i keep going, maybe i can cut deep enough to bleed out. I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore, i hope iâ€™m brave enough to do this.
