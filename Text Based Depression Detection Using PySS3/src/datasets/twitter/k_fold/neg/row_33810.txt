I held a loaded gun to my head s few minutes agoI have never been more afraid. I have had thoughts of suicide as far back as I can remember and the closest I've come to going through was finding a building tall enough to fit the requirements. 


I feel like I have to prove to somebody that my thoughts aren't just thoughts and are legitimate actions that I am capable of carrying through with. But after holding a gun with a bullet loaded and the hammer cocked to my temple I've realized just how much I've sugar coated the act in my mind. I don't know why I'm putting this here but if you feel like you need to prove something to someone, well that someone can go fuck themselves. 
I've never had my heart beat so fast and I've also never felt afraid of myself. I'm scared of having a gun in my house with me and afraid of what I might do in the future.

I don't know it's all just more confusing than I thought.
