Idk why Iâ€™m even writing thisI just need to say this. Iâ€™ve been feeling low for so long now and I feel like I just have to stop. Iâ€™m scared, of course but I canâ€™t stand being here anymore. So many people have so many worse problems and Iâ€™ve tried so hard to accept the life I live but seriously this is it. My head is in an eternal fog, I canâ€™t find the motivation to do anything every single day. Iâ€™m a burden and Iâ€™m making everyone around me unhappy and thatâ€™s what I really canâ€™t stand. I just want it all to stop. Iâ€™ve come here before to give advice but I looked here today and it just overwhelmed me. I just snapped. This isnâ€™t my first attempt and I know that I regretted it but I canâ€™t convince myself Iâ€™m happy anymore because Iâ€™m not. So, Iâ€™ve made a deal with myself, 28 days and if nothing gets better thatâ€™s it. Itâ€™s comforting in the strangest way. I guess itâ€™s knowing that things will be better either way. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this here honestly I guess I just need someone to listen maybe. Iâ€™m just so so tired.
