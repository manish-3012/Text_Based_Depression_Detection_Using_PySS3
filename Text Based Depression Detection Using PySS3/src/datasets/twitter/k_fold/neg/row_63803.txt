Happy Sweet 16thIt's the day before my 16th birthday, and there isn't much left for me to do. I've gathered all my stuff up for school tomorrow, I've written a note on my phone, and I've had one last fight with my mom. Once school is over tomorrow, I'm planning on going to the busiest street near school, ( I go to school in the city) and just walk in front of a bus.  I'm not sad anymore, I think. Unless I really start to think about it, I don't cry. I'm not telling my girlfriend, she'll break down. And I actually had a therapist appointment tomorrow too, how ironic! Well, wish me luck~ EDIT: Yes I am still here, not feeling much better, though. To no one's surprise, I backed out at the last second. My therapist appointment was cancelled, I had no one to talk to about it. I'm sorry if I worried anyone with a late update.
