I know itâ€™s real.I know I am going to kill myself tonight it would take a miracle if I didnâ€™t. I have never felt this sure about it I thought I had a month ago but that didnâ€™t go well. My boyfriend Is actually at work this time so I have absolutely no one to stop me and itâ€™s kind of peaceful. I know he is probably just pissed at me right now because Iâ€™m suicidal but you know fuck him at this point because he is a huge reason Iâ€™m killing myself. I tried to give my all to him and make him the happiest on earth and show him how much he meant to me and he basically took a whole ass shit on my feelings today and when I said I was going to leave this earth he simply said â€˜okayâ€™ this man has ruined my whole life and I let him. I lost myself so long ago and it would feel amazing to die it would feel like a decision I got to make for myself for once. Something that would take away all of my pain. It sounds so fucking comforting right now. Just sucks I didnâ€™t get my gun in time. Sadly will have to scar some people on the freeway with my dead mangled body I really didnâ€™t want that but I donâ€™t have rope and slitting my wrist is not in my zone of comfort and overdosing is just not that fucking effective. Love you all you were like a weird huge family that I could talk to with no fear of judgment and felt connected to. You guys made me feel more loved than my boyfriend has made me feel in the past couple of years. Thank you so much. I sadly will not be engaging in messages as it distracts me from the task at hand but thank you reddit for everything you guys were amazing.
