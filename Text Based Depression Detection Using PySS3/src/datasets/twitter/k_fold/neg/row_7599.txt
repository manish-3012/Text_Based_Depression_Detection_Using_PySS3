Lost, and too far gone to help myselfI've struggled with depression and anxiety for years. Recently, it's become too much to bear. I lost my job in January. We lost our apartment in Feb. I'm down to my last 10 dollars and have yet to find a job. I get several interviews a week. No work. I'm a failure and I cant provide for my gf the way i use to. Worst of all, I'm so fucking depressed I can't bring myself to climb out of this hole. I'm ready to call it. We have been staying with my gf's mother, and if I cant afford to pay her rent Friday, I'm out. And I have 10 fucking dollars. My gf will be better off without me. She doesnt need a total fucking waste like me.
