I donâ€™t know if I can go on.So my birthdays tomorrow and it just means another year of suffering. I think about suicide every day but I donâ€™t have the courage to go through with it. The emotional pain is so unbearable and all I want to do is self harm. I need some light on my life Iâ€™m turning 19 and I feel so alone.
