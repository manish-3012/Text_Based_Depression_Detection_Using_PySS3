SignsStruggling here. I put this together-as I just feel silent in my struggle. 

How Suicidal Ideation Looks From The Outside:

To close friends-
A lot of talk about how bad things are. Eventually days turn into weeks of no contact at all. Waits to see if a text will come through to them-vs- FROM them (as it usually is).

To other friends:
Generally look ok, but may acknowledge some struggle. May seem distant. May see swollen eyes from crying. 

To family: If theres anyone in the family they trust- the truth has been told. Told again. Eventually person stops telling. Becomes distant. Cries easily-for seemingly trivial issues.

To employer:
Same ole same ole. Perfection. Hard on self. But weird "all of a sudden" changes in schedule. May have swollen eyes from crying.

To social media:
Total disappearance. Person is wondering if anyone will "notice" or care. 

To adult children:
May witness parent cries easily and often. Erratic emotions.  Distance. Erratic communication.
