Tonight, it's over.My parents got the letter saying I've been placed on conditional leave. I'm almost 24 and still in undergrad. I can't finish and I have no drive to, but I have to. My parents are crazy and I rely on their support for everything. I can't face another lecture from my parents and I can't face their disappointment yet again. I just wish I knew an easy way to go. Everything seems so painful. I wish I could just not wake up in the morning. 


I just wish I knew someone who would be able to come to my place and take my cat away. I just want to make sure someone will care for her and love her as much as I do.. I don't know how long it would be otherwise until anyone would find me, so I'm worried about her :(


I don't know what my point is in writing this because I doubt I'll change my mind. Just catharsis, I guess. Thank you for reading.
