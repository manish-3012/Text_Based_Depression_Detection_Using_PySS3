Is life worth living or should I just end it all right here, right now ?My life is a pile of shit, my grades have always been dogshit, no matter how hard I tried I always failed. Parents sent me to uni abroad, got expelled the 2nd year, got a job to go through the month, minimum wage 10 hours a day 7 days a week. I'm a stupid introverted shy guy that has absolutely no friends, can't make a conversation let alone keep it. I know no one, no one knows me, and I see no reason to just disappear. Is there a single reason why I shouldn't just end it ?
