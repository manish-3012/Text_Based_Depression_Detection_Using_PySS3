I feel like tomorrow is going to be the dayI think I'm finally going to jump tomorrow. I've been thinking long and thoroughly about it. This may seem strange but I'm not sad, I'm dead inside.I don't hate myself or other people, I've tried to think as rationally about the whole situation as possible but it's probably for the best to talk to people with a different perspective before I make such an important in irreversible decision.   
Edit: I wrote all my thoughts down early this day in I don't feel the need to talk anymore. I feel at peace.   
Edit: I just talked to somebody who wants to help me and it would be really rude to kill myself now. Maybe I should have done it while I was isolated or maybe I don't really want to die, I don't know. I'm such a jackass.
