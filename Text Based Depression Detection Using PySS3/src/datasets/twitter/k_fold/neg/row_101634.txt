Why am I hanging up pictures of her..I have this memory wall in my room. There are notes and pictures from people I care about. Even if the person who wrote them and I hate each other, I keep it up because it's proof that at least one time, they cared for me.

I still have our stuff and I hung it up. Our zoo map and our photobooth pictures. We had a little tradition of using a picture booth whenever we saw one. Now if I see one, I die a little.

I can't take them down now, even though looking at them makes my stomach hurt.
