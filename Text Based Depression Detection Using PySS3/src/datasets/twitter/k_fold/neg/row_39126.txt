do I just give up?Those empty promises she made me, marriage and family.. 

Every night I try not to have the memories of us but they just flood and the tears just roll down my face.

I actually like myself but a huge part of me desires to be loved and I just can't see a world with a new person, I just can't.

I'm so so sad and broken.  I just want to end my suffering, I was a good person to her.

I see many of you who've had SO's that abandoned you or did something to you and never recovered, I feel like I'm part of that group. 6months in
