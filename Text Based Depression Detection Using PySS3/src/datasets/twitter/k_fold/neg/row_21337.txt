Close to SuicideSo I have the option to take my own life painlessly and quickly and I wonâ€™t be explaining how but for some reason I always get too scared to die or keep saying I wanna live yet I have so many reasons to do so. Why do I feel this way is it because of my mind that prevents self destruction or am I just scared whatâ€™s to come after death.
