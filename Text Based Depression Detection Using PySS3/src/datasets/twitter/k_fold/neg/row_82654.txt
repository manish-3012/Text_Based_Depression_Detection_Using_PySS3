Feeling shittyI know Reddit is probably not the best place to be putting this but what the hey. Iâ€™m 18, transitioning and have a lot of problems. My mom passed 2 years ago and ever since feelings of guilt and sorrow wonâ€™t leave my head. My transition is also starting to take affect on me. Iâ€™ve always been cool with people not using â€œheâ€ and such if they donâ€™t want to, but itâ€™s starting to get to me. Just my whole self is starting to get to me. Iâ€™ve been feeling worse and worse over the years to the point of hospitalization a couple times. I have a counselor, but Iâ€™m still stuck. Hoping people who have my experience or something else like it could help ðŸ˜”
