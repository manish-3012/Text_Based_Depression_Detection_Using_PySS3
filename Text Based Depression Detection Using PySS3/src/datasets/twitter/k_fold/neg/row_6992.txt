If this is my life, I don't want it. I don't want to die, I know I could find joy somewhere in life, I'm just not allowed due to my own errors. I just wish I never existed in the first place.This is my life:

Wake up. 

Sit for an hour dreading work

Work for six to eight hours

Come home

Talk to my son

Sit for two hours

Go to sleep

Repeat

Repeat

Repeat

Repeat.

I know I'm delusional. My life is great compared to some people on here. But it's not the life I want so I take it for granted, which I can't help, which also makes me feel even worse about things. I shouldn't have had a child, I don't deserve him and he doesn't deserve a useless dad. If I didn't love him so much, I'd just leave. I'd walk and walk, I'd explore the country, I'd work a shitty gig for a night to make money here and there, and I'd just live. Every single thing I did would be rewarded with surviving. I want to work for myself. But instead I'm grinding away at my 3rd job this year while I feel my life slowly fading away. I've wasted it and will continue to waste it. Maybe there isn't even a point and I'll be miserable either way. Or maybe I'm just a pussy like my grandpa says.
