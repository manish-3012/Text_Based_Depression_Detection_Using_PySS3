I've started having thoughts, and I'm scaredHey, life hasn't been good to me recently. I've lost a lot, including my partner who I devoted everything into, probably too much. I've started thinking about doing something, I'm not entirely sure what yet. I know it's a final solution to a problem type thing, but I can't shake the feeling and I'm scared that in a moment of weakness I'll do something that I won't be able to regret doing.
