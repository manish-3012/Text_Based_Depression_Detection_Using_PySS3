im actually annoyed at my parents for caring so much about methey're literally the only thing that's keeping me from killing myself. them, and the hope that one day everything is gonna be better

i literally have nothing worth living right now, nothing i think ill miss if i do end it all, but just the thought of what that would do to my parents is enough to keep me from doing it 

im their only child and i know they love me very much. it would destroy them if they knew what ive been thinking of doing, i can't say they wouldn't kill themselves too if i ever did lose my life

why couldn't they be shitty awful parents? at least that way id have another excuse to kill myself without any guilt
