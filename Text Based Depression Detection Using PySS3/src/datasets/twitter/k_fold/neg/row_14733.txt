I have no time for therapyI am a male victim of emotional abuse from a former girl i was briefly dating. This woman ruined me. I have no more self-worth and just want to end it all constantly. I am away from my support system because I recently moved and all I do is work. I know this is a problem and I need to go to therapy to help become the cheerful person I used to be, but my job is so demanding that I don't have the time to go. 

I feel trapped and that this is never going to end. I feel like I am just going to die alone and I don't deserve happiness. The only things keeping me going are my cat, my family, and my close friends. It takes so much work to leave the house everyday and not jump from my 22nd story balcony. I just want to be me again and not this weak man that this woman made me into.
