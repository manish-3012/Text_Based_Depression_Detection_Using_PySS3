I don't want to kill myselfBut I just feel like a complete waste of space. I'm 23 in February and in my opinion, and most other's too, I have done not very much with my life and don't seem to have any direction. I have ambitions and hopes for everything and I try my hardest to make these become true, but it seems that no matter how hard I try they never work.

I graduated from University in 2011 (barely) and have been trying since then to get a job, any job recently. I used to blame everything else, no one will be willing to give me the chance but recently I've started to think, what if they're right? Maybe I'm not worth the effort and I really am just one of those people who will never be able to succeed for whatever reason?

I've tried so hard for the last year, and I've had problems with my self esteem before but people have said it's not something that can be fixed with medication and there's no illness there. It's just the way I am.

I'm just sick of coasting through life and feeling as though everyday is just a waste. I don't want to be a waste of space any more and although I've never seriously considering suicide, I sometimes find myself thinking, how long before I do? How long until I finally reach that point where enough is enough...?
