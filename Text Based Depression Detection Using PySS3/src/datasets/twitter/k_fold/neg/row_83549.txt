I have nowhere else to turn, I need help/advice for my boyfriendIâ€™m so sorry. I donâ€™t know where else to post this, at this point Iâ€™m desperate 

My boyfriend has been talking about how much he wants to die more and more within the past few weeks. I donâ€™t know how to help him. Heâ€™s stuck in an abusive home situation that he canâ€™t currently leave, and heâ€™s dealing with a specific type of mental illness that has been taking a toll on him so heavily that heâ€™s constantly exhausted and crying and just in pieces. 

He canâ€™t afford/go to therapy right now, he doesnâ€™t want to be put in a mental facility or be on medication. He feels like heâ€™s crazy and like it would be easier for everyone if he just died. Heâ€™s saying more and more often â€œI want to die.â€

Iâ€™m worrying myself to death over him, and Iâ€™m scared to go to sleep and leave him alone. How can I help him? I love him more than the world itself, I canâ€™t lose him. If he killed himself, I wouldnâ€™t know how to be happy again

His family is abusive so I canâ€™t tell them, if I got the authorities involved it would make his situation 100x worse, but I can barely keep him here all by myself. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

Please help me
