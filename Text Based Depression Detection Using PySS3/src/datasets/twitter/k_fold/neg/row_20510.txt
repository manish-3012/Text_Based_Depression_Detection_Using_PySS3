Advice to Help Someone Who is Possibly at Risk?Hi /r/SuicideWatch. I wasn't sure where to go, but you all seem like the best source of information and honestly one of the most compassionate corners of Reddit. So, here it goes.

I've known this girl since kindergarten, but we had some issues in middle school (basically, I bullied her a little bit, but have since apologized) that I'm not sure are healed or forgotten, and haven't really talked since. We're now rising juniors in college and follow each other on Twitter.

Lately, her tweets have gotten progressively darker. Some hint at death/suicide, some talk about how hopeless she is, some mention her lack of clothes/food/etc. I want to reach out to her, but I'm not sure how to do it in a tactful way. I really don't want to make her feel like a charity case or like I'm assuming she's planning something drastic. I just want her to know that someone's there for her.
