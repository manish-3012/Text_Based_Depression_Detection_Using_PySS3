Why am I a coward looking for a way out?I am at my lowest i miss my ex I am having troubles with my family I keep stuffing up at work and school and I just can't do anything I just stuff it up and I get happy and people support me and I get high and happy and I get down and lower and I just don't know I can see suicide as my option and I think about my ex I don't sleep cause I see her crying and I hear her voice all the time I can barely breath cause I drink so many energy drinks I cant tell my family cause they think I'm overreacting and I am just at my end my death and I just give up.
I SURRENDER LIFE YOU WIN TAKE ME IM JUST A COWARD LOOKING FOR THE EASY WAY OUT
