Iâ€™m just a fuck up.I went from being the #1 student in my entire class with the best grades to a high school drop out. I just had one more year of school left, but Iâ€™m such a mentally ill fuck up that I couldnâ€™t do it. I ruined all the potential I had. All the good grades and success I had in school means nothing now. Iâ€™m not getting into any college at all now. 

I wonâ€™t be able to do anything with my life and itâ€™s all my fault. 

Now Iâ€™m 19 with no education, no work experience, and nothing to live for. I barely have any friends. Iâ€™ve never even kissed or held hands with a guy. I stay isolated in my room and just play video games and listen to music. Some days I can bring myself to go to the gym, ride my bike, or go sit in a coffee shop. But itâ€™s only temporary relief to the never ending shame and regret. 

Itâ€™s all so lonely. Itâ€™s all so pointless. Iâ€™m making no progress and my life is going nowhere. I basically donâ€™t exist in this world. 

I canâ€™t do anything.
