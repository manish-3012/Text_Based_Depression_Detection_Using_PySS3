FUck this year and the restPeople think a new year is a new start but that's not true. Its still the same bullshit life cycle and just cuz the calendar changes doesn't mean anything. You'll still have your job, and your routine, same looks, same car. Life is fucked, and a new year changes nothing. 2020? cooll another decade of the same bullshit.... I hate this routine of life. im fuckin bored. tired of eating, and sleeping, taking showers, brushing my teeth..... like fuck, its so lame everything is.
