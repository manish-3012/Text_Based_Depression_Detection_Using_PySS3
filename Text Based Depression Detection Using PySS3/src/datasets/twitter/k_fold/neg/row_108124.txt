I am so sad about leaving my 8 year oldItâ€™s the only thing that hurts. I was scrapbooking last night, going through her baby photos, &amp; I realized how sad it is that I just canâ€™t be the mom I wanted to be; that a child deserves... It feels like I gave birth to her only to make her love me &amp; then take myself away. With what emotion I have left, that is a painful reality. Itâ€™s also painful that I ideate suicide over the desire to spend quality time with her, especially in my last days with her. She deserves so much better. Itâ€™s not fair to her to have a mom like this. I do love her so much. Weâ€™ve had an amazing 8 years together, full of love &amp; fun. Now, I can barely take care of myself as it is. Iâ€™m failing us. My desire to not be alive is out of control (yes- Iâ€™ve done it all: therapy, pharmaceuticals, life improvements/changes. My mind &amp; body refuse to behave.) I do believe my main purpose in life, if I have/had any at all, was to give birth to her. Iâ€™m going out via a staged accident because I donâ€™t ever want her to take the blame.
She will have more than a fine life being raised the rest of the way by her dad &amp; step-mother. She also has a half-brother.
It just kills what is left of me to think about it.
I just wanted to get that out. Thanks for reading.
