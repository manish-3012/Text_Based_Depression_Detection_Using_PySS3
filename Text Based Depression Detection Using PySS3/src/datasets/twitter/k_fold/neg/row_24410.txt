I've decided to do it - Feel calm and ready to goI'm in my late thirties and have suffered from depression/bipolar since I was a teenager. I'm on antidepressants and mood stabilisers, none of which seem to do much. (I've tried pretty much every combination over the years)

Existence was a waking nightmare for me, living with an all encompassing feeling of self loathing and hatred. Things were about to get so much worse too, with my business going down the pan and my personal bankruptcy (two more failures to add to the list) suicide was the only way out of all this. 

Life is a pretty grim thing, look at all the shit in the world; Wars, famine, the rich getting richer whilst the rest of us get fucked. Who wants to be part of that! I know I don't want to do some minimum wage 'shit eating' job for the rest of my life! Even if I did, there wouldn't be a pension for me at the end of it! And yet the vast majority accept this fucked-up situation without question, just as long as they have their sport/soaps/celeb gossip/shopping! My conclusion; I am totally dysfunctional. 

Plus the voices in my head have started again â€“ they tell me I'm a failure and to kill myself. 

So I've been reading the A.S.H newsgroup and read a couple of books on suicide and think I am ready to go ahead with it, while I have the house to myself for the next week.

Thanks for reading.
