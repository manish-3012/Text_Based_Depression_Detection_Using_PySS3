I don't have control over my body anymoreEvery month/every other month right before my period is due I feel really, really suicidal. I feel it taking over my body, my thoughts, my mind, my actions. I can't take it anymore. Meds don't help. I tried to crash my car a couple times today. I'm so fucking sick of my life.
