I have found the perfect way - Summer, sea, oblivion....I thought about various methods to do it : 

- jumping off a tall building is not a guaranteed way and if you don't fall on your head, you can even survive and stay in a hospital for months with multiple fractured bones 

- hanging is a struggle 

- overdosing can be very painful and a lot of vomiting, internal bleeding, seizures, etc. can happen before you die + you might survive and wake up in the hospital 

So I was thinking about going to the sea. It's been a long time since I was at the sea. IT's summer, so everyone is at the sea anyway. 
There are those red markers that they put in the water, so that people don't swim further, because the water is dangerous if you swim past those markers. There are rip currents that can make you drown in a few seconds. 

I always liked the water. It's said that we come from water and we go back into water. 
Seems to be a perfect way to pass away.
