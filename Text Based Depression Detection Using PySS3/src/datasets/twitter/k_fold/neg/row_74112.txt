I want it to end. I want justice.I want the doctors who refused to help me to pay for their actions. I want my old therapists to feel guilty for refusing to hospitalize me. I want the cops to be under scrutiny for treating me like crap and calling me an attention seeker. I want lawsuits. I want revenge. I want justice. I want a community uproar. I want a national uproar. There is a complete lack of mental healthcare and whoever is in charge of this shit in this country needs to wake up and realize that it is CRAP. 

Fuck you Canada for your lack of healthcare and for the seemingly untrained professionals. Fuck you hospitals for sending me away in a time of need. Fuck you crisis hotlines for calling the police on me and using the same scripted lines over and over. Fuck you RCMP for pulling me by the arm and calling me a faker when I was suicidal. Dr B, you had my life in your hands for 2 months while I was in hospital. You could have tested different medications, you could have sent me to a better hospital to have more tests done, but instead I just waited day after day wondering what was going to happen to me. But I still felt hopeful. I assumed I would be able to live a stable life. Boy was I fucking wrong! Look at me now, homicidal, angry, too anxious to leave home. FUCK this! Fuck you anxiety for ruining me! You robbed me of a chance of a normal life and now we're nearing adulthood without having accomplished anything. 

So, this is my rant. I'm not going to say "this is it", because it isn't the time yet. I'll probably be alive for quite a while longer, but i'm 100% fed up with life.
