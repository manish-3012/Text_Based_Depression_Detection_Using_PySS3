â€œIt gets betterâ€you once said â€œthings will get betterâ€ but i'm sorry, i think thats such a false illusion. its just something that is ingrained in society because we humans hope, we have to believe in something or else what future is there worth fighting for. but you know, no one really knows and we only hear from those where things really do get better. how about the other half who are forgetten, who are still miserable and suffering and most of them are wondering where it all went wrong. and life is never fair, so i don't think that the number of "better" outweighs the negative. 

and iâ€™m sorry, but that hope has left my life a long time ago. iâ€™m really tired. i donâ€™t want to be here anymore. i donâ€™t want to live just for the sake of other people. i just want to be able to choose something i want for once.
