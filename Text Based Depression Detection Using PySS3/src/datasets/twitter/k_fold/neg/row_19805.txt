Iâ€™m still in love with my ex and I canâ€™t let go.Before I met her I was already pretty depressed. I had made plans to kill myself on my birthday. No one knew about it except I friend I told in confidence. I didnâ€™t go through with it and I began dates this amazing woman that changed my life. We were together for a full year. There were bumps. I kept fucking up. She broke up with me about a month ago. At first it was ok. We ended on good terms, talked everyday, kept up with each other. But now as time goes on it just keeps getting worse. I feel her slowly slipping away out of my life and it hurts really bad. Today she told me she wants me to love on and I lost it. Now I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I canâ€™t let her go and I canâ€™t find any reason to keep moving on.
