Iâ€™m tired of tryingIâ€™ve tried to kill myself twice before and both attempts were unsuccessful. My boyfriend has been consistently cheating on me for 2 years and last night I saw everything. Heâ€™s in love with someone else and I am so tired of droning on. I donâ€™t want to go to school anymore, I donâ€™t want to keep trying and be a stronger person. I just want it to fucking stop. I didnâ€™t ask to be here, so why canâ€™t I just leave? Why do I have to stay? I would do it but I have no means and I donâ€™t want to hurt my family. But I wish I could.
