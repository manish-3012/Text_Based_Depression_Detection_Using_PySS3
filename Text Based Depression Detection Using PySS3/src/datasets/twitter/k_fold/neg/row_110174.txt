if you never belong with ur peers, the isolation will kill youI never knew how important it is to keep up with ur peers. ur suppose to finish college by 22, enter the work force, get married, by a house, have kids, etc

I'm in my 30's and now I'm killing myself. Once you miss the train, it's just too late for you. There's nothing left here for me.
