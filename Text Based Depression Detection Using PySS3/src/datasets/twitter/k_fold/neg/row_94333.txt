July 13th 2020i should have died that day 
i should be buried somewhere rotting 
i donâ€™t deserve the things i have
i donâ€™t deserve the chances iâ€™ve been given
all i do is hurt people 
i donâ€™t deserve love 
i donâ€™t deserve anyone around me 
i wish i did it when i had the chance 

iâ€™m sorry i couldnâ€™t 
i thought i was doing better but these thoughts are too intrusive
