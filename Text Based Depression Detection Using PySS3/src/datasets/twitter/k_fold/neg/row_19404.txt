Hi.Currently sitting in my car @ 9 am here on the east coast of the US. I just got back home because I failed to make it to my client, and that pretty much ruined my morning, and brought me here to this subreddit. 

For the past 3 months I have been completely stuck. In terms of money, self worth, and patience. The only thing that is actually moving forward is school, and thatâ€™s because it has no choice but to. 

For the past 3 months Iâ€™ve been seeing a therapist. Though he has helped, Iâ€™m coming to the (obvious) realization that if I actually donâ€™t take the advice, nothing in my life will change. 

And so I havenâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been doing everything the opposite. Iâ€™ve rekindled with something I wasnâ€™t supposed to, and Iâ€™ve been keeping secrets and lying more and more. Iâ€™m beginning to hate myself more than I ever could have imagined, and the strings holding onto my sanity are slowly, but surely, breaking. 

I feel like Iâ€™m becoming a very horrible person because Iâ€™m more willing to avoid consequences so I can have just a bit of peace. But itâ€™s only making things worse. And Iâ€™m afraid soon enough Iâ€™ll end up falling from the highest bridge I can find.
