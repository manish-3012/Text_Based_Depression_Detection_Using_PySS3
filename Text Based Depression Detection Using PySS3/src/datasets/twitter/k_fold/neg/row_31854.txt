Mental health professionals - they know that most suicidal patients wonâ€™t admit to being suicidal right?Cause Iâ€™ve been asked this many times and no way Iâ€™m gonna answer yes at risk of being institutionalised. This method needs to change. I have so much rage. None malicious. I just have so much pain I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. And Iâ€™m no bitch I just donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s wrong with me
