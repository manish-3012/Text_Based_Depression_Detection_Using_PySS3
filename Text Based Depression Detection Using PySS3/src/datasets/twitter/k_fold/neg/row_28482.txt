slipping awayi cant fight this anymore._x000D_
i feel utterly broken beyond any repair, im ill and getting worse i have a horrible disease that attacks and mutilates my genitals and im getting worse and worse, i dont have a handhold on this life anymore, i have no one i can talk to and i am, as always alone._x000D_
this is the feeling i get when i know ive seen more days than i will see, _x000D_
that for all my struggles its nearly over, im broken, all i want now is eternal peace that only death can give. i dont even know why im typing this right now. maybee someone will hear me, ive lost the last scraps of my purported sanity
