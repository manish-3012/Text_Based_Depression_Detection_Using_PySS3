The bleach on my bathroom counterI looked at it when I grabbed my toothbrush 

It just stood there; white and cheerful

Bold fonts promising percentages that will never be checked 

Branded clearly and heavily

It waits there

And I wonder how it would feel sliding down my throat

Grasping the pit of my stomach

Matching my visceral genetic makeup 

It would be so quick; like a stone to the temple

An unsuspecting doe facing a Ford on a winding road

And I grab it

I twist off the lid and see the liquid

Glistening 

Translucent 

Begging me like Alice to just stop and 

'Drink me'

And I lift up the container to my nose and stop

To inhale the purifying fumes that could expire me with one shot

And god, it does smell wondrous 

But my appetite is just enough

To keep me hungry for tomorrow
