im not going to get anywhere in my life so what's the point?i feel hopeless. im wasting air honestly 

im about to be a senior in college. i want to go into filmmaking but as a woman in my major ive been talked down to a lot and made to feel like even hopeful directors will have to sit on a 'casting couch' 
i dont have an internship or any experience to get one. i applied to over a hundred of them only heard back from three to just get ghosted by them. 
one of my professors is relaly hard on me because he expects a lot of me but i will just disappoint him. i feel like im always supposed to please people from my parents to professors, and all i do is fail them. what's the point? nothing makes me happy anymore. there's nothing to look forward to career wise or event wise. 
im absolutely worthless. i chose the wrong line of interest. i should have chosen something safe like accounting or nursing. i disappoint myself. 
and its an oursbouros in a way because as much as i want to exit my depression, i continue to do things that keep me locked in. i have no motivation to do anything.  i hate my self for gaining weight yet i dont exercise and i eat junk food. i feel like my friends all hate me even tho i  have become reclusive and self-deprecating. i haven't left my apartment for three days, and most of it is spent staring at the wall because it seems hopeless and purposeless to try. what's the point? 

does anyone else feel like they should just stop before it gets even more painful? why see it through?
