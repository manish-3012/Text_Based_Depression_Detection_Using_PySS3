Tonight seems rightI finished my goodbye letter, probably a couple of small revisions left.  It's a short note, I don't have any friends.  My parents will be the only impacted parties, but I'm 36 and have been out of the house for half of my life now.  I've got two ways in mind, but I think being near the beach seem like the most appropriate exit strategy. 

I know that this is the right choice, my existence is only poisoning the rest of the world, and I hate being the root cause of this pain. 

So long community.
