Keeping OnI got a good job, good friends and family and I still think about killing myself everyday.  I don't really understand why.  Corona has really driven my mental health down.  For the last year I would only casually think about suicide like this sucks I'll just kill myself lol.  Over the past few weeks it's been more serious like how would I do it?, what would I write for a note?.  I know I don't want to die, I just want to stop feeling so worthless and overwhelmed.  I knew something was off so last week I took a leave of absence from work and have been running and mediating everyday.  I thought the road to recovery would be linear but it is very up and down.  I'll hang out with friends and look completely normal but then right before bed I'll feel like shit.  I truly hope nobody ever has to experience depression but that unfortunately doesn't seem to be the case.  This sucks and I hope we can get through whatever it is we are going through.  Love you all!    â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ Better together â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
