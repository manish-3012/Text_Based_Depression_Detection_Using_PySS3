Most people do not understand how excruciatingly tough it is when you are socially anxious around the people you live withI hide in my room all day and Iâ€™m unable to go downstairs for even a drink of water due to social anxiety around my foster family. I donâ€™t know why this is, the feeling is completely irrational. Yet itâ€™s like I donâ€™t want to be seen at all by my family members. 

I canâ€™t even speak to them hardly, itâ€™s as if I lose all social skills around them. I only speak if spoken to. Itâ€™s such a large family and every single movement I make is in an effort to avoid them all.

Every day is a fucking nightmare. I want out, and I see suicide as the only option many times.
