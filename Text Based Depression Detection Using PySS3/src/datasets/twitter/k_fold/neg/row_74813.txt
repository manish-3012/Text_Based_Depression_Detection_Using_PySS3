Life isn't even worth it.Without any of your consent or wishes, you are forced to live a long time in a shitty world of anger, war, hatred, oppression, stupidity, etc. You are forced to go to school as a child, so you can learn useless bullshit, which won't even matter, because eventually, you'll die, which will just make having learned the information not even worth it in the first place. You are then encouraged highly to go to a good college, so you can learn some more useless bullshit, so you can get a good job, then retire and become old and disabled, and then you finally die. What the fuck is life even worth? We will all die. We will all just disappear, with no one to remember us. We are forced to be slaves to a corrupt world, ruled by corrupt assholes who don't care about anyone else's lives or the rest of the world. No one will care about us when we die. We will just live for many years, just wandering on some planet that we won't even change of do anything good on. Life will suck, then we die.

I don't know whether to end my life or wait patiently for the world to end so I can finally leave this shifty planet.
