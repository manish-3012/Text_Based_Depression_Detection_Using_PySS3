My suicide plan got derailedI was planning on OD-ing next week with painkillers after my wisdom teeth removal, but my doctor only gave me 5 pills which isn't enough for a lethal dose. I guess it's a blessing for my loved ones because I've decided it's a sign that I should try to get professional help. I'm going to go to an intensive outpatient program. I hope it helps but I also feel like it'll just be a band-aid. I feel so hopeless. I wish I could die. I wish I didn't have to try to get better. I wish I didn't have to be strong.
