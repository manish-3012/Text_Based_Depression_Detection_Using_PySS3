going on like everything is greatiâ€™ve been â€œgetting betterâ€ for over 2-3 years i havent self harmed for months (until tonight) and it reminded me of so much that i used to feel. i have a lot going for me, good things i guess, doing well in school, have a lot of friends, socialize, exercise, therapy, i do every fucking thing right. why the hell do i feel this massive weight on me still. itâ€™s like i am stuck in a damn hamster ball without even knowing it. i dont see anyone else in my life that feels like this. so is it just me? that canâ€™t be possible. i wish i knew how to fucking get rid of this feeling. i hÃ¢te think about this every night coming back here or on another app just browsing away as if thereâ€™s any point to it all. maybe iâ€™ll starve myself to death. i must have a reason to stay because iâ€™m still here. maybe i have some hope for the future. but with fucking covid and the rest of my fucked up life i donâ€™t know how much different it will be even if i get everything i could ever want in my life.
