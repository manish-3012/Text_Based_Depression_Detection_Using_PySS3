I don't know what to do anymore i'm so tired of this.So i just got into this reddit thing and created my account specifically for this reason. I cannot cope with my wife and kids anymore, wife says hurtful things to me and my kids tend to agree with her. Im a monster on the inside and that monster is growing and growing and it cant stop. I feel as if i failed as a father and i cant take this anymore. Everyone in the family hates me and the urge to leave is getting harder to deal with every single day.
