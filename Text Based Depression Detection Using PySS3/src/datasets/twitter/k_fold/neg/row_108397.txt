I should be dead by now but slow and sure isn't doing the trick!My husband died approximately 8 years ago.  I didn't realize at the time but I (unconsciously) decided I was going to drink myself to death.  Should be easy, right?  After all, the UK Government recommend that you don't drink more than 14 units a week (as a woman).   So drinking 400+ units a week for over 7 years as well as being a smoker....well the math is inevitable, isn't it?  

Apparently not!  Last year, doctors tested my liver and disgustedly pronounced it "fine".  My blood pressure is high, but not dangerously so.  My heart is 'on the large side of normal'.

Now I am facing my first real financial crisis since my husband died...I am about to be laid off from my job.  Without a job, I will face bankruptcy and losing the home I shared for 25 years with my husband.  

I have one adult step-daughter but to be honest, all I am to her is a 'backstop' for when she runs out of money (she is on benefits/welfare and turns to me whenever there is an emergency).  I have a daughter of my own who, for her own reasons, decided to estrange herself - coincidentally when I refused to subsidize her renting a flat near the married man she is having an affair with. 

After my husband died, I dedicated myself to our dog, a Yorkie and a sweetie, who also died of cancer late last year.  I feel I've done my bit, looked after those who needed me.  Why, why, can't I just die now?!
