I'm officially done. Don't need this subreddit anymore.`vulgar language ahead`

I fucking hate depression. I fucking suicidal thoughts. I hate having to shake my head and try to move on. I hate the misfunction in my brain. I hate trying to accept these thoughts. I fucking hate giving in to them. It drives me up shit creek and to the edge.

 I read a story yesterday evening about a 16YO girl who OD'd on sleeping pills, and I hadn't slept in days so I asked my mom for benadryl. She handed me a mix of diphenhydramine and triazolam. I already had pills for a headache in my hand so I took about 2x that dose. I then took 1 of each sleeping pill and took them with a glass of water. I feel like I'm overreacting to what my mom says because I confronted her about it earlier, and she threw it aside. Am I faking it? Having rare good days and feeling regret? I feel guilty as charged, but I know I'm not. But, the thought seeps back into my head.

I'm trying to find a better way to cope with suicidal thoughts/depression, so I am leaving this subreddit for good change. I also only took the pills to scare myself into not committing suicide. Have a great day, r/SuicideWatch, have a great day.
