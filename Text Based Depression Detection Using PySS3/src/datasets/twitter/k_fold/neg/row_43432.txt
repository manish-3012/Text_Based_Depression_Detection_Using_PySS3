I've been contemplating this for a while, over a year and a half in factI've not been in the best of ways for a very long time. To be honest, I've been trying to keep the bad thoughts away by talking to friends but they can't seem to understand my mindset, I appreciate their efforts but it seems to be in vain.  

They all call me a moody bastard in class and I joke that I am but in reality I'm probably in the worst shape imaginable. Every day seems to feel like one step closer to ending it all. 

I'm sorry if this is a brick of text but I needed to vent. I'm sorry to the people that think this might be fake but to be true it really isn't. I'm trying so damn hard to keep the bad thoughts away but they seem to be winning, every night before I go to bed is complete hell for me.

The never ending thoughts that i've failed the people I love and that I've fu**** up absolutely everything with everyone keep tormenting me and I can't take it anymore.  

Please, I need help in coping with this; I honestly can't take it anymore. I'm sorry if this has offended anyone and gone against the rules of the subreddit.

I'm so sorry
