I desperately don't want to be here.Every other thought passing through my mind is about how much I don't want to be alive/exist anymore. I think about killing myself a lot. I've done a lot of research on methods of suicide but the more research I do, the more frightened I become of trying and failing. It seems like there aren't a lot of guaranteed-not-to-fail methods of killing yourself that are available to me. If I had access to a gun I know I would have been gone a long, long time ago.

I'm so desperate not to be here anymore though. I do not enjoy a single thing about life and I haven't for many years. I don't impact the world, society, or a single person's life in any positive way. There is absolutely no reason for me to be alive. 

I am so very tired of feeling this way; Every single day is excruciating for me, I can no longer tell the difference between physical and emotional pain, it's all the same, life is just one big ball of hurting. I dread every second I have to spend awake.
