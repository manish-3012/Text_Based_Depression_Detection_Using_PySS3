My friend is suicidal and Iâ€™m not sure how to help, if I can help.He knows about suicide hotlines and he even had a psychiatrist once.

Iâ€˜m not his best friend we talk like 3 times a day but he said that Iâ€™m really important to him once.

2 days ago was the last day of school where I live and we had a really long talk. We are â€žbus buddiesâ€œ but no bus drove this late on that day, we were on a party that day. 

He confessed that he has been cutting himself and 1 day earlier was about to jump in front of a truck that was driving by. He said that if he lost his best friends he wouldnâ€™t have any reason to live. I donâ€™t know if I can help him but maybe there is something. His best friends also know that heâ€˜s suicidal.

Iâ€˜m scared that heâ€˜ll take his live soon.

Conclusion: If you have a tipp what to do, that would be really nice.
