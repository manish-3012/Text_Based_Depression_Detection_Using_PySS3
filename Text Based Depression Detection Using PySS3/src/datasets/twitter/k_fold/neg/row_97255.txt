Im planningI'm not the type of person who sits quietly in her suffering. I've posted here many times, I've posted on self harm many times. 

My arms cut up again, my heart is broken just as it is every September. 

I have a tease of a disease, MS doesn't kill people it just tortures them until a nice ripe old age. Im forgetful, I'm tired, I'm an emotional mess. 

He doesn't understand or care. 

I know I don't have to suffer, I have a choice to wake up and be happy right ? Everyday I wake up, I have nothing to look forward to. 

I want to be alone. I want to cease to exist. 

I think after my 29th birthday I'm gonna reconsider suicide.

I know he doesn't want to marry me, it's okay. I don't want my tombstone to say I was a good wife, I was no ones wife. I was everyone's mother, cleaning lady, and chef. I was the few sad tears you hear at night thinking "oh no she's sick again ??" I'll always be sick, mostly in the head. 

I know she loves me alive but I would too until I grow up and realize, wow my mom was super depressed and suicidal, she couldn't get the dishes done for a whole week and her hair was matted 9/10 times. 

Id rather her think I was strong before she has the chance to find out how weak I am. 

I just wanna celebrate my birthday one last time with my daughter. She like most, didn't ask to be here, and one day shell understand why I couldn't be.
