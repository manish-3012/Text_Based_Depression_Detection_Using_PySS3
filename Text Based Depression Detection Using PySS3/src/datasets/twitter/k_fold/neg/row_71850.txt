Just want to start overI have hurt my friends far too many times. I honestly often think if I was gone they wouldnâ€™t care. They would be like oh thatâ€™s unfortunate. On to the next thing. Pretty sure my best friend hates me bc I always have issues with anxiety. The sun would still rise in the morning. Would I really be missed?
