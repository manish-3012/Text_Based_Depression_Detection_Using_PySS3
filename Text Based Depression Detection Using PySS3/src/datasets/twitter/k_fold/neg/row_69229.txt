I am so fucking tired...Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts and depression over the past three years. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m at my breaking point yet, but Jesus Christ I think Iâ€™m getting close. Iâ€™ve lost all my friends after graduating a year and a half ago. I have not been able to keep a steady job at all, there were points where I would stay in my room for months and mentally breakdown every second of everyday. I would intoxicate myself regularly to ease the pain. 

I had a falling out with my mom and stepdad who would supply me with drugs and alcohol and stayed with family for a while. Last week I moved in with my dad and have honestly been pretty optimistic until the past few days. Iâ€™ve been clean for months now I actually bought and own nice things and have a job interview tomorrow. But I still feel like itâ€™s all futile. I canâ€™t be happy, hell right now I canâ€™t even set up a date with women because I feel like such a social outcast. Its frustrating because Iâ€™m attractive, but it seems like everyone hates me as a person. I donâ€™t understand why. Iâ€™m very nice and polite, I donâ€™t pick fights or instigate, and Iâ€™m smart. What is it Iâ€™m missing? Am I a bad person? Because at times I feel like I am.

This I could deal with if I didnâ€™t still think everything is pointless. Iâ€™m going to keep working a job until I die and thatâ€™s all. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m detached from reality, because at times I feel like it. Like Iâ€™m just a thing here for no reason. I donâ€™t really know where this is even going anymore, I guess thereâ€™s no point in rambling on anymore. Thank you for reading and sorry if thereâ€™s any mistakes or inconsistencies, itâ€™s almost midnight and Iâ€™m tired.
