LivingHonestly I just need to rant. My suicidal thoughts fill my  brain and I have nobody to talk to. My friends and coworkers see me as this perfect girl with straight A's and always has a smile on her face. The person that tries to be there for everyone and ends up exiling herself. By the time I get home or shut off my phone, the waves of depression seep over my mind. I always think, "how easy, I could do it so easily" yet I know people love me and here I am questioning whether or not I should kill myself. I grew up in a dysfunctional family, fucked up childhood, and life is better now. I have a full ride to an ivy league school said no because I want to go to a state school because I dont think im good enough for ivy league. Im smart and yet have no idea what I want to do. I serve no true purpose, if only I could follow the advice I give to others. I just want these thoughts to soothe away and I just want to appreciate my life and my gifts. I want to be able to reassure myself that im going to be okay and these thoughts wont come in tidal waves. Im sorry if this was too personal...
