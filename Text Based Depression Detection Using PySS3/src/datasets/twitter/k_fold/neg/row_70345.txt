IÂ´m goneThis is it. I finally decided to do it. I donÂ´t know when. I donÂ´t know how. But IÂ´m going to do it within the next week or two. I donÂ´t have enough money to pay this monthÂ´s bills. I have to pay my mom 150â‚¬ a month just to be able to live in here, and I have only 80â‚¬ left, and I have phone bills and insurance payments that I have to take care of. I have nothing left to lose. I donÂ´t see myself finishing the uni. I want to piss of my girlfriend so bad that she wonÂ´t miss me when IÂ´m gone. I want to hurt everyone so bad that they wonÂ´t miss me. I donÂ´t want people crying after me. I just want piece.
