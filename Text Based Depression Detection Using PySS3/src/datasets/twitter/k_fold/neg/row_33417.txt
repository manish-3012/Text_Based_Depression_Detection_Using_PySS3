I committed my partnerOn Sunday night, my partner of 6 years and I had an argument. This is maybe the 5th fight we've ever had. It was about how he was treating me when he drinks too much. He just turns into a jerk and acts like a frat boy. I was getting ready to fall asleep on the couch and I heard the kitchen knife leave the counter. Then the bathroom door closes and locks. One of our cats started meowing and clawing the door. I had to break in and I found him, fully clothed, in the bathtub full of water with the knife at his arm. I took the knife, got him into dry clothes and called my dad. My partner tells me that he thought he heard me say that it would be easier if he were dead. So he thought that by killing himself, I would get the insurance money and be set (none of which I said or wanted). My dad stayed on the line with me while my mom called 911. The cops showed up, hand cuffed him (he was 100% cooperative) and threw him in the back of the cop car (I'll be writing a letter of complaint for their actions). Finally, 2.5 hours after the incident I was allowed to see him in the ER. The nurse told me that his blood alcohol level was at 0.2. His last drink was over three hours before that. I stayed with him all night. He was admitted to a facility the next morning and is still there till at least Thursday. He is a brilliant man with a great career as a software developer and has an internal drive to succeed. His current psychologist has told him everything I've already told him. He is too self critical and needs to learn how to shut his brain down. He is cooperating and accepting the help. They don't believe he is "crazy" but had hit his breaking point and snapped.

But what do I do? He doesn't blame me or my parents for putting him there. I have tried to stay strong and be as supportive and loving as I can. But I just am lost. What are the next steps? What can I do to help him further once he's released? Any advice is helpful and appreciated.
