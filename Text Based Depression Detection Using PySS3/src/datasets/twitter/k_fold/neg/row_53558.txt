Now I've been told by the two persons I've entrusted the most that I should kill myself - They're both familyAnd they are right. Who wants to listen to self-deprevating depressing whining for years on end? It's getting more evident that this is what I need to do. Still, I've only attacked myself. I never came after them. In fact, I've pretty much just praised them. They want me to be positive and change myself, and if I won't do that then apparently I should just kill myself. It's not like I haven't been cultivating the thought periodically for years without saying it out loud, so yes - that's the truth of the matter. Maybe I can pin a note on me when it's time that says: wish granted.
