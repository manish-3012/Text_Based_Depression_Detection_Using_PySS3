Is suicide right for me?
Genuinely feel like i donâ€™t deserve to be on this planet. i am male. When i was 3 i was raped by a 6 year old male. i didnâ€™t understand what was happening. And i never told anybody.

but this experience caused me to be sexually confused, and sexually curious at a very young age.

When i was 6, still didnâ€™t understand the true meaning and purpose of sex. I tried to rub my penis on my younger (3or4 y/o)nephew because well i loved him and i thatâ€™s just what i knew i guess..

I didnâ€™t penetrate him or anything but i basically raped him.

a few years later, when i was 9 or 10, i started to realize that i was actually attracted to girls.( i thought i was gay up until this point)

But, i wasnâ€™t comfortable enough with myself to even approach girls. and i was homeschooled for most of my life so i never really met any girls my age.

I grew up in a family of boys, except for... my niece.. She was 2, and i was 9 or 10..

But her and i were alone one time.. and iâ€™d never even SEEN a vagina.. my curiosity got the best of me..

so i put my hand in her pants and i touched it....

i didnâ€™t penetrate her...

if i did i wouldâ€™ve killed myself by now...

But as i got older.. iâ€™m 21 now..

I feel as if i canâ€™t live with it..

Idk does my family remember what i did to them? and do they forgive me?

Do they remember and they secretly want me to kill myself?

is â€œi was just a kidâ€ an excuse? do i deserve to be forgiven?

should i talk to them?

should i just end it all??
