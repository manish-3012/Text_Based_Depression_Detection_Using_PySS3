SchoolIâ€™m failing all my classes and missing 37 papers. Iâ€™m going to court because of that and Iâ€™ve been feeling depressed because of it. I just want to kill myself I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m trying to get all the work done but thereâ€™s more papers each day and then they go to missing papers and then itâ€™s just a endless cycle. My mom stresses herself worrying about me and if Im gone there would be less stress for her. Theyâ€™re maybe sending me back a grade and if that happens I know for a fact Iâ€™m killing myself
