I'm losing my ability to handle this.I've suffered from massive depression ever since I was a little child. I never remember ever actually being happy. I used to hurt myself when I was younger, hoping that something would happened to me. That I wouldn't be able to recover somehow. As I grew up, I started to fight the thoughts of self-harm. The thoughts that told me I should just quit and end it. I was always a lonely person. I even managed to get myself something or a girlfriend by age 26! And then, she screwed me over. Absolutely tore out my heart and gleefully laughed at it it seems. It's the worst feeling I've ever had. It's been a while and when I think I'm getting better, I break down again. I broke down at work and cried in front of customers, which is never actually fun. The Thoughts are back and stronger than ever. 

I hurt myself physically for the first time in years the other day. I'm afraid it's only going to get worse. I keep wondering why I'm trying. I'm afraid the thoughts are winning, and I won't be able to fight them this time.
