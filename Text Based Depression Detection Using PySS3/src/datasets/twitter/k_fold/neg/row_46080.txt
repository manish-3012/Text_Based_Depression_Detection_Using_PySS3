I can't take it anymoreI'm 27 years old. Ive been depressed for the last ten years and tried to do many new things (especially for the last eight years or so) to make my life better but nothing worked. I keep failing at everything i do.  

ive been unemployed since i graduated two years ago and i can't find a proper job (it also doesnt help that i live in a polluted war-torn extremely corrupt tiny shithole that is close to bankruptcy).

I got nothing going for me right now no family, no friends, no s.o., no car, no house, no job, no ambition, nothing. Every year i think i reached the lowest point of my life and things just keep getting worse and worse.

recently ive been having extreme suicidal thoughts and dreamt about suicide multiple times in the last couple of weeks. after every dream i became more and more convinced that i have to kill myself. it seems like the only peaceful solution. i managed to get a gun (not that hard where i live) yesterday and im finally going to do it. im still trying to find a place where i can kill myself (i cant do it at home since i dont want my parents to see my dead body) ive been thinking about somewhere near a hospital in the middle of the night or in the morning at about 4-5 am. but i want to do it fast within the next two days i dont know how long i can hide the gun from my parents and if they find it theyll probably call the cops on me and i dont want to end up in a mental hospital
