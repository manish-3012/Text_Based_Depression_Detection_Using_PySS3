In which i find out Physical weight crushes emotional weightI had a breakdown today in my stepdads car. 

The irritation and sadness manifested and 
festering in me radiated out of my every pore and i can tell it was bothering the hell out of my mom that the point where she said i was tiring. It hurt but the tipping point was a friend of mine dropping me when i texted. Sobbed till i was dizzy and gasping. 

I told my mom i wanted to be readmitted but we were supposed to move some things today so i put it on the back burner because i knew they needed me. Im so glad i did because after hours of dripping in sweat and helping move really heavy stuff so my mom, who has constant pain and lots of medical problems, wouldnâ€™t have to lift anything and so my stepdad didnt have to bear all the weight...
I feel SO GOOD being helpful. I forgot about all my sadness and worthlessness for today. It might come back tomorrow but i kicked its ass today
