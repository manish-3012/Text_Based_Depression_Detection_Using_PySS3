I don't matterDon't tell me I matter because I seriously don't. I used religion because that made me believe I actually had some people, but after finding out there is definitely no God, my life is now meaningless. In 200 years, no one will ever know about me. I'm disabled, so I don't make an impact today, either. I won't be remembered, and only my family will actually care if I died. Strangers in the internet say they care, but that's just lies. They don't care that people kill themselves everyday. I would just be another number. It's actually illegal to be me in most places, I don't belong anywhere, I'm basically worthless. I have no reason to live.
