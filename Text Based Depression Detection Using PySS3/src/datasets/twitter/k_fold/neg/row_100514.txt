Everytime i take the train i think about killing myself.Hi, I'm a 15y/o student, not a native speaker and using Google Translator, so maybe this text can be confusing.


Going straight to the point, I think about killing myself since 2018, that year my grandfather discovered he had an incurable genetic disease, something I never imagined, my parents are separated, so he was like a father to me, besides he being the  person with whom I spent the most of my time, continuing, after he discovered this disease he spent the whole year in hospital, when he was discharged he returned to my house, but he only spent about three days until he returned to the hospital, with the disease progressing he started to lose weight to the point of weighing almost twice as little as I, who am already thin, in addition to the progress of the disease he developed depression, normally I often visited him, but from time to time he didn't have enough energy even to  greet me. 

On November 11 he had an internal hemorrhage, that same day I went to visit him, my mother did not warn me of anything, when I arrived he was bleeding a lot, but he did not know, he was very happy because of  strong antidepressants that he was taking, but he felt pain, even after taking morphine, seeing someone I loved very much dying in front of me and being unable to do anything was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, he died on 13  November at 6:50 am.


That same year I started having suicidal thoughts, I spent most of the time alone, since my mom and grandma were always in the hospital, my mom was much stressed and often told me that I was just born to disturb her, that i was no good for anything and things like that, over time I started to isolate myself at school and become an introvert, I talked almost every day with CVV (Similar to National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in my country) because I felt very lonely, but no matter how much time passed, suicidal toughts only increased. That same year I took the exam to enter a school that is considered the best in my state believing that i would be better. 

In 2019 I went to the school that I took the exam, but due to my introvert even with a month of classes I still didn't have any friends, I ate lunch alone and came home alone, in that period I almost tried to commit suicide, but luckily I managed to make some friends. On the other hand, the school's teaching is horrible, and I can't learn almost anything, I usually got good grades, but at this school I get horrible math grades, which makes me feel like a crap, in addition to the school being very tiring in general.

That same year I started to like someone, the second time it occurred to me, but the person I liked already liked someone, the problem is that I started to compare myself with the crush of the person that I liked, which decreases even more my self-esteem, over time I started to compare myself with anyone, always coming to the conclusion that I suck, only increasing my suicidal toughts.  I talked to my mother about my suicidal thoughts, she said that I would start going to the psychologist earlier this year, but until now she apparently forgot, which shows how important I am to her. 

I don't have a hobby, I can't like almost anything i do, I hate waking up early to go to a place that suck, my self-esteem is only getting worse, I can't take pictures of myself for 2 years because every time that I see myself I realize how ugly I am, I have no more plans, I hate myself so much, I hate my appearance, voice, personality, everything that i'm, if I kill myself I will not be missed by anyone, I am replaceable in all areas of my life, my friends only talk to me because I often do jokes and my mom just pretends to care about me because she doesn't want the money she spent on me to be in vain. 

No matter how long I wait, things just get worse and worse. It's been three days since I have slept 4 hours because I am very anxious, I just want to end the bad joke that is my life, nothing is going to change, nothing is going to get better, I have no reason to continue supporting it every day. 

Every day I take the subway to go to my school, and every day I think that jumping there would not be a bad idea, I don't know what to do, I think it will just happen, anyway that don't makes a difference to anyone...
