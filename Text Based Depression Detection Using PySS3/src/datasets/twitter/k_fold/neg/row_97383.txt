I'm suffering so much, it's unimaginable, I can't even get ur from bed to take a shower anymore. I need to die. I need to die...19/Male.

I need to die...

I don't live anymore. I just exist. Everyday is pain for me. I will become homeless soon because I keep failing my exams on college due to my mental issues. And my family won't even support me rather than insulting me with their words 24/7. If I had a gun I would've do it now. I need to escape from everything , I don't want any more insulting voices, I don't want any more pain. I need to die, please let me die
