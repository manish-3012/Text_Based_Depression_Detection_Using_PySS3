I'm having suicidal ideations and plans are forming, but I'm terrified of inpatient care again.Something's wrong with my meds. 

About a month ago, I did my second inpatient stay at a local hospital and it was absolute fucking hell. I won't go back without the hospital ceding to some of my demands including access to legitimate writing utensils (not flexible safety pens) as well as access to my electronic devices. 

Does anyone know if such a hospital exists where I'll be treated like a patient and not a criminal?
