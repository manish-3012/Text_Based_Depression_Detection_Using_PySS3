Every day I wake up with suicidal thoughts. Just great.Every day I struggle so much. I always wake up late, I always worry too much and I can't do anything on my own. Every day, when I wake up I have thoughts. Every time at lunch, and at night. I try so hard to stop myself, but I never can. I've never really talked to many people about it, only people online I know more than my family.. Even if I wanted to talk to my parents, they're always busy watching some random shit on Netflix. They ignore me and it hurts, all because some random crap on a show's going on. My online friends, however are so much nicer. They always want to talk to me, but I'm always different online so I guess that's why. Everything is so much easier online. Even if I wanted to make irl friends, my old "friends" made sure my reputation was so shit that nobody ever even wanted to talk to me, so that's just fucking great. 

I guess I just came here because I felt lonely. I need advice for how to cope.
