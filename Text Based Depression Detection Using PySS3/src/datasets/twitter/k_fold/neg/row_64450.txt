I think I want to die. So why canâ€™t I just kill myself?Iâ€™m struggling to find something to live for. 

I do need to make my life better.

And I can. 

But Iâ€™m struggling to find a reason why. 

Iâ€™ve lost a lot of hope in myself and life itself. 

At the moment all I do is work, eat, sleep and shower. 

I have no friends and none of my family lives by me. 

Iâ€™m single and have no kids. 

Wanted to start a family but just canâ€™t bring myself to anymore. Too fearful Iâ€™ll mess up. 

So what now?

Is there peace after death?

Is it better than life?

Iâ€™m not depressed. Necessarily that is. 

But Iâ€™m just ... I donâ€™t know; not living.
