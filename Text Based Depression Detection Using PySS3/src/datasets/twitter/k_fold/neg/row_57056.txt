Please tell me what to doHi, I won't bother you with everything that has happened but just know that I've been suicidal for over four years. It started when I was around 10 and I'm almost 15 now. Since the start of 2019 it has been getting worse, that was around the time the depression came. But I didn't know that at the time because I did not tell anyone until a few months ago. A man came up to me on Tuesday, I was at school and he said that he wanted to talk to me and since that Tuesday, it was already bad but it has gotten worse every day. I am getting professional help, and I do feel a little better every day. I'm so used to being sad and all that other stuff; I don't want to feel better.  

I have no joy in my life anymore. Yes okay, sometimes I do and I can get happy. When I'm with my friends everything seems okay for a while; no wanting to die or anything like that. And a small part of me does want to experience life but then the other part, the biggest part of me wants to end it. There's no point in living, I don't want to get up in the morning and I only get up because I have to. I'm just done with my life, I've seen it all. I don't want to fight anymore, I'm done. 

I used to have someone to talk to, a really good friend of mine. But she lives in America and I live in Europe. So that's 7 hours between me and her and we only really talked during the weekends but that did help me a lot. Since that she hasn't been online for a month now I have no one to talk to. 

I do have school tomorrow so I should sleep, well at least try to. Sorry if I bothered you and I'm sorry for my English, it's not the best. You don't have to reply, I just wanted to get some stuff off my chest. There's still so much to say and I'm sorry if I went from one thing to a completely different one, I do that a lot. 

Thanks.
