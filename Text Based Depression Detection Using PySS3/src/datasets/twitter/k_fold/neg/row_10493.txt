Please....Anybody, just talkI should start by saying that I am currently on the verge of suicide, I have everythin. g I need with me and can attamept something at a moments notice, this is more of a way of distracting myself from my looming demise, to anyone who reads this, I don't need nor ask for comments, however it is heavily valued.

I feel I have lost everyone, my family/step family are downright ignorant and unmerciful with the way they act towards me and my sister, although not physcially abused, it is mental abuse to some degree, My best friend who I always consider my brother, who Ive known for years now, I feel has grown distant and doesnt like me anymore, and then theres her, the girl I have feelings for, the one who I have made a suicide pact with, the one I slept with, the one I looked to for help as I thought she was a close friend, turned away, always blanking me, thinking Im just 'fine'
Not saying constant talking is good but a message from her once in a while can hopefully help me keep the grandure up that she somewhat thinks of me as a friend.
I feel like my life with no one in it is also going nowhere, probably gonna end up in a dead end 9-5 pecil pushing desk job that will drain me of what sanity I have left, not happiness though, I havent felt happiness for a long time
Going every single day thinking no one loves me, no one cares about, people just tolerate me, I'd be better off dead than alive
Thta not depression....thats hell, I'd trade mental pain for physical pain if it means post poning the intrusive and toxic thoguths my own mind buys into, Is it here knowing that next to me is my way out, it gurantess my release from this cruel world, a world I have tried to help so much, a world which contains my so called friends, the people who always said they'd never abandon me, I sometimes go over those messages and I dont know what hurts more?
The fact theyve left or the messages they sent promising not to......
