How does one actually write a final letter?I've so many things on my mind, yet I want to leave a last letter(message), for the person I love, yet I don't know how start. I am not certain if it's me being at a really low point right now, but I feel like today might be the day, though I'm trying my best not to, I want to make sure I leave something behind me in case it comes to this.
