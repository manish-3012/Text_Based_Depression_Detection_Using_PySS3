Still not happySo I got a "part time job" but is actually a full time job, back doing hair while I'm in school. I was/am happy to be back working and thought it would be good for me while I'm in school, while I'm making great tips and decent money, in still not happy and think about suicide just as much If not more. I feel like nothing in life is going to make me feel like I'm doing something productive with my time, I feel like I want to end it before the semester is up, but I know I won't so I'll just keep staying suicidal and do nothing about it
