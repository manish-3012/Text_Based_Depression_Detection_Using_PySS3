are passive suicidal thoughts a problem?Hi, Iâ€™ve been experiencing passive suicidal thoughts everyday for a couple months. If anything happens my mindâ€™s end result is suicide, maybe its from anxiety and thats my mindâ€™s way of finding an escape? Iâ€™m not sure. Iâ€™ve even made a plan to where if I did want to kill myself, how I would do it. Iâ€™m worried, because I want to live for my parents so they donâ€™t get sad. I know people love me, and Iâ€™m so lucky for them, but a lot of the time when life feels like too much I canâ€™t help but yearn for death and curse the fact I was even born. This has been an everyday thing for awhile, is this a problem?
