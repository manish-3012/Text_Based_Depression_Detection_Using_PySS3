Nobody cares about me. And nobody ever will.I am totally the most unimportant, insignificant person on planet earth. There is nothing special about me at all. Nothing important anyway. I don't have any special personality or talents. I am a total good-for-nothing degenerate who is just a cog in the machine of life. If I were to disappear and die nobody would bat an eye. The world would keep spinning, the wind would still blow, and life will keep going. Just without me in it.

I make no difference to anyone's life. And I never will. Because I am a nobody. Somebody who would be better off dying. I wish I had an easier way than walking my heavy, fat, body to a bridge and jumping off. But I guess beggers can't be choosers.
