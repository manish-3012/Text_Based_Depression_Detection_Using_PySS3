Let's talk STD'sI caught herpes. I have had relationships since, but I don't want to ever discuss this in person with someone ever again, so I'm no longer dating. I've used a few hookers, but, really, who am I kidding? There's no reason to live. I will only ever be able to give someone I love herpes, and I'd rather just not. Too far gone seems like a reasonable feeling to have when you have an incurable STD. Before my diagnosis I'd always felt that those with a viral infection should kill themselves. So now, it sort of feels like the normal conclusion of that feeling.
