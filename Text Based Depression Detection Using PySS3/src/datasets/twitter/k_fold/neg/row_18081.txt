Having mixed feelings for your family at the same time as having suicidal thoughts is extremely fucking frustratingI had a nice childhood and Iâ€™m very grateful for that. I made mistakes, regretted and learnt a lot in the last 20-odd years. But today when I have grown to become a person who has mixed feelings about their family. I donâ€™t like the kind of people my brain tells itself my parents are. But I still love them. I donâ€™t understand this. And this happens along with me constantly thinking about death. Itâ€™s a literal prison where I seem to do nothing right.
