I need some hope guysI'm 20y/o, first of all i dont speak english that good so sorry about that.
My depression started 4 years ago
And slowly, but its getting worse every year
My last gf treated me like shit, lastly i have failed 2 years of school, rn im doing again my first semester on the university
I feel like im not enough, im really trying, REALLY trying but i feel like im not good enough to get good grades, or even pass this semester
I haven't found good psychologists that take my thoughts seriously
I want to text close friends but my only close friend is my first ex gf
And she's busy because of her work
I basically can't speak with no one
I want to be possitive but everytime i feel this worthless i can't help but to think to finish this
I thought i wasn't "brave enough" to kill myself but last time i was drunk i tried it by OD, so im scared because i actually can kill me
I know that if i die, my friends will probably think "hope he could've tell us how he felt", but i know nobody really cares until then
Posted this hoping somebody who has been in my position can give me some advice or hope
