I just donâ€™t knowIâ€™m not really sure why Iâ€™m posting today.   Iâ€™ve asked for help in the past and now feel more hopeless than ever. I feel like this is my attempt to let someone know that I was struggling. I have worked so hard the last few months trying to get everything in line financially for my wife.  I distanced myself from my family, and did things to make them angry with me so it makes this decision easier. The reason I know itâ€™s time is that I donâ€™t have any other emotion left except for anger that I donâ€™t understand. I have worked as a nurse for 6 years now both in the ER and now recently in Endoscopy. I left the ER because I felt so hated and was tired of being treated like I donâ€™t matter. I was the hardest worker in the department there is no doubt in my mind, but for some reason my coworkers would lie about me and say that I didnâ€™t do my job well. I spent lots of time with my patients and their families trying to help them cope with their losses or tragedies all while deep down inside I felt jealous that I was still on this earth. I finally gained the courage to find a different job and try to change my life.  I donâ€™t know what I do or whatâ€™s wrong with me but Iâ€™m starting to see the same thing happening in my new job.  Iâ€™ve been through the cycle of â€œTry this medicationâ€ and when it doesnâ€™t work try to pull the pieces together enough to try another.   All I can think about is stopping this endless suffering.  I know my wife will be okay because her brother lives in our basement and can help her with the house and any future expenses that come in the future.  I made sure we have enough money in our account to pay for a cheap funeral but at this point I really donâ€™t think anyone will attend.  The nurse in me has evaluated and re-evaluated everything Iâ€™m struggling with and I have tried to break the cycle of my family.  I lost 3 uncles to suicide and today I become the fourth. My father died of an extremely rare blood cancer 10 years ago at the age of 53, and I lost my one year old boxer dog 3 months ago to a rare cancer as well. I didnâ€™t have children so he was my child, he was the only thing thatâ€™s kept me alive and he is gone.   My wife, I think she is better off with me gone.  Iâ€™ve caused her a lot of difficulty trying to solve why iâ€™m struggling and her frustration with me shows. I think she will have a deep sigh of relief after a brief sadness of me passing.   I have formulated my plan, being a nurse gives me extra insight on how to do it and make sure itâ€™s completed. The only thing Iâ€™m struggling with today is that Iâ€™m a Christian and believe in God and Jesus. I know that according to the Bible I am going to hell for my choice if there is an afterlife.  Thatâ€™s probably what has delayed me these past three months but now I just donâ€™t even care anymore. Anything to get out of this life. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.
