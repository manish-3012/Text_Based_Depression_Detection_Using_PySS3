I'm fucking up at workI've been at my current job (my first one out of school) for five months now and I'm having a difficult time learning everything quickly enough. It wasn't as much of an issue earlier because I didn't have any real responsibilities yet but recently I've been handling my own projects and I've made some pretty serious mistakes. I have a lot social anxiety and self esteem issues as it is and so now having to deal with people who are disappointed, frustrated, and angry at me all the time for things that are completely my fault are becoming too much to deal with. My boss will be telling me where I messed up and how it's a problem and I'll just be sitting there fantasizing about killing myself. It hurts so much to be here dealing with this all day every day. 

I know this may seem like a petty reason to feel so terrible but it's feels unbearable. I hate myself so much. I feel stupid and worthless and I'm too shy and socially anxious to really have enough of a relationship with anyone for them to have much sympathy. 

I don't think I can do this every day.  I don't know what else to say.
