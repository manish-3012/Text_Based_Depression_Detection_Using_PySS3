Strangulation pain - unbearable.I felt like utter shit, so I tried to strangulate myself with a cable. Let me tell you, the pain is pretty bad. First it's your lips tingling then they start pounding. You gradually lose hearing. Your face starts to burn up and your brain/inside of your head feels like it's going to pop. I couldn't tolerate it after about 30 seconds and scrambled to get it off, which was easier said than done. 

While I do want to kill myself. I may not try this one for a while.
