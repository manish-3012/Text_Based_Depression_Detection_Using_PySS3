A PropositionHi guys, first ever post on suicidewatch, and I am not even sure if this is allowed. If not, feel free to delete. Anyways, there always seems something so futile in trying to stop a suicide attempt over the internet. With this idea in mind, I thought that there has to be a solution, and I came up with an idea. What if someone developed an app that, when someone is feeling suicidal within a particular area, they simply request a person to be with. Said volunteer, or whoever was working that night would then venture to their location, and simply be there for them. Normally, from my experiences anyway, being physically present is absolutely key to helping people. It would almost be like a guardian angel type thing, completely free and available. Of course you would have to have volunteers for the program to assist in suicide prevention, and I can already think of many problems associated with the idea, but how feasible do you think the idea is generally?
