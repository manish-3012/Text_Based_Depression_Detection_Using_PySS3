Is silence too much to ask for?Would I kill myself? Probably not. I wouldn't get the bagpipes, I wouldn't get the processions, I wouldn't get the honor. And i suppose a part of me believes God will hate me if I do. I tried it once (actually 3 times total). Put a gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger. For the first time that pistol misfired. 1000+ rounds through it without a failure. 


I just want quiet. From everywhere it's yelling, screaming, laughing, hugging, touching, grabbing, tones going off, radios squelching, sirens going, horns blaring. When I close my eyes it's my head that won't shut the fuck up. Racing a million miles an hour. Thinking about this trip to Vegas on Monday that I was hoping would relax me or if my girlfriend wanted to get back together because she heard I came into some money. I think I had a panic attack today at my moms. Kids running around having fun and parents yelling because the kids were yelling. Maybe it was a panic attack I don't know what those are like. Hell I'm allergic to cats and I find myself looking for reasons to expose myself to one so I can take 4 Benadryl because I can sleep and feel wrapped up in silence. But deep down I know that I take it because I want to. Hoping either I accidentally overdose or something. For once I want to hear nothing.
