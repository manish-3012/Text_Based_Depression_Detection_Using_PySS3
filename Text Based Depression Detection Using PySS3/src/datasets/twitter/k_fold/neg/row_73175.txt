I'm going to drop a live electrical appliance into a tub of water with me in it in the next 24 hours.Nothing I can say that most of you here haven't probably read a hundred times. I don't want to live anymore and its just that simple. I'm not interested in anything I don't want to do anything with my life anymore. I don't care what it will do to others because if I succeed I wont be alive to care. I cant really name anything traumatic or horrible I've had to go through in my life that would make me feel this way but I've thought about suicide almost every day since I was 12. 


I feel like everything I do is for other people because I would rather be dead. Even getting the help I have is only because people  I've told about this beg me to. I don't think I even want help anymore. I don't think I really want or care about being better and happier even if I can I just want to be dead and at peace. 

I guess I'm mostly posting this so someone can let me know if it wont work before I do it. Which is as simple as filling the bathtub with water and dropping a live iron or toaster into it, depending on which one puts our more electricity, at the end most distant from the metal drain. I already know about modern outlets having a safety mechanism for this and my house is too old to have them, I also understand that it only takes a fraction of what these devices put out to kill a person. 

This is probably the wrong place to post this kind of thing but I don't know where else to say it.
