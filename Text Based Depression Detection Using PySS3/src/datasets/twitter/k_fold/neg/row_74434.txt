Iâ€™m so tiredThere is a typical confusion about depression, which generally does not allow you to understand the problem. So you live, every day, bad, you think itâ€™s the place, your life, people around you. But youâ€™re sick and this kills you slowly. 

I never understood the root of my problems, I always thought it was loneliness, but Iâ€™ve always had so many people around, and in my native country so many dear friends who over the years has done more and more close to me. So what? 

With time, I started to isolate myself, I avoid going out almost always. I donâ€™t take opportunities to find new friends, the only time I go out is to get laid. The last time I went out with someone was two weeks ago to fuck a girl known on Tinder. Actually we didnâ€™t fucked, she talked about shoes all the eve. 

I canâ€™t enjoy hanging out with anyone anymore, because stay with people makes me just more depressed. I donâ€™t know what to say, I donâ€™t know what to talk about. My sadness, my need for isolation, and all the responsibilities I have are killing me. I canâ€™t handle this. 

Iâ€™m done.
