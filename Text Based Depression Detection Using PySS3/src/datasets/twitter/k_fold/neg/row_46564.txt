Would there be consequences if I would try to commit suicide, but got stopped before I could?Basically what the title says. 

Been feeling really bad lately. I just want to know that if I would make this decision, and I would be stopped, I wonâ€™t get into more trouble and a darker place than Iâ€™m in now.

Would there be consequences e.g. police involvement or anything?
