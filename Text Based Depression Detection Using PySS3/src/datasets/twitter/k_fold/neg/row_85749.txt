Im ready to give up now       Im done being sad everyday. Im done being poor and hungry everyday. Im done wishing I could just get hit by a speeding car or accidentally poison myself or get some deadly disease and just fall over and die. I have realized life was set up from the start for some people to just be miserable and poor. Im fucking lonely and anxious everyday of my life for hours a day. I recently picked up crying as a hobby before i get some sleep. I slept for two hours last night because all my time i wasted crying in bed with a knife at hand wishing Iâ€™d have a knee jerk reaction and violently stab myself. Iâ€™ve cut myself enough to know im not brave enough to willingly cause permanent damage too myself. I wish the world wasnâ€™t how it is. Someoneâ€™s gotta get the shit end of the stick so the other end has more shine. How could someone get a big mac if know one drops out of high school and lives paycheck to paycheck for the rest of their lives. Thatâ€™s me. Im the bottom of the totem pole. I make others feel good about what they have cause they can say â€œAt least Iâ€™m not that guyâ€. And donâ€™t get me wrong, alot of people have it worse than me. But at the end of the day I only know my pain, my sadness, and my depression. 

       Lately, Iâ€™ve been thinking that Iâ€™m honestly just a fucking terrible person. I have immense jealousy for my friends to the point that I donâ€™t wanna talk to them anymore. They have stable families and are enjoying college life while I work 40 hours a week just to blow it all away cause I honestly want to die more than i want to try to work miracle and fix my life. I canâ€™t imagine being happy. Ive been sad for 13 years now so all i know is that i have alot more years coming. I know my own limitations and Iâ€™m not built to work miracles. Im not motivated enough to drag my own sorry ass into a happy future. 
        
              Iâ€™ve put up with enough emotional scarring and I have put myself through enough physical harm. In the end, when itâ€™s all said and done, i hope atleast one tear is shed for my suicide. Im not sure when Iâ€™ll do it but itâ€™s definitely coming. Im at new lows in life. I havenâ€™t had a single up in years. I canâ€™t put up with the misery any longer.
