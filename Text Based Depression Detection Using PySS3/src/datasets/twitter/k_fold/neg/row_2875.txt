Living deadI sometimes feel Iâ€™ve simply passed my healthy prime and should be dead though my body carries on. Like the part of me that was happy and loved life is dead already. Sometimes I think that state of mind, via treatment resistant depression/anxiety, should be biologically the same as heart disease. The body should just naturally die. That way you donâ€™t hurt anyone because your death isnâ€™t self inflicted. I recently witnessed what a suicide does to family and friends and itâ€™s much worse than a natural death. We just have to tough it out.
