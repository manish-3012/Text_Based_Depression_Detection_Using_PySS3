Meds Instead of BedsIâ€™m pretty young, 17, turning 18 in two months and a day. I understand depression can be the result of a chemical imbalance and that taking medication will level that out and for the most part fix or help the issue. Currently I have somewhat of a grip on my life/mental state but I can feel myself slipping lower and lower back into a deep depression. My girlfriend (the only one who knows about how bad itâ€™s gotten for me) has suggested to me a few times that medication may be the best option for me and she has somewhat convinced me of that being a good idea. I have a few problems with it such as the whole process of having to explain how I feel to my parents and then explain how I feel to a doctor. (It took me two years to explain how I feel to my girlfriend and that was extremely tough for me bc iâ€™m still slightly unconvinced that what iâ€™m experiencing IS depression). I understand if I do go through with this I can stop anytime but another problem I have with medication like this is im scared it will alter my state of mind so much that I will find things enjoyable that I didnâ€™t before (not like thatâ€™s necessarily a horrible thing I just feel like I wouldnâ€™t be â€œmeâ€) If anyone has any suggestions or tips or any insight at all to sway me any direction, it sure would help a lot. :)
