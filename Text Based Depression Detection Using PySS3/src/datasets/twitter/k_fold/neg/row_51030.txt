CollegeI failed my first year of college. Thats it, my parents put so much hope in me just for me to fucking fail. I wasted their energy, money, everything. I could never be my perfect sister i feel like im a burden i always feel like im being compared w other people. When i broke the news to my mom just just sobbed, shes the type who would not say anything cuz she doesnt want to hurt my feelings but you czn tell sheâ€™s disappointed. My sister offered solutions but i just csnt anymore. Imagine a world without me, their world without me. They wouldnt have to care a thing for me .they dont have to waste their time and money on me. Im better off dead anyways, ive never been an excellent kid my grdaes are always just enough to pass, i dont get as much attention as my other 2 siblings but it makes sense i guess. My dads a doctor i can easily sneak into his office and take a bunch of painreliefs and overdose on that shit. I have everything planned.
