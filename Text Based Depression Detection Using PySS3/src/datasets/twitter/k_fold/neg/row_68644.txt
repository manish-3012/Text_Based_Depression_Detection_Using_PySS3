Text I'm not sure I should sendI've almost given up hope that I'll ever actually feel better because this depression is a constant cycle, for years. Suicidal thoughts have been on and off but these past couple weeks it's almost constant without a distraction. It's hard to play games anymore, or really do anything that doesn't result in some kind of progress towards something without my mind wondering to these thoughts. 

Can't help but wonder how many times I've repeated myself with a similar message. It feels pathetic so maybe I won't send it. It won't make me feel any less alone anyway or change anything so what's the point?

Speaking of change, no natter how much I try and change the way I think or act it always comes back to crying while typing one of these. Sometimes I think I'd rather wallow and just sob.

Is it loneliness? Self-loathing? I can't say, maybe the cataclysm of all my negative thoughts.

Expressing myself is hard to those who aren't good friends, even sometimes when it is a good friend. I feel like something wrong with my brain that people give me so much anxiety it's hard to communicate and just be myself.

The worst part of it all is that I think some like-minded people would aide the situation, or just one special person but my anxiety and self-deprication prevents be me from reaching out and asking. Obviously not an end-all be-all, moreso a huge step forward.

I worry everytime I send these I come across as attention-seeking or needy. I don't know anymore, might just feel worse for sending it.
