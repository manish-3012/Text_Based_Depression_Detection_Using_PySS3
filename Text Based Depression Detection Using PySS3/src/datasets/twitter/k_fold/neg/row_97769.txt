To anyone who wants to take time and read this. (19, last hope)Depression runs in my family and I've talked to some people but I just don't feel like I have anyone to turn to anymore. My entire life when ever I get sad or upset someone I instantly think of what it would be like if I just didn't exist, if I offed myself. My job is to much stress and I will think of ways I can hurt myself enough to get out of work but not enough to die. But recently its been worse, I have fantasies of dying and it scares me because it doesn't scare me. I have thoughts of wanting to cut again, of feeling the blade again. But I can't, I've geld against for so long. But these thoughts keep pushing me and I'm afraid I'm going to let them control me again. I need help before it starts
