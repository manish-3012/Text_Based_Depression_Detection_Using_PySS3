I think it's timeI posted here beforehand. It still hasn't gotten better. Honestly, I realized that a lot of the problems were my fault too. I know I'm mentally ill but at least I acknowledge it. I despise my mother. I hate that I have to wake up to her and she's there every day. I have always wished for a normal mother. I can't even go to the fucking doctors because we only have one car yet I'm exhausted and my kidney is killing me. I'm trying desperately to move out but I have no place to go. She tells me she wants me out by Friday because she "found a place" but that's a fucking lie. She's a fucking disgusting, vile pathetic loser bitch and I hate hate hate her. I wish she was gone from my life like the fucking vermin she is. I know i'm a selfish bitch cunt. But I honestly don't care anymore. There are times when I wish she was dead. And i wish I were dead too. And tonight is the night. If I'm brave enough i can down the viibryd I have and hope for the best. Because this life is just one big joke after another. It honestly feels unreal, like someone is laughing at me. Mental and physical illness make for something funny, don't they? Well it helps that i have shitty parents too. i hate this world and the scum that's in it, including myself. I'm a heartless, selfish, pitiful loser. And i;m abnormal. My hope is gone, just like it's been for the past 8 years. Good riddance.
