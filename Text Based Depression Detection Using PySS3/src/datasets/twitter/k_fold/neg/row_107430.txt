I almost gave up on my life yesterdayI feel like a coward for not going through with it. My suicide note was written and everything. But something stopped me. Idk if it was my survival instincts or what. My friend I was talking to had a panic attack when I told them my plan, so maybe there was some guilt thrown in there. I really donâ€™t know, but Iâ€™m mad at myself for not going through with it.
