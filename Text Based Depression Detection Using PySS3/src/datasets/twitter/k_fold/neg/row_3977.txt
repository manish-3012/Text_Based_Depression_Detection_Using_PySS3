What happens after?I was wondering what would happen once someone dies. Do the police dig into the case? If so, how far do they dig? If it's a student will the whole district know about it or will it only be the teachers? I want to minimize as much trauma as I can.

Edit: What about my body? Can I asked not to have a burial and just burn my body or donate organs?
