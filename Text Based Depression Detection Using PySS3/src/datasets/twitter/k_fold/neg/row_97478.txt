50That is the amount of days I have left before I kill myself with cyanide. When that number reaches 0, I'll do it. If I get super tired before that, I'll do it. I am sick of this same world, and people telling me how I ought to live. I tried counselling, but it has proven ineffective, and my psychiatrist pretty much washed his hands when I left.
