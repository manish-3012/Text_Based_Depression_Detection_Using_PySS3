What's the point? I don't even know what "love" means anymore.I used to think it was protection, devotion to others, self-sacrifice and forgiveness....

But I guess I was wrong, I've always been wrong...

Yesterday I saw a What's App stat which had a chat log with a high school bully who was also my rival (albeit I was probably a nuisance to him).

He has everything I've ever wanted. The ability to say what he wants, thinks or desires without regret at all, having friendships with most people from our high school class, having self-esteem, not being afraid of anything...

While I'm here, paying the consequences of the damage he and pretty much half of our class did to me, being blamed for not changing despite having tried tons of different solutions, not being able to say anything because at least I don't want to make my family suffer anymore than I've already had...

He's the only person I hate almost as much as I hate myself...

Why couldn't they leave me alone at the very least? Why did they messed me up for years, creating the bases that destroyed my entire life...

While he has a very successful life, I'm probably considered by many people as someone who's gross, a nuisance, a "retard" or frankly someone annoying and easily replaceable...

I hate myself so much that I want to bash my head against a wall...
