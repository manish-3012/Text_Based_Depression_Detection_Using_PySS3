Please someone out there fucking help meI (19F) can't take it anymore. I'm not immediately suicidal but I've lost all motivation to draw, play video games, and do basic activities on a daily basis.


I've basically been in "lockdown" my whole life (WAY before the pandemic), with my only real life contact with the outside world being 9 hours of therapy with a bunch of middle aged adults.

Aside from the cold, I can't step a single foot out the door because of how trashy my father has made the porch.

Both my guinea pigs are fucking dead and my parents screams my cat.


In fact, everyone screams across the house so much that it's given me severe anxiety and possibly even hearing loss. I'm always stressed bc they all have booming loud voices and there's nothing I can do about it. It's always so demanding and makes my nerves explode off the roof with me just nodding my head in response as it's the quickest thing I can do.

I long to go for car rides whatsoever as my one and only temporary escape from such madness. My desperation got so bad that I will start to pop a DayQuil and a Terazosin every time they time they leave me at home.

Anything helps at this point, please I'm begging.
