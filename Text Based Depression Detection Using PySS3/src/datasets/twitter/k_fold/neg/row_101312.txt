A lowMe again... Iâ€™m so confused. I want to die. But thereâ€™s so much to look forward to... Iâ€™m 21 weeks pregnant, we sign on our home on Thursday, my son is 14 months old. Thereâ€™s so much excitement and love, and yet I canâ€™t shake the thoughts. Iâ€™ve been cutting myself lately. Deeper than I ever have. 
Itâ€™s such a silly set off point... I was so proud I found us a free brand new dresser. Perfect. And today it got water damage in storage. How silly right? But I canâ€™t shake it. It was my breaking point today. Such deep cuts. I want to end it, but Iâ€™m scared. And then I think for thinking the thoughts, Iâ€™ll just be punished and everything I love will be taken away from me, which just makes me want to die more. But I canâ€™t even kill myself... I canâ€™t kill my baby. Right? That would be wrong and selfish. Gosh. My thoughts are everywhere. My husband just yells at me. Tells me to get out of bed. Says itâ€™s just a dresser, but itâ€™s more than the dresser. I probably sound dumb and maybe Iâ€™m not making sense. I donâ€™t know.
