I feel worthless...Everyone just leaves me... No one that I know ever stayed or chatted with me. Sure they remember me but they don't care. Even best friends have went by and doesn't bat an eye.

Worst of all is I got left again by someone special in my life... I'm not sure whether to go through with this but I sure am hurting myself a lot. 

The final snap of my mind is just gonna be full on.

I've talked to multiple people about this problem of mine and none have helped. Even my "friends" didn't help. When she came back I felt much happier and normal for once... It only delayed my planned suicide...

Then the same thing happened all over again...

Even if I'd talk to someone like a parent of mine. I'll just be a burden. Therapy, Anti depressants. It'll all just be more expenses again in the long run. I'm starting to feel like a funeral and me being buried under dirt would be less painful and better.

One less person to give money and gifts to..

I've cried almost everyday for months. Just for her. I'm starting to think there's nothing good in life for me. I already know I won't get what I dream of. But this is too much.

I'm truly sorry if this confuses you as my state of mind isn't the best. Thank you for your time though.
