How to call for help when I can't take myself seriously?This is round 18 or so for me, I've always managed to reach the point where I have concrete plans laid out and then something happens and taking my own life takes a backseat.

Priorities are strange.  Every time this feeling bubbles up it seems to feel more real than the last time.  You'd figure good life circumstances would knock you out of this type of thought, but it's not the case.  The better things get the more imminent death (by my own hand) feels, specifically because these thoughts persist.  They tend to feel more real when there are fewer external factors to explain them.

In some sick way I resent myself for letting it get this far, I resent that I never acted upon these feelings before.

Thanks for listening.
