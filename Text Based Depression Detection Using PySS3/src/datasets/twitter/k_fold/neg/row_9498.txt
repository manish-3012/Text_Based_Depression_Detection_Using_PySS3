Tired of being called idiot and stupid after a suicide attempt.I have tried to end my life overdosing in meds and failed miserably, I have borderline personality disorder and my life is hard. I lost my shit and it happened. 

I threw up for twelve hours and had to hear my only friend calling me stupid and idiot, begged him to come to the hospital with me but ended up going alone. 

Two weeks later, I had to move back to my home town where I live in a tent because my friend couldnâ€™t host me for any longer. I need a liver transplant because of the damage from my OD. Still my friend keep calling me idiot and saying â€œwhy did you do thatâ€ I donâ€™t fucking know! Iâ€™m mentally ill my illness makes me wanna die but please stop, I regret it too, it hurts everyday and I keep throwing up blood, I feel so lonely and exhausted. 

My friend isnâ€™t a bad person, he is willing to even see if he can be compatible to donate me his liver but fuck every time he is panicking he insults me for doing that, I donâ€™t deserve that.
