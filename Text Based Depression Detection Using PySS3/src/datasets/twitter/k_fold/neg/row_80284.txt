I just want to strangle myself to deathAll of my life, Iâ€™ve struggled with how Iâ€™m ugly, fat, and that no one likes me. Everything I do always goes to trash, and I donâ€™t know what to do about it. Iâ€™m on medications, and I go to a therapist. Nothing ever feels like itâ€™s for me. Iâ€™ve lost my sense of self trying to please others, and it has never worked. Iâ€™m still judged. Everyone ignores me. I only have one real friend who puts up with my trash, but my family doesnâ€™t want me hanging out with him as much. My mom has forced me back into the closet after accidentally coming out as bi. My phone was taken away, and when I got it back, a software was placed on it so she could see everything I did. Iâ€™m scared to hold any kind of opinion in fear Iâ€™ll be punished for it. Itâ€™s an unending cycle. I barely have acceptable social skills. My humor is dry and boring. No one ever cares enough to genuinely carry a conversation with me. They tell me things that arenâ€™t the truth to avoid my feelings. I have panic attacks in class. The only boyfriends I ever have are manipulative or uncaring. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore, and Iâ€™ve really been thinking about going ahead to write my will. Iâ€™ve been searching how to make a suicide look like an accident, but I donâ€™t know. I feel too cowardice. Iâ€™m 15 years old. I donâ€™t know what to do.
