Lost on what to doI made some really huge mistakes recently. Ones that completely ruined me and the relationship I was in. I hurt the one person who meant the world to me, I became a person I swore I never would. Iâ€™ve spent the last week staring at pills I have in my vanity, wondering how many I could take before I would just go. Looking  at razor and wanting to cut myself to feel a different pain, to watch the blood pour out until I went. Iâ€™ve attempted before, in other ways, but itâ€™s been a really long time. I reached out... but this time, I know I probably wonâ€™t do any, but the desire is there, itâ€™s really strong. Iâ€™ve been bashed, belittled, I deserve it. I feel like I deserve to be gone, because I became someone I swore I never would.... so maybe I am that person, and if I am then I would much rather be dead. His life would be better with me gone for good, others life would be better with me gone.... I feel like itâ€™s the only real answer left, Iâ€™ve tried positive talk, reaching out, staying busy, beating myself up, letting others talk down to me.... Iâ€™ve tried what I feel like is everything, suicide just keeps sounding better and better. Like I have nothing else. Like I deserve it.
