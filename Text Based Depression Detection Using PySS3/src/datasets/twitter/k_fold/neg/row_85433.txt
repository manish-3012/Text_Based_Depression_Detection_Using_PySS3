the real big reason im still alive is because of my friendI know that if I die, they will die soon after. I donâ€™t want to do that to them. They rely on me a lot. But itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m a good friend anyway.

The other reason is because Iâ€™m a coward that is too afraid of the tiniest bit of pain and ironically death haha I canâ€™t take this anymore it gets worse every day Iâ€™m so fucking tired
