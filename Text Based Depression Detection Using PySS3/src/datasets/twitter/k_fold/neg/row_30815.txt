Thereâ€™s a huge probability that Iâ€™ll do it in the next few hoursIâ€™m not some bored teenager that didnâ€™t like momâ€™s dinner and everything sucks. Iâ€™m in my mid 30s who has gone through a lot of shit and canâ€™t deal with it anymore. I lost my wife to cancer a year ago and with that I lost pretty much my whole life. My home, my job, everything. Iâ€™ve been feeling seriously ill for so much time, constantly in physical pain, itâ€™s a miracle that I still havenâ€™t done it. Iâ€™m starting to get shit from my closest family because they canâ€™t suffer anymore with me. Iâ€™m trying to put my shit together but itâ€™s not that easy. At this point I donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth it anymore. If I go my family will finally get a rest from worrying too much for me and all the pain I have will disappear. I would so much like to live and be pain free but apparently itâ€™s not an option. The only reason Iâ€™m still here is because I donâ€™t have a gun and suicide is too easy to mess up. But I finally found a very steep hill which is accessible and Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll be fatal. I actually donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m sharing this with you but I know that I will not call anyone right now.
