I really really don't want to dieI've never wanted to die, it's scary and sad and I'm just biologically wired to not want to do it. I don't want to die.

But in all honesty, it's my best choice. I mean I'm obviously not going to do it yet, as neither quarantine nor adolescence are accurate indicators of what my life quality will be. I plan to live until at least 30, then I'll decide.

When your problems are your brain, what do you do? And I don't mean long term, I mean in the moment. Do I just have to sit there and suffer while my brain hurls panic and depression at me? I don't want that... I don't want to just grin and bear it! Why does everyone keep telling me that?! Don't they understand how that makes suicide seem like a saving grace?! 

I never wanted to die, everyone just keeps making it seem like the best option.
