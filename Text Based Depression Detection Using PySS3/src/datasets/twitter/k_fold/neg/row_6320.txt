I just need someone to just, hold me right now, just spent 2 hours in my computer chair shaking and crying into myself..I feel so alone and I just want to be hold closely by someone and I feel like my mind is running at a mile every second criticizing me for every fucking little thing I do as I cry and I just want to reach out and be held or something stupid like that and I feel like this post will be unanswered and nobody will care but I just need to release this somewhere so I don't keep it in and cry again and I just want know someone cares about me at all and just want someone to hug me I feel so fucking pathetic right now
