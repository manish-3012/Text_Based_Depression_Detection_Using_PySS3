iâ€™m just frustrated. everyone says thereâ€™s all this help, but thereâ€™s literally not. | spent the day calling placesiâ€™ve done this before. cold calling places, giving my story, begging for help. and in the end, not getting help. just getting confused voices and lots of questions or turned away immediately. itâ€™s so annoying. like i fit all these boxes that people say i should be able to get help from, then i call or email these places and nobody can help me. im a female, disabled, suicidal, a victim of domestic violence, been homeless, at risk of homelessness again. but still for some reason, no one can help. 
 iâ€™m just gonna end up killing my self and nobodyâ€™s gonna care then either. i already tried so many times and i donâ€™t know why it couldnâ€™t have just worked then.. i donâ€™t wanna be here. everyday i just struggle and feel like iâ€™m begging for help and nobody can help me :(
