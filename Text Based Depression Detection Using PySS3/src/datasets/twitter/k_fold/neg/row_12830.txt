I feel ashamed.I don't know where else to talk about this. I keep surrounding myself with all of these people that treat me like shit. I don't know how to stop. I feel so fucking filthy. I'm 15 fucking years old, what the hell is this? Why the fuck do I feel like this? My mom would cry if she knew, she found out in 7th grade I wanted to kill myself. She cried then. I have a girlfriend. i've had one, 8 months now. i have aspergers. she says she loves me and that i'm the most handsome man in the world, and that should make me happy right? she says she loves me more than anything, and i believe her. but i don't know what i feel. i'm ashamed, that she loves me more than i could ever love her. and i feel so ugly, i hate looking at myself. i look at myself and i say "jesus fuck, what the hell's the matter with you? be normal. fucking talk. make some god damn friends." but i can't. i let myself down. i let her down. i'm even in a fucking skype call with her right now, and she's laughing at something. i don't know what. she doesn't know i'm writing this, it'd scare her half to death if she found out. i told her once before i wanted to kill myself, and she cried, she cried for a while. but not too long. i know she would if i did. i just. i need some fucking light in this tunnel.
