I dont think I can do it anymoreAll I ever do is break my promises. I promised my mom I would get straight As that I would do my best and get better. Its April now and I have two Ds in my classes and a paper due two weeks ago that was a good portion of my grade. I wanted to prove that I could make it. I lived only to see the world change and for the love of my family. 

I'm 17 and yet I feel like I've reached the end of my line. I won't get into a good college like I have always hoped or get a good job. I wanted something a cause to die for but I might have to settle for this.  My first suicide attempt was April of last year and I can't stop thinking about it. I'd have to clean my room first. All I can say is I'm afraid and I'm sorry to my family.
