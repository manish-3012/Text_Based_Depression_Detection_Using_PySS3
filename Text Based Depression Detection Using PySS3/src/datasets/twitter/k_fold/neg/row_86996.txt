New Year's resolution.I'm 29 years old and here I am another New Year's Eve with my parents. So it's thirtieth time that I'm spending my New Year's Eve with my parents. They are old and tired dad is 60yo and mom is 58yo and I'm also so tired of everything I never had any true friends, never had girlfriend, finished crappy high school, quit college on third year because of loneliness and depression. Never got any job. I spent last eight years basically 24/7 with either my father or mother. I don't get out without my dad and you know it's enough. He didn't had great life either he worked as police officer he never got any time to relax and rest because he is basically babysitting me ever since he retired. So my New Year's resolution would be to just end all this suffering and commit suicide.
