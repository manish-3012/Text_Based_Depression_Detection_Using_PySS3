I can't keep going on like this...I have really bad anxiety due to a fucked up childhood (isn't that how it always starts), sometimes it feels like the entire world is waiting for me to mess up so that they can yell at me... I somehow convinced myself that if I kept taking my meds then they would magically cure my anxiety, even though logically I know that's not how it works. And being reminded that that won't happen kind of crushed some unrealistic hope I had inside, and it just hit me, im always going to be like this, I'm always going to be fucking terrified, of everything. I can't live like this, I'm 22, and I didnt think I'd get here, I don't know how much longer I can last like this.
