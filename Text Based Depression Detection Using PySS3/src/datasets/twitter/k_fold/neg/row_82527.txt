Canâ€™t Stop These Thoughts in my HeadSo the more and more I think lately, I honestly believe that everyone would be better off without me. Ever since I spent two, almost three years with my abusive ex boyfriend, it made me realize a lot about the way my brain works. And I realized that Iâ€™m never gonna be good enough for anyone let alone myself, I no longer see the point in my existence. I am currently receiving the silent treatment from three people all because my awful communication screwed things up (I am high functioning autistic and typically things I say get misunderstood and taken the wrong way). I donâ€™t know how to fix it and Iâ€™m scared my manipulative and abusive ex played a part in them thinking the wrong things about me since he told me that he wanted to ruin my life. 

Iâ€™m just so tired of being the one everyone walks all over and honestly it would prolly be easier if I was just gone. The thing is though, I could never get the courage to actually go through with attempting again, no matter how much I donâ€™t wanna be alive anymore.
