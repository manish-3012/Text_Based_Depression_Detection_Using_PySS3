My boyfriend is pushing me over the edgeMy boyfriend has said some pretty shitty things to me in the past (I'm immature, I'm too bitchy, etc.). Last night he said I constantly rely on everyone else for everything and I want to talk about my feelings way too much. I don't know if he realizes how much that makes me want to end it all. I already feel like a burden on everyone.
