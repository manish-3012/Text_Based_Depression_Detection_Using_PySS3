My small financial issues drag me down...I had my appartament flooded recently. Since the owner is a shithead, I was forced to repay for all the damage or to be evicted if I refused. 

Since I have nowhere to go, I had to spend all my savings to repair this awful place..

Now I'm left empty-handed for at least one more week until my salary comes. I have no ability to borrow money and because of these assholes like my landlord, I have to pay for the damage that's not my fault and starve because of it. 

When you're depressed, every small inconvenience feels like a major one. I realize that, but I can't control myself. These two weeks must've been the most frustrated in my recent time. I can't control myself and I'm so done. I'm so disappointed in myself. I'm so disappointed with awful people like the landlord.. 

I wish I could just go to sleep, have a wonderful dreams and never wake up from it
