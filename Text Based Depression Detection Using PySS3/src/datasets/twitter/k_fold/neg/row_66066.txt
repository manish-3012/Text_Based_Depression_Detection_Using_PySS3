Lots of new changes in my life. Having a hard time adjusting and the pandemic doesn't help.Recently moved to a new city to attend a grad school and to live with my long term girlfriend. Due to the pandemic my program went all online. While I am grateful for the safety measures being taken, I don't feel like I able to engage with my classes nearly as well as I did in undergrad. I don't have the same connections with my peers or professors and It's harder for me to sit for 3 hours for a lecture when I have to watch a screen rather than listen to an in person lecture. My attention is shot. I barely leave my room anymore because I am always working on school work. Worst of all I am not doing well in my classes. I had an exam that I studied for hours daily for over a week and  was completely lost when I got to the exam itself. I am continuing to reach out to people. I am seeing a therapist tomorrow but I am losing hope. Everyday I want to end my life more. I've been thinking about where I would do it and how I would do it. I am completely exhausted and it doesn't feel like it's paying off. I'm miserable and this was supposed to be the culmination of all of my hard undergrad work. I just want to be done.
