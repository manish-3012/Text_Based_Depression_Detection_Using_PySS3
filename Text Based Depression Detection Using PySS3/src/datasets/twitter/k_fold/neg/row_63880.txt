I think I'm finally at my endI'm 23, just turned and I hate birthdays. Just a reminder of another year I failed to kill myself. I've also just had my disability benefits cut off so now I don't even know how I'm going to live. I don't want to live, and I think I'm finally going to do it. 

My family don't seem to see my chronic depression as "medical" and to be honest I don't really care. I have imposter syndrome so they're probably right. Anyway, I really want to end it but my boyfriend is sleeping in the other room and I don't want him to find me, any suggestions?

I feel like there's a shred of me that wants to live, that's why I'm posing this. But it's really caught up in the need to just finally have some peace.
