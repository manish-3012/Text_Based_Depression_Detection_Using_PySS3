36 days. Just a little over a month left. Itâ€™s surreal.I just canâ€™t drag myself out of the bed anymore. Itâ€™s all too much. Iâ€™ve loved someone for 4 years who wonâ€™t even talk to me anymore despite having a boyfriend who would give me the world if I asked for it. I have no friends left. Every time I tell myself that things will get better, they end up worse. I just need to decide how I want to spend this last bit of time.
