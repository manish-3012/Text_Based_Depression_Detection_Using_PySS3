I stupidly broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years. Now, I no longer wish to liveDear Reddit,

I've broken up with the love of my life about a month ago. During our 5 year relationship I mistreated her, and she had hope for me even at the end, but I fucked that up. 

Now she won't speak to me any longer...and i no longer interest in life outside of my church. I go through the motions of my day on the outside only because it's mandatory.

However, the silence on her end is killing me. I have OCD as well, and I cannot get her out of my mind. If I could hear something definitive from her, i could atleast move on one way or the other.

With that said, the pain and uncertainty is too much for me to function and I don't want to endure it any longer. I've been praying for god to take me early before I can return to the way I was before I met her. She has been my only motivation, and there is no one that truly gets this fact other than her.

I'm going to take my chances on the outside over the next few days, but I'm planning to end it before this week is out. 

There isn't anyone that I can share this with in my life without making them worry, and I don't want to be an extra burden. I could also reach my ex of 5 years, but I don't want her to feel guilty when she's happy now. 

All I want now is to disappear and no longer feel anything
