I only stay for my dogs and fianceÃ©I probably would have offed myself by now if it wasn't for my fianceÃ© or our dogs. I really have no drive anymore. 
I don't have friends and can't make any. I can't lose weight. I can't find a job despite just getting a degree. I just suck. I hate thinking about how torn up my fianceÃ© would be if I killed myself or how my dogs would be so confused and it's the only thing preventing me from doing it.
