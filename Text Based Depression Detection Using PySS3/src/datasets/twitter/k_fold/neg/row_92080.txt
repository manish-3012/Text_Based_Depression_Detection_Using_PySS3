I donâ€™t want to hurt the people around me but I donâ€™t want to be here anymoreI donâ€™t think I can do this anymore. I feel like something has finally broken in me thatâ€™d been holding on for a long time. I canâ€™t sleep so I watched The Little Prince and now I canâ€™t stop crying. I hadnâ€™t cried for a while but now I canâ€™t stop. The mother-daughter relationship fucking destroys me every time I watch it. Iâ€™ve been emotionally numb for the past few days, trying to fix everything and make everyone happy and I thought I could handle it. I donâ€™t think I can. I donâ€™t think I can do it anymore. I forgot to eat yesterday, or maybe I was just so nauseated from not eating that I didnâ€™t feel like it. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. 

I wish I could go back in time and steal 6 year old me away from this house, right before everything got really bad. I donâ€™t think parents know how much kids take in from them, you know? I think I could be a good parent to myself, but maybe thatâ€™s just the mental break talking. I learned to hate my body from my mother, constantly worried about her appearance. I learned that people judge you based on your appearance from my father commenting on peopleâ€™s bodies. Together they showed me that children are soldiers and ammo to be used carelessly during screaming matches. These are just a few examples of things my parents taught me without even realizing it that I wish I could reverse, more than anything. 

I wish I could go back and protect me from this fucked up world. My parents shouldnâ€™t have been parents. I almost resent them for having kids because not existing would be easier than living sometimes. Wow, ok I havenâ€™t felt this bad in a long time. I need to get out. I want to run away until my legs give out. I want to never come back here after Iâ€™m gone. I want to give myself a fucking chance at being happy. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do this. I feel so alone.
