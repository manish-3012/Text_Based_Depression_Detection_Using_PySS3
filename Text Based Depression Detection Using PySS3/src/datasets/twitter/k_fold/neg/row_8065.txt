I'm back where i started.Posted here two years ago when I was in a really dark place in my life. I thought things had gotten better but clearly since I'm posting back here again things are exactly the same.

No matter what I do in life I am always a failure in the eyes of my parents. I go to one of the top 40 universities in the world, I'm part of the largest events group at the university, I do alright in school, and I work hard at my passion which is film and photography.

However after all of these things I am doing things wrong. My parents think that I don't respond to them enough, even though I took my summer to fly back home and spend it with them. They say I am wasting my time with photography even though I think i am doing well for someone on instagram who recently started.

This is a ramble, im writing this in tears. I can't think straight. My parents want to kick me out and see how I'll fend for myself if i dont get my act together. I've thought a lot about suicide this past year. I know depression is a real thing, but so many people use it as a crutch that I feel no one takes it seriously, especially my family. I think that this pressure and criticism has severely affected every aspect of my life. So much so that I don't think it's worth living anymore. I started cutting myself last week.
