Still want to dieSuffered with narcolepsy for 2 years and a couple months. I suffered a lot in the last 2 years. So bad. I'm starting to now get better but all that suffering is not something i can just forget. I didn't deserve to go through that.  Not sure if i want to continue living even if i get fully healed. Feel like I owe it to myself to die.
