Need advice on my letterHow do I write it? I don't want anyone to think it's their fault. I don't want them to feel like they failed me, I dont want to hurt anyone. I'm going to be a father, and I just know I'll be terrible. I don't have the motivation to keep going in my own life, how am I supposed to show them the joy that life can offer? Nor can I afford this... life insurance will give them all that they need to get a good start in life.. I'm sure my girlfriend wont ever tell them anything about me, but how do I write this so that my child doesn't feel effected or to blame for this?
