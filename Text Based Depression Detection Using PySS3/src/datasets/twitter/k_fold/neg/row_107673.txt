why is dying so fucking difficultI truly hate being alive and every passing day is a reminder that I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I've tried to kill myself so many times that I've lost count but it never fucking works because all I can manage is to try to choke myself to death with scarves, belts, etc. I've wanted to die since I was 11, and I'm 18 now, and there isn't a single reason that I'm glad I didn't do it then. I wish I would've just done it because nothing will ever get better for me and i'm just a waste of space.
