Failed attempt, 6 weeks in hospital, ended up having ECT.Secretly I still donâ€™t want to be here. Despite my SO being fantastically awesome, anxiety is eating me alive and I feel like my kids (young adults) donâ€™t care even though my youngest (20 y o) swung into action when they found me.

I donâ€™t want to go back to hospital, the therapy sessions are repetitive now.

Big gaps in my memory, no recollection of going to things during my admission. Scared to go back to work because of not being able to remember things.

Did anyone recover from this?
