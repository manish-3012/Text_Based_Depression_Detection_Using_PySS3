Iâ€™m sorryI donâ€™t know where else to say this. Iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t the right forum. I doubt there really is one. But I wanted to say this somewhere before itâ€™s done. 

Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m not strong enough anymore. Iâ€™ve fought for twenty plus years. Iâ€™ve tried therapies, medicines, support groups, metaphysics, you name it and Iâ€™ve probably tried it. Things used to work. Iâ€™d have good days. I remember somewhat now what they used to feel like. Now, Iâ€™m lucky to have days where itâ€™s just numb. Itâ€™s not anyone elseâ€™s fault and Iâ€™m tired of being other peopleâ€™s problems. Iâ€™m just out of rope and donâ€™t want to keep pushing to just exist anymore. 

I know the lines... it gets better, itâ€™ll pass, itâ€™s the disease not who you are. But it doesnâ€™t help anymore. The though of suicide doesnâ€™t end the pain, it just passes it off to those left behind doesnâ€™t hold me in the same state of terror anymore. I donâ€™t want to hurt others by dying, but Iâ€™m already hurting them with the way Iâ€™m living. At this point, Iâ€™d rather be a dull ache in the back of their minds that crops up once and a while than the every day in their face pain I currently am. 

That being said, I do want to say I love you to my mom and pops. I love you to my wife April. To my sweet baby boy Elam, I love you so much buddy. I donâ€™t want you to grow up remembering me as this whimpering mess. Youâ€™re young enough right now, the memories of me will fade altogether soon enough. I hope your mommy can move on and find you a better da. I tried kiddo. I really tried. For you I pushed through all I could for as long as I could. I just ran out of road. Please donâ€™t hate me for it. 

I donâ€™t want pity. I donâ€™t want outreach or people trying to pull me back from anything. Thus why Iâ€™m sure this isnâ€™t the right place for this message, but I didnâ€™t know where else to say this. I just wanted to say Iâ€™m sorry and good bye. I just want to sleep now and never wake up again. Thank you for reading this if you did. Iâ€™m sorry if it hurts anyone.
