End of my ropeHi, Iâ€™m eighteen and I just wanna start off by saying I have diagnosed depression. Iâ€™ve been taking meds for months now and lately it feels like they arenâ€™t doing anything and Iâ€™ve felt like Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for a week now. Iâ€™ve attempted before, and Iâ€™ve done self harm a few times. Today I lost my only three friends, I got angry over something stupid at one of them and lashed out at the other two for it, now weâ€™re beyond the point of kissing and making up. 

When I first started my meds I kept telling myself that my life canâ€™t be given to anyone else now even if I donâ€™t think I deserve it and even if I want to throw it away, but as of late Iâ€™ve stopped caring about that. I feel so burnt out and so worthless that it doesnâ€™t matter to me anymore. Iâ€™ve also been stressed as hell for weeks, my brain is full of irrational thoughts and Iâ€™m constantly scared there are people going against me. Iâ€™ve been thinking things might just be easier if I slit both my arms open and let myself bleed out
