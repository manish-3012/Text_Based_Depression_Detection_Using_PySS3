Major Depressive Disorder, Paranoia, Anxiety, PTSD. I just want the pain to end. I canâ€™t handle the burnout anymore.I donâ€™t even know if I want help anymore. I feel nothing. I guess Iâ€™m just posting to see what people say but honestly. I just want this pain to end. Itâ€™s suffering everyday and the thoughts are making me go insane
