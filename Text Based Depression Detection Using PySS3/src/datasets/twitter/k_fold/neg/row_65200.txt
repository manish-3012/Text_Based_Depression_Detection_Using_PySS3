How long to breathe in carbon monoxide from tailpipe?Itâ€™s been a long journey and I know my time has come. I sat in front of the tailpipe breathing in the straight fumes twice today for 15 minutes each, not so much as a headache. plenty of nausea and plenty of weakness though. anyways, I attached the end of a sleeve to the pipe and breathed in the other end. does anyone know how long I need to devote to it to get it right, indefinitely?
