The endurement of painI'll keep it as a short as i can. Diagnosed ptsd/bipolar . Parents spent my college money before i could go. Mother of my child died seven years ago when she was 17. Her father and i went to court against her mother as they were divorced. We lost and now i'n 10k in debt and my kid lives in another state. Stuck at my parents work a dead end job. I'm only now  25 and life hasn't ever worked out for me.
