Every Day, i stop in this bridge and want to jump, 3 months and countingFirst of all, sorry for my english, im still Learning it. My ex left me debts, cheat me with another guy and destroyed my life, so i need to back to my grandparents home, when my grandparents and my father lives and is nearby to my mother's house. My friend say  that is a big step, i left this abusive toxic cunt and i need to start my New life but 3 months later, im here, in a bridge, thinking about all the shit i need to endure... My parents ( my Mother tried to kill me when i was a baby and beat me till nearly the dead cause she dont want me and my father is a alcoholic stupid that try to ruin my life everytime he can) are trying to re-enter my life and they are succeding, Just in time to ruin it all, and im start to think im going crazy, every time i fail in something, here they are ready to make my life more misserable, and im not sure how to deal with they. The Best part of all is that i found a nice girl that make me happy and she is pulling me out of this hole of sadness, so today, im not going to throw me from this bridge, Just see the sun set and back to home, ready to take another shitty Day. Maybe is a little Victory, but is the VÃ­ctory i got every day, when i stop in the middle of the bridge near my house.
