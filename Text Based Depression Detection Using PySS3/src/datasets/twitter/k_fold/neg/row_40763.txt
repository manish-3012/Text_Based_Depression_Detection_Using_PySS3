Life is so hardI recently got kicked out by the love of my life and am now  back to living with my dysfunctional family including a relative that abused me as a child. I'm stressed out everyday to the point that it makes my ulcers act up. I don't have insurance so I can't see a doctor until it's sorted out. I'm bipolar and trying to be strong during a mixed episode. My pet rats are with my (ex)?fiance and i have no idea if they're being cared for or safe. I can barely sleep from the pain, it wakes me up several times a night. I feel completely lost in life, I'm scared at the idea of losing this man that I care so much about.   
My family couldn't help me with my mental health even if they wanted to. I'm helping them with their debts and I have no idea if I'll have any resources left after. The fact that I most likely lost the love of my life over my mental illness hurts so much. I can barely force myself to eat, I feel nauseous all the time.   


I'm trying to stay strong until I can get insurance sorted out and get into a mental hospital but it feels like any sense of stability I had is slipping away. I lost so many of my friends and I feel so alone
