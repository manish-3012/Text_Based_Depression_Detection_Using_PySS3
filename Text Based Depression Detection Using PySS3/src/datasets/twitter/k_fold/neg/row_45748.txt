I've been toxic for too long...I used to think that people distanced from me... But instead, I was the one who distanced from them...

When I think about my past... I was so childish, so inmature, so clingy, so negative and so annoying that I understand why people didn't want to get close to me...

Being honest... When I think about my future, I'm afraid that I'll end up dying alone, old and broken in my home, maybe 60-70 years in the future, and no one will find me for a long while...

I don't know how to face some people, I don't know how to apologize, or if I should do so, I don't know how to start being another person...

I don't even know how to deal with a misdiagnosis, I don't know how to tell people that I don't have Asperger's when they think I have, and I'm not sure how to keep dealing with being treated like a child...

God, I lost a lot of things when I was depressed... And I don't know how to get them back or how to start moving on...

Without internet at home, it's really difficult to think about other stuff...

I wish I could be born again so I could fix all of those mistakes...
