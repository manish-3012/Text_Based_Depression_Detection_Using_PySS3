Nothing Going For MeIâ€™m 15, Male, a Sophomore, and I take extremely hard college level courses and honors courses. I do this to fill the time i have in between flaky asshole friends who care about Fortnite and thinking about a girl I love but canâ€™t go out with because sheâ€™s taken. I used to do Cross Country which was fun until I fractured my growth plate in my heel, and this is month 3 of being in a boot and week 1 of being in crutches because of a greedy ass coach who cared more about winning than my health. My brother had a child with his gf at 19and totaled 3 cars because he was a fucking psycho teenager and all my parents do is pay attention to them and my little brother, and then get mad when I stay in my room since I have nothing better to do than work on homework and hope that girl breaks up with that douchebag. I feel like I have nothing going for me. My life is boring, filled with homework and no friends, and on top of all this, weâ€™re moving out of state next year so Iâ€™ll have to say bye to my 2 best friends who I rarely see anymore (which is still hard). I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel a dark cloud over myself that I canâ€™t get rid of, and I keep thinking about how I can end it and maybe others will actually give enough of a shit to ask what my problems are and try to help.
