I'm out of control and feel pathetic. I have an eating disorder and I'm at the point where I'm considering suicide.Was considering doing a throw away, but yeah, no.

I am an 18yo girl. My name is Ellie. I have bipolar type II, social anxiety and have a food addiction/bulimia. Yeah a good cocktail of mental illnesses to fuck up your life.

Exactly a year ago, I was at the same place. I got hospitalized, diagnosed and felt great for the first time in three years. But here I am, back in the depth of my mental cage. Everybody is getting tired of my shit. "Why don't you answer my calls? Why do you hate me? Why aren't you trying more? Why are you taking medications if you still act like this? Why are you so sad for? " 

My brain is screaming at me things I wouldn't even say to my worst enemy. My body feels numb and my mind is racing. I'm completely isolated. The fact that I eat like crap on top of that doesn't help. I am pretty fit and being fat is literally my worst fear. I would rather die than being overweight. For a lot of people(like my parents, whom I live with) food is a good time. Comfort. Fun. Happy.

For me, it's a living hell. My house is filled with unhealthy food. I keep asking my parents not to buy it. Over and over again. But they do it. My demons are constantly surrounding me and I'm alone in this. I would rather live on the street than have to keep eating this shit. But I'm weak, my mind took over my life. I wanted to be so much more. I used to be pretty. I used to play music. 

I just regressed. I didn't wanted to go back to my starting point. I hate myself so much. I'm so full of hate. I don't want to have to attempt suicide only to go back to the hospital, but it's the only fucking way. I can't do this anymore.

Fuck.
