Tired of tryingI'm not great with people, I can't hold jobs, my family is abusive, I'm broke, and I'm currently living with my friends family. I'm a complete bum. Im tired of always messing up. There's not a day where I don't think about ending it all. I feel like a huge burden to everyone and that I just need to go. I don't feel happy with how my life has gone at all. I get jealous of others passing away from illnesses. Like why can't that be me instead of them? My brain feels like it's constantly foggy. I get sharp pains that shoot through my head all day. My nightmares won't stop. My sleep paralysis is the most violent its ever been. I wake up with my head trembling hard and full adrenaline going through me. I hear voices sometimes right before I wake up. Everything is becoming too much for me to handle. 

I want to die and just feel nothing.
