I just had a breakdown because my work called me waking to come back. Iâ€™m so weak and worthlessSuicide has been on my mind constantly even without working and now that I think about all the anxiety and effort I have to go through when I come back to work makes me think itâ€™s not worth it. Iâ€™M not worth it. All my Friends work sometimes even 12h a day. I have an ability to help my mom financially and Iâ€™m too scared to do it? What a worthless leach. Iâ€™m done being the problem. Iâ€™m done taking and not giving. Everyone has to work. Thatâ€™s life. Doesnâ€™t matter if it makes people stressed or tired or depressed. If I canâ€™t handle that then I canâ€™t handle life so I might as well fucking quit.
