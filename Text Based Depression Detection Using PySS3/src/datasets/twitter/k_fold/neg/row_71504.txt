I want to die, to make it easier for everyoneHi Guys,

I currently have a baby on the way but the mother has gotten back with her abusive husband. We had been seeing each other for 7 or so months, she was in the process of getting a divorce but has since stopped this. She was a raging alcoholic but I managed to help her get clean and dealt with all of the shit that came with it. She has been clean for just over a month now the baby is 8 weeks old. 

I don't know what to do I want to die to make it easier for them as he says that "he will look after the child if it was his own" he apparently has changed and won't hit her again. Which I hope is true but you never know. I don't want my child around that but I probably won't get too see my child as they want to play "happy family's". 

I feel like I have been used as a sperm bank, we had sex unprotected once stupid move I know. 
I am so heart broken and messed up in my head because I really fell for this girl and the only way out that I see for this pain is to end it all.
