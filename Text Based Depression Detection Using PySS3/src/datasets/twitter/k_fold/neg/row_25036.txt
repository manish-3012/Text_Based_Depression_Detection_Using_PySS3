Its crazy that when you think about it, no matter what changes in the world over all these years, one thing that always remains is sadnessI wrote a long post to let out my feelings but deleted it all, maybe just the writing of it let me know the stage ive hit in my life... So many of us are truly crushed inside and its horrible to know we are all struggling. I hope that whatever people are going through you all manage to find a glimpse of happiness in this fucked up world
