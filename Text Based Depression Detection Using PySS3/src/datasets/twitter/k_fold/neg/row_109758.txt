My Abuse StoryHi. I'm a sexual abuse survivor. I could post this in the sexual abuse thread but I feel more at home here. I've been trying to talk to Samaritans for the day but I've been too scared to talk there and my counsellor's not available and I need these words out.

I'm a sexual abuse survivor. I've been abused by three people in my life. I lost a lot of my memory with dissociation but they're beginning to come back now and I just need to get this shit out of my head. I was raped for the first time at age 13. It was November 5th 2010. I was at my friend's sisters birthday party. Parents had stepped out for a bit and we were having a blast and made quite a mess. We were meant to meet them at the firework display, just a two minute walk away, and we didn't really have time to clean up so I volunteered to stay back and meet them in a few minutes, after the room was presentable. They'd make up some excuse with our parents. Her brother offered to help and walk me down as it was pretty dark. So I was cleaning up and he raped me. I don't remember very much of the actual rape. I was very dissociated, but he took away my virginity. Memories feel like it happened to my twin sister. But I remember it being over in about 15 minutes. I remember going back to my friends and they asked me why I was caught up and I replied I needed the bathroom. I don't remember much more.

The second person was my mother's husband- I refuse to call him my step father. I don't remember anything about the actual events. Don't remember when exactly it started. But I do remember his constant stares, and sexual innuendo in everything we spoke about. I remember in his car I would sit in the back seat and he would reach back and pull on my legs or knees and try and pull me forward. I remember the rare events I sat next to him and I think his hand was more on my legs than the steering wheel. I remember his breath as he would forecfully kiss me. I can remember being 14 and fighting with him and him pushing me down to the ground and pinning me there. And I screamed loudly "Get off me". My mother was home so he got scared and stopped and left. It was the only time I remember verbally stopping him.

The clearest event to me was a month before my 16th birthday, my mother was ill at this time and was asleep. He came up to my room to check on me. I hate saying this as it's pretty embarrassing but I was masturbating and he caught me. Masturbation isn't really tolerated well in my family as they're pretty religious (or at least on the surface) and I begged him not to tell my mother. He asked me what i'd give him in return and I dissociated. Was completely paralyzed but I remember this whole event clearly. After he was done he lay on my bed for a while but then my mom woke up called him. He went onto the landing and my mother though in a very groggy state asked him what he was doing in front of my room. He said he was checking on me. He told her to come up. He went to the bathroom and and then went and had sex with my mother. Thin walls in my house, I heard them. It disgusts me so badly. I cannot describe it. I remember him coming out and having a shower and then she did after. My body was still full with his semen. I was beginning to calm down and went to the bathroom to clean up and I ended up having my periods. I remember being glad because I thought I couldn't get pregnant (I am still not sure if that is true). I was scared for the next few days and avoided him when possible. Knew he'd blackmail me, use me again or tell my mother. I always made sure my mother was always in the same room as us two. But my mom had to leave for a few minutes three days later. We were alone. And he tried to blackmail me. I wasn't on good terms with my mother at that point and she was very ill but I didn't want to do anything to him. So I told her, and I told her he raped me and she didn't believe me. She hit me a lot that day. Whipped me with wires and a metal coat hanger. It took her a few weeks before she started talking to me again. We avoided this subject. Two months later she asked me if I was lying. I told her I was telling the truth and she looked at me in disgust and told me to leave the room and that was the end of that.

The third person was a guy I was working for. It was my first job. I was kinda attracted to him. He was charismatic, skilled and very cunning. Looking back I see strong similarities between him and my mother's husband. This didn't get as far as sex. I was very in and out of dissociation during this, the same amounts that I still struggle with now. The sexual innuendo in his words was constant but I was attracted to him so I sometimes flirted back. May I add he was in his 40s and married and I was 17. I think I was just flattered by an older guys attention. He made me feel special. But he constantly touched me. My legs, my waist. My lips. In between my legs. Sometimes I looked away, sometimes I just looked in another direction. I only physically pulled away once and that was when he tried to take my shirt off. So I suppose he had some respect for my boundaries, but I think if I dissociated further or if I had stayed with him long enough he might have taken it further. I don't know if it legally counts as abuse or not. At least abuse of position and I can tell you I felt physically abused. I left after two weeks of working there. My excuse being it was too far.
Two of these guys are dead now. The first guy died this year, sudden death. The third died last year. He had cancer (don't know what specifically/ don't care).

So yeah that's my story. I'm kinda glad that's out. Feel relieved and a bit anxious that someone I know might read this. Gah. My paranoia is through the roof. 

I'm sorry for any typing errors, as you can imagine I don't want to read through this to check.

Edit: You know it's occurred to me I've had more experiences of sexual abuse then this. I've been groped on a few occasions, but I don't know. I don't count them as abuse. I'd forgotten about them, they don't have a lasting effect on me. I suppose it's mainly because they were strangers and mainly teenage guys who do stupid things and me being me, I freak out and run away. Lol at least this is a healthier reaction then freezing, so it's nice to know my body cares about me.

Edit 08/05/2016: I feel humiliated saying this but I was in a relationship with my mother's husband to begin with. I let him do some of the things to me. I wanted that attention from him and it felt good. But at the same time it felt guilty and wrong and I started fighting against him and he wouldn't take my refusal. I still can't remember where it started, but I can see why I suppressed this stuff. I remember some more stuff like him touching my lips and placing a hand at the side of my face. Not precise details for that year.. He's tried to get into a relationship with me again, but I've refused. I won't tolerate his shit again and he knows if he tries again now I won't hesitate getting police involvement.

Edit 16/05/16: I'm wrong on one account. I wasn't in a relationship to begin with. After his constant stares he made a move. I still don't remember the first time he raped me yet. But I do remember fighting against him- that must have been the third time. After inital shock wore off. And then I gave up. Then I got into a confusing relationship with him in which I reciprocated. It hurt less to reciprocate. I could just forget who he was and enjoy the moment. It didn't hurt. Was almost sweet, but the guilt that came with it was unbearable. Tried to fight and got hurt. In the end decided to just lay there. Let him get over and done with.
