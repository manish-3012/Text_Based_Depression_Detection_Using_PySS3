I guess I'm a bad friendWhen I manage to get even those who stuck with me to leave because I literally have no personality. My worst fear is being lonely and here I am, lying in my bed all day. All because I'm afraid of other people and have been for 2 years now. 

I'm not gonna survive this summer.
