Emotionally abusive motherMy mother has always been controlling over my life. I havenâ€™t been able to download apps on my phone in 3 years, havenâ€™t been allowed to party, or do anything. She always puts me down and never ask how I feel, well today she made me feel worse than ever. We normally get into fight, but she knows how much I love her and she uses that against me. She put words in my mouth and tonight, while she is sleeping, Iâ€™m going to sneak out and wait for the train, and walk in front of it. I know how it will affect her, but I just donâ€™t care anymore, she doesnâ€™t care about my feelings anymore.
