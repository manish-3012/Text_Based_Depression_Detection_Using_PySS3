Can't I live my own life and must I rely on families' support because I have schizophrenia, compulsory disorder, chronic and severe depression and personality disorder all are based on asperger?
That is I. I do suffer from all of these symptoms (according to my psychiatric doc's diagnostics)Besides I missed proper period of treatment. I barely started my first treatment from psychiatric professor after mental devastation caused by endless ijime (Sadly, there are no therapists in Korea. People still think psychology is very useless and waste of time. Besides, psychiatric doctors don't want therapists steal their jobs so they do not let parliament makes laws related to therapists) Entering University was waste of time. Relationship between I and my parents became terrible because I blamed my parents for this, thought they forced me to enter university. During two-year conscription period, I developed a deep misanthropy while dealing with convicts and morons fight for moneys or their origins...... If only I started treatment so early I haven't had to develop any complications like schizophrenia and chronic personality disorder. I could have actually overcome asperger but I think everything is too late. I cannot even concentrate to university lectures because almost nothing interests me. I still blame my parents because they were naive and they thought I was same as other boys and girls so they sorta abandoned me. Fear of test failure haunts me too since I study in university. Everything is expensive including tuition and I think I just waste my parents' precious money and I commit a sin against them. Even if I graduate university, I will not get a job because my symptoms are listed on my dossiers and employers can access them at anytime. Can't I live my own life? Were my parents really ignorant about my innate autism so did they really abandon me? Can I still get a job? Should I drop out univ for getting a job in more accepting/relaxing countries?
