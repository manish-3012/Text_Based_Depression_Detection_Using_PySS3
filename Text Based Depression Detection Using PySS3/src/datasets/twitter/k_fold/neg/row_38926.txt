17, ruined my life because of depression and anxiety.I'll make this short. For 5 years, I had no friends and no confidence. I had chances to make friends, but I sabotaged myself. I try to keep myself occupied with my daydreams, but it's not enough. People my own age are out actually having fun, and I'm making up imaginary lives inside my head. I often dream about childhood and still being with the friends I had back then, and I always wake up painfully, painfully depressed.
What's worse, I'm not sure if I'll be able to make friends again. I dropped out of school. I won't be going to uni, at least not for a while, so I don't even have that to look forward to.
What's even worse, is now knowing I had no good reason to hide myself away in my room and not try. I'm very good looking, always have been. Somewhat intelligent, and had a good personality before  I was embittered by all of this shit.
Honestly I want to hang myself.
