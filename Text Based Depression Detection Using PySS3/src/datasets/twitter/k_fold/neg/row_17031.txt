I have no reason to stay. Iâ€™m going to be gone by the end of this month.I donâ€™t know how to say it. But might as well try to get it out before Iâ€™m gone. 

Iâ€™ve been in a relationship with an amazing guy for about two years, but we broke up recently. He told me he didnâ€™t love me the way he used to anymore, and it was after I opened up to him about how suicidal I was. 

I had been practicing for an audition for a month and almost passed, but unforeseen circumstances and the cruel world betrayed me as usual and Iâ€™ve got nothing left. 

I have terrible grades. I am in the top class in my school, but I donâ€™t even know how I got in there because my scores are in the lower half of the class. All my classmates hate me, but I donâ€™t know what I did wrong. 

I had aspired to become a doctor, but I donâ€™t know what for. Everyone around me is so cruel that I canâ€™t bring myself to think Iâ€™ll have to save their lives in the future. Also, weâ€™re all going to die anyway; why try to make them live longer if the worldâ€™s such a hellhole?

I tried to kill myself on Tuesday. I wrote a suicide letter and drank a bunch of pills. I lay down in my bed, ready for death to welcome me in its arms. But I woke up. I cried because I couldnâ€™t do anything right â€” not even dying. 

I canâ€™t trust anyone anymore. Iâ€™m just a burden on everyone and I canâ€™t take it. 

I have no friends nor anyone that truly cares about me. I have no reason to stay.
