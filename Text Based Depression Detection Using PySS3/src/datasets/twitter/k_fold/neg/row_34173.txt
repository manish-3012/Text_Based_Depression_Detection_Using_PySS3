My time is coming soon.excuse me if my post doesnâ€™t make much sense. i canâ€™t seem to get many of the words i want to say out, wether thatâ€™s trying to speak or type something. 

ive decided that im going to end it within the next few weeks. iâ€™ve never been more adamant about it in my life and iâ€™ve felt this way on and off for years. 

i canâ€™t go outside without putting makeup on. otherwise i feel like everyoneâ€™s staring at how ugly i am, and thatâ€™s been going on for years. wether iâ€™m ugly or not to the world - my head has always told me the worst things. my social skills are just awful. i canâ€™t get the motivation or confidence to work because iâ€™m insecure and scared of absolutely everything. iâ€™m afraid of men due to PTSD and have been my whole life so it stops me with being a person to easily get along with, iâ€™m very awkward around a lot of males and theyâ€™ve got the impression iâ€™m stuck up or weird. my girlfriend is such a happy person and doesnâ€™t need me bringing her down anymore than i already do, i stop her from doing a lot of things, not intentionally but if i donâ€™t want to go out for a week for example, she wonâ€™t do anything she wants to do due to me. And itâ€™s sweet she wants to be there but i know my company isnâ€™t the most exciting. 

my relationships between my family and friends have gone downhill the past few years, they realise what kind of person i am, they donâ€™t want to be around me. i understand that completely - so i distance myself. i wonâ€™t make plans with people a lot because again just the thought of me stops me from doing a lot.

thereâ€™s a whole lot more to it but quite frankly i havenâ€™t got the motivation to type anything more out. i just wanted to get it off my chest as reddit is the only place i can admit to that iâ€™m going to end things very soon. thanks for reading this if you do xx
