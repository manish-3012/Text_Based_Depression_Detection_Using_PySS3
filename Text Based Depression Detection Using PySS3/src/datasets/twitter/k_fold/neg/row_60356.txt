Thoughts of suicide getting more real than I can handle.I'm a 30 year old student. I'm in a professional program, which means im specialized in a job after graduating. After we graduate we still need to land a job/paid training position to continue our training. 

However, I'm doing very poorly on the board exams that allows me to land These said paid training positions. These exams can only be taken once, and they are large factor to my application being denied. 

I've sacrificed so much in the last 4-5 years to get into this program, time studying for the board exams, time away from those I love, friends and xgfs I no longer talk to. Not to mention the sheer cost of the tuition is daunting. 

I found myself today alone drinking at the bar. My subconscious telling me I'm not worthy, I'm dumb, and unlovable. I'm having difficulty... No, actually I'm not able to see a pleasant future for myself. All I see is being alone because of my choice in career and not even having that career. Working my debt off in a job that won't even make a dent on my debt. 

I feel stuck. Ive been run down. I feel old and tired. I don't see the point. I've worked hard and I feel like I'm being punished for it. I wish someone would save me. But I that's not possible. I have no family, and I have no close friends. My thoughts scare me. I find myself looking at tall buildings. 

Thanks for letting me reach out.
