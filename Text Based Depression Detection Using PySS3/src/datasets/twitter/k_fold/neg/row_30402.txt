How do you talk to people? Who do you talk to?I'm in my early 30s. I don't have a lot of friends, I have a lot of coworkers and acquaintances, but nobody I'm close to on a personal level. Same goes for my family. They're around, but I don't talk about my feelings with them. Never have.

I'm not good at forming connections with people. I can't convince myself that ANYBODY gives a shit about me or what I'm going through, and it makes it difficult for me to open up to people.

I have a girlfriend, but she has her own problems and the last thing I want to do is saddle her with mine as well. I don't want to put that kind of pressure on her or on our relationship.

I've suffered from depression most of my life, but rarely has it been to the extreme that it has these past few weeks. I keep thinking that today will be the day it ends, and I get caught it the spirals of dark thoughts.

How do I talk to somebody? How do I find somebody who wants to help me?
