Can someone in the UK help this person?https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3dl8xe/i_need_help_i_think_i_just_watched_a_suicide/    The person at this reddit needs to contact 999 but the call won't go through from the US.  Maybe someone in the UK can call for them?  Or conference call?  Open to other ideas, thanks
