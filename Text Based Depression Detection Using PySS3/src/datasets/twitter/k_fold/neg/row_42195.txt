Yâ€™all, I am this ðŸ¤ðŸ¼ closeI canâ€™t hold a fucking job to save my life. Everything is falling apart. I canâ€™t get approved for Medicaid but I canâ€™t afford health insurance so thereâ€™s therapy and medication out the window. And if I break my arm, Iâ€™ll have to heal it myself I guess. My student loans are way over $28,000 even though I only went for three semesters and donâ€™t have a degree. Iâ€™m $5,000 in credit card debt. I have ADHD and anxiety and agoraphobia and depression and I canâ€™t treat any of it because Iâ€™m broke and Iâ€™m broke because I canâ€™t hold a job down because of my sick, sick brain. 

I am so close. So close. I have nothing. Iâ€™m so far in the hole and Iâ€™m not even 23. All the credit card companies keep calling me but I canâ€™t answer the phone because of my crippling anxiety. My bank account is -$360 and they keep calling me. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do about rent and food. None of these dead end jobs provide any sort of training so I canâ€™t hold onto them. 

Fuck. I just want it to be over already. Why wonâ€™t this nightmare end?
