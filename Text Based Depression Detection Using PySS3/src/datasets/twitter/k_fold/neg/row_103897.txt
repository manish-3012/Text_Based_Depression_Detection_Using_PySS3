YepI just don't care anymore.  I can't seem to find the motivation to continue.  My mom is crazy.  I got dumped by a girl who led me on for months and then went crazy.  I dont trust anyone and I can't let anyone get close. People constantly talk badly about others behind their back.  People who they pretend to be friends with.  How can you trust someone to be faithful and loyal?  I hear about tons of relationships where the girl or guy cheats.  I dont want to get hurt again.  I don't want to hurt someone else.  I'm terrible with people.  Making friends is next to impossible for me.  I'm not going to do anything.  But this grey twighlight where I'm not alive and I'm just not dead yet seems really stupid.
