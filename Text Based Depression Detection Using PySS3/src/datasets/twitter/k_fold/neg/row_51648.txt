Sexuality struggle. 5 years of mental tortureI'm 25 years old and male and ever since I turned 21 I had discovered all of these weird fetishes I had, on top of just being attracted to women. 

I've become almost addicted to crossdressing and cuckolding for sexual purposes only and have gotten into some strange types of porn, mostly humiliation, some with men involved. I can confidently say that men aren't attractive to me in almost any way. If it makes sense, what being the receiving partner signifies in my head is more of a turn on than anything else. Total emasculation.

For almost 5 years now I've watched as my life went don the drain. Anxiety levels are extremely high, I'm depressed, my car has been repossessed and I can barely keep a job. My stress levels are through the roof, and who I am sexually has much to do with this. My sexuality and the stress of that on my conscious runs through my mind almost 24 hours a day and it has brought me to the point of wanting to kill myself to get out of it.

On another note, I thought maybe if I told my family members that I'm a crossdresser, the stress on my mind would go away, since they are really the ones I fear finding out. My family members have accepted me with open arms. I feel that I'm just not able to accept this part of myself, and as a result I will be alone for the rest of my life. No woman wants a crossdressing, bisexual-leaning man, and I don't want to lie to her and be stuck in a crappy relationship cause I wasn't totally honest about myself with her.

Idk, my life just feels destroyed.
