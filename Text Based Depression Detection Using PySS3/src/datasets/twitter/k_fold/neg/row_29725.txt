Faceless nameless and joylessIf only you could look into my eyes 

Iâ€™ve been suicidal on average everyday for the past 3 and a half years, and Iâ€™m only 20.

This is the type of pain I can not share with my family.

These are the type of thoughts I canâ€™t talk about with my friends.

The words that I type will never be able to effectively communicate how I feel.

My best effort is that I feel like Iâ€™m in a black hole of sadness. Utter darkness. Utterly alone. 

Anything youâ€™re reading pales in comparison to what you would feel if we were alone in a room together. If only you could feel my presence.

If only you could give me a hug, and you could feel my barriers break down as my muscles relax.

If only you could take the weight off of my shoulders even for 5 minutes.

If only you could feel what it would be like, to be with me.

If only you could look into my eyes.
