My moods are up and down like crazy and right now is a huge â€œdownâ€ and I donâ€™t know what to do with myselfLately life has been so hectic and itâ€™s all coinciding with finals and Iâ€™m so overwhelmed. I donâ€™t have bipolar depression or anything, I am diagnosed with dysthymia/chronic depression so normally Iâ€™m in a constant low mood so this is VERY different for me and Iâ€™m afraid. 

Last night I was manic, up until 4 am meeting 3 different guy friends to try to have sex with. I almost got on a train and just left to somewhere, I had no plans on where. I was desperately trying to find adderall or coke. I eventually convinced myself to go home and I just woke up in one of the worst depressions Iâ€™ve ever been in, like it feels like someoneâ€™s sitting on my chest and I canâ€™t move. 

[i typed out a completely hypothetical â€œplanâ€ here but Iâ€™m afraid of someone finding my location and calling the police on me, itâ€™s happened before and scarred me for life]. I have absolutely no intentions to actually do it, honestly I donâ€™t have the energy or motivation to get up nor do I have the money. I know that having a plan like this is a one way ticket to the psych ward, I really donâ€™t want to go through with anything. But Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t want to get my school involved or go to the hospital because me or my family canâ€™t afford a hospital bill and I canâ€™t afford to fuck anything up with school, Iâ€™m on a very strict scholarship. 

Typing this all out made me feel better but Iâ€™m still terrified of facing life right now. The only person I could go to normally I canâ€™t right now due to weird circumstances, my other friends are at work or not available, and like I said I donâ€™t want to get school/authorities involved because I donâ€™t feel that I pose an actual threat to myself. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m toeing the line between â€œI â€œwantâ€ to kill myself but not reallyâ€ and â€œactively suicidalâ€. I donâ€™t think I could do it just because of my family, and I just honestly donâ€™t â€œwantâ€ to (but I feel it. Iâ€™m sure people on here can relate and I canâ€™t really articulate it). But I have a class in an hour and I didnâ€™t do the assignment and then I have 2 more classes and 6 assignments to work on on top of studying for finals and I have laundry and I have to make my bed but I canâ€™t even get up right now and I just need support. 

Iâ€™m sorry for the rambling wall of text. I donâ€™t even know if this is okay for this sub, Iâ€™m kinda just desperate to talk to anyone or even yell into the void of the internet right now. Please donâ€™t actually find me and call police. If I end up in a psych ward and my parents find out my life will be ruined, like seriously. My parents arenâ€™t ones to be forgiving for these things and Iâ€™d never be allowed to finish my degree or even leave the house for that matter.
