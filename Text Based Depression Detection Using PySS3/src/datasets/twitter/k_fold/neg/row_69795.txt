1 am..Its 12:50 as I type this. I cant do it. One thing after another. It sounds like every other post here but that's the only way i can put it. I can't go a day without being yelled at and even though I'm big and tall I can't talk back. It's just how I am. I feel so trapped. Ending my life is my only way to escape this hell hole. At 1 am I will officially kill myself. Goodbye. Good luck to everyone here.
