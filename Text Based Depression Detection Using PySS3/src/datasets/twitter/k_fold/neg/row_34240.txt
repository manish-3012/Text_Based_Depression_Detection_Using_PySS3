I'm tired of this bullshit. My life will never get better.I plan to kill myself soon. I don't really want to die but I don't know any other way to stop hurting. My narssistic mother pulled me out of school when I came out as trans. It's been over 2 years since I've talked to anyone even close to my age. I have lost almost all of my social skills so even if I try to move out, go to school, get a job, etc. I will have no idea how to interact with the real world. I have no car( I wasn't allowed to get my permit until I was 17) and no one in my family is willing to drive me to take my G.E.D so even if I wanted to move out I can't because most jobs require you to be finished with high school. This situation is never going to get better and I'm fucking tired of people telling me it will. I have no good reason to continue dealing with this bullshit. No one will miss me anyway all I do is take up space. Even when I am dead I'll just be a waste of a grave
