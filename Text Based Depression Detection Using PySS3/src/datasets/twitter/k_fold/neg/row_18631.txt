I Have No One, Unless I TellI hate everyone at the moment. I was planning to tell my brother that I might have anxiety, depression, or borderline personality disorder but I didn't. I stayed in my room until 2pm prepping for what I was going to say when I came down my brother said, 
"We thought you were all dead." My mother then said,
"We hoped you were dead." and so I walked up the stairs, and didn't come down. Now my family is turning off wifi (they know how to do it, those fucks. lmao im typing this on my computer that they haven't turned wifi off of yet) which is my only escape. They're forcing me to eat 3 meals a day (I'm trying to starve myself), get dressed, and do chores. They yell at me. Scream at me. Tell me how stupid I am. Tell me I have issues. Tell me that there's something wrong with me. My point is, I thought I could tell my family about how I'm feeling, but I know that if I do they'll either say "It's for attention" or "I'm so sorry" and that "I'm so sorry" will only because they feel bad. Not that they would care unless I told them. So I've been sitting in bed thinking of which medicines I could take to overdose. Theres this acne meds I have to take, and they sometimes make me barf. So I'm thinking if I take all of them at once, will they corrode my stomach and make me die?
