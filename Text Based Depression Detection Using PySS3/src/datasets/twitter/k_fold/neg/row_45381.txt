My memories are killing meI started therapy months ago to deal with trauma of being raped multiple times, beginning age 5.
For the past three weeks or so every time i sleep, I dream about being raped as a child. I see him, smell him, feel the pain, and I wake up crying sucking my thumb.
I have Xanax and tomorrow Iâ€™m going to take a lot, so Iâ€™m out of it, then hang myself.
