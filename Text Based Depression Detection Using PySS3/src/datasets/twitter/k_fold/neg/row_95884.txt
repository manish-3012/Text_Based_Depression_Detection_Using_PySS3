My friend is probably going to commit suicide within the year. I need advice.I was hanging out with my friend last night and we were doing one of those â€œsecret exchangeâ€ things. I told her that I had attempted suicide two years back, woke up in the hospital, realized how silly I was, and then lived (mostly) happily ever after. She then revealed that she had attempted suicide three different times over winter break.

A little background. My friend is clinically depressed, and has been in therapy for over three years. She was molested as a child and despises her family. Sheâ€™s overweight, has self-esteem issues, and did webcam work for a BBW site for the past two summers.

She seems rather dead-set of suicide, and said that sheâ€™s probably going to go through with it within the year. She doesnâ€™t think suicide is selfish, nor does she feel the need to stick around for any of her loved ones/friends. She brushed off everything I said to try and talk her out of it.

Advice?
