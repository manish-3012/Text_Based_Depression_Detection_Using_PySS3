Trying to sleep at a conventionI've been feeling like shit for a long while now, and it's only getting worse. At a convention right now trying to sleep, but I just can't.

The last few weeks I've been planning on ending it all on monday, and it's getting closer. I'll be going back home, alone, for an apointment at the doctor's office (specialist on depression and all that shit). My friend will not be home, so I'll be alone. Perfect time to do it, no one will be there to stop me.

I just don't know how to face my doctor, because he always ask if I have any plans regarding suicide. I'm worried that I wont be able to lie good enough to make him let me leave.

Seriously don't even know why I'm posting this. Guess I just need to get it off my chest or something really. I'm just rambling, fucking stupid idiot. I'll stop now.
