Becoming increasingly ill.My physical and mental health are on the decline. Can't get any answers from the doctors except to "keep waiting". I don't know if I can keep waiting. I'm having terrifying visible and painful symptoms of being ill, but none of it is helping a doctor to diagnose me, if anything it just confuses them further. I've lost my job, bills are piling up, I'm going hungry a lot, I don't have weather appropriate clothes, my phone just quit working once and for all, I can't pay my bills, I can't afford to go to my follow up, I'm passing out almost every day and I think I hit my head yesterday and now my whole scalp and part of my neck is numb.
