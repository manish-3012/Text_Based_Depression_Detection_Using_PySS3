I slowly become happy of suicide.I have depression, but i supress it with gym and other stuff. Thoughts of suicide never left me, now i kinda think about it like good thing that will happen :(. Other day i thought about getting shirt : just hanging. and hang myself, it seemed like cool and fun idea to do. I dont think its healthy way to live, yet i seem happy. When im truly happy i forget about suicide tho.
