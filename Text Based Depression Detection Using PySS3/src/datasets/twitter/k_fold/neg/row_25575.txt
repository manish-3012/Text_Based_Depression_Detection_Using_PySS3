The end of the absurd manI have lived my life for almost 30 years. Died once already when I was young. It lead me to realize the meaning of life, nothing. This for a few years drove me insane. My only solace was in philosophy. Though much research I found meaning in a meaningless world. But, all good things must end I suppose. I sit here watching the sunrise thinking about everything. I'm not depressed, or mad. I just know the ending to a movie, and I slowly watch as more people leave the theater, knowing its about time for me to leave too. And I'm just not sure if I should keep being the absurd man(see Absurdism). I've tried to find meaning in love but it slowly become a chess match, of which I usely know her next move and it becomes a bore. I end up destroying the relationship to just she if I know her as well as I think I do. spoiler I do, every time. I've tried nonprofit jobs/volunteering, and I slowly build in rage due to others incompetence. Not from the lack of knowledge, but from the acceptance of their stupidity, and lack of willingness to learn and adapt. I even tried to meaning in helping people on this very reddit and self harm, but I am slowing realizing that maybe its not the right thing to do. What if letting them die was the right thing, letting their death drive take them. I've stared into the void for so long that I think I'm falling into it.
I'm not sure when I might do it, but I can feel it calling me and as I sit here watching the sun rise, I know it will be soon.
