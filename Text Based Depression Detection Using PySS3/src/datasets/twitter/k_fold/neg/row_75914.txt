I'm scaring myself.I really thought I was feeling better. The beginning of the year wasn't absolute shit. I talked to people and felt comfortable with myself for once. Then I could feel the decline in March. The subtle lurking of hollowness beginning to grow again. I pushed through April simply by pretending it was normal. May was a slap in the face to all of the progress I made, I couldn't stop thinking about how things would be so much more easier if I'd just off myself. June is doing me in and I think July is finally gonna finish me off.   


I'd gone to get help myself a while back. On my own, I thought I'd be able to push myself to get 'cured.' Then I realized how much of a pussy I am even in the face of a therapist whose literal job is to help me. I couldn't open up. All I kept saying was "I don't know," for fucks sake, I knew. I knew exactly why I'm so fucking sick, why the slightest things paralyze me, why I can't talk to people, why struggle to get close- I knew the reasons behind of all it. It's because I'm a dumbass, there's no one else to blame even if I try to desperately find some other option besides myself.   


At this point, the slightest thing inspires suicidal fantasies. Whenever I panic or make a mistake, or sometimes nothing will be wrong at all, I'll get paralyzed with this chest-tightening fear and the only thing that calms me down is my idealizations of offing myself. In the past I could've seen me dragging myself out of all this. I can't anymore. All I can think about is the enticing relief that comes with suicide.    


Whenever I get over these moods, I can't help but beat myself about it. I tried ending myself before but it didn't pull through. I know the next time I do it there won't be a fail-safe.
