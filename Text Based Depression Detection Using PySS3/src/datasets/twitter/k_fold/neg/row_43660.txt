I keep making plans for the future i know iâ€™m not going to be there for and i feel terrible about itIâ€™m killing myself by my 19th birthday but iâ€™ve been making plans to travel with my only friend knowing that iâ€™m not going to be alive to actually do them. I feel so bad about it but she seems so excited and i donâ€™t want to be all depressed while sheâ€™s planning her future with me. I cant tell her that iâ€™m committing suicide but i donâ€™t want to ruin her plans by her relating said plans to me after i die. i figure iâ€™m just gonna tell her soon that i wonâ€™t have the money or something along those lines.
