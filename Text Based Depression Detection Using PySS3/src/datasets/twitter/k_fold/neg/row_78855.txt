What to doEscaped my Muslim home and country

Survived for 1 year now without a job

Struggled not to be kicked back home when i don't even speak the language of the country hosting me

I tried getting a stable job and flat in methods better left to imagination

I have been completely alone

I Have been my best and only friend

The authorities is about to deport me 

I got no money at all 


I am staying with a flat mate to whom i am supposed to pay rent 

For my own dignity i want to die and i hate to give up so much but even this is difficult.
