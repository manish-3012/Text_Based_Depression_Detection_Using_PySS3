I was the abuser.I never learned to love properly. I feel love more intensely than any other feeling in the world. But I never knew how to express it. I felt as if the efforts I made to give us a better future were a show of love, but those efforts made me tired, depressed, angry, loud, and sometimes hurtful. Just a product of my upbringing I suppose. I was asked to get help  but I was scared and didn't know how. Little did I know seeking help then would be the show of love to make all the difference. But that hurt and neglect built up, and I never knew until it was too late what it had done. 

I had exactly what I had dreamed of in a significant other. He isn't perfect but I never wanted perfect. I wanted him then, and still do now. And it took a nuke, but I worked hard to change to try to make up for what I put him through. I chose to break the cycle. I changed my goals, and I learned to want for so much less, so long as we could share in it. But... the cycle broke me after all. Things are so intertwined at this point that once he unravels it,  that's it for me. I won't risk emotionally abusing someone else, being so physically neglectful that sex is conceptually absurd. I won't be forgiving myself and I don't know how long I can live with it. I don't have a plan, I just know the world's better off with one less asshole.
