I'm just confusedI don't know what else I can do in my life, I've posted on this subreddit in my own concern more than I ever thought I would in a lifetime within the past month, I so badly want for it to be done, there's nothing that motivates me and anything positive is either momentary when I'm looking at a meme or after hearing a joke, or faked for the sake of those around me, I have multiple people close to me that I'd say are mildly at risk to kill themselves just because of shitty circumstances and I don't want to push them by jumping myself. I don't know what's right to do, I'm mentally broken and battered, from what I can tell far beyond repair, but leaving leaves multiple peoples lives and psyche up in the air. I want to make life easy as it can be for a select few people in my life, and I'm just floating along being useless for months now
