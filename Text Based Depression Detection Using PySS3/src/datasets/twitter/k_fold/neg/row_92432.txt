Having a very rough time.Lately Iâ€™ve been having the urge to just take all of my pills for depression and anxiety. I keep having this idea that maybe if I take them all Iâ€™ll feel better because just taking once a day doesnâ€™t seem to be helping much anymore. Plus if I die from it that would be so bad either. When Iâ€™m not feeling empty I feel so alone and lonely so maybe trying a few more pills wouldnâ€™t hurt maybe. 

I just really wanted to get this off of my chest.
