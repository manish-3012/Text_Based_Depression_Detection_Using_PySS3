What things do you think you should do or loose ends you feel you should tie, to give yourself closure before you catch the bus?I'm at a point this point where I've accepted that I'm going to kill myself, but don't feel as if I'm ready to leave just yet. I feel as if I need to get my affairs in order and tie some loose ends in order to make it as "easy" and least painful for myself and more importantly, others around me. What do you think should be done before one decides to clock out and take their life?

I'm thinking of packing my stuff up, cleaning my house, getting rid of anything I don't need, etc. The one thing that breaks my heart beside leaving my family is leaving my cats behind. I am the only one that looks after them and I don't know what my family will decide to do with them when I'm dead. 

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should do to give myself and others as much closure as possible and make this as "painless" as possible for all parties involved?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
