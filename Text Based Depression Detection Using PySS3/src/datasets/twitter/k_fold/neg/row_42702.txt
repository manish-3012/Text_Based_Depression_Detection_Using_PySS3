Tomorrow I am going to get COVIDMy dad has COVID. Tomorrow Iâ€™m going to sneak down to his quarantine room and put on his mask and try to generally expose myself to as much of his contaminated stuff as possible. Wish me luck. I bet I still wonâ€™t get it though. If I do, Iâ€™m just going to drink and smoke a ton (I donâ€™t smoke) and generally just try to do everything that makes COVID worse. 

I understand how this might seem like a selfish decision because I could infect other people, but I get tested every three days. Iâ€™m so desperate. I hope this works.
