tonight is the night i will kill myselfiâ€™ve been here a lot and iâ€™ve made a lot of posts about how iâ€™m going to kill myself

tonight is truly the night, i have texted my suicide (note/text) to my boyfriend and a text to dish out to my grandma i donâ€™t want to scare her tonight. i have no other choice, truly. my boyfriend cheated on me, (months ago) i see the cycle of the women in my family repeating, it scares me.

thats not why iâ€™m killing myself, thats just the straw that broke the camels back (or however you say it). this was a thought out situation for years to come. tonight is the night. i pray i will wake up tomorrow morning in jesusâ€™ arms. thats all i ever wanted, unconditional love. this is the only way to get it, i wont repeat a cycle, i wont be a sad old woman. i will die young

i hope i will see the rest of you with me in heaven when your time comes and you all lives amazing cycle breaking lives. im so sorry anyone else feels this way. its horrible. i love all of you so much
