Redditors, I need your immediate inputIve been off/on suicidal for years. I just couldnt bring myself  to do it because I always had hope. That hope is gone now. I guess id like to know if any of you have similar situations pushing you to the brink. Ill start.....

Cons:
Massive amounts of debt... currently 4 months behind on car note, student loans etc

Child support has been kicking my ass. I see my child very infrequently. Id like to more but I live an hour away and his mother uncooperative. 

Make decent money, but between student loans, child support, medical payments, rent. Im behind every month. I dont have car insurance because I cant afford it.

Unsupportive family

No friends

Had gf. We broke up. Shes dating... im not

Legal trouble. Judge threatening six months jail for driving on suspended license from 2008. Had an attorney who basically did jack shit. Have a warrant in another county for open container and throwing a cigarette out the window. 

Just got over kidney cancer.

Tall, handsome,  decent amount of trade skills and certifications for decent career. Love working out and fitness. Associates degree. Honorable discharge from military.
