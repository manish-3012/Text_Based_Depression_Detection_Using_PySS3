The thought of dying bis becoming more appealingThis is actually my first Reddit post I've been a long time lurker. I'm not sure what I'm trying to get out of this post, probably for someone just to hear me out.

I've lost all hope, things have been getting really bad recently. Today I overheard somone talking about heart attacks and thought I seriously wouldn't mind having one. I think of a way out at least a few times a day it's just getting ridiculous im just not scared of death anymore.

Life is just a dark tunnel with no end in sight. I've suffered for so long now I miss having a normal happy Life like everyone else. I've forgotten what happines feels like. I had to go to the toilets at work the other day just to cry. I'm just so so and tired of living day by day.

Sorry if this post seems a bit scattered I can't think straight right now

Edit: Just noticed the typo in the title fml
