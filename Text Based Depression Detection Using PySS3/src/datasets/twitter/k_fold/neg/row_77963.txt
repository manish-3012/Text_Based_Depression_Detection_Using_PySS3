It's funny that the last time that I made a passive suicidal ideation, the local fire department kicked in the door to my building, 2 cops, 8 paramedics banged on my door while I was asleep, asked me if I was going to kill myself, and I went back to sleep.But, you're not here to call anyone this time.
