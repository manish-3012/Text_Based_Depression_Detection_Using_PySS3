I'm going to kill myselfI hate this world. I don't know why anyone would want to live in this world. I get treated like crap because of who I am. I don't know what it's like to be treated with respect, nor will I ever. People think I don't deserve respect because of who I am. I can't get what I want because of who I am. It's all about who you are in this world. This world just isn't made for people like me. The world is one big high school. The assholes always win. Not social outcasts like me.
