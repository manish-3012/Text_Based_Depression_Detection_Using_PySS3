17 and permanently alone.I hate it. I hate almost every second of my life. Yeah, maybe I'm happy sometimes. But I'm so miserable 99 percent of the time. It's not worth it, I already know I have no future. Nobody loves me and nobody ever will and I don't blame them. I'm a useless piece of shit. 

Every fucking second of my life I'm expected to work and obey every command and be a perfect child. My parents won't even let me have a free period at school and I'm so stressed I'm known among my friends for pulling out my own hair as a stress habit. My parents don't see it though and I'm going crazy. I can't work 24/7 but they expect me to always be doing homework and never relax with my friends or play games or anything. Every fucking second is work.

And when I'm not working I'm belittled every moment for some shit I can't even control. I heard my mom talking the other day about how kids aren't old enough to know their sexual orientation. She knows I'm bisexual and knew I was listening, it feels like a personal attack. I'm 17, I'm expected to decide what college I'm going to but I can't decide that I like other guys? It's not just that. She attacks my sisters for every tiny mistake they make and attacks me if I try to defend them. I love my sisters but I can't do anything to protect them. 

I just hate it. Being yelled at every moment of my life. I know how many people hate me. I truly believe that if I die it will do more good than harm.
