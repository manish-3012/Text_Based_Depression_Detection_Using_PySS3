I'm so confused latelyI'm struggling with bipolar disorder and recovering from drug and sex addiction. I don't even know how I feel right now. Im so confused. Sometimes everything feels great and it feels like my meds are working and I'm getting better but then sometimes that all goes out the window and I feel like I'm back at square one. I get so stressed out just thinking about things that I don't even know how I feel. I just got out of a mental hospital after 6 days on monday for suicidal thoughts. I'm in a program working on my addiction issues as well bipolar and suicidality for the next few months and when I get out of it I have to go back to my home state to deal with legal issues I ran away from while I was in my addiction. I feel like I have so much shit on my plate to deal with and I dont even know how to feel. I feel like I'm a bunch of broken parts glued together with one of them always not functioning whether it's drug addiction sex addiction anxiety bipolar or suicidality and I rarely feel like I get a day to myself to just enjoy life. I just got out of the hospital for feeling suicidal and now here I am feeling suicidal again. I'm having a really depressive episode today and I feel like it's going to last a few more days because it always does. It's so exhausting going back and forth between different issues always having to deal with something.
