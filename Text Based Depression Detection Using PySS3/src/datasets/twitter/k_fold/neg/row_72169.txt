I decided to make the above diagram to better illustrate why I think I have suicidal thoughts.  The positive and negative signs represent good and bad feelings about life, and the horizontal axis is the course of a life through time.

I can't seem to handle the roller coaster effect seen in the first part of my figure.  I just want to make things simpler.
