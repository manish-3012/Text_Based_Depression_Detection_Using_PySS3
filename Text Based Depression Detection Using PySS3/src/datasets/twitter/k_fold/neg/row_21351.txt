"/i've felt depressed for years and it comes and goes in waves but each wave keeps getting worse and worse and closer together. i'm having less full days of happiness or content and more where my mind is just cramped with how to commit. all the reasons in the past that made me not make a plan are gone. i'm graduating soon with no plans and i know i'm gonna lose the one person who makes me so happy. i don't know how to handle it all anymore. i don't know what to do when i graduate and have nothing left. i used to always see my future of getting married with kids but i couldn't picture college or that in between and now i'm in college and i can't picture life beyond it. i dont want to make it another day.
