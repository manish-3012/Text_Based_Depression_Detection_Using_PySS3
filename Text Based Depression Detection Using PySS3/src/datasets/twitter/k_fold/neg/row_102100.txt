I'm failing out of university and I'm gonna be a waste of money.I am, for the first time, seriously thinking of killing myself. I lied about my classes because I was on my last chance to pass, and I failed, and that means I will be kicked out of my career. I've been in university since 2014 - it's all been a waste of money from my dad. I should be done next year but I did so bad that even if I hadn't failed it would take me about three more years to finish; maybe more. 

I really just want to end it. I'm a disappointment and a waste. I'm only alive because I don't wanna hurt my mom but at this point it just might be better for her and for everyone if I kill myself. 

I hope that it happens quickly and painlessly.
