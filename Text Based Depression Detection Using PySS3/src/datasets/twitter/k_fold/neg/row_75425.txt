Why can't I just bone a cute cosplayer?Why do I have to watch myself grow older when my taste in women won't catch up? Each moment I go without the embrace, I grow more fearful. Fearful that I'll be a creep. Fearful that I'll get rejected. Fearful that I'll accidentally hit on someone underage and go to jail.

Can I at least be cured of the fear of failure? Can I at least figure out how to get a hookup at Fanime?
