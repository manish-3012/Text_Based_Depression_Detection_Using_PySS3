I made this account the day I was going to kill myselfI feel so worthless and pathetic I know not to compare your problems to others but itâ€™s just the way I think, Iâ€™d write my problems like everyone else but hate sob storyâ€™s when itâ€™s mine 

I already tried I failed I thought it was a blessing itâ€™s a curse more like it I just constantly think of trying again but canâ€™t man up to I cut up my wrists too I have scars as constant reminders

Itâ€™s so hard to get motivation rock bottom is supposed to have the only way up but itâ€™s incredibly fucking hard to change when u can stay there indefinitely
