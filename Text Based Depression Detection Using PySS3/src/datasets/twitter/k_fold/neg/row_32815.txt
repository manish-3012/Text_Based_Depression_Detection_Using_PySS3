So fucking sick of myselfI keep throwing away chances for the things I want out of cowardice._x000D_

I keep having these private episodes of absolute rage where I basically scream silently but uncontrollably and hyperventilate for ten to twenty minutes or so.  I was doing it so hard my lungs ached all yesterday.  I feel like I'm about to have a psychotic break or something.  I've been thinking about killing myself.  What keeps me from it is reminding myself over and over how much doing it would hurt the people that care about me (all five or six of them)._x000D_

I can't talk to anyone.  I've always been shy but it just keeps getting worse and worse to the point where I can't even chit chat at work with people.  It's just a total brainlock about even the simplest things.  I basically don't look at or talk to anyone anymore unless it's absolutely necessary._x000D_

Relationships are out of the question.  I've was trying the okcupid thing but I keep running away from any chance I get.  The last one... she started a friendly conversation and we seemed to match really well.  She's smart, gutsy, and a truly good person.  We shared a lot of the same opinions about things.  Both liberal, both pro-feminist.  Then suddenly I just couldn't talk to her anymore.  I vanished with no explanation and didn't come back to okcupid for over a month.  Then I basically edited my profile and answered a test in such a way as to make me look like a bad person.  I don't know if I was just chasing her away or trying to hurt her for being nice to trash like me.  In any case, whether she saw any of that or not, she quit okcupid, deleted her account totally._x000D_

I'd like to apologize but I have no idea of how to contact her.  But I probably shouldn't bother her anymore._x000D_

I say I'm liberal and support charity and feminism but I lack the courage of my convictions.  I too quiet to actually speak up about anything and, as most charity involves interacting with people, I shy away.  I did volunteer to do Habitat for Humanity with my dad.  We'll see if I actually go through with it._x000D_

I want to be a writer (you'll forgive the disjointed nature of this, I'm sure) but I don't have the guts to publish anything even if I did have the discipline to finish anything.  A zillion started projects, two finished.  Two, after doing it for over ten years._x000D_

I don't know what to do with myself anymore.  I want to go to college, I want to get published, I want to get a life but I never do anything significant.  Just the endless lull of my deadend job and an empty house to come back to at night.  I'm so fucking lonely I can't take it.  But Darfur war orphans and beaten housewives, right?  Suck it up, spoiled american male.  You don't even know the meaning of pain, you whiny prick._x000D_
