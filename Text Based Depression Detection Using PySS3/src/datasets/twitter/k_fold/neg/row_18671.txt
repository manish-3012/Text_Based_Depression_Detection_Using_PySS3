Starting to not care about myself at allIsolated at home in a mostly shitty village, have Asperger's Syndrome and I'm not very good with communication. My girlfriend of 4 years, who I was planning to propose, broke up with me a few days ago. Now all I have that cares about me is my mother. I just want to end it all, the pain and suffering of existing, the struggle with everything, isolation, communication, failing. I don't know what to do to help myself get out of this, because I don't want my mother to be devastated by what I may do.
