No more will to go onI'm 31, not sure what my gender really is anymore or if it really makes that much difference (started transition 4.5 years ago now I feel really unsupported) I had control of my finances taken away from me on Monday, and I have only eaten hospital sandwiches since then I believe to eat, I have been to the ER 3 times this week, idk I feel pretty meh about carrying on with life now. I tried twice this week and failed both times I feel like an idiot... I just want a hug right now, I wish I was close to someone
