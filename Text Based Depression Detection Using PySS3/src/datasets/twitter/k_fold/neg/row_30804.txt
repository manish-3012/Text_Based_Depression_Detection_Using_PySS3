So this is itIt is happening tonight. This time I've made sure it is going to work. Kinda funny the last thing I am doing is posting a pointless anonymous whiny post that nobody will ever read or remember. 

I've never been so certain in anything in my pointless small life. There is no other solution because I just can't, I can't, I really can't stop the pain. This is ending tonight. A logical ending to someone that wasn't intended to be here from the very beginning and failed to deserve caring from a single person in their life. Who failed everything. Because I am a boring joke that nobody even wants to hear. 

At least it's over. I'm going to hug my cat and start now. 

Please don't be mean in comments. I'm not going to read them anyway. 

Well, at least I made it funny in the end. Hahaha.
