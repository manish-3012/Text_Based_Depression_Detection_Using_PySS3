Finding this living thing to not be so greatI really don't know what to do with myself or my life. I feel like I've exhausted my potential and focused on all the wrong things. As a result:

* I'm socially awkward. I can't have a real friendship with anyone. I wonder if there's something off about my body language of facial expressions. Even my own family doesn't seem to like me. You can imagine how well this goes over when talking to women or going on dates. I spend most of my time alone just surfing the Internet. The worst part is, despite all the advice I read, I have no idea how to implement it since it seems like my personality is beyond my control.

* I haven't spoken with the only real friends I've had since I was 14 (I met them near the end of college) in two years.

* I have literally no talents. Alright, I can cook pretty well with a recipe in front of me and I know a little Japanese, but beyond that, I have nothing. Since I have no real skills, I can't get a job beyond minimum wage work (despite going to college) or have something cool to show other people.

* I have nearly zero experience in life beyond studying in Japan for a semester in college. And I burn through those stories quickly and sound like a huge weeaboo if I talk about them too much. As a result, I usually have nothing interesting to talk about.

* I live at home and don't have a car. As a result, it's hard going anywhere to meet people. There is a bar near my home and the staff is friendly with me, but beyond that, it's still really hard starting conversations with people.

* I have no idea what to do with my life. Most days, I'm working at my cashier job or laying in bed surfing the Internet. I do go to the gym and jog almost everyday of the week, though (I rest on Sunday). On top of that, my student loans are piling up. I really hate to see my acrued interest right now. I just don't know what to do. I hate the idea of being committed to something for the rest of my life. But even if I had an idea what to do, see the section above about me not having any skills.

I just don't see the point in life. It seems everyone wants to work 9 to 5, get married, and have kids, but none of that appeals to me. I want to be free to go wherever I want; do whatever I want; fuck whoever I want to fuck. I don't want to be chained down by anything.

But that's the problem with this world; it wants you to be committed to something. It seems like the only way to be free is to completely ignore the law and fuck people over, and I don't want to do that. So, at this point, it seems like suicide is the best option.

I just hate the person I've become and how it's the exact opposite of anything I wanted to be. And how any effort I take to change it will take years. Why couldn't I have had the realizations I'm having now when I was younger? I could have actually had a life in high school and college, and worked harder to have a better future after I graduated.

I'm hoping you guys can pull through for me. I'm at the point where very little in life gives me any real joy. I've posted here before and haven't been too impressed with the commentary. Hopefully, this time around, there's something.

But I'm already pretty committed to dying at this point, so I don't know what anyone can say to change my outlook.
