My life is pointlessIâ€™m currently studying for exams in January but no matter how hard I try I still feel so stupid. My life is not going anywhere, Iâ€™m not going to find love, Iâ€™m not going to be able to finish school and I have no money and everyday I just wish to die. My parents are abusive assholes but I canâ€™t leave, they pay for my school but I just feel that Iâ€™m wasting everyoneâ€™s time and money . I wanted to ran away and never look back but I know thatâ€™s going to be even worse, being homeless is one thing but being homeless in South Africa is a different story. I see â€œsuccessâ€ stories of many people and I just think WHY THE FUCK IS LIFE WORKING OUT FOR THEM. Everyone can give me that same bullshit speech â€œ itâ€™s all hard workâ€ yes but you need luck, you can work all your life but someone needs to open the doors for you . My grandmother keeps praying that Iâ€™ll make it in life, Iâ€™m sorry ma but nothing is working. I canâ€™t eat, canâ€™t sleep, I canâ€™t do this anymore .I just want to leave this earth, I really do hope heaven is real so I can live in peace, I canâ€™t see my future, I just got a bunch of codeine pills and locked them away so if the day comes I know I have a way out. I plan to do it on my 21st birthday but if get a sign that everything is going to be fine I really hope it finds me soon
