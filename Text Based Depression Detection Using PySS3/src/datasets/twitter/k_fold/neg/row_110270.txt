Iâ€™ll never find my person and watching everyone around me find theirs is painfulI want a best friend who canâ€™t wait to tell me good news. A SO who canâ€™t wait to come home and spend time with me. Itâ€™ll never happen. Not everyone has a person and Iâ€™m one of those people. I wish it wasnâ€™t so heartbreaking to see everyone around me enjoy life or at least not hate it to the point of suicidal ideation. A decade is a long time to be depressed and at this point it wonâ€™t change. Itâ€™s really shitty to spend my one life being me
