4am here and I feel like killing myselfSomeday I am going to kill myself. Without telling anyone. Without informing anyone. I am not a depressed person. I don't have these thoughts very often. But some days are hard. Very very hard. I cannot seem to get a hold of my life. Everything is just so messed up and I do not even know why. It feels suffocating. I feel like choking myself. I don't know what am I writing. I don't even know why am I writing this. But I hope to get some burden off my chest. Or maybe I need to get some burden off my chest. I do not know. I feel like I am getting crushed by this huge weight on me. I want to cry. I want to cry my heart out. But I have got no tears. I scream and I really really try to cry but I cannot. And this is going to kill me someday. Slowly. Gradually. Eventually.
