I just can't keep going on like this...I am so alone. No friends anymore. I have no one. I've gone through a break up before, but I can't take this again... every night I just pray I dont wake up. I can't even function anymore and just wish I would die. I have fucked up so much in my life. I look back and I'm embarrassed, disgusted and just hate myself, so I dont blame others for feeling the same. I just want this to be over. All of it. My life isnt worth living anymore.
