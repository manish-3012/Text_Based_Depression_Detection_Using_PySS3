I don't know. Just ready to go.I (22F) live with my family. I recently graduated but because of covid have been unable to find a job. I've been depressed since I was about 8 or 9. Tried to kill myself 5 times in my life. I cut throughout high school. My parents never let me see a therapist because it was too expensive and would hike up my insurance. 

I have a boyfriend. We've been together 5 years. He's very loving and affectionate. He's much more touchy and physical than I am and a lot of times doesn't realize I need some personal space. I feel like he touches me when I don't want to be touched and purposefully ignores my body language. There have been times where he'll ask for a blowjob over and over again until I say yes. He'll ask for sex over and over again until I say yes. I don't like to turn him down but he keeps asking. He mentally corners me. I was raped 2 years ago by someone else I knew for 9 years. I sometimes wonder if my boyfriend is raping me or if its not rape because I technically said yes. I'd like to think he has no malicious intentions but I just dont know.

I feel shitty all the time. I feel useless without a job. I feel like an object. My little brother treats me like shit. My friends ignore me. I'm always the background character in everyone's lives. I want to kill myself. I want to end my pain. I've tried pills, cutting, drinking and drowning, even hanging. I have to do it right this time. I'm waiting for a sign. I want the universe, that I know for certain is bigger and better than me, to show me the way. I wish I was strong enough to experience this planet and the universe entirely. I wish I could have enjoyed my time here. I'm just waiting for a sign now.
