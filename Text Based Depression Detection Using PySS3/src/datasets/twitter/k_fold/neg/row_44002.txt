helpI've been suffering from depression and depersonalization for a few years. I couldn't find any potential 'causes' of my mental illness because I've grown up in a privileged environment such as having lots of money and living in a huge house(though I severely lack social skills and am extremely introverted).

Weeks ago, I finally reached out for help to my parents. They seemed to be supportive, but they didn't seem to 'accept' that I am depressed, even though I have been diagnosed. My mom keeps saying that no one in our family has had a mental illness.

Yesterday during the conversation with my parents I impulsively said that I don't want to live. The words just automatically came out of my mouth.

Then my dad immediately responded, "then die". And then something like "others have it worse than you".

I cried in my room so hard that I felt like I was gonna suffocate myself from crying.

I've been feeling dizzy all the time after that, and with my suicidal urges even more strengthened by the conversation yesterday, I have to go to school, only to stay all the time alone and miserable.

I feel like this is an emergency, but I don't have anyone to talk about what I'm feeling. My therapist appointment is saturday this week, but I can't even bear just a few days because I'm so tired.
