I'm killing myself the day of my 18th bdayI have everything and still feel empty. I have a caring family and still feel alone. Even when i suceed i only see the bad side of things. Good things dont make me happy, i dont feel anything.

In my birthday i will chug a bunch of xanax tablets and a bottle of wine, its almost 100% lethal, supposedly without pain.

Im too sensitive for this world, i guess its natural selection, the weaker one has to die. 

Goodbye everyone, i know you all are good caring people, i wish you the best. 

Abe~
