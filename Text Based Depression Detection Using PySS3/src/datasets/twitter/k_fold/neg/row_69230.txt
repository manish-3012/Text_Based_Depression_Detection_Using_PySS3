Best Friend wants nothing to do with me. Fuck this, Iâ€™m out.Caused a fight via text, Iâ€™m now blocked, told they couldnâ€™t take it anymore. They resented my success, only wanted to hear about how shit my life was, and would try, to their credit, to help. Told them about some good things that were happening, and was told I was boasting. Despite me suffering from mental illness.  So, fuck it. This is what life is. Itâ€™s shit. Iâ€™m not supposed to have good relationships, just superficial ones. My pain continues. If I end my life, I end my pain. This seems like a good deal. 

When they said â€˜Iâ€™m out,â€™ I said â€˜Iâ€™m out of lifeâ€™ I was told â€˜Iâ€™m sorry to hear that,â€™ a fucking cookie cutter scripted answer. 

Theyâ€™ll see, theyâ€™ll all see.
