Suicide and workHow do you get yourself to go to work or do anything that you REALLY don't want to do. I hate going to work. It's associated with adulthood, takes effort, and I'm a student so it's difficult managing both. Plus, I am suicidal, I do not want to live a single moment of life, so why should I bother going to work? I should just kill myself. I have no reason to want to live so why am I pulling myself through this headache to gain money for a life I don't want to live. And I hate waking up 5am in the morning for practically illegal shifts, that I must take because I am desperate for a job.
Any suggestions of how to deal with my hatred of these situations and move on and do this stuff without so much anger and bitterness?
