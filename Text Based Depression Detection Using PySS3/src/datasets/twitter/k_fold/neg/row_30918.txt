First time feeling actually suicidal in yearsI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m losing my mind or if I actually feel suicidal, but I really either just want to cut or actually shoot myself, even though things have been ok for me, Iâ€™ll try and sum it up, broke up with my ex 3 months ago, but I wronged her, and I felt awful for it, knowing Iâ€™d never see her again, but despite my life going ok, I want to end it all, and just say fuck this life, the life that I never wanted to live, since existence is already pain.....
