I want to see my daughter grow up. But I might not.I am a straight woman who almost never drinks and I try to live an honest, ethical, mindful life. But I married a gay, alcoholic, lying, abusive philanderer - and I still lost custody of my daughter in the divorce. I only get to see her 48 days a year. My ex is a powerful man in the town where we lived, and I never had a chance. I am a fucking idiot. I should have stayed. Now she'll suffer for it.  

I'm such a fucking idiot that she's probably better off without me. And I really can't think of a single reason that I shouldn't throw myself off a building tomorrow. Intellectually, I know that's not healthy thinking. But I really want to do it. I really WANT to.  

Reasons to do it:  

- Save $30,000 in attorneys fees that I do not have, on top of the $7,000 I've already paid  

- Avoid horrific ex-husband and ex-in-laws forEVER  

- Stop crying on the floor of my parents' spare bedroom, where I live, a gainfully employed 38-year-old college educated woman  

- Vacate my parents' spare bedroom  

- Vacate the job I've been screwing up due to being distracted about divorce and custody  

- Stop crying on the phone to my sister, whose life is just fine without me boo-hooing all the time  

- Stop bothering friends with problems almost as big as mine  

- Basically, just stop being a burden on everyone around me  

- Keep my little 7-year-old daughter from being put in the position to defend me when ex and ex-in-laws badmouth me  

- My absence would even out my ex's temper, so he wouldn't take out his frustrations on her as much  

- My life insurance would pay for private school, if needed. Her college fund is already fully funded.  

- She won't have to endure the back-and-forth from mom to dad, feeling like everything is out of her control, feeling unsure of anything. Feeling like the rug is always being pulled out from under her.  

- She won't spend the next 11 years of her life wondering what she did wrong that caused her parents to be such obnoxious assholes  

- I won't spend the next 11 years being treated worse than dog crap on the bottom of a shoe by my ex and his family  

- I think maybe, while my daughter's life might be slightly happier if she had me in it, her life would actually be EASIER if I wasn't

Why did I lose custody, you might ask? Power. Money. Liars. Simple as that. No, I did nothing wrong. Yes, they made me out to be a bad person, and had no proof. I had proof of his threats and lying and drinking, and that somehow made me out to be a bad person, too.   


I don't understand how this world works anymore. I don't know how to be a mother anymore. I don't understand what's right and what's wrong anymore. I think it's time to reboot. I think, on the reincarnation cycle, I have risen to my level of human incompetence. I donâ€™t think I will ever even achieve a state where I feel â€œokayâ€ again. And thatâ€™s not something I can stand.
