I want to die today.I want to die today but I donâ€™t think I will. Sometimes this horrible overwhelming feeling eats me up. Iâ€™m sad, Iâ€™m lonely, Iâ€™m hurt but this wonâ€™t last forever. 

All the things I hope for can come true if I hold on and have faith and keep trying and give myself grace on the hard days to feel shitty and hopeless, Iâ€™ll be okay. 

Iâ€™ve made it this far, if I canâ€™t leave bed today thatâ€™s okay. I wonâ€™t always feel like this. If I donâ€™t cook or clean and barely feed myself thatâ€™s okay. Things wonâ€™t always be like this. If all I can do it distract myself from the circular thinking about my relationships, my past and my future, thatâ€™s okay. Iâ€™ve been here before and I know it doesnâ€™t last forever. It just feels like forever. And feelings arenâ€™t facts. 

Just wanted to say it â€˜out loudâ€™.
