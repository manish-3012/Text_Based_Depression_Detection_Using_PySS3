No Money No HopeI was recently laid off from a job that I loved doing. I've been looking for work everywhere but no one wants to hire me. I feel like the fact that I'm mtf has a huge part in this. Now I have no money and I can't even afford my hrt pills. I even had to allegedly break into cars last night just to try and get rent money. I feel dirty and broken, like there's nothing left for me. As I type this I keep running a knife up and down my wrists thinking about just ending it, but I won't because I'm a worthless coward who allegedly has to resort to stealing. I am now officially a worthless member of society, I'm just a leech trying to survive off of others hard work. I hate myself so much, and there's nothing I can do to change. I'm completely hopeless.
