I'm having a dark thought i wanted to share. and need help with.First of all i don't feel like life ows me anything. Or anyone else for that matter. I am struggling with thought of ending my own life. I am so unhappy and i constant emotional pain. Life just hurts. Too much. 
I dont know where to start, i feel like i am standing on the sidelines and life is passing me by. Life is full of things i want but can't have. I hate myself an i hate my life. A thought hit me today a realisation. I just can't go on like this. I am seriously thinking if things are like this six months from now i have no hope. Things wont get better. I'll jump in front of a train or something. It scares me, i might one day get so depressed ill kill myself. I don't want to die but what's the point? Whats the point in living this life. Seeing things i want, no, need. And not being able to get them. Not being able to give them myself. Never being good enough, never being chosen. seeing how other do have it. Hating myself, hating my life. Hurting always.
