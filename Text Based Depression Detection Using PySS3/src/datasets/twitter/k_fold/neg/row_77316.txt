I thought I was getting betterBack in January I overdosed and survived. I had a few seizures and was brought to the hospital for a week. Nearly dying seemed to be the wake up call I needed and I seemed to be getting better. I realize now that I'm not. My problems seem to have just gotten worse overall since then. I've got so much to be happy and smile about but my own mind makes these things bad things. I see a single post on Reddit and my chest starts hurting and I nearly or do breakdown. I'm scared of almost everything, especially losing my friends, despite the fact that I'm constantly pushing them away. I overdosed again a while ago and made myself vomit the pills up after a friend got really pissed. I just wish something would kill me so I wouldn't be breaking my promises.
