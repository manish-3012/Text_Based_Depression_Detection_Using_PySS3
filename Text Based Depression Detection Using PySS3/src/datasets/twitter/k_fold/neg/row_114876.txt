Nothing left and nobody to talk toI'm almost 30, and I'm a hideously ugly tranny freak. Transition was a mistake. Hormones did just barely enough to make me hideous (think 90's jerry springer show freak), but took with it any last shred of hope I ever had. My friends and most of my family have disowned me. When I used to leave the house, strangers would laugh in my face, or outright harass me (the best was being yelled at to just kill myself already.) I don't leave the house anymore.

Beyond that, I've failed at everything I've ever tried, fired from most jobs, failed out of school, even tried joining the Navy and was kicked out within 6 months. I've been denied unemployment, disability, welfare/foodstamps, medicare/medicaid/medical/etc. If you can think of a social program in the USA, I've been denied. I was even denied financial aid (via fafsa, with an income of 0 and no assets) to try and go back to school. I have $18 to my name. I'm unemployable and I would be destitute (and likely already dead) if my 65 year old mom weren't willing to let me live with her.

I've got nothing left. The only thing keeping me alive is a fear of not existing/not being self-aware (e.g. death.) At the same time though, I wish I had never been born in the first place. I'm a genetic mistake, and a waste of human life, and I just want the pain to go away.
