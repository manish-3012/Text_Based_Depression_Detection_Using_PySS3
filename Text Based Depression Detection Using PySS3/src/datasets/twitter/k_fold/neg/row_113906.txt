I can't do this anymore.I don't know how to help myself anymore.  I have 60 days sobriety (I hope I'm not violating any guidelines by saying that), but it doesn't seem to be helping much.  I'm supposed to be looking for a new job, but it's agonizing.  I have a couple of people I can talk to, but nobody who could help me if I ran into financial difficulties.  I don't know what to do anymore.
