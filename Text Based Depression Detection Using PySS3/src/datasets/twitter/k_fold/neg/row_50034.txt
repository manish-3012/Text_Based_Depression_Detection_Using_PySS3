I canâ€™t do this anymore.My life at this point is worth nothing. Iâ€™m not going to graduate high school due to me being in and out of psychiatric wards and just giving up on my school work. I am a ball of nothing but sadness and darkness.

Most of the time I am only happy when I am with the one that I love the most or if Iâ€™m daydreaming about ending my life. I have messed up. I have dug a whole too deep to get out of.

Iâ€™m sitting in my room now with my blades right next to me and I am ready. 

I feel so empty. I feel like I bring everyone down. What do I do to make myself feel better?

Iâ€™ve exhausted all possible options.
I donâ€™t know what to do.
