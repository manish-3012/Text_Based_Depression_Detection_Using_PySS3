I wish I had the guts to kill myselfI don't want to exist any longer. I feel hopeless and life doesn't get any better. I've tried to kill myself before by taking an overdose on oxycotin but it didn't work, that was probably the lowest point of my life. I try to tell my parents how I feel but they just dismiss it and tell me off. They think I just "act up" or am moody but I have been severely depressed for the last 4 years. Im 16 and should be having the time of my life but instead im just a depressed peice of shit with no friends and ambission.
