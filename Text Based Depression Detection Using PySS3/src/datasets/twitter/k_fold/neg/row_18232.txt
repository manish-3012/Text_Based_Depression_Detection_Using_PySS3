I'm doneI don't even know what I'm posting this for. But I feel like shit. I'm so close to ending everything. Honestly, it seems so much better than just staying alive. My fear of death has been far less that the pain of life. I'm only 16. I have an amazing life to look forward to, yet I feel that urge. I have major depression and the meds just aren't working. Today may be my last.
