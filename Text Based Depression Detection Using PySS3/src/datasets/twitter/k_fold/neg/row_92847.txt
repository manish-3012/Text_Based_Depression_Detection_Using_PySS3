im tired. i cant go on.im 37. i was born in to a christian doomsday cult. got married for cult reason. i tried. 12 year i tried. she never loved me, she doesnt even know what love is. 

i was born broken. i can hold down a job. it got worse and worse over the years. finally on disabilty, only to find out i dont make enough for housing. im tired of being homeless. i did manage to get a trialer i can pull behind me before my marriage fell apart. 

but its so damn expensive to live. im tired. and i have not been able to afford a doctor, so while i have meds, ill probably lose disablity. the really shitty part is i could be fine i had a year of stabilty. there are no more meds to try. i even asked  for ECT the last time i was in the psyc ward and they said no. 

and so i sit here in the forrest, typing this out to a dying battery, and a dead generator, a hour from anything.becuase its cooler here. always fun breaking out into a rash when the temps go over 80f.

i think this is it, i have no more cards left to play, no friends left to beg. no friends period. stuck in the middle of arizona. shitting in a bucket and sleeping in sweat is no way to live. im tired. all ive ever wanted was to be able to hold down a 40hr week job i hate. thats my life dream. and i cant even do that.  and so i think this is the end. i think ive reached the end of my journey. all that is left is to decide where i want to die. and how. im just do damn tired. im 37, lifes been like this since i was 15. ive wasted my entire life just trying to survive. i wish i was aborted. nothing in this life has ever made me say, 'i hope i dont die and miss out on this.'. its always been, 'i dont mind dying.' at best.

i just want a home. i want a family who accepts me for who i am, i just want to be loved. im just tired. im just exhausted. ive exhausted everything i am.

i dont know why im typing this, i just want some one to know.
