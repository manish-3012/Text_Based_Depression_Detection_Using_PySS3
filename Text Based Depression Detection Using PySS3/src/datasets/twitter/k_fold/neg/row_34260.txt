I come here every weekI come here to post every week, i have for four months. I keep thinking that this will finally be the place where someone can help me feel like living or something. 

Every week I write something stupid, about how I want advice or just someone to show me something I can do to stop feeling worthless and depressed.

The only reason why I'm even bothering is because of my husband. I hate seeing what it's doing to him. He's the only reason why I'm still here... but I feel like I'm burdening him by being here... by being sad. He worries about me and that makes me feel guilty...
