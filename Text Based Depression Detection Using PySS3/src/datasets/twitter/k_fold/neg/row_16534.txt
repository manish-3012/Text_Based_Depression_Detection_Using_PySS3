I try so hard to get better but I just can't?I feel like I'm trying to carry this fucking boulder up a mountain. And that I'm just going one step forward two steps back. I'm so sad and tired and I hate myself and I hate that no matter who I ask, no matter how much I beg no one takes me seriously. I feel all alone and I'm just... Exhausted.
