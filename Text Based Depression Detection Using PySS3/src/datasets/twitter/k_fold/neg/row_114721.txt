Don't want to traumatise my brother, but I really want to hang myself tonight.I don't care how my bastard parents would feel when they see my corpse. But I really don't want to traumatise my younger brother.

He's now studying for master's degree and has a bright future. He comes home every weekends. He has been acting indifferent to me for years, but I still care and love him.  

I really feel like doing it tonight, but maybe I should wait until he goes back to the dorm on Sunday evening, to make sure he won't witness the gory scene. Or maybe the death of a loser sibling won't bother him too much I guess.

I can't think quite clearly. My mind is in chaos right now.
