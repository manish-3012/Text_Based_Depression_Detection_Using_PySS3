3 years 354 days3 years 354 days thatâ€™s when Iâ€™ll do it, Iâ€™m going to move to a different state without telling anyone. Iâ€™m going to legally change my name rent a car and kill myself in it. No one will know me, my friends and family will never know. Iâ€™m going to save up as much money as I can buy her that farm anonymously and then put my plan into motion. Iâ€™ve thought about it so much, I even look forward to it. Iâ€™m sick of all these predictable outcomes and repeating events no matter what I change or do different itâ€™s all the same, so dull and pointless. Nothing matters when you know how everything is going to end. Iâ€™ve been dead for years now and she was the last good thing, she gave me hope again and I will always love her for that even if it the feeling was short lived, it was something I thought Iâ€™d never feel again. Too little to late unfortunately, I gave up long before I met her, you canâ€™t save everyone and I died a long time ago. Nobody can fix me if Iâ€™m part of the problem. 3 years 354 days
