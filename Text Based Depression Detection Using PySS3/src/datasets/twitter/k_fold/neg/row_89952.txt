Im doing good now but i need helpHello i posted this earlier and i was advised to post it again in this subreddit 

This morning i tried to commit suicide by cutting my wrist but i was in so much pain so i stopped and now im not thinking about doing that anymore , so im looking for over counter drug . Also i dont want to reach doctor or anyone in my area because i myself is doctor and i know how things go here 

So are there anyone i can talk or text online not necessarily specialized ? Preferably female 

Thank you
