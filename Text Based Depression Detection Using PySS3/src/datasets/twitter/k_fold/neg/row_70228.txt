Not sure if i am actually suicidal or I fear suicide...Hello everyone, I am 20 years old with no history of mental illness exept trichotillomania and I think somekind of OCD, but not sure, wasn't diagnosed.
So my story started 2 months ago, I remember the exact date(22.07.2017.) On this day I feel like it changed my life...
So I was sitting on my laptop in a friend's house, working on a new project, on a Saturday afternoon...everything was awesome, the sun was shining, the birds were sining, I was drinking my favorite coffee.
I logged into my Facebook to chat with one colleague. Yeah...awesome...but then...the news about Chester Bennington's suicide popped right into my face. I freaked out without a reason, and started having suicidal thoughts. I started googling and the results were....as you guess...Major Depressive Disorder. I completely freaked out. I went home and went right into my bed...I felt sick to my stomach, felt like vommiting. Couldn't sleep, couldn't eat... The next day felt the same way, I couldn't eat, everything felt pointless without a reason. I was very anxious...now...two months later i feel like everything was changed, I am constantly anxious, everything seems pointless for the half of the day. I have times during the day when I feel almost back to normal. But still most of the time I am constantly in my head, constantly googling about mental health. Still have those thoughts+10 more from the googling.(Life is not worth living, I don't want kids on this terrible world, it would be easier to just give up and so on.)Everything was fine before the news about Chester poppes up, I never thought of suicide before. I don't get it. So my questions and thoughts are:

1. Am I suicidal or I am obsessed with it because the of fear it?(My stomach is always anxious when this arrives) How can I tell?
2. Is there is something wrong with my brain (OCD, MDD,Anxiety)?
3. Will I always be this way?
4. What happened to me?
5. Why it happened?
