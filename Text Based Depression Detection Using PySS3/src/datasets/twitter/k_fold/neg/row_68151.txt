Reached out to my boyfriend and he walked out on meI (29f) have been have intense suicidal ideation recently. Iâ€™ve struggled with suicidal thoughts as long as I can remember. I survived a trauma at an early age and have had health issues since then.

Iâ€™m in chronic pain. Iâ€™m always sick. My mom has Alzheimerâ€™s and I know my dad will probably off himself when she dies. My older brother lives with them and cares for them but doesnâ€™t work because of nerve problems. 

I was laid off recently and have limited work options. I live with my boyfriend (35f) in a home he owns. We split bills 50/50.

Iâ€™ve fallen behind on bills and Iâ€™m really at the end of my rope. Canâ€™t stop thinking about how I should have just died when I was 4 years old and that it was a mistake for me to live. 

I told my boyfriend today as a last resort (I normally donâ€™t â€œburdenâ€ people with my mental health struggles) because I was really desperate. And he made it all about him and  how he canâ€™t keep supporting me and then left the room before completely leaving the house all together. 

I feel completely alone and donâ€™t know what to do. 

Thanks.

tl;dr Told my boyfriend I was suicidal and he physically left me alone
