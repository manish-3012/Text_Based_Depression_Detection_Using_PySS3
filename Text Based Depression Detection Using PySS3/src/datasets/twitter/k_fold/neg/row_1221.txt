Life is a test...I feel dirty, used, stupid, humiliated, week, gullible... but most of all worthless to the people who mattered the most to me. My feelings stem from abuse and lies of the most horrible and disgusting nature, purposefully designed to inflict the most amount of emotional and psychological pain that can be inflicted on another.

I contemplate suicide every day, usually as soon as I wake up... as if it was already on my mind while I slept. How come I get up and drag myself out the house every day to work, then school... ?

Because I know to be saved I have to save myself... nobody is going to do it for me. Nobody is going to think I'm worth anything unless I become worth something, nobody is going to love me until they can't live without me. 

So that's what it is... my own personal rebellion. I'm gonna prove  those people who used me and mock me and don't care weather I live or die that they're wrong... killing myself would only prove them right. So instead I'm going to show them I am a smart, strong, determined person who the world can't tear down. I'll fight, I won't lay down and die like they want me to. I'm going to become something just to spite them, to prove them wrong... maybe secretly tho... I'm gonna do it just for myself, because I know I'm worth it.  

Life is a test to see if you can rise to the challenge. Can you overcome the problems you face or will they overcome you?
