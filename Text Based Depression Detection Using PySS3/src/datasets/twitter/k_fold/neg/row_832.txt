can you tell me at all why this is a life worth living loli am constantly physically and emotionally abused, constantly heart broken, constantly in pain, constantly failing and there is no foreseeable out other than death 

my uncle just committed suicide last week and my initial thought was that it should have been me. this is not the first or last suicide in my family. i hate this existence
