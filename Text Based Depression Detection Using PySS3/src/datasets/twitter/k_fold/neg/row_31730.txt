the longer i wait, the more people I will hurtevery person I meet, every connection I make... every one who sees something in me.

i'm breaking a bit of them.  

i've given up for too long.  led people on too long...  pretending to be alive.

i hate myself for this. i hate myself for not wanting better.

but, this is something i need to do.
