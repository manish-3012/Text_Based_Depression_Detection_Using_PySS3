I'm accomplishing nothing with my life. I really didn't ask for any of this...I want everything to just go awayEveryone's else's success is crushing me.

I'm from a really poor family, but I was lucky enough to go to a great private school in my poor city. (USA)

Every teacher was lovely. I've had people believing I could grow up to do great things since I was young. I grew up thinking I could accomplish anything and now that I'm actually "grown" at 24, I feel like the definition of a loser.

I had a "good" job right out of school as a scientist, and I think I socially sabotaged my experience there. 

I ended up quitting and taking up various part time jobs and freelance work and internships to pursue something that made me happy.

Ever since I've started this journey to embrace my creative side i've never been more unhappy.

Life SUCKS. My parents are long since dead (in high school). I have no family. I can't make art. I can't find direction. I don't know what I want to do with my life. My boyfriend is succeeding in his line of work.

I'm lagging behind friends who have kept at their "thing" for the past two years post graduation because I fucking decided I wanted to make a series of poor career choices...and for what?

I have nothing to show for it. I'm living up to no expectations.

I literally just want to drive away next chance I get off work. 

I feel so alone. Whenever something good happens anyway there's no one to tell. No one to share the joy with. I feel like I can only burden my boyfriend with so much. When he got a new job offer a few days ago he told me..."I'll call you back, I have so many people to tell!"

I was thrilled and then immediately crushed. I'd have no one to  tell but him if the situation were reversed.

I can't even cry for some reason. It just feels like my throat needs to be ripped out.
