I messed up big time and I dont think I can live with myselfI recently went through a CDL program where I live in KY to be able to support myself and become independent since im about to be living on my own. My parents are moving to Florida at the end of the month and the plan was for me to be able to get a driving job so i could afford an apartment and I almost did... I interviewed for a promising job but failed my drug test (for weed) which cost my my license. I can go through a program to get it back but it could be a year before I complete the program.  I understand that I only have myself to blame but the timing is horrible. My parents have been so stressed about the move and were entering the final 2 weeks until we have to be out and now im gonna have to drop this bomb on them... 

They've always done a lot for me despite my managing to fuck up every opportunity They've given me. I've screwed up a lot over the years... Expelled from my high school, flunked out of college, later went to a media broadcasting school but never found any work so i got discouraged and stopped pursuing it. And within a month of getting my CDL I lost it because I smoked weed daily... I know its dumb and I knew I shouldnt be doing it but I obviously don't make great choices.

I feel like a complete failure on every level and I dont thing I can face the embarassment or their disapointment again. I've struggled with depression for several years but this is the first time I've ever REALLY considered suicide. I came here because there's no one in my life that I can face right now especially my family. 
If anyone can offer my some advice on where to go from here I would greatly appreciate it.
