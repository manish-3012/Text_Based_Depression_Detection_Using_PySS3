I Donâ€™t Understand My Call To The VoidI just donâ€™t get it man, I know that I have so much going right. Iâ€™m privileged to be surrounded by great things and people that my lifetime of hard work has yielded. Good fulfilling job that allows me to be creative and is fiscally lucrative, amazing kids, decent house, good health (well...) no more addiction (been clean since 2016) and for some reason I randomly get the obsession with just driving my bloody car into the river at 150 mph. Itâ€™s so strong, impulsive, and fucking tempting. Then I sit in it and obsess over it, and think of clever ways to do it and still have my family get the life insurance. I mean what in the actual hell. 

No one knows, no one sees it, I smile and fucking crack jokes and just imagine hanging from the damned ceiling.
