I really really can't fucking do this anymoreI really really can't do this 

I don't know how else to say it, I just feel hopeless and empty and under so much pressure

My head won't stop hurting and I feel like there's too much in my head and too much in my veins and I just cannot imagine getting through the night

I don't want to be like this, I want to be able to go to bed and know I'll wake up happy in the morning but every day has been a struggle and I don't have any motivation anymore, I just feel like every day is just another thing to get through and nothing makes me happy anymore

I don't know if this is the right sub or not I've never posted here before I can't fucking think or read right now I just feel like a waste of space, I'm paranoid and a terrible girlfriend and I don't even know if I'm that anymore because everything I touch falls apart and I feel so lost 

I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
