I wish I had a gunIâ€™ve become an eater. Iâ€™ve slowly lost all spontaneity and imagination. Every day feels like Groundhogâ€™s Day, and only thoughts of blowing my head off bring me any feeling of control anymore. Itâ€™s the only way I see it happening honestly, all other forms of dying terrify me. Whenever Iâ€™m driving on the highway, every time, I imagine about how it would feel to hit the fencing head-on, at 90mph. Sometimes it seems instantaneous. Decapitation, etc. Other times I imagine the car spinning around with me in it, before my neck snaps or something. I think about the time I got punched in the face as a kid. Itâ€™d be like that, but harder, and everywhere, at the same time. I wonder if I would experience consciousness for a couple seconds after impact.

I had a therapist back when I had a job, I lost that job and the insurance with it. Now the pandemic is here, and I can only interact with the rest of the world through a camera. I donâ€™t speak to any of my friends or family. My partner is the only one making money, and try as I do I canâ€™t seem to find a job. Last week I got an offer to get in somewhere, but they yanked it away after a company-wide hiring freeze. They waited weeks to tell me.

Now weâ€™re pinching pennies and wondering what comes next. I donâ€™t want to live in this world anymore. We never win anything anymore. Nothing good ever happens, everything just gets worse. Iâ€™m afraid to see it get even worse.
