I honestly don't know what to do..Im 16. Im a junior in high school and i don't know what to do anymore. My parents make me feel useless everyday. They make me want to kill myself. Everyday they always yell at me telling me how terrible of a child i am, how much their lives are ruined because of me, how i wont be anything when i grow up, how all these other kids are better than me, and so much more. I know it seems like it's not that bad but it's been going on for years now. Theyre always putting down everything i do and make me feel so terrible. I dont know how to explain it, but the things they say to me break me down so fucking bad and ive been wanting to kill myself for a while now. They say so many terrible things to me and just ruin my self esteem and make me feel so useless. This all has got me thinking and my parents have helped me realize that these isnt a single good thing about me. I don't have any talents, im not good at anything, i have ZERO good qualities, and my parents lives would be so much better without me. Everybodys lives that i know, would be better off without me. I want to drink a shit ton of cyanide and just fucking die, but im scared. Im not scared of the pain of dying, but Im scared of what comes after. In islam it says, that those that kill themselves go to hell forever. Thats the only reason i still havent ended my life. Im fucking done living and i cant take any of this anymore. I want to do this one thing so that i cant atleast do one thing to make my parents happy..im fucking crying typing this up and i dont know what to say to explain how fucking much i hate myself and how badly this are going
