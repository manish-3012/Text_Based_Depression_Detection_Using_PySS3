Im dealing with the same thingIm 28 and my girlfriend passed from cancer in 2016 halloween and ive done some shitty things to her and everybody else because of how selfish and inconsiderate i was. in the past as well. Said the wrong things to her during our arguments. And drank alot. And hurt alot of people because of my drinking. Lost all my firends. Mainly i just miss her and i am lonely as ive ever been. Cant keep a job due to my bipolar episodes and depression/ suicidal thoughts that make me wanna drink all the time. Im tired of starting over all the time however i feel like ill never be happy again. I have so much guilt built up inside that not breathing and just blackness or whatever follows after this ( hopefully reuniting with the ones i love) seems like the best option. I constantly watch nde vids and other vids about when people died and came back cause it makes me less afraid to just do it cauze they say it was pure bliss and love and relaxation. I hope it is. Anyway thats my story so far. Still trying to build tge courage to just get it over with but IDK.
