This is enough. I'm fucking done.My life is over. It's too late now to change anything. Nothing in my life works. I'm about to fucking grow a pair and just jump off a high-enough building I know of. It's my fate. This is not a cry for help. Hate myself. Hate my family. Hate my social life. Hate my academic life. Hate my non-existent future. Hate my house. Hate my pointless life. Hate this world. HATE FUCKING EVERYTHING. I've just got enough out of it. There's no turning back. Fuck my life, fuck myself and fuck this unbearable pain. FUCK ALL OF IT.
