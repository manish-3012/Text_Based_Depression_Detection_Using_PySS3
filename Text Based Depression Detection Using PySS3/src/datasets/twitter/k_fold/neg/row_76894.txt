I really wish it was all over.I just can't be bothered anymore.

I'm nothing more than an anxiety-riddled mess, who's to scared to live his own damn life. I'm 26 and I have no dreams, no ambition. My whole life I suffered from social anxiety, always having the feeling I'm being judged by everybody. Never feeling good enough.

Never has anyone expressed interest in me even when I tried my hardest. But I'm a short, genetically skinny fucker, who isn't attractive. Balding, receding hairline. I inherited everything that is considered unattractive I have. Bullied my whole damn life and when I finally escaped them I can't even begin to even love a ounce of myself.

The fucking anxiety, loneliness and worthlesness is just to much for me. I rather die now than live through this another fucking 20 years.
