I Had a Gun in my Mouth This MorningI'm in so much debt, and it honestly I found no easy way out other than suicide.

I also duffer from chroniv bsck pain from being thrown on my back on the floor out of my evil step-dad's anger.  

I guess I got luck, because the barrell was empty, maybe there is hope in the future.

Please send good vibes my way. Thank you.
