I'm sitting here, holding my gun...It's my first gun I've bought. It's a standard mil-spec 1911 from springfield. I carry it everywhere with me. When ever my life feels out of control, I just reach back and touch it. It reminds me that I still have control over one thing in my life. The way I die. I use to think one of the first things I'd do with one as out it to my head. Just to see how it feels. I haven't done it yet. I tell my self that the only time I'm doing to do it is when I mean it. Can't tell you how many times Ive thought of doing just that...
