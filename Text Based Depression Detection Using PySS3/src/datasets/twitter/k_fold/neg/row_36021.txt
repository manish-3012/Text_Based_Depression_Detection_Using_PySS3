Failed at lifeHi Iâ€™m Jesse Iâ€™ve tried 24 times and failed all of them so I pretty much just gave up on life and idgaf anymore my parents died mom died when I was 8 and dad died when I was 11 and he was very abusive physically and emotionally itâ€™s been 6 years since he died and I still struggle with severe ptsd cause itâ€™s apparently not normal for your dad to try to kill you? Anyway life for me is just pain shortly interrupted by some good things every so often
