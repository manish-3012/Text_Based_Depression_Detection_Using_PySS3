Have you ever thought-Thought that you could unwillingly become a woman's sex slave? Now I know I put in for a previous post about hiring a prostitute to feel ones 'sexual' embrace, but what about being the one being used, abused, toyed with... Has anyone had experience of feeling horrible.
I guess what I'm trying to get at is that I feel like shit for a few years now, the more porn I watched/read the more I wanted out of it. It got a little dark and I've been having fantasies to be used up like a condom and be somewhat tortured... Whether physically and or mentally because I think I need to be punished for the things I've done in my past.
What I've put here doesn't exactly express the feeling I have or want because I'm bad at writing and I ramble. This isn't really a post about suicide, but this is the only page channel thing I know of.
