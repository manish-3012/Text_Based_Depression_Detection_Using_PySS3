Even if my life situation itself gets better, I'm never going to be happy or useful.I thought I knew what I was going to type, but now that I'm sat here at the keyboard, I can't grasp any words. And this is how it always is. I can't think. I don't know how to talk to people. I can't do the simplest of work. I'm too mentally screwed up to even function at low levels. It's humiliating. I have no purpose. 
I grew up in a terrible home, which only served to amplify my mental illnesses that were already severe. Despite being fairly smart, I barely made it through high school and dropped out of college.
And now I'm sitting here at home, trying to do the simplest of work, and I can't. I can't think. I can't focus. I can't work. 
And even if I were to leave and be somewhere that would probably be better for me... I would still be so lethargic. So tired, and empty. 
And I still wouldn't be able to be happy. Because I always return to this, no matter what I do.
So I don't want anyone to waste any more time or money or whatever other resources on me. Hell, I don't want to waste any more on myself. The few people who actually care about me think I'm getting better, but I'm not. I never will. It never goes away.
All I want to do at this point is buy some rope and go hang myself deep in the woods. I don't want anyone to have to think about me anymore. I don't want to think anymore. I'm in so much pain, all the time.

This was supposed to be at least a bit more comprehensible. I'm sorry.
