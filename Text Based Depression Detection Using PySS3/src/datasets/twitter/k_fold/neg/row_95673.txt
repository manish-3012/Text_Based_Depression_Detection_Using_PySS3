Iâ€™m not creativeSo last week I found out my ex was cheating on me. When I confronted him he dumped me and I had to move back home with my parents. They were supportive with me grieving and everything. But Iâ€™m still not over it and itâ€™s just propelled me deeper into my depression and Iâ€™ve starting cutting myself again. Everyone expects me to get over it and Iâ€™m just not. He was the only guy Iâ€™ve ever loved and we lasted a year. As of right now Iâ€™m fully blown suicidal and today I looked at guns to buy. It will either be me shooting myself in the head or cutting my wrists. Iâ€™ve stopped eating and lost over twenty pounds. This relationship ending really just pushed me forward with suicidal thoughts and self harm. I havenâ€™t cut in over a year and I finally succumbed to it a few days ago. I go to work where I see him being unaffected by everything, laughing and joking around. Then thereâ€™s just me. Endless suffering and feeling so isolated. 
I have been reaching out to supports and I see a therapist. Iâ€™m also medicated as well. None of that helps me. I just feel like this is my only option right now. Iâ€™ve got nothing else. My house is shit, my life is shit. The only thing I enjoyed was seeing the new joker movie where I only liked it because I related so hard to him. But even in that movie he ends up on top. Me? That just wonâ€™t happen. I guess this is it.
