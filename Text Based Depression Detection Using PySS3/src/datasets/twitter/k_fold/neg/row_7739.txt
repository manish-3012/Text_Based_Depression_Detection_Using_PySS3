Scared to dieI'm tired of being alive but I'm too scared of the idea of pain during death
I don't believe in anything after and I feel like I'm postponing the inevitable, meds aren't helping anymore and I don't see why I couldn't have just gone through with it years ago when I was more manic/inclined

I keep 'lightly' toying with hanging but I'm scared it won't go through

I'm so tired of fighting my head
I'm sorry for rambling
I wish I could be euthanised

The only solace everyone around me has is I'm too fucking stupidly scared to actually do anything
