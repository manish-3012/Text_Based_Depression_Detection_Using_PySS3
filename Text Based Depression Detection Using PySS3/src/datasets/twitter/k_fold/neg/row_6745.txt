I'm suicidal and feel too guilty about mentioning it to anyone.I've been depressed for a long time, but recently I've been really really up and down. I've gotten close to someone this year who understands me, and it was making me feel like I could handle all the things I've been dealing with. But I feel like I've been slowly losing them for months. Like they're growing bored of me, or just realizing how worthless I am, or just want something else. It's not that we're dating, mind you. I get that it sounds that way when I'm vague about it, but it's not that kind of relationship It's a complicated relationship. At least on my end of it. And the entire relationship has been ups and downs, itself, lately. So I've ended up crying on a lot of shoulders already, the past few weeks. I think people are sick of me being down, and rightfully so with how often I have been.

The reason I mention all of that is because I feel like I'm at the bottom of the hole, at the moment. Like, I'm sick of putting death off, right now. I've been putting it off for years and years. And I feel like I "should" say something to someone. But I've already asked so much of so many people at this point. I've made so many people worry for nothing, already. I can't keep using people like this. I just want to do this and get it over with, make the pain stop once and for all, and not leave anyone feeling like they're obligated to try and stop me.

So I guess I'm just wondering if anyone can say anything to me to convince me that these feelings aren't legitimate. That I should reach out to someone. Granted, it's past midnight, so that cuts down the number of people I could harass about my pathetic feelings, anyway. But I've already heard the "suicide is a permanent solution" thing, and I guess I just want to give myself a chance *yet again*. I just can't convince myself I should say anything to anyone, though.
