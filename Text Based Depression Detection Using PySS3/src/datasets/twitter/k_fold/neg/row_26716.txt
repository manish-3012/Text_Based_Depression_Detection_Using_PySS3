PTSD, Bipolar II and BPDHow the fuck am I supposed to function when even my own brain canâ€™t keep itself together for more than 5 days near every month? Donâ€™t tell me to try medication, therapy, exercise or healthy eating- Iâ€™m already doing it. I AM IN THE WAITING ROOM OF ONE OF MY TWO THERAPISTS RIGHT NOW AND I STILL WANT TO DIE. I fucking hate being alive. I tried to kill myself for the eighth time in two years on Monday and even that didnâ€™t work. Fuck being here. Fuck living for today. Fuck trying for other people. FUCK ME.
