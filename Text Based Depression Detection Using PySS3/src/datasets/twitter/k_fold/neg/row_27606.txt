Thinking about checking myself into a mental health hospital.Like the title says I'm thinking about getting help, but what should I expect? I just had a mental breakdown at work and quit I've been suicidal before and my friends are drained because of it but I can't stop fantasizing about ending it all. I want to do it but I chicken out and maybe meds could help shut my fucking mind off and go get help but now I'm rambling. What should I expect at the hospital?
