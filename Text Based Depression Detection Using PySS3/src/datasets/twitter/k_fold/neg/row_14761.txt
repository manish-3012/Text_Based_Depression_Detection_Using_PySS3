I only feel right when I'm asleepIt's the only way I can pretend to be the person I wish I was. Maybe the reason suicide seems so attractive is because I'll finally be able to sleep without interruption.

I just want some kind of help or understanding. That, or I want to run away. I'm not fit for adult life. It's not that it's hard, but that I can't deal with it like a human being. The worst part is that I don't want to try. It's not worth it. I wish I'd just die in an accident.
