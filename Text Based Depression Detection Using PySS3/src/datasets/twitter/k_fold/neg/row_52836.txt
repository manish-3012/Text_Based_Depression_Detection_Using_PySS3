Help for an Online FriendI can't cross-post so I'll put this here.  
I just really want to know what to do for once.  
Thanks for reading.

I have a schizophrenic friend that I've known for years online. She's diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and it seems to get worse over the years. She's been very suicidal and has at least 2+ attempts in the past 3-4 years. She likes to game a lot and one of her favorite fandoms is the Touhou fandom. She believes that if she dies, she would be reincarnated into Gensokyo (the main setting for the Touhou Project). I've been working with her mom for years and we've gotten her help from therapists and many anti-depressants. She has been very persistent in insisting that she be put down so that she doesn't have to go out in a "messy way". Honestly I don't know what to do, it's been so long and I'm just some shitty college freshman. Most of my friends aren't willing to help me because of the antics that she goes through and it causes so much drama but I decide to keep her unblocked because I feel a massive amount of guilt for her and her single mother. What should I do?
