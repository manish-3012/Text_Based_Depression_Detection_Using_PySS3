I plan on killing myself on July 31stIâ€™ve had a lot of fucked up shit happen to me through out my whole life. This year has been the worst year of my life. I literally tried to do right by everyone and somehow, someway I always get fucked. I canâ€™t even remember what being happy feels like anymore and I donâ€™t think I want to anymore. Iâ€™ve had second thoughts because of my family and the few friends I have. The thing is I will be forgotten.. I was never really important. I told myself if things didnâ€™t get better by July 31st, I was gonna do it. I almost feel as if no one can convince me otherwise. This might even be one of the last posts made by me. I donâ€™t think I will be missed. I feel bad because I couldnâ€™t live with all the trauma anymore. I wish my life couldâ€™ve been different.
