I sexually assaulted people and I can't live with myselfWhen I was in high school, around 16 or 17, I used to go to the mall parking lot after school and touch women's rears. I knew it was wrong but it became an addiction. At first I tried to do it without being noticed but eventually I would do it openly and then quickly run from the place so I wouldn't get caught. I acted like a full on criminal, following women around the store and actively looking for women to assault. I was so fucked in the head that I didn't even care that it was wrong. I also shoplifted quite often from the same store and others, which I eventually got caught for and haven't done again since.

4 years later, I am disgusted with myself. I've read so many stories and news about sexual assault and I've gotten angry, angry at the world for the way women are treated and how many people are sexual abusers. But for some reason it took so long for me to realize that I am one of them. I have no right to be angry. All those comments I upvoted saying sexual abusers should be locked up or killed, they all apply to me. And I agree with them all. I hate how unclean I feel. But I have no right to feel that way, because that's the way I made other people feel. 

I'm not here wanting people to tell me I deserve to live. I am not a victim. Don't tell me it's ok because I was young. It's not. Don't tell me to stay alive to atone for it either. They were strangers and there's nothing I can do to change what I did. I simply need to put this out there to acknowledge and accept what I am and why I need to end my life.
