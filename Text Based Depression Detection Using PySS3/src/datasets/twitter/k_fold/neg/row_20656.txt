I don't belong anywhereI've been struggling with depression and an existential crisis for over 6 years now to the point where I feel nothing but indifference. I'm never satisfied with anything, neither can I bring myself to care about anything. 

I dropped out of highschool, I don't have a job and I'm slowly becoming homeless. I threw everything away because I kept telling myself that I was going to commit suicide anyway so nothing I did mattered. 

Now I'm finally going to own up to those words and hang myself. I don't want an afterlife. I don't want to be conscious anymore.
