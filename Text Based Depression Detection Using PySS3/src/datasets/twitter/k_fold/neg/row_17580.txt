Problem finding the right psychotherapistThis is my first post here, I hope it's appropriate.
I've been struggling to find the right psychotherapist for years now. I have a psychiatrist, but she only talks to me about my medication, nothing else. Maybe I'm just too demanding, but I don't feel like I can truly trust my doctors. They have put me on all sorts of medication, nothing helped. Some meds even made it way worse, to the point I seriously considered killing myself. I have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, panic attacks and of course insomnia. My family thinks I'm faking it. I don't have any friends at all and therefore no support system. I can't even make my own appointments because I'm too scared to talk on the phone (talking in person is much worse though). Whenever I visit a new psychotherapist, I immediately find them unsympathetic and struggle to open up. I see them more like an authority figure than someone I can confide in. Do you guys have any tips on how to be honest with your doctors? I'm really trying, but it never seems to work out.
Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad english.
