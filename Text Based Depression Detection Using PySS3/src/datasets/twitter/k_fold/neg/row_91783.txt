I hate when people tell me that I'm innocent or pureAside from a few people, whom I know they truly mean it... I don't like when people say that I'm like that, plus other things like kind, caring, understanding and so on...

They say that, but they don't reach out unless I do so first...

It's like I'm a collective action figure, where people see me from a certain distance, but they never try to interact...

If I'm truly what they say, why don't they try to reach out? 

I think I only make others uncomfortable, and like someone told me once, people are too nice to tell me I make them feel like that, so it's up to me to understand their cues and leave if I'm not wanted.

I always mess things up, and even when there's a chance I would make new friends or at least friendly acquaintances, I always ruin everything, like I've always done in my life...

Living like this, threated like a porcelain doll by many people (except family and remainng friends), but knowing that I'm probably **hated/disliked/tolerated...** It really hurts.
