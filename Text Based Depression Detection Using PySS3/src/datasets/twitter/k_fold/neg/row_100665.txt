I donâ€™t know what to do. Okay so Iâ€™m 16 and you donâ€™t know how bad i want to make it to my birthday. But, the way that things are going right now make that almost impossible. Iâ€™ve recently lost all, and when i say all, I mean ALL my friends. I have no one to talk to, my family tries to act like they care but they really donâ€™t, iâ€™m barely losing weight, and I can say that iâ€™m bored of life and think that suicide is the only way out. Iâ€™ve tried acting positive, iâ€™ve tried antidepressants, iâ€™ve tried going on walks, iâ€™ve tried everything, but nothing works and iâ€™m really tired of trying. what can i do?
