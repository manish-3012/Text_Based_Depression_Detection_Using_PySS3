I've never been more surethat I want to die. 

I've struggled for years and everytime I make some progress, I'm faced with even worse problems to overcome. I can't catch a moment to just breathe, to just be. These issues that life throws at me are unbelievable and unpredictable to the point where it actually feels like there's a force hellbent on screwing over my life and making happiness impossible. I don't normally believe these things but sometimes I just ask for "signs" like hearing from a friend or hearing some good news, etc and NOTHING happens. Even sometimes when good news is expected. I honestly feel like I'm delaying the inevitable. EVERYONE dies and my way to go is through suicide. Soon. Now.

It's frustrating that people consider this to be "giving up" when I've been fighting this for years. I can't live another year like this.
