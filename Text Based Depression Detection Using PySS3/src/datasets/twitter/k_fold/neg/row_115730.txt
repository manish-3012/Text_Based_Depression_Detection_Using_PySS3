Hello humansThis is my first time using Reddit.

Um...A lot of reasons why I'm making this post. Some things off the top of my head in chronological order sort of? I don't know how else to organize this, sorry.

I'll start by saying I've always liked myself, so no problems there. I think I have a lot of good traits.

I've never really enjoyed living, I guess. Since I was little, I've felt that I've done everything worth doing. I haven't done many things that humans would consider worth doing, but I've done the things I wanted to and enjoy. You could say I've felt very old since I was very young. I felt I'd lived a full life and there's not anything I'm looking forward to.

I've never had a dream or a passion. I've never had a job. I guess I never thought I'd live long enough to even think about it? 12 is the oldest I ever thought I'd get. I never imagined being a teenager let alone a grownup.

Just as I thought it would, things get worse every year I'm here. In every way. I have less fun but more suffering.

Is it possible to be born depressed? I've been able to go to a doctor recently for the first time since I was little, and she thinks I'm depressed. I disagree. I enjoy the things I enjoy. I haven't "lost pleasure in things". I just don't get the opportunity to do anything fun. Videogames require a good, working computer and games. I've got no money so can't get them.

I've also been able to go to a therapist recently. We think I'm on the spectrum. I'm smart, I've always gotten straight As, school is pretty easy except I hate writing reports. I've got a college degree. But that means no more scholarships, so I can't go to school anymore. Why I'm saying this is because it's that human things are just too hard for me, and no one understands that. I can't make food for myself usually. I'm able to prepare very few things. I don't have the motivation nor energy for daily living tasks. Having to act normal around humans is exhausting. I'm tired and miserable. I hate being hungry most of the time.

I've gone through a lot of family nonsense, but I've finally gotten away from my abusive and neglectful mom. But things aren't as "better" as I hoped they'd be. The place I'm living is disgusting. She's not hurting me anymore, but somehow it's not enough.

I'm asexual, but have/had a fiancee/best friend for almost 10 years. He's the only person I've ever been able to be my whole self with. I've never been able to connect with people outside of teamwork tasks. I just don't know what to do with them. I don't get along with humans well enough to want to be close friends with them. He's been living with me for close to a year. Shortly before he came to live with me, we found out he has bipolar (he also has ADHD, along a several other physical and mental illnesses) . Until he was with me in person, I didn't understand what that meant. I have to babysit him 24 hours a day so he doesn't get kicked out. He came to live with me to help me out with human things, but he doesn't. It's me helping him. He's probably the biggest blow to me of all my reasons for wanting to leave, because I thought I could believe in him. He was my hope. He's why I've stuck it out this long, because he made me believe things could be better. But in person, he constantly lies and hurts me and makes messes and does nothing. I'm at the point I've told him he needs to go. 

I'm having a harder and harder time every day just "going with the flow" and trying to live. If it wasn't so hard, I could try harder. I wouldn't want to leave if I wasn't always suffering. I thought my options were increasing and was more hopeful after I got access to a doctor and therapist and my fiancee came to "help me" and I got away from my mom. But I'm at the end of my rope.

I hate being poor, hungry, lonely, struggling with just existing, everything. I've been trying hard, but I just don't want to suffer anymore.

I tried to write everything clearing, but it feels like a mess. Sorry, writing and explaining is really not my forte.

I don't really know why I'm doing this. Maybe to try reaching out for some other option for a final time. I've tried therapy, I've tried being hopeful and trying hard...
