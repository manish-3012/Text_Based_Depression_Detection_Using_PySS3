okay so i was going to kill myself and i didnt, i wish i did, but i cant.Okay so the other day i was on the edge of killing myself, asked you guys if you think the drop would kill me, i took someones advice and rang my now ex girlfriend, she was an ex whilst i rang her anyway, she was there for me through this entire thing but that isnt why im like this.

I dont knowwhy im like this anymore i just get like this all the time, i self harmed and my ex told me not to made me promise, shes an ex because i broke a promise so i wanted to keep it but i cant..

i feel like i rely on people all the time to stop me from doing what i wat to do which is kill myself, i prefer depression over happiness but i seem to just run around in circles, get depressed, say im going to kill myself, speak to my ex, she gets upset and i say im not going to anymore, apologise, be nice to her, get angry over nothing and end up telling her to fuck off basically and then the depression starts again and so does the circle

Like i said i dont know why im like this i just always get like this, i rely on people and i dont know why, maybe i want people to feel sorry for me but then i push those same people away? i keep saying i want to stop being like this but im like this with anyone who gets close to me, i dont know why :/

before anyone asks, im on antidepressants, i do counselling, got a session tomorrow, i just need advice and help but i dont know what to do, i never do know what to do. 

help me, please?
