I've been done for yearsI developed a sinking feeling when I was just 4 years old at pre-k. It was depression, and it gnawed away at me. I was scared, since I didn't know why it was there or where it came from. I eventually got used to it, and didn't think anyone would care. Fast forward about 3 years later, just after my 7th birthday. I was so pissed, alone, and just so sad. I locked my door and hung myself from my closet. After about 6 seconds, the knot came undone and I fell. I was left in shock that I had just tried to kill myself, as I didn't even know that it was a thing. I was still a naÃ¯ve kid and thought everyone got along and everyone except me was happy. Fast forward 4 years, I was caught cutting in 6th grade before my 12th birthday. I lied and said that I just saw some older kids doing it, saying it was cool, but I knew what I was doing. Then, it became routine when I was about 14. I would always try and always fail. I even overdosed, only to wake up. Those were just some of the many attempts I've made at my life I'm crying I don't even know what to do anymore. My parents always yell at me, I'm 100 miles away from my real friends, I'm so stupid. I'm done. I always feel so numb when I'm going through a deep spell of depression. Like it's not really me. Even now, I wonder, since I've had this forever, what I'm really like. Help. 

(Btw, my step dad got drunk once when I was in 7th grade, and yelled at me so much that I wanted to kill myself. My mom just watched. He's even gotten into moods where he's dragged the dogs outside and beat them. I love them so much. Does this count as abuse? This, I should add, does make it 1000x worse)
