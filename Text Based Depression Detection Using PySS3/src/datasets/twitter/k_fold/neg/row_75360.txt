Please, SOMEONE help me...In college, haven't gotten out of bed in literal days. Have barely eaten, and when I do I feel bloated and sick. Exasperated with living, I've tried to kill myself too many times, I can't fucking die. Tried to crash my car, NOPE. Tried to overdose, NOPE. Tried hanging myself, NOPE. I'm sick of living with this depression. Either I'm happy and dreading my next "bout" of depression, or I'm fucking miserable. Just confided for the first time about how bad it's been getting to a guy that I've been seeing, he's ignoring me because of a drunken whorefest I went on. Lately, i'd been drinking a shit ton/going to parties/hooking up, but I just feel worse afterwards. I'm on less medication than I used to be, but I don't want to be a zombie again. The counselors here are god awful. I haven't showered in days or done my giant pile of laundry. Finals are coming up and I have so much shit to do, but I've just been sleeping all day. One of my close friends can tell that something is up (it's not too hard, after all), and won't leave my side. I just want him to go away. I'm sick of living for the sake of my family and friends.
