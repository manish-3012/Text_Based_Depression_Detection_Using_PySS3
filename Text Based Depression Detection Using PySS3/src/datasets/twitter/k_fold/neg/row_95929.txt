Now I understand that even family isn't enough to keep me goingSure I'm stuck at home helping care for a sick physically disabled mother. Will be for years more. Yet it's not enough for me to want to go on. 

I'm perpetually teetering on bankruptcy due to high expenses, a low income, and limited cash reserves. I have little chance of finding any other kind of work than my shitty part time job thanks to a useless degree and only 2 jobs in my experience. I can't afford to take on another loan for another college degree because my income is that low. I'm all alone most of the time with no friends or girlfriend thanks to how shit I am with people. I simply have no place in this world at all. Worst of all, my depression diagnosis turned out completely wrong. It's actually dysthymia.

I quite simply don't have much longer to live. I'm tired.
