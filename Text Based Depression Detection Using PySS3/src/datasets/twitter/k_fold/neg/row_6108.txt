I donâ€™t know what to doAbout six months ago my girlfriend and best friend broke up with me after I got back from a mini deployment. We were fighting but I never would have thought we would break up, we were so happy together. Or so I thought. we had honestly planned to get married when she graduated college. I have not taken this break up well, when we broke up I started talking about suicide and I feel so awful for putting that kind of stress on her. However the suicide part is real. The thoughts started happening when I was over seas and I canâ€™t even remember if I told her prior to the break up. About a month after the break up I ended up in the hospital for attempting suicide. This was the last time I ever heard from her. After I got out of the hospital I came to find out the military had issued a restraining order for a month and later another month. I was never told why. I was always so gentle towards her I would have never ever hurt her. Iâ€™d only yelled at her one time in the entire time I knew her. I hope deep down she knows that. Last night I again tried to end it but I couldnâ€™t do it without talking to her one more time but when I tried she didnâ€™t reply. I donâ€™t understand we used to mean everything to eachother and now itâ€™s like Iâ€™m some evil monster. I just need closure. I canâ€™t go back to the hospital, Iâ€™ll get kicked out of the marines. Itâ€™s all I have left. Iâ€™ve seen doctors and I go to therapy every week nothing helps.
