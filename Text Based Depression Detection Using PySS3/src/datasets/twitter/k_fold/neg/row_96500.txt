Anyone in San Antonio and want to chill?Some fucks from work obliterated my emotions tonight and to make it worse, my work is not considering harrassment "persay".

So for the first time in my life, I get invited out to a bar for a drink with a coworker who've I've grown to like. 

As we're about to leave, he ducks in to the bathroom for a piss, and I decide I should too. As I enter, the other coworker who is in the stall taking a shit, is talking shit about me to this guy. Neither notice me standing right there.

First the guy calls me a creep, then accusses me of killing my dog, then convinces the guy who invited me out to ditch me by lying to me about which bar we're going to then go somewhere else instead.

As he finishes his shit and exits, he notices me. The only thing he says is "Well, I'm not going to sugar-coat it." whatever the fuck that means. He's never expressed his displeasure about me before to me, and was just caught talking shit and making up a pretty bad rumour that hit pretty hard since I had to give up my dog recently to save money.

Also, coming back from Houston, the people I stayed with went through my logs and I caught them. THey lied when explaining themselves, so when I called them out, they actually bitched at me for 'not giving them enough info', even though I bought them groceries and was an open book that they failed to ask anything.

Oh yeah, and some bitch reditor just had to use my dog against me in a thread where I asked advice on investing in a house. I'm fucking crushed.

I just want a good friend here.
