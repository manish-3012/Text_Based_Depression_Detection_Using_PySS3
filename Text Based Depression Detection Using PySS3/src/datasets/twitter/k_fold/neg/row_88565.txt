No hope I am 25(f). I was diagnosed with depression in 2010. 
While I have had moments of clarity and have been able to manage my depression and suicide ideations it has all become too much to cope with lately. 

Basically, I dropped out of law school. I haven't seen more than 3 friends since 2010. I have isolated myself to the point where the only interactions I have, are online. 

My life is so chaotic. I recently moved out of home thinking that this would greatly alleviate some of my stress but it comes with its own challenges. 

I have 3 older sibling (all male). One is in jail for drug and weapons charges. The other is a paranoid psychophrenic who is out on bail. And my other brother is in intensive care waiting for a lung transplant. 
My father is an emotionally abusive alcoholic and he is so negative that being around him alone provides enough initiative to kill yourself. 

My brother who is currently in jail made some enemies before he went in, and they have showed up to my parents house with guns and taken our cars under coercion. He has accumulated massive debts, which has been passed on to my parents, who also are trying to pay for everyones legal fees. 

At this point, I am feeling pretty shitty about my life and my situation and very discouraged that despite all my effort to get back on my feet I keep falling down and getting stuck. 
I see a Doctor regularly but its never really that helpful, just more money I have to pay. 

It breaks my heart that I have to endure these difficult circumstances and I really just dont have the energy to keep fighting. 
I have lost all my friends, have ruined relationships and my self esteem and confidence have been obliterated. 

I just don't see the point of continuing when the future is terrifyingly hopeless. 

If anyone can offer some advice or encouragement i'd really appreciate it.
