Can you tell me what keeps you alive?Because everyone has a thing that keeps them going. For me is anime. I was bullied all my life by the other kids at school and from where I live so I spend most of my time indoors. That's when I discovered anime.I can still remember the night's when I was in my kitchen with the knife against my neck ready to kill this useless human being that is myself.One time I was so sad,broken and felted that I can't take it anymore because something really horrible happened at school I almost died by being strangled by a classmate because I did something to upset him, and when I got home I got scolded because I cried at school.What??? That night I was ready to end it all...but then I got a notification it was that a new episode of Naruto was updated with sub's in my language so I can watch it. At that moment I thought "wait I still have to see if Naruto brings Sasuke back" because it was that episode where Naruto went to get Sasuke back who was escorted by Orochimaru's servant's. So from that day on I decided that I would die only when I finish all the anime and manga that I start. And that's why I start a lot of anime and manga all at the seme time so I have a reason to stay alive in this shitty world. 

This is the thing that keeps me alive.Oh and music because when I  have my headphones on they're like a shield from all the bs and pain being thrown at me. 
 What about you what keeps you alive?
