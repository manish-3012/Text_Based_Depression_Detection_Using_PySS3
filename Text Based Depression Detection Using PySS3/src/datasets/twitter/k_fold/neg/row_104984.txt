I made a post here about a week ago...The post told my story to the fullest. 

TL;DR: I was molested as a child and told basically no one. Decided to tell my mom on Friday. 

When I told my mom, she told me she would have to back both me and my sister. This felt like an ultimate betrayal, to be completely honest and Iâ€™m ready for it to be over. Iâ€™m done fighting it. Iâ€™m telling everyone in my life goodbye this week and ending it as soon as possible.
