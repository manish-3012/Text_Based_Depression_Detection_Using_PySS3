It's never going to stop hurting.My girlfriend of almost six years and I split up back in May. Since then, she has moved on to somebody else. I tried. I really fucking tried. Hell, I dated 15 different women this year. Not a single one wanted to be with me. And even if they did, I can't stop thinking about my ex. There's an ice cold rod of pain in my chest that has been there since May, and I don't think it's ever coming out. I spent all night tonight in so much pain that I just now vomited. I'm supposed to let time heal this wound, but when it hurts even worse than it did when I first got it, I can't say that my odds are very promising. 

I don't want to keep living like this. When I'm awake, I think about her. When I'm asleep, I dream about her. This is fucking torture, and I think that I am well within my rights to put an end to it.
