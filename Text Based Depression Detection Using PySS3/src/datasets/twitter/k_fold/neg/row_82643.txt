I messed up two families. I ruined everyone's lives. I don't want to ruin any more.I am a horrible human being who deserves to die. As said above, I ruined two families. How did I do that? I ran away from my real family, who had locked me in a house for 19 years, forced me to be anorexic, and told me I was absolutely worthless. They beat me down at every opportunity so I took the first chance I could and ran. I found out later on that I'd ruined their lives. That my parents are now depressed. That they never want to see me again. 

I ruined the second by escaping to their home. I can't do anything right for them. I'm not good enough to help them out. I work 40 hours + a week and buy everything myself because I feel guilty for asking them for anything. I avoid everyone half the time because I feel like I'm just making the place worse for existing. I'm trying to find an apartment, but I don't make enough to get one where I live without government assistance. I'm trying so hard to show I'm grateful. I just feel like I've ruined their lives by existing.

I've ruined my boyfriend's life. He worries about me constantly now. He knows I'm thinking of suicide. He's even caught me trying to hang myself. I try to keep going for him. I have no other reason to live honestly, except that I'm afraid of what would happen to him if I did it. Sadly, here I am thinking of doing it again. 

I ruin people's lives by existing. I don't deserve to exist. anything i say ruins someones life and i'm so tired of being afraid of hurting someone. i just want it all to be over. i don't deserve a life. i wish i was never born. i wish i could just end it so that id have one final thing that was awful, and then everyone would forget i existed. my boyfriend would find someone better. my parents would be happy again, knowing i'm not out in the world and free anymore. the family i'm with i wouldn't be a burden to. i just wish i had the guts to do it tonight.
