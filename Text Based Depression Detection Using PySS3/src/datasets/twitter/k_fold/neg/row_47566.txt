The good times are gone, and it's my fault.I am a worthless man. I wish I would just die. People smile at me, but they secretly don't care whether they see me again or not. I can't be trusted. I'm a horrible person.

I've thought about suicide a lot. If I did, things would be better for everyone.

Haven't had a proper meal since last Thursday. Anxiety is starving me. It's what I deserve.
