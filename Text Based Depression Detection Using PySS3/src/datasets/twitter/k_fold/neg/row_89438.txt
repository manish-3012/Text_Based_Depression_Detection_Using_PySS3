I've already become the disappointment of the family, and I was the first to go to collegeIn an extended family filled with doctors engineers and nurses I've somehow found a way to mess up doing a computer science degree. My family has doen everything to support me and I've thrown it all away. I've become the source of their troubles and stress. But I'm a fucking coward and can't just die. I living in a high enough floor that jumping kills me. I have enough stuff in my room to poison me. I have towels and belts I can use to hang myself but I cand do it. I wish I could get a gun to just end it or find away to just die "accidentally". Just a quick death so my weak ass will accept it.
