Im probably going through with it tonightIm going to be completely honest, I turn 14 in December. I have diabetes and I hate my life. My mom gives me absolute shit every day and then expects me to talk to her like an old friend. Today she completely trashed my room and told me to clean it up. Donâ€™t get me wrong I have things to live for but itâ€™s not even enough. I need physical and emotional affection and I never get it, no one finds me attractive and I only have one friend whoâ€™s slowly drifting away from me. I have a bird and I love him but he always bites me and basically hates me. And once Iâ€™m gone my family can take good care of him, better than I could anyway.  Iâ€™m not complaining Iâ€™m just trying to explain to someone who will listen why I feel this way, Iâ€™ve asked my mom for a phycologist many times all to be ignored. I just want someone who will listen but my entire family treats me like shit and Iâ€™m tired of it.  Thanks for readinf
