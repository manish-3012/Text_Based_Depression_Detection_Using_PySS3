Why bother...I hate myself. I've been such a failure my entire life and every day I just become more and more useless to my family. I failed out of college after putting my parents 75k in debt, I lost many of my closest friends to depression, and now I'm just a shitshow who can't even afford therapy. I seriously just want to die. But I know I shouldn't, and I've been doing my best to not be suicidal. I just have no idea what to do.

Life feels empty and pointless. I worked my entire life to go to school and get a job, but now that I'm not in school, what the fuck am I supposed to do? I have no dreams or passions or anything. I've spent the past month trying to sort it out on my own, trying to find goals or find something worth living for, but it's just the same goddamn thing. I wake up, I go to work, I go to bed. I wake up, I go to work, I go to bed. Sure, I may do things inbetween like little activities or seeing friends, but it's still so empty and pointless. I've tried religion, I'm on depression medication, and I used to go to therapy, but of course the moment this all started I stopped being able to afford it, and I certainly can't afford going to a mental hospital.

I just want something to live for, something to work towards, some reason to get up in the morning...but at this point, I don't even see why I should bother. It'd be so much easier to end it. I wouldn't have to worry about money anymore, I wouldn't have to worry about being a failure, I could stop searching for a reason to live, and I could just sleep forever.
