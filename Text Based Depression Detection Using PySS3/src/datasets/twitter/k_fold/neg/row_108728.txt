I was just feeling suicidal yesterday.I read a post that scientists say that capitalism was going to ruin the earth irreparably until 2050 and I was sad in the moment, but later during the day I noticed that I was feeling suicidal.

 I'm in my mid-twenties, I spent my childhood and youth often miserable due to continuous abuse, I have no job, I struggled with a lack of support and mental health issues throughout my studies and now I am about to finish them with a degree that won't help me pay the rent anytime soon. 

I have friends but sometimes I feel like nobody other than my therapist can really get how much pain I've been through and am partially still going through because of what I experienced in terms of various kinds of deeply humiliating, soul-crushing violence. 

I feel like I wasn't allowed to be myself when I grew up and now that I'm grown up I don't know if I can do anything worthwhile in the couple of years that I still have left. I am too tired, too burnt out, too mentally ill to help stop climate change at this time. 

All I want to do is stay home and lick my own wounds until I feel reasonably safe in the world again. But how can I, knowing that the world is not safe and probably never will be again? I'm just so desperate to feel safe, heard and loved finally. 

My friends love me, my flatmates do, they all care, but I don't know how I'm supposed to talk to them about the existential dread of having been dropped in the world to deal with the kind of position my family left me in - Being traumatized and needing to sustain myself. 

It feels like I can never do what I want in life. It feels like my shitty parents put this self-destructive algorithm in my brain, and sometimes I feel imprisoned by the garbage they dumped on me, and imprisoned by the kind of politics we're experiencing at the moment, where people don't matter, no living being matters, only profit does. I just want some compassion and rest. I no longer want to be held accountable for everything that goes wrong somewhere.

I think I need to take a break from following any politics or news at all, from trying to do any activism at all, or my head is going to come off all on its own.

I think conversion therapy, the second COVID lockdown and the fact that there were terror attacks recently where I live also plays a role in this somewhere. It's too much. I don't know how I'm supposed to handle this.
