Severe Heartbreak. I Think Itâ€™s TimeIâ€™m 32. This isnâ€™t my first breakup or even my longest relationship, but I loved her more than anyone Iâ€™ve ever known. Sheâ€™s with someone else now, and I honestly donâ€™t think I can continue without her.

Itâ€™s been 16 days since the â€œGoodbyeâ€ text. In that 16 days, Iâ€™ve forced myself to be around friends, continued taking my anti-depressants, and have continued therapy. Nothing is working. Sheâ€™s on my mind every waking second. No activity, no matter how intensive or engaging can stop the thoughts of them.

I need to silence my aching head. Iâ€™ve written a note, and am looking into suicide options. I plan on doing it on Monday by hanging myself in my closet. Every second is crippling pain, and I canâ€™t live with it any more.

Learn from my mistakes. If you love someone, tell them while it still means something. 

Goodbye world.
