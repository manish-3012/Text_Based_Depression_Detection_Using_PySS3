My view on lifeLife is just like a game. You start playing the game. Youâ€™re still a beginner, but better than most players who have put much more time in than you. You have achieved a lot in the game. People tell you that youâ€™re doing great, and you are. You donâ€™t like the game though, you donâ€™t want to play anymore, in fact, you never wanted to play in the first place. You have the right to quit the game, and who are those other players to tell you to stay and play the game? Why does it even matter what they want and what they say if youâ€™re not enjoying the game? Why is it a bad thing to just quit and not play? In the end of the day youâ€™re not enjoying it, why should you continue playing? It makes absolutely no sense. The point of the game, in the end of the day, is to be happy. To enjoy it, but you arenâ€™t.
