I'm getting to the point of killing myself.Hey everyone, my name is Will and I've been starting to feel depressed.  Its starting to get to the point where I'm honestly thinking its better to be dead then it is to be alive.  A little bit about myself, I am currently in my last year of highschool, I get just over passing grades (50-60%).  I am unemployed and have no money, that with my family not be in a stable financial position.  I have very bad anxiety which is where my depression comes from.  I've been putting in job applications which I don't get responses from, I sent applications to colleges where I have very little hope of getting accepted because of my grades and my school record.  My whole life is revolving around getting into a college so I have at least a little hope of getting a career that I can live off of, but if I can't get into college I don't know what to do.  It seems like everything I had planned is just collapsing around me.  I am anti social and don't have many friends.  I spend most of my time by myself in my room avoiding people.

I just don't know what to do right now.  Thanks for taking the time to read this.
