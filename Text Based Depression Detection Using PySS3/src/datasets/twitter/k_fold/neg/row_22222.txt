.i have perfected fooling everyone into thinking iâ€™m great unless i bring something up. my roommates donâ€™t know me, itâ€™s very surface level. all my friends and family are nowhere near me. my pain is my own, my loneliness is my own. 

i feel my life is worthless and pointless. all i so is suffer no matter how good my circumstance is. 

i want to die. i donâ€™t know how much more of this torture i can endure.
