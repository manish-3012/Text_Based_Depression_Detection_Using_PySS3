WellI guess it's come to this, complaining about my issues online because I have no one else to talk to. I feel quite dumb saying all of this being that I'm only 16, and I'm not sure if it's the fact that I'm a teenager or my physically and mentally abusive past that has made me 'depressed'. I hate using that word considering I haven't been diagnosed. I've told everyone in my family I'm depressed and that I'm seeing things. When I told my mother she laughed in my face, it was a while ago but since then she has abandoned me, she essentially kicked me out when I was 15 (almost 17 now) while I was doing my exams (I'm in the UK) meaning I had to move in with my brother in my dad's house which he didn't live in, I essentially fucked up my exams completely because of this and didn't pass any of them, my brother eventually moved out forcing me to become a sponge to my other older brother. My mother still hasn't spoken to me and continues to ignore my texts even after all this time. I'm now going to college doing a subject I deffibately don't want to do, I don't know what I want to do anymore and to be honest suicide is all I can think of to escape this hell, it may seem to some of you if anyone is even reading this that I'm another teenager complaining about non existent issues because I'm too narrow sighted and immature to realise the big picture or some shit, maybe so. I have no real life or online friends, no one at all to talk to and I honestly don't see the point in therapy or drugs, I don't want to live with false emotions, even if the ones I'm living with now are non existent. I feel like I'm so broken that I'd pass for a sociopath. I don't really fear death anymore and I honestly don't think I have anything left to live for, I have no enthusiasm or will to improve my life. But regardless, I'm not sure what Im expecting from posting this or if anyone will even read all of it since it's extremely drawn out. Idfk what to do anymore tbh.
