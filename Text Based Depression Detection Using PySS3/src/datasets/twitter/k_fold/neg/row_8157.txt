I wrote a noteIâ€™ve never written a note before. Itâ€™s never felt this real. Iâ€™m ready, but I donâ€™t know how to do it. Iâ€™ve never felt as ready to be done with this life. I hope I can think of a way, but Iâ€™ll likely just go to bed and wake up again. I wish it was easier to do this. Iâ€™ll most likely talk to you tomorrow guys.
