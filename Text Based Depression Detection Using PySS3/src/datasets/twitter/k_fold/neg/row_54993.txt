Maybe I should kill myself19 with horrible luck, past 2 years have been the worst I've ever had. I keep trying to progress but some bullshit always happens, a family member dies and I get kicked out of the college program after attending their funeral which is already enough emotional stress to deal with. I am behind on HS credits since I was a troubled teen with emotional abuse. Later I try to reenroll and I wasted a semester trying to reenroll and failing both attempts due to more bullshit happening. I lose my job due to false accusations and then get into 2 attempted robbery's and have a gang of kids threatening to kill me telling me to kill myself. My girlfriend abuses me emotionally and physically and might have cheated on me with some dude off tinder, and has moved away. I am now stuck with my toxic family and with a manipulative relative. My dad is a multi millionaire but pretends I don't exist, and tried to use me for tax fraud. I used to be very attractive but have since gained weight from being out of the gym for over a year. Dealing with PTSD and found out I basically had PTSD my whole life due to child abuse and truamatic memories I still have from when I was 3 lol, I don't know anymore, feels like life has no meaning. I have nowhere else to go other then 6 feet under at this point. I may or may not have genius level intellect and death always sparked my curiosity, how bad can it be.

Edit: forgot to mention car accident I was in and a friend dying.
