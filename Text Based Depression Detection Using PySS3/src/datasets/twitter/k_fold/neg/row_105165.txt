iâ€™m sorryiâ€™ve been fighting for so fucking long and i canâ€™t do it anymore. iâ€™m finally at the point where nothing anyone says or does will make me feel better. i moved across the country for school a few months ago and all of my friends/family have completely lost contact with me and i canâ€™t deal with the loneliness anymore. see you on the other side &lt;3
