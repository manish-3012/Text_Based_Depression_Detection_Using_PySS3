I've wasted everyone's time here for too long.I've posted here and in other sub's for so long now. I've had so many people message me, and every time I say I'm okay now. I'm lying every time. 

I don't know why I pretend to have a grip on depression. I always tell people that I won't give up without a fight, or that I'll keep going and prove it wrong. I can't even blame it, because I am so stupid that I can't even decide to die. My life has been one downward spiral after another, but I put on a smile and say I'm okay. I've lied to everyone, my therapist, my friends, and you guys. 

I don't know if I want to die, or if I want to live. I don't want to do anything, I just want the world to move on without me. I want to sit down and never move, never be betrayed again. I don't want to lie anymore, I want people to stop asking me so I don't have to. 

My birthdays in a couple of minutes, and I don't know what to do anymore...
