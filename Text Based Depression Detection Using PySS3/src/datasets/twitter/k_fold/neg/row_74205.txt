I want to dieMy parents can't afford to pay the mortgage, my step dad is a jackass who talks shit about me behind my back all the time, my financial situation is in complete ruins, I've become addicted to cutting myself (I'm a 21 year old little boy who's not even a man) My real dad has been dead since I was 3 years old. I found a job a month ago at a hospital, but the management team is delaying my start date because they lost my certificate sheet for CPR and First Aid and they're telling me to redo it again on August 6th when I've already done the damn fucking class and passed the goddamn test. Also I had orientation with the same company. I found out that it was actually paid orientation, and that people got money. I didn't receive anything! My friend got $55, and I got jack shit. The company I got hired is G4S, and they "promised" me a post at a nearby hospital that's only 20 minutes away from my house. 

My stepdad is an asshole who likes to get drunk on a daily basis and neglect his wife. He can't pay the mortgage this month for our house, which means that my mom and I will be homeless. My mom will go to a womens shelter, but I hate shelters and I'll just sleep like a bum on a park bench. My step-dad is planning on abandoning our house and he's... a fucking dipshit who can go to hell. He obviously doesn't give a shit about me nor my mom, so he's going to just leave us out on the streets with no home. My mom wants to live in a shelter and be away from my stepdad. The piece of shit is ruining my life. Whenever my step-dad complains or argues with my mom, there's a risk that we can be thrown out onto the streets. 

I can't live like this anymore! I honestly wish God would show me mercy and give me cancer so I can die a peaceful death. If I commit suicide, I risk going to Hell. I didn't ask to even be born though! I didn't ask for this shitty fucking life, and I didn't ask to be suicidal. Why will I go to hell for killing myself?! Why? Why can't you just do it for me then God?! Can you not understand how difficult my life is, and the shit I have to go through, every single fucking day... GODDAMMIT! I want out! I want to go and meet my real dad! I want Cancer and I want to die. 

Here's 3 more problems that I am forced to endure through:

And don't tell me to go to the hospital! There's only 1 hospital at my town, and it's where I plan to work. If I go in as a suicidal patient I could risk losing my job. And I desperately need money. 

Please, God, the merciful, the Almighty, please just give me a terminal illness like Cancer so I can die a peaceful death and so I can go up to the heavens and see my Dad again. :( I can't handle this world, I can't handle the stress of this life, I can't handle living. I cannot. It was a mistake to put me on this Earth, and now I want to fix that mistake.
