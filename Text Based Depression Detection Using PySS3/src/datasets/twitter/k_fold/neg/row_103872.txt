I don't think I want to keep goingLife works in mysterious ways, for a while everything was going amazingly well. I didn't even think of looking at what could go wrong. My future was set and I was so happy. 

In just 2 weeks it all just came crumbling down. I had to watch my life fall apart and I had no control over any of it. I was helpless then and i'm hopeless now. 

My grandfather died, my girlfriend broke up with me, my job is getting worse, and my family still treats me like shit. After being knocked down like this I realized i've lost sense of who I am. I don't like living anymore. I'm lost and I don't think it's going to get better. I'm just a waste of space. There is no hope for me anymore...I dont feel like doing anything, I dont feel like living anymore

All I can think about is how peaceful it would be to be dead and not have to worry about anything anymore or cause anybody more trouble..I find myself crying to sleep every night now 

this isn't fun
