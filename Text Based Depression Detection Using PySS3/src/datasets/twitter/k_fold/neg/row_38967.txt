Some adviceA few years ago I was at the point where I was considering taking my own life. I had written a note and everything I just didn't know how I was going to do the deed. I decided to wait a week and see if anything would changed. That decision saved my life. During that week I came to the realization that I was loved. There is always someone in your life who loves you. If you think no-one does, your wrong. I do. Wait a week before making a drastic decision. Reach out to someone who can help you. Proverbs 3:5-6 "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths."
