I'm TiredI'm a coward, I wrote it a whole post and couldn't post it.
TL;DR I'm thinking about killing myself on a daily basis.
I've been sick since before birth.
I'm autistic
I have OCD, PTSD,C-PTSD, Major depression, Severe anxiety-general and social.
I take my medications as prescribed
Tried to kill myself when 6, 13, 19, &amp; 23
The last attempt was stopped by someone on Omegle that convinced drunk bleeding me to walk to the nearby ER.
Traumatized by first encounter with counseling/therapy after being raped and subsequently betrayed by 90% of my friends.
I am in constant pain, I have non-stop tinnitus.
Letting go of my hope of reconciliation with my ex is also letting go of the hope to be healthy, leading to a drastic uptick in suicidal thoughts- to the point of having a plan and writing goodbye letters to loved ones.
I can no longer say I don't have a plan or am in no danger of killing myself without it being a lie.

I'm just tired of being in pain for the sake of others.
My illness is progressing and will only get worse.
I already am starting to have difficulty driving safely, which is basically my only skill.
I'm terrified that I will have to file bankruptcy before I get approved for SSI. I've been waiting for a judgment on my hearing since January 9th. I applied mid 2016.

Is it fair that I suffer so no one has to think about my death?
Is my pain worth less than theirs?
