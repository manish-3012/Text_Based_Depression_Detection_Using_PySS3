Currently crying about wanting to die &amp; using a suicide prevention shirt as a snot rag.I bought the shirt off people selling them @ some random grocery store in my town, I wear it to bed every night cuz I like it. Itâ€™s the only thing I have on hand to blow my nose into, how ironic. 

But it made me laugh a little at how pathetic I am rn, so I feel better.
