Going to kill myself this weekend. (Long)First and foremost, I know that this will be a long post so I apologize for that. I don't particularly know why I write this, but I suppose it's a goodbye. If this post happens to violate any of the guidelines, I'm sorry. I'll do my best to avoid all of the unnecessary details that fill my life. Let's just sum it up by stating that my unhappiness is a result of my own actions and idiosyncrasies. My habits of always putting myself first, getting angry at the slightest thing (as well as taking it out on others), and my consistent lying to those I love are just a few examples of what I mean.

So, with that said, I plan on hanging myself this weekend. I've got a note written out just in case anyone I know cares enough about me to wonder why I did what I did. I also wrote it to apologize to those who do matter to me. The only thing left for me to do is to clean up my house a bit. I haven't cleaned up in a long while and would rather not have my body discovered surrounded in the absolute filth that is my room. 

Truthfully, I don't want to die, but I know that it is what is ultimately best for me and everyone around me. I'm an unintelligent failure of a life with no future and I don't deserve to be helped or even have existed in the first place. I know everyone is better off without me, so I guess you could say that this is the very first time that I'm putting someone other than myself first. 

If anyone I know somehow finds this, I'm sorry for the way I was. I genuinely did love you all despite my actions and (sometimes) words. Thank you all for your time, whether it was enjoyed or not, it was appreciated.
