how do i let go of the rageim angry, and i want to die so that my father can suffer. ive tried too hard for too long to stay afloat, to do whats right and become better than hell ever be. 

but he doesnt deserve to see that. he doesnt deserve to see me succeed, to get into a good college, to accomplish more than he could ever fathom and then try to take credit for it. not after all the pain and terror hes inflicted for almost a decade and a half on my mom and on me for the entirety of my existence. 

any love for my mom and consideration for what shell go through has been eclipsed by how much i hate my father. i want to be rid of him, but i want to haunt him, i want him to live the rest of his days knowing his only child committed suicide just to spite him.

i want him to experience the irreversible damage hes done to me, and yknow what? i can do it in a completely legal way. i cant hurt him physically, it seems the years of abuse has made me completely petrified of any and all sorts of confrontation, but i can hurt myself. and it scares me that im okay with that. 

how do i let go of the anger in a healthy way? how can i block the negativity out, when i cant leave it behind? how do i cope until then?
