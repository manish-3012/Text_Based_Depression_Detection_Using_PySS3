Hate my life. I'm going to be a miserable person for the rest of my life.For starters, I am a gay guy who lives in superficial Los Angeles. I might have body dysmorphic disorder as I have skipped classes because I've felt too ugly. I rarely go out because of that too. I can't work because I am too fixated on my appearance. I feel disgusting everyday. 

I have no irl friends. I only have two online friends, and one of them lives in Saudi Arabia. Long story short, the Saudi guy and I have been getting closer but I have refused to send a face picture because I do not like my appearance. I don't even have any selfies. Now I am most likely going to lose him since we've been growing apart due to my insecurities.

And I can't even get a job. I am too scared to work, and too scared of people judging me. I am miserable everyday. My parents probably see me as a failure. I don't want to be miserable my whole life. I don't know how I will be able to change. I want to end it all, but I am a coward. I am too scared to go through with it. Can I just disappear? I hate myself. 

Sorry for the incoherent rant :(
