Why are there no resources for people who attempted suicide?There is nothing out there for people who just attempted suicide. Its all for people who are actively suicidal. If youre lucky enough to have a therapist, youre just expected to continue treatment as normal. You might be sent to a hospital due to your attempt, but those havent been shown to be very effective, and disrupt the normal life that may have been able to go back to. PHP also disrupt your life, and both are extremely expensive. Cant there be like support groups for people who attempted? So that we have extra support to deal with the stress of going back to life, after we thought we would have no life at all?
