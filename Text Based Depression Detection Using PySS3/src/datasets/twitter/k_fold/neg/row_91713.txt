Im fucking done. Im planning shit outI've had enough. Years and years of this fucking shit. Trying to cope, failing, trying to die, failing, trying to survive, failing. Im just done. Im tired of the guilt i get even boiling therapy. Im tired of feeling sorry that i tried to kill myself, i deserved love and support not guilt and being shamed. Im tired of turning to people broken and sad, ripping myself apart just to open up. Just to say my feelings even when they rip my throat as they come up. What's the point of all that wgrhit just ends up being arguments, guilt tripping, shaming. Why is it ny fault that my siblings and i were raised like this. Why do i have to be made guilty by even my family for this depression i never fucking asked for. Im in a constant fucking hell and they just make it worse. I was stupid to tell them. I was stupid to tell anyone. Because everything is a fucking game to them. Everything is just arguments and shit. Im about to spend the next few fucking months acting like im fine. Holding off. Pretending. I will not have the space to be alone and safe and to process any of my feelings. Im going to have to act like i don't have intrusive thoughts that make me want to destroy the world around me. Im going to have to pretend im a person that isn't dead
