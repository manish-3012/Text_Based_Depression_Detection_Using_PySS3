Please remember thisOkay, let me tell you something. This is not out of the blue or anything. This is from my experience as well others.
When someone attempts suicide or seems to show suicidal traits, you are not supposed to hit them with aggressive sentences like "Are you crazy? What the fuck is wrong with you?" and insensitive sentences like "Maybe, try this, it will help you die easily" or "Suicide is for the cowards".
For a moment, take a step back and stand in their shoes. Try to understand, why they took such a big step. Ask questions like "Are you feeling fine?" "Are you okay?" "Do you wanna talk about it?" and "I'm always here".
That's the sign of an emotionally mature person who knows what to say when.
Do not also try to justify their actions by comparing your pain to theirs. Their journey, their struggles, their hurt are absolutely different from yours. Their tolerance level is different. You're not doing any good by constantly showering comparisons in disguise of advices.
Be considerate, be kind and approach such people gently. So many of you have to learn this that it deeply saddens me.
