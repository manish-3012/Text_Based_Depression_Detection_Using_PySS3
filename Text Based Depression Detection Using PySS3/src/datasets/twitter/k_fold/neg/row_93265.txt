I really don't know what to do.I'm going to school full time and I have a 2 year old little boy. my family has disowned me for forsaking their "religion". I am alone. My SO and I recently broke up. I have no one. No one to talk to or call or anything. This loneliness is eating me alive. I don't have any income to take care of my son. No way to pay my bills. Its like I'm fucking stuck. I sometimes feel he would be better off with out me. These  feelings are especially prominent tonight. I feel like someone else can give my son the life he deserves. I'm three Weeks away from graduating hair school and have no idea what to do now. I'm lost. Utterly lost.
