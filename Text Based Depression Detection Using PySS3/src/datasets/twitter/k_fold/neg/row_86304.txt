its always the little thingsMy life is falling apart around me but it's always the little stupid shit that makes me want to put a gun in my mouth. Wake up to cat poop outside the box? Better kill myself. Waited too long to get tickets for something I wanted so much? Welp that's depression for you so I'd better kill myself. The only thing keeping me here is all the videos of people dying I've been watching. They look so pitiful immediately after that I don't want to give anyone the satisfaction of looking at my dead body and being able to pity me or say what a shame that they killed themself over something so trivial. Like, look at that idiot, suicide because the sheets won't stay on the bed or something.
