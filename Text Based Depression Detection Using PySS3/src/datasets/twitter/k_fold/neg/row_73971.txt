I really think i'm going to do itI have destroyed myself completely to the point of irreversible damage. Everyday i think about my mistakes in self hate and guilt that's insufferable. My therapist wants to hospitalize me but I think I'll commit before. I think opening up my veins would be the best option. What do you guys think please i need people to answer this i can't take it anymore
