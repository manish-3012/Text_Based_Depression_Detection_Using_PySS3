No one cares...I just feel like no one cares, and no one would care if I killed myself. Well, I know my family loves me, but they're almost obligated to, and we're not that close. Everyone who knows who I am really hates me, and it would be better for them if I was gone. My friends are leaving me; I have one role model that I really care about that I don't think even cares. And the worst thing is that I can't talk to anyone about it; I'm ostracized, or it makes them hate me even more. I hate who I am too, but I can't tell anyone that because they'd immediately put me in a hospital or tell my school's admin. I just feel so alone. People would be better off without me.
