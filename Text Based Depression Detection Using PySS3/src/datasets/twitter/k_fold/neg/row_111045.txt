I can't do this anymoreI can't handle life anymore. I'm agoraphobic and I have a panic disorder. I hardly leave my house and when I do the panic won't stop. Now the panic is attacking me in my own home, I can't even lay in bed without feeling dizzy. It feels like I can't even get a break. I never used to be like this. I used to travel the world, I had friends, I partied, I worked, I lived my life and I loved it. Now I'm stuck at home 24/7 because I can't leave the house. With this PD getting worse I feel like I'm going to have no choice but to kill myself. I don't want to die, but I can't live my life like this. Hell, I'm not even living it anymore.
