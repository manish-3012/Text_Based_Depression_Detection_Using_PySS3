My mom passed away and I want to end my pain.My mom passed away a few months ago so suddenly and unexpectedly. She was only 55. Iâ€™m in my early 20s, I still need her. The pain has been insane. I donâ€™t want to live in a world without her. 


I know my dad and siblings are and will always hurt too. But I watched my mom die and every time I close my eyes I am back in the hospital room with her. 


I find peace in imagining myself committing suicide. I think I will soon.
