I asked for help. I didn't get it. Now I want to kill myself just to spite them.I've been depressed for so long I genuinely can't tell if I even am or if adults just aren't supposed to be happy.

 I wanted help at some point. I asked for it, they made me beg, and then wouldn't give it. I won't go through the whole sob story here but sometimes I just want to be a part of the statistic.

 I don't think I even want to be happy. I just want to die. I know I still have years ahead of me and I want none of them. I haven't liked life so far, why the hell should I have to deal with, fuck, 90 years more?

This is a stupid game and I don't want to play. I want to stop life from happening and to be left the fuck alone and not have to deal with anyone or anything or ever hear of anything or be heard of ever again. I want to stop existing.

I just want everything to stop.
