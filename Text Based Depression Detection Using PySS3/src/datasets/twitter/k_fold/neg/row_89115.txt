Suicide is the only option to be free since somethings are irreversibleI will not hang on like a thread , to hope which is bullshit. I will not allow my life to be determined by a drug company, by this shitty you people built and are proud of, to this fucked up existence and universe which provides nothing chaos, misery, entropy, destruction, etc. There are so many, perhaps most, situations where you can control, but not mine. I hope death brings you half the joy I know in my heart it will bring me.
