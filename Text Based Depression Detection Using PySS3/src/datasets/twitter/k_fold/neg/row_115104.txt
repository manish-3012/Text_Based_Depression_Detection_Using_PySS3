Tooth infection is slowly killing me, but I might just kill myself before it doesI am 18 and have a severe tooth infection, but cannot afford health insurance. I have tried to get in at several dentists and even though it's bad they give me antibiotics and send me away. It's a constant pounding in my gums and the blood and pus is beginning to be too much. As someone who is already suicidal for other reasons this makes me want to end it all. I'd rather shoot myself than continue to sit in agony.
