Why am I still here?Hello,
I'm a 15 years old female student. My current school is very small (40 students in total with 6 classes). I have no friends, the girls in my class are in a group together, the 2 boys are mocking me, but not in a rude way. I have no friends outside of school, either. My entire life, I have dreamt of being a Writer and have worked hard, until I realized a few months ago, that I have no talent and no matter, how hard I try, my phrases and lines are all cringeworthy. I have no talent in anything what so ever. I am not a fun person to hang around with; not funny, etc. I am ugly, as I stased in my previous posts, I am stupid and have bad marks in every single subject at school. Even though I am learning so much more than my beautiful, funny and special classmates, I am never going to as good as them. I have, I don't and I won't succeed in life. Poeple tell me to "explore" so I can find my talent, but where am I supposed to search for new stuff? Everything is a subject at school: Art, Writing (languages), sports. I am sick and tired of myself. Always ugly, always dumb, always lonely. If I has at least something I could be proud of... Next friday, 19.02.2016, I am forced to go sledging with the whole school and I will be alone. How embarrassing. I want to be dead by then.
I am sorry for my messy english, It's not my mother language (not that this could be an excuse).
Thank You for reading. I hope, that You have a great day.
