Will the police do a wellfare check?So I decided to contact the crisis line and long story short i fell asleep so thwy did their job and contacted  EMS and I got a call just now. I denied them to come over rn to check on me because of everyone sleeping but i was honest with not being alone. But, now im concered the police will do a wellfare check tomorrow with my parents home. I plan to be upfront with my mother since she's willing to at least bring me to therapy. Just the whole call alone got me really shook up. I need to hear your thoughts.
