I want to be someoneThe noose is ready, hanging there. It stares at me, tempting me to feel its grasp around my neck. It mocks me. Asking why I continue to search for help when the answer is right there. It knows things get better. But its inpatient, watching the seconds pass waiting and waiting without knowing what it waits for. Why did I have to fall so suddenly? My life was made, it was what I wanted. But with it came a rising storm of unforeseen darkness that rots all in its path, rots to the core. My voice is drowned and choked as I sink into the depths of my mind, begging for some return to the life I once knew. The place of happiness I once knew. I never wanted to die. I never wanted to plan out my own demise. It came suddenly and no longer was my heartbeat the sound of drums banging but a mellow thud of boots wandering lost in the dark. I want nothing more than to feel again. To feel alive. To feel happy. To be someone once more.
