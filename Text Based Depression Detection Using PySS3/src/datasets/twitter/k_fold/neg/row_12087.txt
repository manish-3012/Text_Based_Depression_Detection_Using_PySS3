I am going to kill myselfI'm not looking for attention, I just want to put this stuff down so that atleast someone knows my reasons. I have a horrible life. My dad never wanted me, my mum hates me, and has told me so herself. I'm 16 and I have absolutely no friends, at all. My stupid boyfriend ruins my self esteem daily and emotionally blackmails me into staying with him and I can't get out of the relationship. The only time I leave my room is to go to work and to get food when I'm starving. I don't go to school, because when I lost all my friends, I gave up on trying to get good grades, I fail everything, I've ruined my future. I have no reason to alive at all. No one wants me and I don't want to be alive.

I'm really scared to die, but I just keep thinking, how can it get any worse? Being dead and feeling nothing from anyone, is no different to being here and feeling nothing from anyone, except if I'm dead I won't feel the pain. I'm really scared but I need to do it. I can't live like this anymore. My life is stupid and useless and I hate it.

EDIT: I was really upset when I wrote this down, and now that I've calmed down I can see it wasn't a good idea. Thank you all so much for your kind comments, I'm so glad reddit exists.
