I want to kill myself because my depression is a cycle that will never endI am a 21 year old female. I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 13. Sometimes life feels okay. I struggle and fight so that I can be â€œhappyâ€ and for awhile it works okay and then it fails. I have a brain that is wired wrong and I want to put a bullet through it. There is no escape from this cycle of feeling depressed and fighting to feel okay, only to feel even worse the next time. Iâ€™m on medication. Iâ€™ve been on tons of medications. Gone through multiple therapists. 

I am a waste of space and I know that if I kill myself I will not be wasting oxygen or food that could go to people who matter. I donâ€™t know if this post even belongs here but I guess I needed to tell someone because I canâ€™t tell anyone I know and be an even bigger burden on them.
