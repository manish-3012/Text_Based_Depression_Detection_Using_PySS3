Fin.I keep putting it off because of my family. But I've been gone and no one noticed. No one misses me. I may as well just go for good. Is it selfish to commit suicide? Is it more selfish to expect someone you love to live their remaining days in misery? Whose misery will be deeper, my own or theirs? Whose misery is most important? 
But I know how now. And I know why. And so I'll go. I'm sorry momma. I didn't mean to be this person.
