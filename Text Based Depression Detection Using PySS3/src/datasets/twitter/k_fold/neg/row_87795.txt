What is success?I don't understand what I actually want. What is this ideal success that I'm always hungry for, always loathing myself for being so far from? What would make me happy?

And if it doesn't exist, what am I to do?

Sixteen and I already feel like an utter failure. No accomplishments to my name, unintelligent, uninteresting, worthless. I can see other people's bright futures stretching ahead of them, and I have nothing. Only dullness and stupidity. I'll never get anywhere. Is it worth it to try anyway?
