I want to so bad.I just posted on MMFB and i got some very nice comments, but i have been sinking deeper and deeper into the mindset that i need to do this. I made a rash decision to quit my job, my girlfriend broke up with me, and she has made it clear that she no longer wants anything to do with me. I know i have much more to do in this world, but i don't want to. I want to be gone. I tried last night but i couldn't go through with it. Now i am just laying in bed thinking about my next move. I want to end this so badly.
