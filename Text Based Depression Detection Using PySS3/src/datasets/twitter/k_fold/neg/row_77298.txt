Do it for them [vent]I told both of my parents that I would kill myself if it wasn't for them. It's absolutely true; nothing gives me more peace than imagining myself jumping off a bridge. But that choice isn't mine to make, unfortunately. I can't even cut myself because they would flip the fuck out, making my life situation even more painful. I don't want anything or do anything because there is nothing inside me. I only exist to avoid making my parents bury a child. I'm stuck between life and death because I'm not really living anymore.

EDIT: I stopped seeing my therapist because there's nothing he can say to me.
