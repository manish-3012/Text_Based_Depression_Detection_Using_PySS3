Im 40, Fun, Interactive, good looking, but I'm very suicidal and it's not working the way I have heard. Why not. And why doni feel this wayU cant asked a person how did they kill their self by hanging. I found reddit by accident. Googled why I hang from a raftter for an hour waiting for the lights to go out. But instead I come to with a puddle of saliva at my feet and a 8 inch bruised and now scab across my neck. Tried to do it against last night but the pain of a cord around my bruised, dried and scabbed neck makes the burning sensation impossible while sober.
