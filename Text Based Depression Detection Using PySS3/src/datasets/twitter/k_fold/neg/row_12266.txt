I donâ€™t think i can keep this up any longerFor a couple of months now i have been thinking about my life. What have i done, what i havenâ€™t done, what it could be in the future. And i can help it but feel like there isnâ€™t a purpose anymore. Living feels like a useless painful existence. Im a 17 year old I shouldnâ€™t be like that, but fuck me i cannot do this anymore. I havenâ€™t got anyone to talk about it either. I tried to, i talked with a I would say close friend of mine and he gave me the â€œThings would get better donâ€™t worryâ€ and â€œCome on, its not that badâ€. Something that didnâ€™t really help much. I donâ€™t know what would help. I used to be an absolute asshole, most of the people i know hated breathing the same air as me i saw that, so I decided that i will become a better man, a better person. And it worked. People did change their opinion of me. 
But that didnâ€™t really help.
I enjoy it when i can be of help, i feel somewhat useful. The problem is that i canâ€™t help myself. I donâ€™t know what i want. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do. I mean, i know, i think that its my only option to get out of the mess my life is. I know that it would hurt the people around me, but i have no other choice. I hope that with time they would understand. They would do fine without me anyway. I never really connected with them. Most of the time my group of â€œfriendsâ€ talk and do stuff Iâ€™m not particularly good at like writing and reading poetry, books and so on and so forth. I try to participate but i still feel like a dumbass whenever i do. They are not particularly interested in mine, donâ€™t blame em tbh, my interests are video games, playing them and making them and cooking. Not that interesting. I donâ€™t have a girlfriend. No girl would fancy me, probably for the best i can only imagine how much of a bad company i am. Family is all over the place, they donâ€™t like me I donâ€™t like them.
Not sure where Iâ€™m going with this, i just want some help. There are people that are in worse situations i know, but i really cannot do this anymore.
