I'm suicidal and my friend just attempted suicide last night. How can I support her when I can't help myself?Last night one of my best friends tried to hang herself. We got her admitted to the ER and she's in a behavioral centre now awaiting treatment. I myself have been suicidal since eighth grade. What can I do to be there for her? I was to be supportive, but I don't know what to say since I struggle with the same things. Thanks for reading.
