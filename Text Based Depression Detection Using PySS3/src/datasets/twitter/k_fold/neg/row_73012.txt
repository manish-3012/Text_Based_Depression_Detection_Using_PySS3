Close to ending it all.I made 1 stupid decision, and I've thrown my whole life out the window. 

I'm pretty positive I'm going to get fired. At this point it's a matter of when rather than if. And it will ruin my entire career, and will probably stop me from getting another job of value. 

 I've contemplated offing myself. The embarrassment, and disappointment I've given/ will give people is too much for my mental health. 

I'm not happy, I dont know what else to do. I dont know what's going to happen. I'm not sure if I will actually be able to recover. I dont know what anything means anymore. 

I dont even know how to tell my closest friends, because what I did is so stupid and embarrassing, I dont want them to even know. 

I lay here just worthless and empty. Everything feels empty, I feel empty
