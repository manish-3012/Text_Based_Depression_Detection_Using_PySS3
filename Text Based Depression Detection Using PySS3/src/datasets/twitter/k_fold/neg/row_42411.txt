How can I leave without hurting my family and friends. It's just not fairI just feel numb, life doesn't have anything for me. And I'm okay with that. I'm not angry or sad. Just numb, like I have nothing that interests me or a reason to live other than family and friends. I'm okay with ending it all, that doesn't bother me. But what bothers me is the people I leave behind. There's no way to just opt out of life. I just want to not exist, and not hurt the people I love in the process. It's just not fair that I'm forced to live, just to keep them happy. I wouldn't even care if they went on with out the slightest bit of care for my death. That's how I'd want it. Then to just move on and forget about me. That'd be perfect. But there's no way of not hurting them. And it's really getting to me. It's just not fair I'm alive just so people aren't sad at my death. Like living in this state is okay as long as I'm alive. If only they celebrated what time they had with me. And be happy that I've escaped and gotten what I wanted. I really just wanna them to understand that this is the best thing for me, and not be mad or hurt, just happy that it's over.
