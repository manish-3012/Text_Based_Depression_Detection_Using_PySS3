I donâ€™t wanna feel anymoreI fuck everything up.

Literally every relationship becomes toxic. I donâ€™t want to be like this anymore. Thoughts racing through my head telling me Iâ€™m not worthy of being loved and I should just kill myself all the time. And the worst part is Iâ€™m too pussy to actually do it. I canâ€™t talk to anyone around me about it without stressing them out and annoying them. Right now the only thing keeping me alive is my dog. 

I wish someone could understand ... 
I wish someone would just validate my feelings and I wish I didnâ€™t get blamed every time something goes wrong.
