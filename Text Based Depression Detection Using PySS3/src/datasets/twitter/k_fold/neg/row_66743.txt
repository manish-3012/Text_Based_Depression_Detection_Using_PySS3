I want to kill myself because I can't get a girlfriend.I'm 18 and I'm a senior in high school. The last time I had a girlfriend was in 2016. I was 15. My speech therapist is lucky, he got married for the first time in his entire life. He was in his late 40s when he finally got married. *I'm not going to wait 50 years of my life just for a partner.* I already have a history of attempted suicide from last year. Every therapist in my school is lucky because they have a partner and I don't. I never want to get married. I got bullied by males. How do I attempt suicide with materials at home?
