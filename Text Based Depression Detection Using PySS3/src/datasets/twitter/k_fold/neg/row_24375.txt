I was going to kill myself todayBut then I found out that it's Valentine's day. There are so many things wrong in my life but not having a partner is the least of them. I don't want people to think that's the reason I ended my life because it's not. I don't want my family to have something else to blame it on. I want them to feel responsible for it, because they are.
