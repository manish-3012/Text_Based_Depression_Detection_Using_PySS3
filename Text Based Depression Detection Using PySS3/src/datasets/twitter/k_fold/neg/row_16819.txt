How can I live with being a bad person?I am a bad person. My family hates me; every interaction will start out well, and one thing leads to another, I slip up, and it ends in a horrible argument. Always my fault, and it always feels accidental. Like dropping a glass and trying to catch it in midair. My boyfriend deserves better than me on pretty much every measurable standard, and no matter how much we love each other, this creeps into our life together slowly. I am never my friendsâ€™ first choice. I have always just been an addition to a group.
See, people say Iâ€™ll feel better and they can think of a million cool coping mechanisms, but what is the point? I am a bad person, a negative influence over the lives of all that I meet. Why would it matter if I feel better, if itâ€™s not about how I feel at all?
