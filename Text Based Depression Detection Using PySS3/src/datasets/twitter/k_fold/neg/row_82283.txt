It is hope that keeps us alive. Nothing less, nothing more.We may think that we don't make the step because we don't want to hurt our loved ones and it's true up to a certain point. Some of us are also afraid of dying, afraid of the pain and the process. 
In the end, it's the survival instinct that stops us. Hope, the strongest force in this world, the limitless fuel. The love for oneself and all that yet may change.
