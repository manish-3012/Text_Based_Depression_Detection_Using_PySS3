I lost my best friend in the world yesterday; he greatly undervalued himself, and I just wanted to say: you are amazing. You are unique and I love you.He was a good man, and he had much left to give. He thought himself without value, would not believe praise, but the world is much darker without him. I won't presume to know how you feel and tell you what to do, but please never make any irrevocable decisions in the heat of passion; we are not logical animals, and that is when we are furthest from reason's guiding light.

If anyone for any reason needs to talk about anything, do not hesitate to msg me.
