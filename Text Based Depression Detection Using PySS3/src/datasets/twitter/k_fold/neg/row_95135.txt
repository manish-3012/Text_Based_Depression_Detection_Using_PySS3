I want help, but I don't know what to do anymore.I don't know if this is the right place for this kind of post, but I don't know where else to post and I need to get this out. This is a throwaway. This post is long. 

I've been struggling for years. I'm mentally ill, I know that much, but every doctor I've been to has told me something different. Some of them said I'm depressed, most say I'm type 2 bipolar, some have tossed out the idea of PTSD, some say I'm fine and I just need more sunlight. The only consensus is that *something* is wrong with me. 

I don't remember the last time my mind felt stable and happy. Maybe when I was a kid? I don't know. I was raped for two years, starting when I was six, by my then stepfather. My mom didn't believe me when I told her. He went to jail for something else. It happened again when I was ten by someone else. Something happened then, like a connector in my mind burned out. My mom was an alcoholic. She never listened to me or cared what I felt or what I had to say. Most of my time was spent taking care of her and my little brother. I had nightmares all the time, and in school I usually skipped class to cry in the bathroom. 

In high school, I got worse. The pit that I was so familiar with started being interrupted by these lightning bolts of mania. Sadness became anger, and they'd take turns. I stopped sleeping. I started drinking, taking any pill I could get my hands on. I wanted to destroy anyone and anything I could get my hands on. Then at some point I learned I had endometriosis (I was lucky that it runs in my family, I probably wouldn't have gotten a diagnosis so soon). The pain was so bad at times I'd miss weeks of school. Not only did my mind fail me, but my body had turned on me too. I was sixteen the first time I tried to kill myself. I couldn't take it anymore. 

After the first time I started therapy. None of my therapists cared enough to take the time to figure out what my problem was. I got frustrated, angry. I stopped going after the fourth therapist told me to just exercise and "high school is hard for everyone". I made sure none of my friends knew any of this; they wouldn't understand it and they'd immediately feel terrible for me. My mom drank more and got remarried. I drank more. We fought all the time. I'd pull out the rum I hid in my sock drawer and drink until I passed out. I stopped having nightmares at least. I barely graduated.

College came and drinking became normal - it's college after all. So I got to drink more. I got my hands on more drugs. I failed out in two semesters. I drank more. I started going to bars. I managed to be functional enough to keep a job, but the nightmares started coming back. The endometriosis got worse. I had surgery that year. I tried to kill myself again; I walked down by the water with a cocktail of pills and my trusty booze in my book bag. I watched the sunset. My little brother called me right before I went through with it. I think he bought me a couple more years. 

My stepfather eventually kicked me out. Not because I drank or did drugs (I made sure my parents never knew), but because I wasn't *happy* enough. My pain was rude. My highs were out of control, my lows were me being a bitch. My mom did nothing. I bounced around parties, slept on couches. I never got better. I just learned to laugh louder and smile harder. My friends loved me, my boyfriend loved me, my brother loved me, and I didn't get better. I was the life of every party and I didn't get better. I started keeping a knife in my back pocket in case I had the chance to slit my wrists in a bathroom. I was manic once and tried to kill my boyfriend with a shovel. I was waking up in my own vomit almost every day; I wasn't even expecting to wake up anymore. I didn't want to. 

I'm 20 now. I got sober recently. I have a good job and a few close friends who love me to death. My brother is in high school now and he looks to me for so many answers. I just finished detox. I started painting again. But I still can't find any real reason to keep doing this. The outside world is slowly getting better and I'm still waiting to die. I'm still miserable. And if I'm not miserable I'm sleep deprived and manic. Therapy hasn't helped me; to date, I've seen 8 therapists and none of them seem to truly care or understand. It's a job for them, and my life is another day on the clock. I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't want to feel so fucking empty. I don't want my mind to keep tricking me. Now that I'm sober the dreams are starting to come back and I wake up scared and angry. I'm gonna need another surgery soon. My hands and wrists are almost always in pain now from improperly healed fractures and breaks over the years (I used to get into a lot of fights or just punch walls) and I'm scared I won't be able to paint anymore without being in pain. I don't want to touch another pill or a bottle ever again. But I still feel like it's all pointless. Like it's not gonna really get better, I'm just gonna get better at lying to myself and the people around me. I hate this. I don't even necessarily want to take my own life, I just truly want to die and I don't know how to get better. 

TL;DR: my life, my mind, and my body have been complete shitshows for years. I'm starting to get better and I'm still empty.
