All I want for Christmas is death. or the spine to commit suicide. Just want to do the good thing a disappear forever, and be forgotten.That's it. That's the only thing I want. Nothing else. Just to be dead.

I miss them so much. I miss him. and I miss my best friend.  But everyone's better off without me. Many don't want me around anymore, they know what I am. Some will even be happy once I'm dead, and even the ones that will be sad, will be better off and happier in the long run.

I just want to grow a backbone and finish this. To be forgotten. That's the only decent thing I can do in this world.....die, go away forever, and let everyone forget me.

Then i can be a worthless forgotten memory, and everyone will be better off.
