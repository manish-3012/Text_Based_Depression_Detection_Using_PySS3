I can't keep going,I've tried to kill myself twice in my horrible life and both times have failed, the rope for the noose broke and the second time, I was walked in on, my friends found out now and keep trying to keep me from killing myself but all I want is to get out of this suffering, but if I do it will cause a chain reaction, my friends will kill them selves to, I can't do that to them, they have an actual future, I'm a waste of a life, why am I typing this, I'm writing a note and it will address everyone and tell them to forget about me
