Corona has ruined everything in my lifeI have lost every job i've had before the coronavirus, i'm an actor and journalist  while being a student i have had all 4 projects/jobs canelled. I feel like my whole future is gone. There's no parties really. I don't feel like there's anything to live for.   


Nobody knows i feel like this, i'm very charismatic and charming and socially intelligent. I feel way to privliged to have depression. Like i shouldn't feel this way because so many people have it worse.   


I have so many people i love and care about, truly but i still feel so incredibly depressed. I have know idea what to do.
