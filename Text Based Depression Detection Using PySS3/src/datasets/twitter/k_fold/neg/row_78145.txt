Ultimate betrayal..I just found out that my "best friend" has been feeding my sister who treats me horribly what i say in the depth of my despair and suicidal thoughts.  I can't even tell you how much this hurts.  Its like my sister stole "my person".  Now i truly have no one i can talk to.  Of course im still the bad guy in the situation.
