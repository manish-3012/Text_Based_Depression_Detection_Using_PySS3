Tried killing myself Wednesday, and all I want to do is still end it.My entire life has been complete s***. I was finally happy for just a few short weeks and now its gone. I love my boyfriend, but his parents forced him to stop all communication with me because they found out (they have a strict no dating policy). I haven't been able to talk to him and I don't even know if we are still together. I'm just about to assume this means we aren't together anymore and he never loved me. i'm tired of being sad all the time. I just want to be happy.
