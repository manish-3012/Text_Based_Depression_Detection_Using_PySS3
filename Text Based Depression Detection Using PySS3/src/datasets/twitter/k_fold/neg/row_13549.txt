Feeling LostIâ€™ve never considered myself suicidal but it feels like the walls are caving in. My life is falling apart and the turmoil and tension I feel inside is ripping me apart.
Iâ€™m tired of all the hate in this world. I hate the way I feel constantly and even moreso the fact that I canâ€™t handle it. 
I have a daughter and I feel guilty for bringing her into such a cruel and unjust would. As paradoxical as it sounds giving life to a child is anything but. 
Itâ€™s a death sentence with long term suffering. 
These past 2 days Iâ€™ve thought of nothing but taking my pistol and just putting a hole in my fucking head, but the dissonance I get between doing it and not doing it just adds to my angst. I feel like a coward for wanting to kill myself, but even more of a coward that I canâ€™t follow through with it.
Iâ€™m fucking miserable.
