Im still hereI'm a 27 year old Canadian lady, I love my daughter, hanging out on reddit, and cooking.


I'm still trying to find the strength for my daughter. She's getting older now and asking me if I'm crying and if she's fed up she'll actually remark it in a tone, why are you always crying. 


I'm not looking for trouble but I just wanted to know for sure and I'm coming to understanding now that he isn't in love with me anymore, he tolerates me. Sure he pushes for me to improve, I do for him as well. But in the bottom of my heart, deep down I know the love, care, compassion is gone. 

Years of telling me to plz let me die, he wishes it too now I'm sure. 

I'm still here but for how much longer ?
