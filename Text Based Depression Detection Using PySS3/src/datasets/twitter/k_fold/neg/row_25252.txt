I just od'dI od'd 2 hours ago on a huge amount of painkillers.

While i was in the ambulance choking on the charcol drink my fiance was holding my hand crying.

My mother in law was outside the ambulanc shouting at me and telling everyone that came out how stupid i was.

It took.every once pf fibre on my being to not punch her.

Regardless i feel awful for my fiancee and regret this move. I am now sitting inside the A and E waiting to see a doctor
