Ran Away From HomeYou can read my backstory in my other posts, if you care. Basically, my life is so unbelievably shitty that even do-gooders on Omegle instantly disconnect upon hearing about it because they know I'm beyond help.

Today, I was lying in bed, wondering how I was going to get through another day in my unbearable existence when my wonderful mother walked into my room (without knocking, as per usual). "Planning on spending another day in bed, are we?", she said to her son who has been chronically ill and too fatigued to walk around the block for 18 months. I ignored her and she left and slammed the door behind her.

I got up, started packing. She muttered something and, without batting an eyelash, I told her to fuck off. It was the most cathartic moment in the past 6 years spent living under her shitty, abusive reign.

She was dumbfounded. She ran through the house and actually sounded deranged, yelling at me about how I can't replace her, I have nowhere to go etc. I didn't care. I caught an Uber to my friend's work and he took me to his house.

I know this is killing her. If I'm out for the evening and don't tell her where, she freaks out. The idea of torturing her like this is so unbelievably beautiful, even though it's only a tiny fraction of the hell she has made my life. 

The sad thing is, I actually feel some degree of peace at my friend's place -- all of my hypervigilance and constant terror disappears. I know everyone will say, "well, move out" but that is not possible. As I describe in my previous posts, I can't work due to severe mental illness and since my family relocated countries, I can't get any form of disability as I'm not a citizen. I was also in that shitty living environment for so long that my health has completely deteriorated and I now have chronic fatigue syndrome (which means I can't look after myself anymore).

I have enough money to last me three days and I imagine my friend would want me out by then anyway. I am considering having a pleasant last few days with someone I really like and then killing myself. The thought of going back to that house makes me physically sick. I cannot do it anymore.
