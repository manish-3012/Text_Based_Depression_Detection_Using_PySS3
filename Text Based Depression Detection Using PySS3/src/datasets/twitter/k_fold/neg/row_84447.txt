Wretched despairIâ€™ve always been so scared of being alone in life. 
Youâ€™d think being with someone would make you happier, but I donâ€™t know anymore. Iâ€™ve been in a relationship for 3 years now with my GF and Iâ€™m so confused about how I feel. I donâ€™t know if I love her. Sometimes it doesnâ€™t feel like she loves me. She hurts me so much more than anyone else ever has in my life, but sheâ€™s also the only thing that makes me happy, and my reason to keep going everyday.

I know a lot of people would say â€œBreak up, it may seem hard but itâ€™s the best thing for yourselfâ€ or something along those lines but, I wouldnâ€™t make it. I would never be as cruel to say so to her, but without her I would kill myself. I have no meaning in my life. I go to work to make money, to buy stuff to distract myself from myself, which isnâ€™t working anymore. Everything I enjoyed I donâ€™t anymore. My favorite foods are a chore to eat. Hobbies are a chore to do. I hardly take care of myself anymore, not at all if it werenâ€™t for her.

Iâ€™ve tried talking to her about my mental health. She tries to be supportive whenever I open up to her but it almost feels like she doesnâ€™t take it seriously. Unless Iâ€™m actively and openly acting depressed it might as well be a fairly tale. I guess itâ€™s hard to understand without actually experiencing it, but knowing that doesnâ€™t make it any less gut wrenching to me. Sheâ€™s the only person I have in my life, but I can never make her understand. Would it even be humane if I could?

And, I donâ€™t know, I could probably write a whole book going on and on and on... but Iâ€™ve already talked a lot guess. I barely even scratched the surface on how I feel. All Iâ€™ve done is talk about my relationship. Thatâ€™s just what was on my mind tonight. But Iâ€™ve never felt so low and close to falling over the edge. I wish I had drugs to abuse. I wish I had alcohol to drink. I wish I wasnâ€™t scared to hurt myself. I know how terrible these things are portrayed, but as dark as they might be, the promise of temporary relief is music to my ears.
