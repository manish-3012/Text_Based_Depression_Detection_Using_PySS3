I forced myself to live for a very long time. Itâ€™s time to go. Soon.Wallowing in self-pity made everyone turn their back on me which I understand. I donâ€™t see any other way out.

Iâ€™m here because itâ€™s such a heavy topic to talk about and the stigma around it is still present in the society I am. Iâ€™m really worried and feel sorry for my family that wanted the best for me ... from a distance.
What will my relatives think?
â€œThe Y familyâ€™s youngest died from suicide.â€ Personally I donâ€™t know anybody that died from suicide.
Only 1 internet acquaintance â€” although we only had a few (cherished and positively memorable) interactions, I cried when I heard the news.

I have a history of panic disorders &amp; trauma and will permanently take time off ... elsewhere.
I wanted to be remembered as a bright, fun-loving person but now Iâ€™m a psycho.
People stopped giving me attention because itâ€™s draining to be around me. Iâ€™m better off dead and silent.

When I typed emails to a person I looked up to and hurt unintentionally after they hurt me, I looked up a wikihow site. wha..... i lament about many things in general and have a lot of pent up self-hatred.
I still donâ€™t understand how to love and forgive myself. How do people do that? I feel stupid and worthless. No contribution to society, no addition that enriches another personâ€™s life significantly. I am nothing.

I was happy to make someone else happy... I live for others because I see no meaning in my existence. Everyone left me. Iâ€™m really... unlikable.
No mention of me anywhere â€” thatâ€™s how insignificant I am.
