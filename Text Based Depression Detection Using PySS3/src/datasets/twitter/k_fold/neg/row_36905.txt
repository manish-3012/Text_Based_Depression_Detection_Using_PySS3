Please save meLet me just say this, I probably won't kill myself because I can't. I've tried so many times and failed and I'll probably fail for the rest of them as well. I don't want to feel this way anymore. Everytime I failed I picked myself back up and told myself "this time I'll be better" only for me to lose hope again. Tonight I want to try again but I know it will turn out the same. If someone can, please help convince me Im not an idiot for hoping someday ill be happy.
