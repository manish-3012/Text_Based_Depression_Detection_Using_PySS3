I'm spending my 18th birthday alone and want to fucking cry myself to death. haven't honestly felt this horrible in a really long time. Mom's at work, brother at college and hasn't even sent me a text, my dads in another damn state. I have tons of family and not one NOT ONE has shot me a happy birthday message. Don't even have any friends to chat with today. I've sort of always been a lonely person, but days like this kinda amplify how there's literally how desperate of a life I have. Have I really made that little impact on others? Does everyone really care that damn little about me? I honestly just want to go back to bed and snooze the day away. Maybe I'll go down to the store and buy a cake and sing happy birthday to myself. Or maybe I'll just cut my own fucking wrists so I don't have to feel this same gnawing things I've been feeling for over a year who knows.
