No Will To LiveI became depressed after my grandfather died on my birthday when I turned 13. He died from cancer caused by agent orange and my rage and sadness is incurable. I've tried all sorts of pharmaceuticals but they're all bullshit.

When I was 17 I started using cannabis to relieve my symptoms. After a while (when I was about 22) my family got fed up with me using cannabis and I was getting it from my brothers high school friend. So my family asked the drug dealer to lace my weed, he complied. The drug dealer got paranoid or something after lacing my weed and he thought I called the cops on him.

After that his gang made my parents poison me because he thought I snitched on him. I had been poisoned for about 8 months before I decided to confront my parents and ask them why they were doing it because at the time I didn't know why. I found out later when I was in jail. The symptoms of the poison being ingested were that my veins were hemorrhaging (that's what the doctor told me). I called the cops to tell them that my parents were poisoning me and one cop said they couldn't do anything because it was "community food".

My parents and I got into a fight and I ended up using a knife on them. The poison made me delusional so I didn't really know what I was doing or thinking of the consequences of my actions. So I ended up getting arrested and I was in jail for 15 months. I can't count on my two hands the number of people who wanted to kill me in jail because of that piece of shit drug dealer who thought I ratted him out.

So now most of my family won't even talk to me. My parents still talk to me and my grandma does too. But I don't have any friends and the girl I'm talking to seems to be uninterested in a relationship for whatever reason.

Anyway. I have no will to live. This world is beyond fucked because of greedy and selfish people and I want out.
