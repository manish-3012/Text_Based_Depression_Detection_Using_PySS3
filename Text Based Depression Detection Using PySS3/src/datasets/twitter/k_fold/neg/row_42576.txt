who is really the one being selfish?Honestly is the me wanting to die and relieving myself of my pain being selfish? When people do not understand how i feel and selfishly do not want me to just pass on and no longer feel pain? Just because they care for me and are afraid to feel the pain? calling me selfish for wanting to kill myself when they themselvrs are being selfish by keeping me here
