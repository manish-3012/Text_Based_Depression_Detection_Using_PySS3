Going to end it all tommorow nightEven after saying you care about me you can't talk to me about anything that's wrong. You never communicate with me. You're the last person to care about me theres no one else. You said we could talk about it but went back on your word. Why bother going on when everyone just lies to your fucking face? Everyone hurts me over and over and over again. I'm done.
