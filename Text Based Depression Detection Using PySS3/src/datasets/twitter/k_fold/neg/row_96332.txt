I just lost another Auntie within a month. They shouldn't be gone when I'm still here...My Auntie went, and now my great Auntie is passed as well. I'm not built for this, and I got no business being here when they're not. I got 20 tramadol is right here, and some southern comfort to wash it down, but I can't bring myself to do it. Why can I not take the the plunge?
