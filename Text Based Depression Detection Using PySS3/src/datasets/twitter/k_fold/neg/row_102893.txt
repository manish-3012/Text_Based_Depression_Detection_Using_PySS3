My Ex's entire family thinks I'm a monster and think I'm a potential murderer all because I bought a gun to kill myself.Hello, I've been dealing a ton of depression my entire life and the breakup between my girlfriend and myself caused me so much depression I attempted suicide from overdosing and that failed.

Fast forward a few months later I was still dealing with a lot of stress until I finally purchased a weapon, I was talked down by a roommate when I bought a gun in my room. However, he also knew my ex and informed her. She eventually got a restraining order against me even though I've never had a criminal record, I was never violent, never made a threat of harm against her, and there was no intention of ever hurting her. I wasn't even charged with a crime.

I now can't even contact her explaining the situation and I'm still very depressed. Her entire family thinks I'm a monster and I have no one in my life. This is probably the worst moment in my entire life, I'm so lost and I don't know what to do.
