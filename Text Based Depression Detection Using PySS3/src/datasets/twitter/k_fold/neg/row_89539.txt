So, it's come to this. Broke, jobless and about to lose everything.I guess the fact is, I can't work anymore. As much as it kills me. I'm about to lose everything I have, over one little hospital stay that was supposed to make me better. Because of feeling suicidal, I lost my job. The only thing keeping me afloat. The rent is unpaid, the electric bill is unpaid, car note, you name it. I never thought it would take something like this to break me. But, I've reached it. My breaking point. People keep telling me to swallow my pride and try to get government assistance. At this point, only a miracle will help. I can't take care of the people I care about anymore, and it makes me feel so insignificant. I'm not sure if any of this even made any sense. Just had to get it out there before I kill myself.
