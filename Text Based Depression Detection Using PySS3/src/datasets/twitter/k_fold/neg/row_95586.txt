Every time I think it can't get any worse, guess what happens?Last week just broke me somehow. I no longer give a shit about my work (3 days late on some important coursework and I'm here on fucking reddit). I'm literally trying my hardest to get myself worried about the consequences of not doing anything and it's not working. 

I've barely slept since tuesday, since I just haven't felt like it much. Same for eating, for the most part. My landlord is fucking me around a whole bunch, costing me money I can't afford and draining my precious will to keep doing anything. If this keeps up, she's going to end up kicking me out, and then I get to either let everyone I know how much of worthless fuckup I am, or just lose everything and be homeless.

I'm just not enjoying anything any more. I almost wish I could hate it because not being able to care about anything is the weirdest thing. I can't even feel that sad or angry. Mostly just bored, clueless and frustrated.
