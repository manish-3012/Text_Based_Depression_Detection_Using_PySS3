I hate myself and it makes it hard to changeI recently hit 30 and my life isn't technically bad, but I live a meaningless life working in a warehouse with no friends and very little motivation to get out of bed. I'm overweight and unattractive, but I know for a fact I could change these things I truly hate about myself if I tried, but I just can't even find a reason to. I just wish I was someone I cared about.

I feel like there is no point and it's not worth my effort. I used to be very happy as a kid but more and more I just think about death and how much life truly doesn't matter. Also our political climate in America legitimately  makes me question my sanity every second with how corrupt and stupid people are. Thanks for reading and try to have a good day today
