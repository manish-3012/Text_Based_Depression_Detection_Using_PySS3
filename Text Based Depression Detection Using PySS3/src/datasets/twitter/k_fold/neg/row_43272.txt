a couple of reasons why iâ€™m still coping to be herei like to think of my medication as a second chance at life. it hasnâ€™t affected me yet bc itâ€™s only been 2 weeks. but if it works well, itâ€™ll make me feel like iâ€™m alive again. 

then i met someone and the one time we hung out it made me feel joy. i wasnâ€™t planning on meeting someone who shares the same interests as me. in a way itâ€™s telling me i canâ€™t die yet. 

but the thoughts still haunt me. like right now i am in so much pain and battle in my head. 
reminding myself that i still have a chance at living. 
iâ€™m just so sad and hurt. nothing can fix the pain. but the brief moments of feeling content are good enough, even tho i just want to escape everything forever. 

i donâ€™t know how i can describe how difficult it is living with these thoughts all the time. my depression feeds it. when will i feel happy. i am using so much of my strength to stay alive right now too, trying to remind myself. iâ€™m fighting it so bad. 
iâ€™m so sad
