20 years of a shitty life.Iâ€™m 20 years old and a full time college student. My life has been shit so far. Iâ€™ve been bullied my whole life and last summer while I was working it hit a peak. Iâ€™m single and I donâ€™t have any friends. Itâ€™s Saturday night and I canâ€™t stop crying because I know Iâ€™m going to keep leading a miserable life and no one understands. Every time Iâ€™ve tried to make a therapy appointment something goes wrong. Itâ€™s like the universe wants me to suffer and stay in pain and agony. I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll ever get better. Every morning when I wake up I just want to kill myself because I know it would easier than having to be in pain and suffer everyday. Iâ€™ve turned to food to cope and Iâ€™ve gained 10 pounds since this school year started. I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep this up.
