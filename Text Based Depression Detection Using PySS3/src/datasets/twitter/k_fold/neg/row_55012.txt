Fuck this.My family (brother and mother) are trying to get me sectioned so that I no longer have a place to live. I currently live at home with my mother because I canâ€™t work or take care of myself. I havenâ€™t made any threats against myself or anyone else. The only reason they are doing this is to force me out of the only safe place in my life. On top of this they have been fabricating things and gaslighting me. They were the last two people I trusted. I never thought they would be capable of such evil. It sucks because I was actually feeling really great for a very short period of time but that was clearly too good to be true. Iâ€™m done.
