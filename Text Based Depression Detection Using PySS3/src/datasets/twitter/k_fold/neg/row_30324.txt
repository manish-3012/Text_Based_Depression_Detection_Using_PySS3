This is the last post, I promise.I won't kill myself; I'm too afraid. You had better things to do than try to talk some stupid loser out of killing himself so sorry I took your attention from more important stuff.

I could still use advice though, if you don't hate me now. There's two tests this week and I didn't study, so I'll likely fail this year completely. Then there's not taking my meds for a while and I'm not sure what to do now and if just starting taking them again without telling anyone what happened is a good idea.

I also still feel really lonely, and I only have one person I'm talking to, so I don't want to bother him too much. If anyone could talk to me, even for just a couple of minutes a day, it would help me.

Hope I didn't annoy you too much.
