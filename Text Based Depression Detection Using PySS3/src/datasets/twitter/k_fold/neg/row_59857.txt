I am tired of tryingMy only question is, how can you stay positive motivated and have self esteem when none of your efforts have results? When despite of you trying so hard, you go downhill instead? 

I would understand somebody having a ratio of success (positive things) / Failure (negative things) of 60/40, 70/30, but not a 10/90 or a 80/20. 

If you have previous positive experiences and personal success, things you are proud of yourself,  more failure down the road doesnt hurt as much, as somebody with no much success. 

My case is the latter, I am sick, tired of trying everything, I feel no proud of myself at all, i have failed at so many things, put too much effort into everything and gotten zero results, how the f***** can I just keep getting up without seeing at least one of those "aha moments" when you say "yes, I did it! ", No i recieve I kick in the ass by life instead.

If life is like this why continuing living? Life will get worse, not better, my parents will die, i will work a job I hate, and just retire as an old lonely man living of a pension, wishing to be death. 
I hate life almost as much as i hate myself. Sorry I had to rant somewhere, I know nothing can help me, thank.you for taking the time to read.
