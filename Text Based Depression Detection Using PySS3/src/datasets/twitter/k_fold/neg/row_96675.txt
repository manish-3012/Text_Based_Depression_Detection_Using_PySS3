21 years old, been in love with a heartless bitch for 5 years..We always had problems with her talking to/flirting with guys. 3 months ago we were "broken up" but still seeing eachother.. She found a ex felon with tattoos on his face to make her new boyfriend.. He was 35 and she is 20 and looks/acts like shes 17(me too). She came back to me 5 weeks later after breaking my heart asking me to help her because she was afraid for her life because of this guy. I helped her.. Quickly went back to being with her. Tonight she took long coming out of work so i went to check if she was therw and she wasn't. I discovered she is sleeping at a guy she works with's house... Right now she is probably laying in his bed.... Everyday of my life has been getting worse then the last for years now... I want to die... But my brother is an recovering addict and I'm afraid my death will make him relapse.. All my family is addicts. I think im gonna kill myself before new years...
