When you see another walking dead man. You see it in his eyes. The meds have blinded him, caged him. And they say it's for the best.Ok, now here's something from a guy I met.

A man with wife, kids parents a house. Massive TBI due to a I beam strike. His personality shifted so badly he became either violent or suddenly withdrawn. He has to down a shit ton of meds every day to function. He is now a zombie. He works at a call center and is very slow and people that didn't know his story made fun of him for being slow, or were creeped out because of the meds-state.

The worst part? He knows sometimes. He remembers who he was. He remembers loving his kids. His wife. He loved Christmas with them.

He's alone now. Just trying to scrape by on damn near minimum wage. He can't even drive now.

He randomly cried when the emotions got to much to handle.

That's his life now.

So stop thinking about the bean counting you horses ass and start having empathy for a man that cannot end his suffering because of people with a point of view that a working man has more utility for tax purposes than a man that just wishes he wasn't a father/husband anymore.

Do you know what that feels like?
