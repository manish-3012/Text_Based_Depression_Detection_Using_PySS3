I canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™m killing myself on Sunday. Truth be told I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m waiting that long. My roommates away tomorrow night and I just want to be gone. I donâ€™t even feel like me anymore, I talk and donâ€™t recognise my voice, my body feels foreign and I donâ€™t know how to get back to myself. Iâ€™m sick of trying Iâ€™m sick of talking and Iâ€™m ready to go, the fear of the other side doesnâ€™t even reach me anymore. I just canâ€™t wait to be dead.
