It Doesnâ€™t Get Better for EveryoneTime doesnâ€™t heal all wounds. Not everyone finds love. You are good enough. Those are all lies told to people to make them believe a fairy tale. Even my best friend, whom I have shown nothing but love, devotion, and forgiveness to, lies constantly to me. Every time he does I feel like less and less of a person worthy of anything good because if he, of all people, will treat me this way, then I must not be worthy of anything better. I am never enough. And Iâ€™m just so tired.
