Hi, I'm new to thisI've struggled  through a lot of shit. Life is hard and there has therefore been countless times I have felt that suicide is the clear 'go to' option. The only thing stopping me from doing so has been the effect I know it will have on my family. I am exceptionally empathetic but at the same time, I find myself being very distant from empathy. I want to experience life to the fullest but I really struggle dealing with people, I wanna excel and I wanna have good enjoyable memories but its hard to find a balance, if there is anyone outhere in the UK id really like to speak to you for my own sake aswell as for yours &lt;3
