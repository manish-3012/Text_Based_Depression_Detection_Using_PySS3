Head in the wrong placeI fight my thoughts alot and last night was my weakest moment of the year. Between everything from depression anxiety to PTSD and suicidal thoughts let's add a breakup to that mess. It not her fault for any thing I did last night that was all choice of mine I'm still alive just broken and I dont know how to fix my self without help
