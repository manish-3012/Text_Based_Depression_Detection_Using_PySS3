I don't know at all.Hey there. First of all I want to thank all the awesome people in this sub that are helping.
 I am 15-17 years old and I think I might be suicidal. In the last few months (4-7) I've grown very tired of my life. I got tired of doing the same thing every day, but when I speak out about it, I get told that it's going to get better soon. But that's what I've been told for 4 years. There's nothing particularly wrong with my life; I have okay parents, I have something to eat and drink every day, I am not bullied or anything. That makes me think I am just overreacting, but I really wouldn't mind if I just wouldn't wake up tomorrow. On the other hand though, I feel like I would never kill myself. I don't even know what I expect from this thread. I guess I just want to know if I am ok and just in q typical "I'm a teen and I'm sad" phase or if I have depression/am suicidal. I just realized my best (and only) friend is a random dude of the internet I've known for about 3 years now. I never met him irl and I don't even know his real name. I guess that's why I'd rather get responses from you than irl "friends". They're not real friends, just the other outsiders I eat and talk with in school. A few days ago I started chocking myself, because it made me feel something. It again comes down to this boredom. I don't feel bad about my life, just bored and it drives me crazy knowing this will be my life for at least another 4 years. I think typing this out helped. What do I do? Should I try to talk to my parents? Am I ok and just going through something every teen goes through?
