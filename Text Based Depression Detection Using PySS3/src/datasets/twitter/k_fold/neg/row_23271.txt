I fully plan on killing myself todayThis is more like a last ditch effort than anything. Iâ€™m 15, I have horrible anxiety to the point where Iâ€™m too nervous to ask my friends to hang out so I essentially have no more friends, the only thing that brings me happiness in life is playing music and video games, I donâ€™t try in school because I knew I was gonna kill myself one day so why does it matter, since I donâ€™t try in school my parents are always on my back and they always take away the only things that make me happy and then wonder why Iâ€™m always sad and mopey all the time. Iâ€™ve been having these thoughts of suicide for roughly 2 months now. Itâ€™s kinda funny, the only reason I havenâ€™t done it yet is because I wanted to play Borderlands 3 but I guess that doesnâ€™t matter now. If someone could offer any form of help other than, â€œYouâ€™re loved, people will miss you, blah blah blahâ€¦â€ it might just save me, I donâ€™t know.
