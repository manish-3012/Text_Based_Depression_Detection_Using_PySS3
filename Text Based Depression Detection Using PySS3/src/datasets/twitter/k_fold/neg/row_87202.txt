Iâ€™m in actual painI wake up every morning wishing I wasnâ€™t alive. Another day of doing the same thing. Same anxieties, no friends, nothing I can enjoy because Iâ€™m too depressed.
But Iâ€™m too weak to actually end it. So I keep going in circles!
I want to go to the forest at night and hang myself but Iâ€™m too scared of actually going into a forest at night.
There might be people around? Iâ€™ll be so scared but Iâ€™m not sure what else to do. I have some pills I can take but Iâ€™m scared they wonâ€™t be fatal and will just make me sick.
Iâ€™m such a loser I wish someone would just murder me already
