I no longer want to keep going.This pain Iâ€™ve been dealing with for so long never stops.. everyone looks at me like Iâ€™m crazy for having breakdowns when I never asked for any of this.. I just wanted to be happy and get my happy ending.. but that will never happen now and I just want to die, I have for a long time. I hate my life so much and I just want to scream and cry. itâ€™s just not worth it anymore.
