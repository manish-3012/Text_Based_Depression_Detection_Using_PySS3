Nobody will care if im dead.I feel like everyone couldnt care less about me. Earlier today I got yelled at. And then my friends told me to shut the F up. He said i was being "annoying". I remember when i had friends. When i wasnt annoying because i had more than 2 people i can be friends with. I used to be really friendly but now i dont even have the confidence to talk to anyone. I feel like im invisible to anyone and everyone. Really i just wake up to feed myself and make websites. All day. Make websites, eat go to bed repeat. I wish i had a girlfriend but who would like some tall 14 year old veiny kid who makes websites all day. I never have confidence talking to girls. When i do get confidence i get called ugly and other mean names. At this point my life has no meaning. Im getting more and more suicidal by the minute and it doesnt stop. I dont have feelings anymore. I stopped crying.  My grandpa died recently and i couldnt find it in myself to even feel sad. I just feel empty, ugly and disgusting. I think nobody will see this post. Ill never get a girlfriend. I just keep harming myself. I harmed myself today. Nobody will care. Nobody will see it. One day ill just wake up and decide im pointless and kill myself. Nobody cares. I cant wait to die. Nobody will care. I could kill myself right now and my friends would still call me an annoying bitch. Sometimes i feel like if i told my friends i was depressed and suicidal they might care about what they say to me. But i also know they wont care. I remember hearing to girls walking around my neighborhood. One said that suicidal thoughts are dumb and they are fake. They were talking about some girl who was depressed. I just dont want to tell anyone because people will judge me. I cant open up to anyone. I tried that. I hated it. I wish it never happened. I wish i never happened. Bye.
