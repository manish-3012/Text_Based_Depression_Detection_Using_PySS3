Nearing the end of the lineIâ€™m writing this post in lecture. Iâ€™m not sure why. I guess itâ€™s just a good thing to put your thoughts down while you have them.

Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m winning against depression anymore. Every day my motivation is nonexistent, I struggle to wake up, and there are very few people in my life who I look forward to talking to. I uphold good school grades, and everyone thinks I have it in the bag. I do not. The massive amount of homework, debt, and social anxiety donâ€™t help.

Therapy isnâ€™t helping me anymore, so Iâ€™ve stopped taking my medication. I was sexually abused as a child, lost many friends to suicide, and am currently struggling with alcohol and drug abuse.  In the back of my mind, suicide is telling me every minute of every day that it is there and there it offers escape. I hate to sound helpless, but I have no choice. Iâ€™m not in control of my choices, and Iâ€™m dreading the day that this suicidal impulse wins.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated
