i just cant anymorei just dont even know where to begin, after highschool i got a scholarship to a fantastic university but not only did i lose the scholarship ive been kicked out of school, my parents still pay for my apartment but im so fucking worthless i cant even find a job and its been 4 months, my motivation has just slowly dwindled to this point where i cant even get the motivation to wash my fucking clothes i just sit here in my apartment mooching of anyone i can, even if i find some dead end job, then what? slave away at that for 20 years only to realize i was just delayed the inevitable ive got no fucking clue what i should do with the rest of my life so why not just end it early... why do i owe it to the world to keep living?
