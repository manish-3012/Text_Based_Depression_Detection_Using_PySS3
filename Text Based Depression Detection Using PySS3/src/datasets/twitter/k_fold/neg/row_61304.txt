iâ€™m so tired of being alive, i donâ€™t know what to doi cant stand waking up in the morning and feeling like shit everyday. it doesnâ€™t get better. i hate when people say that it does, but it doesnâ€™t. you get used to it. i know nobody actually cares, no one listens or tries to listen. my â€œfriendsâ€ donâ€™t even bother talking to me or anything. iâ€™ve found thereâ€™s no point in life. i just do not want to be here anymore :/

sorry for making you read this, if you do.. thank you for your time.
