I want to kill myself out of anger and depressionIâ€™m a 20 year old gay guy in a place where people like me are rejected and legally prosecuted. I have no future and no way to get out, and I honestly donâ€™t know whatâ€™s stopping me at this point. Nothing brings me joy anymore and I just want everything to end.
