WhyI'm 19. Just cut for the first time. Cut about 7 times. Been derpessed since I was 13. Nothing makes me feel better. No pills, no nothing. Only drinking makes me feel and it doesn't if that makes sense. I don't know why I just cut other than i'm just drunk as fuck. Probably gonna cut more before I pass out. What's the point. I'm 19, no degree, no nothing just a dissapointment like fuck there's seriously no point in life I don't get it. I see so many posts about don't give yp, but why not. Like why live when I get 0 enjoyment out of anything I'm so fucking sick of this.
