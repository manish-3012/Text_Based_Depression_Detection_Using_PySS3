No reason to live anymore?Slightly over half a year ago I met the love of my life. She means absolutely everything to me. I'd do anything for her. She's just perfect for me. Only problem is that she never loved me. I was fine with her thinking that until just about 30 minutes ago.

In these 7-8 months where we've spent very much time with each other. Even though she said she wouldn't be able to love me I took care of her. I'd make food for us both quite often, we'd watch movies and series together, we'd be like a couple, even though we werent. I've loved her since I first actually got to meet her. And I know most others say that they really love someone and then end up not loving them in the end. But I truly mean it about this girl. I love her. And I can never stop loving her. It is impossible for me to not love her. And this even though she said she never could love me, OR anyone else for at least another couple of years. But as I said I'm completely fine with her not loving me, as long as I get to spend those years with her as my only true friend. 

Any other of my friends would leave me behind  given the opportunity. But she wouldn't, she has proven that on severeal occassions before. 

But now things are different. 

She told me that she likes someone else. But not only that. Someone whom she's never actually met before. Someone who she met in an online game. Someone who barely knows who she really is. The fact that she would actually rather love him than me is currently killing me and making me think about my life. 

I'm not the best person in the world I know that for sure. But in my 20 years I've never felt this depressed before. 

I'm fat, unattractive, a horrible person and probably an alcoholic in some people's eyes, not good at anything, I won't and can't bring anything good to this world and no one could possibly ever love me.

I'm severely tempted to just end it all, and never have to bother with any of this ever again.
