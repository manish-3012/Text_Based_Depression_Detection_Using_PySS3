QuestionHow do I let my wonderful and perfect girl know that me wanting to kill myself everyday has nothing to do with her?? She is actually one of the reasons I haven't done it, I feel she suspects she doesn't make me happy enough for those feelings to go away. I can't make them fo away, and it has nothing to do with her. I need to get this point across to her, but i'm not sure how.
