I am quite literally a worthless human beingI feel worthless, and I very much just might be. I thought I was happy and everything was good finally but ofc that was only for a short period. Now I'm back, back to being worthless. Back to being anxious all the time about everything. Back to not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel. I'm getting skinnier by the day, and everyone around me keeps reminding me and poking fun as if I hadn't noticed that I'm starting to look more dead than alive. I'm pretty sure no one actually likes me, since no one really reaches out for me but instead I have to ask them all the time mostly with no success. But I know it's my own fault, I just don't know how to change it.
