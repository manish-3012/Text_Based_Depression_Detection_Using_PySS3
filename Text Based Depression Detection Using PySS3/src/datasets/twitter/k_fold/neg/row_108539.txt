Being "suicidal" but knowing you'll never do itSince this is the suicide forum I thought this was the best place for this. Is there anyone else who is somewhat suicidal but knows they could never actually do it, whether it isn't having the balls to or some other reason?

I pretty much tell myself daily how much my life sucks and how I want to kill myself, but I know that I could never actually put a gun in my mouth, or jump off a building (I actually have a fear of heights), or jump in front of a train. 

Does this even really mean that I'm "suicidal"?
