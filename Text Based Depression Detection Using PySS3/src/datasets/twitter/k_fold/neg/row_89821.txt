Just want someone to talk toI feel like I'm just, I don't even have words anymore.

Incredibly lonely. Everything in my life should be looking up, but all I can wish for is to not wake up, every night I go to sleep. 

I don't know how to fix anything, and I feel, in so much emotional pain, torment, and agony, it's, excruciating. It's, so heavy, and I just feel like it's destroying me, crushing me, to the point, that I can't think, of any steps, to make it better. 

Thanks
