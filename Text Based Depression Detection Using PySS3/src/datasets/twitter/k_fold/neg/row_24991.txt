I'm don't want to do this right now. But I feel like I have to.I am sitting at the top of a 250 foot building in a city close to where I live. I don't think anybody is going to come up here and stop me I've been sitting on the ledge for almost an hour, and walked around for a little bit. 

I'm sick of not having a family. I'm sick of not having any friends. I can't be alone anymore. The girl I was going to ask out told me she doesn't want to be friends anymore. I quit my job, I gave away everything I had. I donated my money to numerous charities, I have nothing except for the Bayern MÃ¼nchen kit I'm wearing, my wallet with a picture of the girl, and a flag that says 'Los gehts Deutschland!'.

I'm sick of the flashbacks. I don't want to see their faces anymore. I don't want to feel them anymore. I don't want to smell them, taste what they did to me.

I've given up. I don't want to die, I want to do the things I've yet to do. I want to see what I haven't yet seen. I want to see world evolve. Have children and take them to school and see them grow up. I want to live life. But when I think hard about, life has never been anything I want it to be. Everything that could possibly go wrong has gone wrong for me at this point. 

I wouldn't mind having a few conversations before I go, I've still got 146 minutes left.
