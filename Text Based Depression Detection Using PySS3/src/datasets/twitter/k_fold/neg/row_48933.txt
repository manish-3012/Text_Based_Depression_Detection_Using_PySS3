Eventually those words come backHonestly? I donâ€™t care if they said it in the middle of an argument. I understand it may have come out wrong, but the damage is done. â€œSo now we canâ€™t say anything [bad to you] because if not youâ€™ll commit suicide?â€. It hit me like a fucking brick. I hate everything my parents say about my attempt or stuff like that. Iâ€™m getting better, but those things donâ€™t help At All. Itâ€™s not the only thing theyâ€™ve said, thought. Well, I guess they just donâ€™t understand this well...
