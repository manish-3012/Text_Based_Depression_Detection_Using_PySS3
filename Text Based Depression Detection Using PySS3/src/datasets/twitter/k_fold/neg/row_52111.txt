Canâ€™t escapeSo Iâ€™ve been in love and In an on and off relationship with my ex for 4 years now. I wasnâ€™t strong enough to block it out but the last couple months sheâ€™s hit me up multiple times through email and texts/calls on a new number and Iâ€™ve managed to say no. Tonight I was out drinking with two of my good friends and I go to the bathroom and this guy I know from high school was in there and says that my ex is a psychotic bitch to which I reply â€œI donâ€™t want to talk about itâ€ he keeps making comments saying that he talked to her for a week and sheâ€™s crazy and I say â€œBRO I REALLY DONY WANT TO TALK ABOUT ITâ€ after that he keeps mumbling shit under his breath and not only am i angry as fuck and want to smack this guy in the teeth for disrespecting me, I feel hopeless and like I canâ€™t escape this/her. Iâ€™m ready to just not have to worry about it at all anymore reddit. Iâ€™m drunk and hopelessly in love and everywhere I turn sheâ€™s there or someone reminding me of it. I spend all my money on coke and alcohol to forget and I feel like a loser with no motivation thatâ€™s better off dead.
