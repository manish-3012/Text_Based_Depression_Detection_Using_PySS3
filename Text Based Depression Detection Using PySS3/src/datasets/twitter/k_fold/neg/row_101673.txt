Don't know what to doIt feels strange posting something like this but here I am.  I've had PPD since my kid was born 5 years ago.  Some days I feel like I'm slowly breaking out of it.   Mostly not.  Sometimes I think about driving my car off the side of the turnpike so my family wouldn't know for sure.  I don't feel like my life has improved and I don't think it will in the future.  I don't really want to die because I stopped believing in God when they cut me open.  But I don't want to be here anymore either.  I haven't had any friends in years.  I don't know what i'm asking for here exactly.  I guess i'm just at a low point.
