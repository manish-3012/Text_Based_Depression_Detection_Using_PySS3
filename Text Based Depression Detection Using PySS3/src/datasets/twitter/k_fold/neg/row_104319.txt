Nothing but an AfterthoughtI'm honestly sick and tired of everything at this point in life. Sick of people in my life ignoring me for days on end, only to act like nothing is wrong. I don't even know who anyone really is anymore. 
I've been through this several times before so it's nothing new to me. Can't tell you how many times I've gone through and planned everything out, only to have someone talk me out of it last minute. That usually lasts  about a week maybe longer. 
I don't really worry about how it will impact the people in my life.  It sounds selfish but let's be honest, with enough time they'll heal or they'll gradually begin to forgive me.

What I worry about at this point is if I'll even make it to the right place. For I don't know what lies on the other side.
