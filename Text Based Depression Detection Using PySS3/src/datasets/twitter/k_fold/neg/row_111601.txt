"You're ruining my life"My mom said this to me today.  I already knew I was a burden.  Good to hear it from someone else I guess.  Just confirms it in my eyes.

I just feel so underappreciated and I've felt numb most of today.  I wish I had the fucking guts to kill myself.  Because I really want to.
