Everything Iâ€™m doing is wrong and I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreI don't know exactly what i'm expecting from posting this but here it goes.

Bit of a backstory:

I am 20 years old, and have suffered from depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. The last 2 years have been the hardest years of my life due to the deaths of two close family members (one who committed suicide, and the other passed from cancer 6 months later) as well as seeing the effect it has had on everyone in my family despite their best efforts to cope. I was also unable to cope and started abusing drugs &amp;amp; alcohol (I had experimented with some drugs before but nothing close to what I'm about to list) 

Including: Weed (~2-3g/day), MDMA, Painkillers + Drinking, Xanax, Acid, and Valium (once I was prescribed). (Also meth only once)

And this went on until about 4 months ago when I was admitted to a mental health ward in hospital after seeing doctors and a psychologist weekly as well as a psychiatrist occasionally. By this time I had already stopped everything except for weed which started to peek at ~5g/day. I had stopped seeing my friends for months, worked a shitty job apprenticeship that I never wanted to do (which had random drug tests, but I was never tested) just so I could come home every day to smoke to feel OK and just repeat the next day. Once I was out of hospital, I had quit my job, quit smoking weed and hoped to better myself but ended up drinking daily and taking MDMA with friends on the weekends. 

Now:

I have stopped taking drugs (4 Months off weed, ~1 Month off MDMA) and slowed up my drinking to weekends only. I am still trying to improve (Exercising, Drawing, Piano, etc) but I still feel no different to anytime before. It feels like nothing is worth it and the concept of living seems so pointless. I am still seeing my psychologist but today she seemed mad at me because I still have not improved, but I don't know what the fuck to do or why I feel like shit, I just want it to stop. She was also looking at the symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and nodding at each one of them. I don't know if I'm just overthinking it but I have been researching BPD since and have been reflecting on my life and can see the symptoms in myself. After reflection and reading peoples experiences with others who have BPD, I am just feeling worse and worse. I'm a bigger piece of shit the more I think about it all. This isn't who I wanted to be, I barely know who I am anymore but it's becoming more apparent and I don't like it at all. 

Nothing seems to be working and I am running out of ideas, so if there's any advice you can give, please comment or pm me. I'm afraid that I might follow through with the plans I have made very soon.

P.S.: Sorry for any grammar mistakes, it has been hard enough to even just type this all out.
