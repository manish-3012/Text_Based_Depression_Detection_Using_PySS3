I don't see the point in livingThis isn't a depressive post, I just really do not see the point in living. Especially if most of the events you experience every day are usually either neutral or negative, then I don't see why you wouldn't kill yourself. The cost/benefit analysis of life seems to be favoring the costs and looks to be an investment that doesn't pay off.

I feel that most of you will give the advice that it's because of love, or just being happy doing the things you love, but I don't see the point in doing those things if you know you won't be the best at them. Statistically it's pretty much 100% likely you won't be the best or even close to being "great" at something, so why do it if you know you're going to be constantly outperformed by someone else or a lot of "someone else's"? Especially if you're into an art form or in a performance field; your fans will enjoy someone else more than you, and it's highly unlikely that you'll be a star. 

This holds true for attractiveness and personality traits as well. If you're not going to be the most attractive (whether it be physically or personality-wise or both) person then why begin a relationship or a friendship? There will always be some other person that that person (whether it be a friend or a girlfriend/boyfriend) will enjoy being around more, be more compatible with, admire more, or be happier around than you.


And I know this sounds extremely negative, but try to take it in objectively. There's no hidden meaning in here, these are just my ruminations. And maybe some people are happy with not being the best (I think this is valid for careers/hobbies, but not for relationships) and I can understand that. 

Does anyone have something to alter my point of view?
