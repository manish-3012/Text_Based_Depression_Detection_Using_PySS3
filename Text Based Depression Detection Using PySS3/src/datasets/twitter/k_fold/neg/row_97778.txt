Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m so incredibly tired.whatâ€™s the point of getting out of my abusive home if Iâ€™m haunted by the memories every day. I canâ€™t see my siblings, as theyâ€™re still stuck in it. 

Iâ€™m completely, totally alone and I find myself repulsive. I try so hard just to get through the day, I take all my meds and go to therapy. I try to keep up with hobbies. But with covid I canâ€™t go to school and Iâ€™ve lost too much weight to exercise. my boyfriend is gone. itâ€™s becoming so much harder to want to try.
