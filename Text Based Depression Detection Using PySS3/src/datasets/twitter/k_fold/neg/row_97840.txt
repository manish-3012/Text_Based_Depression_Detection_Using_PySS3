Give me a reason to be hopeful.Honestly, why should I be hopeful that I'll ever feel better? The only person who can get me out of feeling this way is me, but im to fargone to get there on my own. Yet, i have no one in my life able to help me, even though I have already reached out for help. Why should I be hopeful? If the only thing that can change it is me, and I am unable, why the fuck should I be hopeful?

Everytime I hear someone say to me "Just hold onto hope!" or something I feel sick. i feel insulted. Why would you ask someone who doesnt have a drop of hope left to hope? When hope isnt possible because depression has ripped everything meaningful out of your existance and replaced it with misery. 

So seriously, someone come on here and tell me why I should have hope. I want someone to tell me. Please. I'd love to get in on the secret.
