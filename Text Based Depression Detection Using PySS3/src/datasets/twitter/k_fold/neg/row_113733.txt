Beginning to planI see it's against the rules to mention methods, so I won't. I've finally become content with suicide. I really do think we all have a right to self determination. Yes, depression is an issue, but mental anguish can be unbearable. I wasn't born in the right world or time. I'm going crazy. I know my parents would be upset if they saw me doing it. But why can't they understand my pain? Life hasn't been kind - they all love to hate "faggots with AIDS" like me anyway.
