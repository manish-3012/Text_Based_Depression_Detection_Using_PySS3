Not sad, just want to die for some reasonI donâ€™t really have anything in my life that I have to be upset about. My life is actually pretty good. Not a lot of stresses or anything like that. But for some reason, I donâ€™t want my life to go on. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself a few times in the past, but I always end up in the hospital, or I end up chickening out. Iâ€™ve been on all different types of medications for years now, and while my mood is balanced, I still feel empty inside. I wouldnâ€™t even say Iâ€™m depressed; I just donâ€™t want to go on. Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I donâ€™t have a plan or anything like that, but I just see myself living for another 50+ years. Anyone else feel this way and/or know how to escape this feeling? (If thatâ€™s even possible)
