The world is sadI'm fucking...hurting y'all. After years of torment and abuse, years of me healing that shit alone. Years of always being alone.

 I do all I can to get better, be better. I'm fucking doing the 12 step program and I'm not even addicted to drugs or alcohol (though it's true I guess that we are all addicted to something). But I'm fucking *trying.* And all I feel is sadness. So I look out into the universe begging for some hope and then I see pain and injustice.

I can't escape. I'm either going to die during a protest and maybe my death can have meaning, or I'm just gonna blow my worthless brains out because at the end of the day....fuck life isn't worth this.
