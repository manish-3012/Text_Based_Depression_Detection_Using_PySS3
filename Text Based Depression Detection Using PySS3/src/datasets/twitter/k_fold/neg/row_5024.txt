[Advice] Food for thought ...Hi SW,

Not sure if this belongs here but after something I went through last night I thought I should share it with you. I regularly suffer from depression and debilitating anxiety which can often lead me to suicidal thoughts but I try to keep it to myself. I'm writing to SW today about sort of an epiphany that I had last night after getting a natural high from doing something I used to enjoy ...

I have intense focus which on the one hand means I can accomplish a great deal of things if I really set to work at it. On the other hand this means that if I get fixed on self-deprecating thoughts I turn into an insecure, emotional train-wreck.

So in the midst of one of these pointless speculative thinking sessions I seem to go on just trying to sleep last night I'd decided that I'd really had quite enough of this bullshit and got out of bed, sat down to my computer and tried instead to focus on a project that I was working on the other day before she moved in since I wouldn't be sleeping anyway. This ended up being a really solid move for me.

It wasn't anything super complicated, just a little software project I was already halfway finished with that was only going to take about 20 hours to code. I was frustrated with some routines which is why I hadn't already finished it and decided it wasn't going to fix itself and since I wouldn't be getting any sleep anyway, why not?

I get high from solving problems, achieving a higher understanding of something, or just finishing something that takes a lot of time and effort. Something I learned the other day is that high is a legitimate "opiate high" (dopamine?) your brain gives you when you accomplished things like this. Your body is capable of rewarding you with these dopamine highs instead of the nauseating lows I know some of you are in right now.

Writing software demands such intense focus that you seriously can't do it and think about anything else at the same time which is wonderful. There's always failures just like with anything else but the learning experience gives me a legitimate body-rush. When do you finally accomplished a goal you feel fucking awesome for it.

So that's it. I'm not saying software is the answer but for anyone interested I know you guys are pretty smart so please check out [r/learnprogramming](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming) and learn to do something fun, new and incredibly profitable. I know what it's like to be at the end of my rope and while I don't suffer from chronic physical ailments like I know some of you do this might still help some of you too. I just thought this might help someone who needs a new direction or maybe just some inspiration or just some light at the end of this damned tunnel. 

It can be hard to dust off the old workbench and set to work on something that used to bring you joy or might bring you joy but I assure you it's totally worth it. In fact, there's a little part of me that thinks this might be my only way out of here, out of this rut. It might feel a little contrived but at this point in my life that isn't a problem for me. It's just that much better than the alternative ... which is a problem for me.

So I finished my project last night. It seems to work the way I wanted it to and I learned some new things. I actually felt good about myself for the first time in days and promptly sent myself to bed.

Slept like a baby, woke up feeling great; decided I should share.


It's funny because there's enough on my plate right now that I should just learn to get some things done. I have intense memories of doing this in the past just writing about it. I've been chronically depressed for a very long time and it seems to me that maybe I should just let people who are new to this know how I've to be able to cope and listen to people more myself.

Try new things, especially things you know are beneficial to you because it probably isn't something you will regret. I'm prone to hobbies but perhaps some people aren't. You might set to work doing something new you might enjoy like a hobby or a game, move to a new place, do tedious or manual labor for karma or profit, even buying things you know you'll enjoy like the most comfortable shoes you can find or a better chair for your back pays off incalculable ways. Walking ten blocks, walk forty. You would not regret buying a bicycle if you used it frequently or riding the thing up a mountain for matter. If you don't have a job take any job you can find, take two. If you don't like any of them quit. 

Do things that bring you joy especially in the long term. Make investments in yourself emotionally, financially, academically, etc. I wonder if happiness isn't just accepting that this future is yours and everyones. 


Hopes this helps someone.

Good luck, SW.

**TL;DR**: can't break the cycle of vicious self-deprecating thoughts in your head? Try [r/learnprogramming](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming) or another hobby that demands too much focus to be dwelling on your struggles. Food for thought! ;)

**Edit(s)**: Major redactions for personal reasons figured I should leave anything substantial or relevant to the and make some additions.
