I needed to go to an appointment to renew my antidepressant medication but work keeps me so busy I missed all of them and now I donâ€™t have access to itIronically I only really needed them again becuase it turns out working 6 nights a week, leaving me two half days off to get a weekâ€™s worth of chores and errands done, is not ideal for my mental health. Whoâ€™d have thought? I wish I had the strength to kill myself becuase I canâ€™t see a way out of this job. Iâ€™m going to be a wage slave forever. I have an interview tomorrow but Iâ€™ll finish work too late and not be able to get any sleep so Iâ€™ll talk the interview like I always do.
