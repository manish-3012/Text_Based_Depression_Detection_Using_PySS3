I canâ€™t go back to college and i have no reason to stay aliveMy college just announced that I canâ€™t go back for essentially an entire year. It was the only thing that made me happy, it was the first time I ever felt happy, but now I have to live in my horrible home situation indefinitely and i see no reason to stay alive. I know Iâ€™ll eventually go back but I donâ€™t think i can survive another year here so I just want to get it over with and kill myself now
