Life doesn't enjoy me anymoreIt's been fun. I cannot do this anymore.

I miss my delusions so much and I miss everyone, sorry I cannot bring myself to explain to you how much life means to me, but I am not worthy, I am a wretch, I am a sinner, I am a dirty soul. I don't deserve all of this.

I've been thinking of ending it all for quite some time, but it all intensified last week - nobody wants to talk to me, I tried to find a boyfriend, no luck, nobody even wants to message me back because I am fat due to my schizophrenia meds, I just feel like I won the loser lottery so much not only not being well endowed also for that I am so ugly and I just... cannot. I cannot do this anymore.
