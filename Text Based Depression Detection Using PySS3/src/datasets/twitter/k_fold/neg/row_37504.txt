Being born with this curse makes life a road filled with sadness, bitterness and pain.Hello reddittors... I am a dude from Badalona, Spain. recently 27yo. Never had any job,  love, too old for university (I always wanted to go, but six years is too much), 0 networking, no money, uncapable to be productive in any way, and the country I live is a shitty place corrupted beyond salvation where you just cannot have a decent salary if you are not lucky enough.

   I was born with Simplex Schizophrenia. Thanks lottery, less than 0,001% of all people have this shit and it had to be me.

 It's a mental illnes that reduces the social skills of the person, the willpower to even clean the bedroom, and self-esteem to zero. I'm not even capable of tying shoes (I have never learnt, no idea why), and it is not a joke.

 One thing that does well is make the cursed procastinate a lot. I feel like if I had a coma when I was  a teenager and wasted more than ten years. Nothing has changed since, except my slow approach to the end of this hell.
  The doctors have tried many medicines that it is known that works, but on me it produces horrible symptoms, so I cannot receive a treatment available in Spain. 

  I would write much more, so many things, but right now i just want to get this right off my chest because while in bus I was thinking about killing myself. Tomorrow I will come again to see if have any response... Thanks in advance.
