the mundane tasks that repeat over and over again are swallowing me wholei just joined reddit for the sole purpose of posting shit like this. I'm stuck in  an eternal loop of repeating the same boring tasks everyday, staring at my phone for hours wishing i were somewhere else and doing something with my life but lacking the energy to do so. I spend everday in the same quiet mediocrity as the last and its making me go insane. I just want to put a gun to my head and end it all or swallow pills and let my organs fail or jump off my roof or just die. let me fucking die please please please


its 2am i haven't slept in 3 days
