I donâ€™t want to make it to 22 but Iâ€™m such a bust I canâ€™t even do this.I have never been diagnosed, never taken medication, never been to therapy. But what I have done is tried to kill myself so many times I lost count, self harmed but stopped because I canâ€™t explain the scars so now I stick to scratching and hitting. I break up with the love of my life so I can date and sleep with guys who abuse me because I deserve it. And the reason Iâ€™ve never taken care of this is because I have to be there for everyone my mom needs me because sheâ€™s mentally unstable since I was born. Iâ€™m afraid this is never going to end the pain and suffering. I canâ€™t wait till itâ€™s over. 

I have no support system and I have become such a burden I wonder what Iâ€™m doing here. 21 no job and living with my mom. I try my best to do what I can for people clean, keep to myself, listen to people and support them. But Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s not enough and I keep fucking up. I think the world slipped up when they made me because I am the definition of useless. And Iâ€™m sorry for wasting your time if you read this.
