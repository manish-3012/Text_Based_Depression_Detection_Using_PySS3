Tired of everything.Title says it. I am tired of everything. Everything seems to not interest me anymore. All I wanted was for my ex to message me and now that she is I feel like she's just trying to get stuff from me. I lost my best friend because he's ex tried to help me with finding a way to self harm less. I don't know.ive lost all of my friends and have no one to help me anymore.  I've already made plans to kill myself on the 28th. Maybe once I'm dead they will all be happier.
