I don't want your pityI don't want your pity. I don't want your fucking sympathy. I just want eternal darkness. I want to forget. I want to numb the pain. I want to seize to exist. My mind is my own enemy and I'm ready to fucking take it down even if i go down with it. I'm trapped inside my thoughts. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. Just cold and dark. I don't want your pity. I don't want your fucking sympathy. I just want eternal darkness
