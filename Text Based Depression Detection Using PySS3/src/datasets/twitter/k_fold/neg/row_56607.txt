Pure hatred.I hate this world. And I hate myself.

Every day I am hoping for a nuclear apocalypse to finally happen. To wipe the entire humanity of the planet Earth.

Unfortunately, that might not happen any time soon.

My death would be the second best thing that could happen. Even though the existence of this world would continue without me, **my conscious experience of it would disappear** in a blink of an eye.

*My suicide would be the best way of saying fuck you to the entire world.*
