Can't deal with all this bad luck ..I haven't been on here in awhile tried staying away from the darkness worked for a little bit but sadly back to wanting to die again. Have medical bills that was supposed to be covered and they arnt .. Can't afford to pay them at all can't keep my family happy at all I'm just useless and don't want to cost them anymore money that we can't spare. Other thing just screwing me over but just don't feel like talking about it. Wish I had pills to go to sleep forever, but I guess a blade will  work. Therapy didn't work they just wanted to talk about there life and what's bugging them so that didn't help. Medication just made it worse for me, I just need to not exist so I am not a bother on anyone anymore then my family will be happy.
