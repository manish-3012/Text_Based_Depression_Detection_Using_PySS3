Please read what I wrote because this is how Ive been feeling for the past few years...Leave me be...
I just want to be left to wither alone. Friends and Family I am sorry I canâ€™t push through no more. My life is going no where in life and I feel Iâ€™m stuck on an endless loop of misery. Happiness, what is that? Emotions, chemical reactions. Brain...dead. Leave me be...Iâ€™m tired of living. Reap me from my soul and take me on another plane of existence. Pain has nothing to do with this. My future plans are no more, just scrapped from my brain and into the gutter. Bullet through my flesh Iâ€™m might be alive. Few seconds later Iâ€™m laying on the ground with nothing, but a sight of darkness. Medics in the scene; heart beating...Leave...Me...Be...

P.S: Arenâ€™t yâ€™all tired of living or is it just me?
