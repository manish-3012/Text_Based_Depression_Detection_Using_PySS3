What can I do to restore faith in my future?I actually made this throwaway to say something to someone, but I figure now's as good a time as any to confront my problems. Talking about this is a bit difficult for me, even with a throwaway. I'm not the kind of person to make my problems other peoples' so this is a bit difficult for me. Each time I try to go in depth about my problems it's like my brain refuses to let me type it out... I don't know how else to explain it. So I'll shorten it to little bullet points, it's over-simplifying things quite a lot, but I don't care. 

* Had a crap childhood. (Not going to go deeper into this)
* Used to be on anti-depressants, they didn't work.
*  I've had dissociation for years now. Not sure if it's the depression, lack of sleep, or both.
* Started enjoying life for 2 years before things went downhill again. ( I was off the anti-depressants looong before this.)
* Quite a few years of continuous medical problems; lost my job and had to stop studying because of it. 
* I've been to numerous specialists/doctors and nobody knows what's wrong. Last specialist I saw told me that they'll probably never know.
* Long term unemployment.
* Lost all my friends
* Can barely sleep because of constant pain, and when it's not that, it's because of the depression.
* I'm average at many things, but not good at anything. (I know this sounds like typical self-pity drivel but it's actually true. I'm as average as they come when it comes to intelligence, talent, etc.) 
* Hate myself to the point where it sucks all motivation out of me; I start something and I immediately get this feeling of self-loathing and failure. It's as if I've failed before I've even tried. (ties into the previous point too)
* I want to vanish.

 I've told someone how I feel, but it didn't help. Everyone always saw me as a happy person with a good life. Not because I was, but because that's what I wanted everyone to see. I still do. I came here because I need advice, I don't think I'll kill myself although I've thought about it a lot. Each time I think about the mess I leave behind though. A family friend's son killed himself and I saw the terrible impact it had on those around him, as ridiculous as it sounds, I don't feel that I'm worth the energy. I don't want anyone to have to feel terrible on my behalf. I always tend to try and be nice to everyone, because I don't want anyone to feel how I feel. Empty. Useless. I don't know, my life these past few years keeps going in a downward spiral and I don't know where to turn. I have nobody to lean on, and even if I did, I wouldn't want to be a bother and my pride probably wouldn't let me even if I tried. Anyway, I'm starting to think that I should erase everything so I'm just going to post it before I erase it again...
