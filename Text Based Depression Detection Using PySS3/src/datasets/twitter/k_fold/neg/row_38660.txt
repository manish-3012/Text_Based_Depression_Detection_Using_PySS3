Is life worth living even if you are universally hated?I'm tired.

Maybe I'm just not made for this world. Maybe I'm not supposed to exist. I just don't fit. Anywhere.

People around me (even here, on Reddit), they mistreat me for no reason or they approach me pretending to be friends just to forget me later. It's like there's not friendship, loyalty, good will anymore.

Or at least there is, but not for me. Maybe it's my destiny. To be hated and loathed until I take my own life and finish this for good.

I only have peace when I'm alone. Once I longed for someone - anyone, a relative, a friend, a significant other - who would accept me as I am. But not anymore.

As I come to the realization that this will never happen, I wonder why keep living.
