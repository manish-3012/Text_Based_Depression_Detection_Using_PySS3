I have a great life but when things go down I feel like ending it.I don't know where to begin. I just don't feel like doing this anymore. I have a fantastic fiance, a dog, good parents and am finishing my degree this year. My Fiance and I are temporarily long distance due to school. (East Coast - West Coast). We've been fighting a lot and its been really rough. She's amazing but I feel like our fights are fucking this up and both of us are just not trying as hard as we used to. I feel depressed, down and just not myself. I cant keep this up. She just went to bed on me after a big fight and giving me a tongue lashing. We never do that. We have an agreement to not go to bed angry and always try and fix fights before bed. 

Her and I have a relationship unlike anyone else I know. We connect in a different way and never run out of things to talk about. We both truly care about one another and make each other a priority. There is none of the same bullshit that engulfs most couples our age in our relationship. We still fight like all couples do, but its different.  I love her more than anything and feel as if I am the luckiest man alive to have this woman. For real. Y'all should see her (especially in comparison to me). Looks alone are not what makes her amazing. She's everything I've ever wanted in a partner and I cannot bare the thought of our relationship falling apart bit by bit.

I am generally a very strong willed person and always have been in my life, but for some reason lately I have felt run down and exhausted. Fighting daily with the person you love most really takes a toll. I don't really think I could actually go through with this all. I don't know though. I might just hit a breaking point.
