Why do I want this ?Everything is so good.  Transition is going well, I pass, I have a wonderful new girl friend, I am back in school, I have two wonderful children.

But dysphoria. Yeah.  All the rest doesn't matter sometimes.  All I want to do is step outside and dive off my balcony.  

I don't think I will tonight.  I hold on to the thought of my kids, I do not want to do that to them.  But that is it.  That is all that holds me back, when everything else is so great.

If you know a trans person, don't take them for granted.  Too many of us step off the stage when everything seems to be perfect.   

I am going to go to bed. I am going to cry.  I am going to dream my own death.
