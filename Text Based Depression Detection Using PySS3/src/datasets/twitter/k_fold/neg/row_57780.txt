I finally have hope for onceI've had suicidal thoughts forever now due to my life situation, but the other day I was thinking about the fact that even though it feels like the world is ending sometimes, it really isn't. And if anyone out there is reading this I want you to know as well, when you think that you can't possibly go on anymore just think of the fact that you have made it through 100% of dark days this far. 

As long as there's life, there's hope. Life is still gonna suck for me for a while at least but I have to remind myself that everything is temporary. Shout out to you guys on this subreddit for being there for me in the past. I wouldn't be here today without you all.
