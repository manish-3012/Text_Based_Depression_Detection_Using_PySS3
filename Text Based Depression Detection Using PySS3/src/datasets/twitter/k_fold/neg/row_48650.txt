This world is fucking disgusting , no itâ€™s just humans(generally speaking)I just joined Reddit like yesterday and itâ€™s a great place. People are open and genuine, at least the ones ik. As u scroll u come across disturbing stories, and when I hear them I surge with rage of how disgusting people can be. I started thinking, do I have the right to be depressed, thinking of suicide when thereâ€™s people out there that suffer 100x what I call stuffing. It just shows me how weak I am that such little things can bring me to the edge when thereâ€™s others suffering far worse and can still go on even a little bit more. I truly am pathetic.
