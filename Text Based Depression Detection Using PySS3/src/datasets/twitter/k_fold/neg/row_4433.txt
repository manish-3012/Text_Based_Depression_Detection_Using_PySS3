I picture myself already dead and I want it to stopIt's like being still alive must be a punishment from the gods or so, if there are any..
I can't live without love and somehow I still do, in unbearable mental pain, every day,...
This feels like a cruel joke, or starring in a horror movie.
It's way too much and has been for a long while, but seemingly my body won't die on it's own.
So the task to actively kill it is on me as well I guess. 
But I'm too overwhelmed, almost paralyzed by my mind, don't know how to do it

I guess I'll post here again in the future, 'cause I struggle with words ..

writing here because... well honestly I scroll through this sub a lot because suicide is the main topic on my mind, sadly.. and some of the posts here give me the feeling of being understood at least -
so maybe I'll give someone else this feeling as well
