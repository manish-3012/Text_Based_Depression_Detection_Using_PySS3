Does being scared to kill yourself mean you are a weak person?I think I may have found a way to peacefully kill myself but I'm still a little scared to do it.  I'm not sure where the fear is coming from.  I think part of it is not succeeding and being left with other problems.  I'm not sure.  Anyone else have a method but can't seem to follow through?
