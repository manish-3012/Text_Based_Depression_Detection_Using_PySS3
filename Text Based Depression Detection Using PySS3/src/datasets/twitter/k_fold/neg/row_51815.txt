I ruin everythingI fucking hate myself.

I ruin everything.   
Every opportunity.  
Every relationship, weather it be friendship or love.  
I can't keep a job, I can't stay in school.  
Barely finished High school.

I look like shit,  
I have a shitty personality.  
Even when people start to like me I push them away.

Never felt truly happy for the past 10 years.  
I'm only 23 y/o and people always say that now are my best years...   


I fuckin hate myself fuck...
