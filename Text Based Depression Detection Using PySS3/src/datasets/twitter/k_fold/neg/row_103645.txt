Writing some suicide notesI have been thinking intensely about suicide for the past week now, some nights I can distract myself and the thoughts will lessen down, last night and tonight have been extremely hard for me. So I got out some paper and wrote a couple of suicide notes, when I was writing them it didnâ€™t seem good enough, like nothing of what Iâ€™m putting into a note about killing myself is actually good enough to even mention. I have so many overwhelming feelings and yet I sound stupid every time I put them down on paper. I feel like I just mess up on my own suicide note too. My friends say I can talk to them, when I really needed to talk to someone last night I didnâ€™t even know who I couldâ€™ve called because I felt like I wouldâ€™ve bothered them. I feel like Iâ€™m just here bothering everyone and I donâ€™t really have a purpose in life. I mess up so many things, Iâ€™m really mad at myself because I try my best and it still isnâ€™t good enough. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore, I donâ€™t want to exist.
