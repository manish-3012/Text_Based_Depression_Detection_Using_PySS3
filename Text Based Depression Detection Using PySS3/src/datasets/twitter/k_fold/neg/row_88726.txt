Don't know what to doHello

I'm 19. Dropped out of college. I thought about suicide almost daily there and was apathetic towards almost everything. Naturally I failed some of my classes. I'm trying to get a retroactive withdrawal to save my gps but I don't think it will happen.

I feel like I have nowhere to go in life. I don't have a job and I don't want to do anything. My suicidal thoughts were alleviated at first when I came home for winter break/dropped out but they are pretty strong right now. 

My dad just got really mad at me for not doing anything. I live with my mom and only talk to him a couple of times a month. He told me people have always said I'm lazy and worthless and he's defended me but he doesn't want to deal with my shit anymore. 

He knows about my depression but says it's an act. I started seeing a therapest again last week but he doesn't understand me too well. He tries but we are really dissimilar. 

Anyway I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't have any motivation for anything. My friends are all in college and I can tell they look down on me now. I was once the "lazy smart kid" but now I really am just nothing. 

I want to go to sleep for a really long time. Maybe not forever but it doesn't sound so bad. 

If I don't kill myself I don't know what else to do. I'm just a waste of space.
