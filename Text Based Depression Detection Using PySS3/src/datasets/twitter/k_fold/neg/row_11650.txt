my truthtruth is, I always want to die. i hate existing. honestly, writing these words on paper scares the shit out of me because it's the raw me, and I don't want to show people that. i feel like I'm trapped. nowhere to go. whatever i do, makes me a bad person. whatever i say, makes me a bad person. if I feel like I wanna shoot myself, I'm a bad person. if I feel like shit about something and talk about it, I'm a bad person. i make others feel bad constantly. i shouldn't be alive. if I don't tell anyone about my problems it feeds off into negativity. I've always been an awful person deep down, this was who I've always been. I've struggled to like myself and accept myself after all these years but I've just realized that I shouldn't because I really am garbage. i just want to stop existing, but I can't. i believe there is a God, but he hates me. he just doesn't let me die. everyday I just hope to wake up dead, it makes me so happy just thinking about it. but unfortunately, that doesn't come ever. i don't want a future. i don't want anyone else. nothing and no one can bring me happiness. im tired of trying, I just want to die. i don't deserve anything or anyone, I don't understand why I'm still alive. i keep replaying ways in which I could really hurt myself brutally, with so much blood. it's so satisfying. it makes me so sad to know that I'll never die soon. i just want to die, and I can't. i hate that I can't. maybe I just deserve to stay alive and continue suffering. i should be happy this is how I feel after how bad of a person I am.
