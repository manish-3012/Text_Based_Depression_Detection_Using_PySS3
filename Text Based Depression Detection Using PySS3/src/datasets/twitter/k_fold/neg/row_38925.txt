I don't want to live anymore (M16)I've ruined every relationship I've ever had because once my S/O becomes close to me, I get anxious that I'll lose them and tend not to be myself around them, making them lose interest. Then we get in one fight and I go off the deep end about being careful about what I say and when I do finally talk to them about it, it's always about how I love them more than anything but I don't trust they feel the same, driving them away more. I don't know why I always do this but it's happened over and over again. I feel like I have no close friends or anyone I can talk to. My mom and dad just get mad at me when I try to talk to either of them about it. They're somehow worse parents now that they're separated. That's when I see them that is. I have trust issues with women but my relationship is my life. Nothing else excites me or makes me feel anything. And if I can't maintain a healthy relationship, I'll have no reason to live since nothing else is worth doing to me. The same thing seems to be happening with my current girlfriend as all my other relationships, and I get more and more depressed every time this happens. I almost crank the steering wheel in either direction to flip my car every time I drive. I know where the guns in my house are and know how and where I'd kill myself. Outside under a bridge listening to music and getting high, with my dad's M1911 9mm handgun. Probably listening to Post Malone or something. I leave school everyday almost in tears because near the end of the day, I just can't be around people cuz it freaks me out. I have work in half an hour and I pray it calms me down or might slit my own throat with my box cutter
