i'm too embarrassed to tell people i know of my suicidal thoughtsmy friends will think im a weirdo and distance themselves from me, my parents will think im being dramatic and tell me to shut up, and my therapist will be terrified. these thoughts swarm my mind daily and i feel like i either deal with them alone or let people in and ruin my relationships
