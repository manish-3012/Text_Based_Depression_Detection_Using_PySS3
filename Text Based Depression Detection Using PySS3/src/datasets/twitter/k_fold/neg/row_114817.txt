In FranceAnd contemplating killing myself again. I don't know why. I'm not feeling that sad. Maybe kind of numb. I just don't see the point in all of this. I don't want to be alive anymore. I guess I never wanted to be alive in the first place. I have no one else to tell this to since everyone is so far away, and they'd get too worried. If I was in Canada still I'm sure I'd reach out, but now that's not possible. I'm so stupid for ever leaving. Hanging myself seems like the best thing I could do now. 

I'm not in any immediate danger, I'm just so tired of everything. I want to be gone.
