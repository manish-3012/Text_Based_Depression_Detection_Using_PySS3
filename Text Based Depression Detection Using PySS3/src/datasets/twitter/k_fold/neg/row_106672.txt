a way outsometimes i wonder what choices i could of made for my life to be different but this is the situation iâ€™m put in so itâ€™s pointless to wish it . my whole life has been pure bullshit. iâ€™ve been treated like a fucking monster my whole life for no reason. i have one friend and itâ€™s on xbox . iâ€™m fucking pathetic. every girlfriend i ever had has always been more fucked up then me and once i get there self esteem up they just leave .  iâ€™m always so fucking lonely . every possible job i want is one in a million . i like jobs where i can be creative like writing , acting , art , music ya know shit like that . and like i said thereâ€™s a slim chance in fucking hell i could ever get that. literally the only time iâ€™m ever happy is if a youtuber i like uploads like ryan george or mamaMax . i really have nothing else to look forward to .  thank you for reading my rant . i plan on making big choices soon life or death i donâ€™t give a fuck.  i wish suicide didnâ€™t hurt ...
