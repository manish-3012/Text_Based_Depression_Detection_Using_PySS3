15 year old boys have experienced more love than I ever have at 26.It is incredibly depressing being undesirable. No women wants a short, weak-chinned man like me. The only time a women will settle with men like me is I have eventually accrued wealth and she can use me for it. Which of course is not real love.

Girls never liked me. In high school, college, work, wherever.

I look in the streets and I see girls chasing a 15 year old boy. I have no idea what that feels like.

No woman has ever even touched me. I ask them for simple things like directions, and they even ignore me or give me a look of disgust.

They say there is someone for everyone but that's BS. Some of us are not meant to be loved.

Reality is that a short ugly guy will never be truly loved. I hope I had realized that earlier.

That I'm not worthy of love and that I have to find love in a proper career. Romance is not meant for me.
