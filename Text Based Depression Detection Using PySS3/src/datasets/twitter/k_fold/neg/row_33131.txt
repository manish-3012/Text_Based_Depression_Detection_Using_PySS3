"Cakey" issues.I know the title confuses you but Cakey is the nickname of my friend in question that I need help with.

She's a year younger than me, and I've had a crush on her for a really long time. She knows this but sometimes I don't think it registers.

She recently got out of a relationship that she was sooooo certain would last forever and her life has just been a free fall of depression. 

Normally this would irritate me more than anything but... My stupid feelings for her and seeing her this way makes me get pulled back into that dark abysmal existence that she's currently in. 

We got into a fight today... a few minutes ago... and I said some things that I will regret forever but.. I just need a way to reach out to her... show her that she CAN be happy... show her that she might be able to find some sort of resolve in someone else or something else.

Whenever we talk on the phone its almost like she never was depressed but its times when we can't reach each other that she gets really bad... 

I'll answer questions in the comments if you ask.
