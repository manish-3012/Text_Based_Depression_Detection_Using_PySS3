20F i feel like i could die tonighti took 15 benadryls again 
i can't stop crying even when i am drugged out 
there is 1 person my age who i can talk to and he told me he doesn't know how to respond. 
i told my dad how hopeless i feel and he got so mad at me and started yelling. i always feel worse when i talk with my dad even though he's one of the only people who knows how sad and suicidal i feel every day. 
i call out for help and i feel worse every time
i feel like i am nearing the end
i don't know how to live without people i loved and lost it gets harder every day 
i am so alone
