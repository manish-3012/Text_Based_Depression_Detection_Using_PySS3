I'm sick of dealing with PTSD.~7 months ago I was raped by my ex fiancee. She was the love of my life but she went and did that, then got increasingly more violent with me until she left 2 months after that. And only leaving because she tried to kill me and I fought back for once. I'm sick of the flashbacks, I'm sick of the pain and I'm sick of not being able to sleep at night anymore because of it all. I should have left before I let her do that but I refused to see how abusive she became and now I'm totally lost on what to do.
