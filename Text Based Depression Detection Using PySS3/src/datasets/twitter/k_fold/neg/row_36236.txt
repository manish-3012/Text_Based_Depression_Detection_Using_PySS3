yepnot going to sugarcoat it really, and you've probably heard this a thousand other ways, and you're used to the same script. I don't want to live anymore, can't live, can't function or whatever. But this is going to be like that. I've said a dozen times that this is going to be the night I do it, and I never do it. The closest ive ever been was when I tied a noose to the ceiling and then put it around my neck to see how it would fit before, with the chair underneath, and then another time where I bought a ticket and went to the bridge and just stood around there for a bit but then went home. 

I have no life, and I just work two jobs - a steward in a theatre and at a job centre - and im getting another for christmas at a video game shop to get some extra cash. I'm incredibly selfish, narcassistic, thoughtless and every time I just push away those who try to help, but I am a terrible person. I'm not going to be waste time moaning about how life sucks, because there are other people worse off than me who are still happy but struggling, and there are people with actual problems. 

Maybe I won't do it now. Maybe I won't do it tomorrow. Maybe I won't do it next week, or month, or year. But at some point, I know I will do it, and it's just a matter of when.
