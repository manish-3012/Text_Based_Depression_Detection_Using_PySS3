I think Iâ€™m out of reasonsI honestly donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™ve struggled with depression and anxiety. At least since 14 or so, maybe earlier. Too long, anyway, but I didnâ€™t really recognize it until a few years ago. I guess I just thought everyone felt like this, you know? I was in a toxic relationship and my anxiety had been mounting, Iâ€™d had a couple anxiety attacks at work and then a breakdown when the relationship exploded. That was when I realized I had a problem. 

After that, I did absolutely nothing about it because I honestly had no idea what to do. Some time later I met the person of my dreams, but everything else around me has steadily crumbled since then. Over the last few years Iâ€™ve lost everything, I literally have no family or friends left and I donâ€™t even think my person wants me anymore. I donâ€™t have a career or any higher education, Iâ€™m working a bullshit job, I live in constant fear and self loathing, and I just donâ€™t know how to do this anymore.

I just canâ€™t find any reasons to still be here. I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore. All of my escapes: movies, books, video games, playing music... theyâ€™re just not doing it. Theyâ€™re not doing anything. Every time I try to immerse myself in something my brain gets in the way. Every day is a struggle and I feel so fucking alone, and the things that used to help me cope all feel sad and alien to me. Nothing is comforting anymore. I feel like I can never relax. Iâ€™ve been feeling like my imagination atrophied a long time ago so I try to get back into drawing, or writing/journaling, or even coloring, but my fucking stupid broken brain gets in the way, I over think or get impatient and frustrated with myself and just give up. All of my reasons keep slipping away. My social anxiety was doing much better a couple years ago but now I feel like itâ€™s tripled. I donâ€™t do anything anymore, and when I do I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin that I want to throw up and run away from everyone.

I did a little bit of therapy, but finding someone Iâ€™m comfortable talking to is so difficult and time consuming. Itâ€™s tiring to go through my story and then realize I donâ€™t feel comfortable opening up to this person. I lost my health insurance and couldnâ€™t afford my meds at the time so I stopped taking them a few months back. I donâ€™t really think they were helping anyway. The mental health system in this country is a nightmare and most of the â€œprofessionalsâ€ Iâ€™ve spoken to seem to have zero compassion or understanding for people who suffer from mental illness. 

Iâ€™m too far behind in life. Thereâ€™s just no catching up now. My head is such a mess. I feel like Iâ€™ve got an overflowing backpack of emotional issues, problems I should be tending to, and to do lists that I can never take off. My thoughts are always so tangled and Iâ€™m so bad at expressing myself, so awful at putting my feelings into words. Iâ€™ve been trying but I think itâ€™s too late. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m a good partner. Or maybe we just arenâ€™t good for each other. I guess it doesnâ€™t really matter. One person shouldnâ€™t be your only reason left. Thatâ€™s not healthy. Thatâ€™s not fair to them. 

I hate that thatâ€™s a thing. I donâ€™t know what happened, but suddenly all of my people are gone. I have absolutely no support system. Iâ€™ve lost everyone and now I donâ€™t recognize my life and this poor person whoâ€™s gone through so much pain themselves has to put up with my miserable bullshit and unhealthy coping while Iâ€™ve probably been too self-absorbed to even realize I wasnâ€™t doing my part. And then to have that pressure. Ugh fuck me. 

I feel like I really need to stress that the last two years have been FUCKED UP. For obvious reasons I donâ€™t want to go into detail, but Iâ€™ve dealt with loss, death, and come out feeling betrayed and abandoned frankly traumatized. I feel like nothing is ever going to be resolved, nothing is ever going to be okay again. I feel scared and on edge much of the time, I can almost never relax. Every day is a struggle with just little moments of joy sprinkled in occasionally and I just canâ€™t fucking do it anymore. The highs are so much lower and more fleeting than they used to be and I feel like thereâ€™s nothing for me beyond those little moments, nothing bigger to look forward to because nothing is ever going to work out for me. Life is just a series of increasingly larger disappointments. 

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking for here. Iâ€™m not looking for someone to make me feel better, I donâ€™t think a stranger could right now. I donâ€™t want advice and Iâ€™m not looking for someone to talk me into hanginâ€™ in there, kid. I might though, for a while, I really donâ€™t know right now. These thoughts have been looming for a long time, and they keep rising to the top stronger and more unshakable each time. The only thing stopping me is fear. Iâ€™m so scared Iâ€™m not going to do it right and Iâ€™ll wake up back here in a worse situation than I was already in. Thatâ€™s not a very compelling reason. I wonder how long that will last. At least through the night, I donâ€™t really see myself leaving bed. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll sleep and I donâ€™t know if I can go to work tomorrow. 

I donâ€™t want to die slow and painfully, Iâ€™m terrified of blades, I donâ€™t have access to lethal medications. In all my ideations, Iâ€™ve never really found one I was comfortable with, except maybe a gun. Or jumping. At least then I could cross â€œconquer fear of heightsâ€ of my bucket list. 

I feel like this world just isnâ€™t for me. Iâ€™ve always felt like I kind of donâ€™t belong here, and lately it feels like life just keeps going out of its way to prove me right. 

Itâ€™s weird, I browse Reddit constantly but never interact. I feel like itâ€™s all I do anymore, just get lost reading articles and going through comment threads, but I never inject myself into conversation. I donâ€™t even know why, I used to spend so much time talking to strangers on the internet up until a few years ago but now Iâ€™m just too afraid or canâ€™t be bothered or, I donâ€™t even know. Hell Iâ€™ve been agonizing over writing this for over an hour, Iâ€™m hesitant to post it and if I do Iâ€™m not certain I wonâ€™t delete it. Iâ€™m just a fucking mess. So I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m hoping to get out of this. I donâ€™t know anything right now, maybe this is just pointless incomprehensible rambling, but I guess Iâ€™m just hoping someone hears and understands. Thanks so much if you bothered to read this.
