i'm only 22 and i can't go on any longer.life is too hard, and i am just too tired. the obstacles i'm facing seem insurmountable. at the very least, the energy i require to deal with them is way more than i currently have. i don't want to give up, but please... please let me. 

i can't stop crying. i cry all the time and it annoys everybody. i have zero friends and my family is so dysfunctional. the only time i can remember being happy is being with my husband, and he has left me for someone else. i truly have no one now. i'm so lonely. i have so much love to give, but it doesn't matter because i'm alone and i always will be because i'm not good enough. all i deserve is abuse. 

i don't want to die. i just want the pain to stop. i want to cease to exist. i want it to be like before i was born - nothing. to match what i am worth.
