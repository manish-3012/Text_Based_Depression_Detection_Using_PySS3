I went out for my final walk the other nightFirst of all, apologies for the extremely lengthy post.

I'm 27 years old, not that it should matter, mental health is an issue at any age. I have no friends to confide in and my family is broken and the ones that listen don't offer great advice.

5 years ago I tried to take my own life by jumping off a bridge, I fell about 200 ft, hit water and was instantly knocked unconscious. I woke up in hospital the next morning, surrounded by doctors and my girlfriend from the time.

I've had a rough past, all kinds of abuse, sexual, physical, mental, alcohol and drugs.

The tipping point for that episode 5 years ago was when I fell in love with said girlfriend at the time (Who, actually, wasn't _quite_ my girlfriend yet.) and caught her with her 'ex'. We were a thing at the time but hadn't made anything official.

Small things like that have been known to have a massive effect on me.

Well /r/SuicideWatch, I would like to say I'm an enlightened man. But unfortunately I left that woman 5 months ago. Things weren't working and we weren't happy anymore. But rather than try to fix it, I ran away. 

Over the past few weeks, I've began to miss "Christine" (name changed for anonymity), really, very badly.

I found out that she has a new boyfriend with whom she is happy, on the 28th of November.

I went out for my final walk.

Unfortunately, though I had planned to jump from a bridge, I neglected to think about which one, and as it turns out, there are 5 or 6 within a 4 square-mile radius of my home. None of them are high enough.

And so I'm sat again. 3 words revolving around my head, over and over. Except now I'm thinking of various other methods.

The point of my post wasn't so that people would read it. I know people will. And I know most people will probably try to console me.
