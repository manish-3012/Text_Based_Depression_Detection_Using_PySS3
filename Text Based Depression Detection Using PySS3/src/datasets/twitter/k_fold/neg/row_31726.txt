Awwwh fuvvkI'm extremely drunk and alone right now. Just got out of prison less than 2 months ago. There's this really close highway, highway 680 to be exact lmao, I keep thinking about what it would be like to walk up there and Just jump in front of a car.. I'm pretty sure it would kill me I'm just so scared it won't. I honestly don't care about what it would do to the person driving and how much if scare them. I'm far past that point. I just want to die and not waste my time. This is my first post here, and if it's my last I'm sorry you had to read it and I'm sorry to whoever I jumped in front of and totaled your car. I hope you're okay and I also hope you come to my funeral and get shitfaced. I love you audree. I love you Tyler. I always will. Don't miss me. Just remember me like it was yesterday.
