I'm 100% doneI try to be a nice person and this is what I get. My life is nothing but pain and now I got fired from my job so I'm probably gonna either starve to death or die from dehydration since I'm broke, so I figured I should end it before either of those things happen. I'd say more but I don't even have the energy. Goodbye.
