How do I make sure that no one gets into legal trouble for my suicide?Before I began distrusting medical professionals, I did have counsellors/therapists in the past (the most recent one being around half a year ago) and I obviously did vent about a lot of things, and I named people and family members and such. One of them said that if I do end up taking my own life, they might get a call from investigators asking about what could have led me to my decision. 

However, I donâ€™t want anyone to get into any legal issues. I donâ€™t want to leave behind a mess. Iâ€™m not going to leave a note since most of my friends donâ€™t speak much to me anymore since theyâ€™ve got their own lives, and I donâ€™t think a note is gonna make a difference to family. But should I leave a note saying that no one is to be held legally responsible or something? Anything I could do to reduce the chances of that happening when Iâ€™m gone? Again, Iâ€™ve either stopped going to certain therapists or simply didnâ€™t respond to emails from others (until they eventually stopped trying), so would a legal team still bother looking into that?
