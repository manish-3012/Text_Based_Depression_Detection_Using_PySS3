Bullet
My legs are dangling off the edge,
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone,
My legs are dangling off the edge,
A stomach full of pills didn't work again,
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone

Lyrics to a song that is scarily relatable. 

I have been diagnosed with severe depression for 3-4 years and Iâ€™m not sure if I can take the depression any more. It began when I moved to Ohio from suburbs of Chicago. I was almost immediately ostracized and never fit in. I tried to  Join the popular crowd and earned the nickname fag For the first year and a half in Ohio. I began to distance myself from all social situations and stayed at Home and 6 months after moving to Ohio I began cutting and hit t from my parents for almost 2 years. I have a 6 inch scar on my arm from the cutting and reopen it quite often. Currently the only thing keeping me alive is my dog. I was hospitalized about 3 months ago after leaving a suicide note on my bed leaving my house going to a bridge and sitting there for an hour before wimping out and biking back home and being taken to the er were I was in the â€œcrisis stabilization unitâ€ for 8 horrible days. I went back home and started again cutting a week after return (I had stopped cutting 6 months ago when I got my dog.) I donâ€™t want to live anymore and I donâ€™t have the mental strength to anymore. This is my story and if Iâ€™m lucky where it will end. Itâ€™s been a good run reddit.
