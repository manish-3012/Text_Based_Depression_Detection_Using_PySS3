My breakdowns are scaring mePosting this in another sub because I need some wise words right now. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m capable of 

I had a bad emotional breakdown yesterday and cutting came to mind.

The thing is, I hate knives. I hate pain. I hate getting cuts.

It scares me that my breakdown made cutting appealing until I realized what I was actually considering.

Many days before with another breakdown I had the urge to drink, a lot. I donâ€™t drink at all, I donâ€™t see the appeal of being drunk when Iâ€™m not having a breakdown. Plus the only alcohol in my house is wine anyways, I crave hard liquor. Something that will just make me so fucking numb. 

I donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™ll be able to keep pulling myself back to sanity. It scares me. I donâ€™t want to ruin my life but the dark thoughts go too far.
