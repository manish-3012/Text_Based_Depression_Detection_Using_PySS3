ThoughtsLaying in the guest bed at some of my old friends' house tonight. Drove a few hours to be with them to surround myself with some peace for once. My head goes in loops over periods of time and one of those phases is an overwhelming urge to just die. And the only thing that seems to stop me is, I couldn't do that to my friends.
