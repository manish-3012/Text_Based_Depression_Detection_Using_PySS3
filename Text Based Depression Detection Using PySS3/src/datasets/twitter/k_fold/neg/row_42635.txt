Can't help but feel like it's a good time to kill myself.Basically that. As things are, I don't think I can go much longer. I don't have any friends and seeing love stories or  reading anything like that on Reddit makes me feel so lonely. That happens all of the time, love is everywhere... I've been single for 9+ years now. I can be fake and talk to people sometimes, but I want to make friends and date me because of who I am. Like really smile, instead of smiling till everyone looks away. I live in a town where you can't really go out and meet people on top of that. Socailizing is a skill and i cant really just go out and get better at it. Im so withdrawn now, that i just cant talk to people. I cant articulate myself to be comprehensable to other people and i just dont click. I usually get ignored or people are short and ignore me right after that or something. It's so hard to just stay afloat, that moving somewhere is unrealistic and impractical. I want to go to school, but that's also impractical, cause I'd have to work full time and go to school full time. Not to mention that I dropped out if HS (err, GED, but same thing academically) I'm so far behind the learning curve for my age group I'd have to go full time for quite a while, taking HS level classes.
I feel like I've missed my chance to live my life and I'm alone... I just feel like it's a good time to disappear. Had I known things would turn out this way, I'd've done it a long time ago. I don't think I'm a pessimist, more of a realist. It just seems so impractical to go on. Like the long road ahead of me isnt really worth the payoff.
