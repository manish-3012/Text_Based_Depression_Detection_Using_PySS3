Don't know how long I can bear thisFirst of all thank you for going into my post and reading through my pain.

I just want to end it. There is just to much pain in this life to enjoy it. I have tried so much, but I have failed much more. 
The must crushing aspect is this unbearable loneliness. Maybe I am just a wimp but because of borderline and depression, am I can't hold this anymore.
Just seeing a couple, or hearing about love in one more pop song gives me shivers down my spine. I want this so bad. Someone to hold me and tell me everything is going to be alright. I want someone so cuddle the living crap out of and appreciates me. But I know I am not gonna find this ever ... And with every day going on it is getting harder. I have already set my goal, that if I am still single with 25 will definitely kill myself, but I don't know if I can hold out that long. To go to sleep every night with so many painful memories is premium nightmare fuel everytime I close my eyes.
Exercise, talking with friends, talking with professionals and everything you can imagine, I have tried and given up. I want the permission for my final choice... Let me give up, one last time and let me rest for I can not bear this anymore... But our primal instincts will torture us with the will to live forever 

I am sorry for my whining, but I don't know what or who to turn to anymore... Just tired and let me sleep for ever.
I even prayed for it,  even though I am a highly unreligious person.
