27 yr old girl, I'm honestly not a good person, I don't want to die but maybe I should.Worthless is a good word to describe me, and I'm not just being dramatic. I can't give people what they need, I'm too emotionally vacant. I do bad things in order to feel something ya know. I have tried medication and therapy which I can't afford anymore, and honestly it did not help. This is hard describing how I feel but I don't wanna feel this anymore
