I don't get it.Why won't they let me die. WHY!?!?! I DON'T FUCKING GET IT! Why can't they just kill me. Every day gets worse. I add nothing to the world. WHY why why why. I can't tell anyone this or they will lock me up in the psych ward again. I don't get it. I just dont get life. I just can't do life. I'm losing my fucking mind over here and can't tell anyone. I can't even drink to get to an altered state of mind. I'm too young. I hate my existence. I hate everything about myself. I feel like an animal on the road that got ran over, it's guts hanging out of it, yet it is still alive. It is in tremendous pain, but everyone keeps driving by. No one is helping it.
