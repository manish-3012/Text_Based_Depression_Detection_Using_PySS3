SuicideI've been dealing with constant feelings of being lonely, sad, exhausted. A few months ago, I wrote a suicide note. I had been feeling really low for months and because of that I always had fights with my mom and it didn't help that she kept repeating that she doesn't know how can she help me, she didn't know what to do anymore. She wanted me to move out because she could feel my negative energy and said that it was bringing others down. So I had plan of when and how I would do it. Then the day before, I just told her everything. We called a crisis line which helped a bit and said they would refer me to a psychologist at their hospital... Which never happened. The hospital never called me back.

So we managed to fin a psychologist and nothing's working, nothing.

Honestly I feel like I can't talk to my mom about this because when I had told her about it last time (few months ago), she yelled at me and said that even if I do it, they would be sad but they will get over it.

But nothing's working. The therapy is not working. I can't talk to my dad because he's drinking 24/7 amd I haven't seen him since christmas. I have no close friends, my grandma is another alcoholic and I can't tell her about it because she would be devastated. My mom's gonna get mad at me once again. So I have no idea what to do, but I know if I don't do anything about it anytime soon, I won't be able to hold on. I'm barely holding on right now. And I already know how to do it but the only reason holding me back is if it ends up not killing me and damaging my organs or brain
