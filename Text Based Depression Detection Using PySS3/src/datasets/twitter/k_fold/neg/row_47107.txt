I have nobody to turn to...I'm 17 years old and I have been bullied and beat up my whole life...recently I was sexually assaulted by my uncle...when I told my parents they said it never happened and never tried to help me. I became distant and I lost it. My parents used to choke me..pin me against walls and things...I tried to kill myself at the beginning of the summer and got sent to a hospital for a while...while there I told my social worker what my uncle did to me...legally she had to tell my parents. They said it was either I find somewhere to go or I will be put in foster care..I thankfully found a distant relative to stay with but...I feel so alone. My whole family ignores me now...they refuse to except I am even alive. I started cutting again..each night it's been getting worse...I think I am going to kill myself on Friday (10/23)..I am afraid but...I don't know what else to do anymore..nobody wants me...I just want to be dead..

EDIT:



Thank you for your help...I know what you mean...I do...but that guy is right...why keep hurting..
You guys can do this. The best thing for me was music...I loved music...just give it a shot..
