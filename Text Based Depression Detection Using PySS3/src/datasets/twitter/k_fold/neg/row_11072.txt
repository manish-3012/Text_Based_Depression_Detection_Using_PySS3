HelpI live in Nevada county California can someone direct me on my resources available...? Any fellow Californians? Or better yet anyone near me? I cut myself today. I'm not trying to kill myself but today is the first day I've had the feeling in my gut to go through with it. I'm struggling to be productive and am overwhelmed by everything. I don't know who to call for help and I don't want pity. It's all my fault for letting my life become like this. I don't have any support systems here. I live and work alone and have been here a year with no success at making friends.
