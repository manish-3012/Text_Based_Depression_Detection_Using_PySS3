Why should I not put my plan into action?I've been planning to kill myself for a year now. I thought I'd fucking be gone in May. Then Oct. 28. Now I think I want to do this ASAP. I don't give a fuck if I kill myself on Christmas Day. Maybe I'll wrap myself up like a fucking present, lmfao.

I have been abused since childhood. I was homeless for nearly 3 years until the pandemic started. I thought I was stable, I thought I was going to get back to college and finish my degree, but I'm being evicted, basically. Other people don't like to live with me, and the feeling's mutual. I have no fucking clue where I'm going but I am *s i c k* of this being my life. I have $1200 and no car of my own. I'm tired of trusting people only to be stabbed in the FUCKING BACK. That's all my life is. My head is like a scrambled GPS, Rerouting... rerouting... rerouting... fucking kill me.
