I give up.I did my best. I dont deserve all this  shit I have in my life right now. I dont deserve to suffer this fucking life. I didnt even cause it! These fucking bunch of parasites and pests! i just wanted to have a good future. Hell I made efforts for it! I dont deserve this! My mother used my " family gratefulness" so I can loan money in the bank so my sibling in college and high school wont have to suffer the same  way I suffered in college. Damn I didnt eat for days so I can pay for my thesis! And now the fucking pest didnt even graduate because of being a try-hard cool motherfucking social climber in college! so I shared this to a friend of mine and replied "well it was your choice". I knew my friend got a point but thats family man?! We dont abandon family! But this is enough! This family SUCKED everything out of me from my spirit to finances! Now my fiance, consider leaving because its seems like our dream wedding, future life cant be achieved anymore! This girl is the only good thing in my.life right now. Please dont be mad to her. She's a good person and also did her best to accept my fucked up life but she's right! She also doesnt deserve to have a fucking messed up married life to me! I dpnt deserve this motherfucking fucked fucking life!!!! Shit! Goddammnit! I wanna die! Fucking internet filter! Im searching for 2 hours on how to die painlessly and nothing shows but fucking advises Ive heard before! My life is so fucked up buried in debt and suffering! I deserve a peaceful way to go and sleep and never wake up! FUCK!!!!!!!!!!
