Nowhere else to go, nothing else to doMy mother destroyed my future by â€œhomeschoolingâ€ me (meaning, not actually teaching me anything but keeping me locked in the house for fear of me leaving their religion). Sheâ€™s a much better person nowadays and would have done things differently, given the chance, but itâ€™s just too late now. Ironically Iâ€™m a bartender now but I suck at it because of my poor social skills. I donâ€™t get many hours at work. I canâ€™t afford to go to school. I have no merit for scholarships and Iâ€™m not eligible for financial aid. My boyfriend of 9 years sees us as â€œmarried without the paperâ€, but thatâ€™s not good enough for me or our families. I want to get married for real, get a degree, have kids and make money from home. Those were my only goals, but itâ€™s too much to ask for my career level and education, an itâ€™s just not in the cards for us as a couple. We donâ€™t want any of the same things. I donâ€™t want to exist anymore. Iâ€™ve lost control of my life. Thereâ€™s nothing else for me to do but die. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. It just seems so stupid to even try. Iâ€™ve always been an optimist and have never had suicidal tendencies before, and nobody has any idea that Iâ€™m even thinking of this, which would make it so easy. Iâ€™ll feel bad for my family, but (and I feel terrible for saying this, but) theyâ€™re just not enough to make me want to stay. Iâ€™m struggling to find any more reason not to die at this point.
