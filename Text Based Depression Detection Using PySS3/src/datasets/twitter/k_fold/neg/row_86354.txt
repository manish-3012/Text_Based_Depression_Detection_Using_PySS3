Is it just me or does therapy seem like bullshitI've been going to therapy for almost two years now and they have just made everything worse. They give me pills that dont do shit but give me terriable side effects. They give you random pills hoping that they'll help. That's not science that's faith. They make you relive trauma because it's supposed to "help" you. But really all it does is just make you more depressed because it's all you can think about now. Then they tell you to just change your mindset with bullshit CBT techniques. If it was that easy to change your mindset you dont think we would have done that. Do they think we want all this suffering, do they think we asked for this, and then they say "just give it time things will get better". But that's just another fucking lie. All they do is tell you lies and then when you actually try to end it all they say "just give it time things will get better." Well when, you ask them this and they just ignore you because even they know that's a lie.

Sorry for the rant
