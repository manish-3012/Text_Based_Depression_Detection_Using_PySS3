Advice??My best irl friend killed himself late June last year and I have been coping with it but I don't have anyone to talk to?I have a really good internet friend but she's in a different time zone and I feel like I'm always a burden to her.I have depression and anxiety but I don't have a therapist and I don't take any medications.I want to talk to my mom about it but I don't know how to bring it up and every time I almost do,I phsych myself out.My panic/anxiety attacks have been getting worse and its getting harder to hide my self harm scars.I feel like I'm stuck and I can't do anything.Im in a very bad place and I don't know what to do..Advice??
