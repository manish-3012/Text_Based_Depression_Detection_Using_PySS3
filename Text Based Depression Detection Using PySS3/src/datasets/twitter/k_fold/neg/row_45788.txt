life is unfair.. I do not want to be apart of this world because of it.we all know the life is unfair... somewhere out there in the world someones getting raped, while someone else is getting showered in kisses by a significant other. My point is, life is very unfair. I have been done very dirty by life, I was born into an abusive family... thereâ€™s no point of reference of life that I have before the trauma, because I grew up with it. I was set up to be psychologically damaged... Now thereâ€™s a lot of broken aspects of me... and itâ€™s like ... why do I have to deal with the effects of my abusers?
