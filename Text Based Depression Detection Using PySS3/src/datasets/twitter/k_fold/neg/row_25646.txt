Is there a difference between suicide and euthanasia?I'm an older male. I've lived my life and had my fun and done most things a person my age should do. but now I'm all alone, I've become fully introverted and I realize that I'll die all alone. there's not much in my life going on and I'm So bored. also this world seems so mean and I feel quite sad about our society and I don't want to be a part of it anymore. I guess I'm just tired of life. Is it really such a bad idea that I end it now instead of waiting +/-20 years to die naturally. I'd probably have done it already but I'm really scared of death. What would be a good way to get over this fear?
