No hope.Well, i'm 24 year-old boy, dropped off university twice because I've made bad choices. No education, can't find a decent job. Long story short, I'm giving up. No real friends, mainly because I'm too asocial and awkward. And I consider myself as an average person with no real skills like music and other professional domains. I'm still living with my parents. I've been seen a doctor twice a week for 5 years, but it doesn't change a fucking thing. The only thing that give me some relief, is meds (painkillers for headaches, xanax, etc..). And I can't stop abusing them, until I pass out for hours. I already tried to kill myself. My first 24 years were pretty dull, and I think my 25's will be the end of it. I'm lost, and I'm sick of people telling me 'oh it's gonna get better'. I end up thinking I'm not made for this world, or society. The day, I'll be on my own, which will be very soon, I'm will be probably found dead by OD. And the world will keep spinning.
