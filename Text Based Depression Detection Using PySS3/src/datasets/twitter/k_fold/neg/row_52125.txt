constant thoughts of suicideI constantly think about suicide because it comforts me somehow,
and I've tried multiple times but survived. 
&gt;hate my hair
&gt;hate my skin
&gt;hate my personality
and I'm a fucking shy fuck who can barely speak to people.
I flaunt my psychotic side when I feel intimidated and it almost feels like my brain gets a jolt of adrenaline and become extremely aggressive. 
Been on and off medication but most of the time it makes it worse.
also a sociopath so I don't really know if I'd care if anybody cared, just trying to think of things to make my brain stop fucking with me.
