Advice for confidence?Iâ€™m a 16 year old female and Iâ€™ve always had bad self-image issues. I just posted something here on reddit, asking people if they thought I was ugly and even though I didnâ€™t even get a single negative comment I still hate myself. Ive hated everything about me, ever since I was younger. I stare at the floor when I brush my teeth, hide from cameras, etc. Iâ€™ve always felt this way and when it comes to sending snapchats or posting Instagram pictures, I canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m not sure how to stop being so anxious about it, because I know I canâ€™t do this forever. At the moment I feel really anxious and I feel like crying because why? My face. It might seem silly to others but itâ€™s what affects me the most. I know I could never find acceptance with the way I look even if I get complimented because Iâ€™m really sick, mentally. Iâ€™m not sure where or how to get help for this because I could never imagine loving myself. Right now I just feel like crying till Iâ€™m numb, falling asleep, and never waking up. But I canâ€™t, because I have a dress up event to attend, and let me just say that those are the worst. My social anxiety really grows out of my low self esteem. Iâ€™m not sure what to do, or how to get out of this pessimistic mindset.
