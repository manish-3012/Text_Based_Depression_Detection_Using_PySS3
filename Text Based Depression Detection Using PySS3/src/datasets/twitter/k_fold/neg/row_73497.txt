Help can't help me...help can't help anyone...My trauma and mental health history is extensive and complicated and now takes pages to recount so I won't. Imagine the typical...anyway...
I've been an outsider for my entire life and not just in my imagination, in reality, people say this to me and call me "weird" and "mean" and "edgy" and "different." I am a graduate student right now and I'm no fool. The people in my program hate me and gossip about me. Everyone always hates me, it's just a thing. And this is true and real, I have evidence to support this claim and CBT can suck it...haha...but really, it can suck it and the premise on which CBT is built is invalidation dressed up in appealing words like logic. I am the real exception to positive psychology. Fuck Rogers too.
The truth about "help" and "evidence based" is actually frightening...because it's literally reflective listening and asking open-ended questions and hospitalizing people to save the therapist's ass...and in the hospital they abuse and blackmail and confuse and drug you until you're too bullied to want to kill yourself anymore for a month or two...and then it all creeps back up as you recover. that's all "help" has to offer. DBT, CBT...there's no real solution to being...in pain. The people who recover were meant to recover...I thoroughly believe statistical regression (in the social science sense) explain many of the "successful" stories of getting help.
People with severe, persistent mental illness...to be honest, are alone treading in deep water.
If this is it, what am I fucking doing? If every day for decades has hurt like this and is going to keep hurting like this, why go on?
