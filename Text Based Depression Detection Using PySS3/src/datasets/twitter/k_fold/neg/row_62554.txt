Everyday I am pushed more and more into contemplating suicide. No one really cares about you until youâ€™re truly gone.With whatâ€™s going on in the world, with the pandemic, the political bullshit, having to work during a pandemic and risk exposing myself to COVID-19, then dealing with my SO whoâ€™s a â€œrecoveringâ€ addict/alcoholic, who only cares about me if heâ€™s in a good mood. The second heâ€™s in a bad mood (or we get into an argument) he relapses, then the lies, manipulation, and gaslighting comes back. Itâ€™s like a â€œfuck you, I donâ€™t care about what youâ€™re feeling or thinking, Iâ€™m going to do whatever I wantâ€. He left at 9am to go fishing to â€œthinkâ€ and heâ€™s been gone since, itâ€™s currently 6:20pm. 

Found out that he stole $100 from my wallet this morning (claiming itâ€™s his money) yet it was in MY wallet. Clearly, he doesnâ€™t give a shit about me, no matter how many times he says â€œI love youâ€. Because, he sure as hell doesnâ€™t show it. Just nothing but empty/broken promises. I should be used to it by now, especially after 7 years.

My mental health has been getting much worse. My depression is really getting worse. I miss my dad who passed away in 2014, thatâ€™s really taking a toll on my depression as well. I want to be with him. I have mental breakdowns and feel alone everyday, and I just want to stop existing to make everything go away. 

I recently started self-harming again, its the only thing that makes me feel alive and I start thinking that I deserve this pain. 

I donâ€™t know how much longer Iâ€™m willing to put up with up with this. I feel like death will be my only release from this hell on earth.
