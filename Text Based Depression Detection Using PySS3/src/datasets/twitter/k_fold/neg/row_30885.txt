What will non existence be like ?Does anyone feel suicidal as a time machine / portal. 

I just want to go back to when the world was a rainbow , those feelings of love and Thanksgiving and just enjoying a ride on a horse and buggy collecting Christmas trees and having a hot apple cider and enjoying the cook air and family togetherness. We used to cut down Christmas trees together and there was so much love. Every day just feels like a bad dream. 

All I've been doing lately is wandering through the graveyard. It's peaceful but scary. In tried my best. One of those lone warriors that did a ton of food but will never really be known or recognized for the good things. And I feel like I've learned too many things about the universe. Ignorance is bliss. Conscious spiritual growth is best. From birth to death we can reduce suffering and make the experience highly spiritual. But it's hard to create that environment when you feel like the world rips you apart.
