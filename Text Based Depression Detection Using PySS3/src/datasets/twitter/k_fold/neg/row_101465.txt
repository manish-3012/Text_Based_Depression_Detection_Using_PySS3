I think I found something to live for...After decades of suicidal thought and depression everything becomes the same, music is just music, films are just films, and books are just books. As a bored guy stuck in quarantine and considering I believe(d) I didnâ€™t have much time left I decided to re some classic books. I read Lord of The Flies... for the first time in a long time I was able to feel something while reading and this wasnâ€™t just a book it was an adventure. I canâ€™t believe how I feel like right. I have lived the past two decades of my life I in unimpressed by it all, but this book has brought me more closure and hope than i could even ever imagine
