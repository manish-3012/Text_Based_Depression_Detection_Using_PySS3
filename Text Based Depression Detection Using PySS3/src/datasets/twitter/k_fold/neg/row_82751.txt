I FUCKING HATEwhen you throw me away;   
i am a human toybot, a message to lay,

hate when you ask me to wait

give me the shoulder, tell me someday.

i'm diffused, drying--waxen--once I was clay

ready,in your hand,

statuesque and foreign-familar

ebbing with possibility

and you were my whole world climbing

the tree of my mood,sanding out

,and lapsing on the beach of my fears

i hate when you throw me away

like the dead crab

i returned to the sea,

not knowing it'd drift into me
