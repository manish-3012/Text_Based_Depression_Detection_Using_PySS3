I need a reason not to end it tonight.Hi. I won't go into a huge amount of details but here is the TL;DR.





Always have had anxiety, I'm 23 now. Panic disorder started at age 9. Didn't go to a year of high school because my panic attacks were constant and I felt overwhelmed easially. Been in hospitals, therapy, and on countless pills for 8 years. I get overwhelmed very easily. I panic 4+ times a week. I was diagnosed with Bipolar-I 5 months ago. I barely sleep because I'm scared of having a medical emergency. I have severe depression to the point where I can't even play video games.



So don't tell me "it gets better," because my prognosis is suicide within 8 hours or a lifetime of pain. 




So tell me why? Why go on? I have about 5 minutes a day where I forgot my issues and it's great but the other 23 hours 55 minutes are hell, truly hell.
