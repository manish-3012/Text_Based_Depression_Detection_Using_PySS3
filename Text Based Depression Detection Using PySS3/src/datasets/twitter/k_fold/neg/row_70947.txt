The allure of a 'stop button' has become too much to resist
I've been suicidally depressed for 4 years now,
every night I've cried myself to sleep hoping that things will turn around tomorrow and I'll get a glimpse of what it was like to be happy.
But everything has slowly but surely gotten worse.
I've tried therapy, medication, exercise, diet change, 
and mediatation (which was the most effective)

My business has failed, I'm out of money, and hopelessly unemployed.
I haven't been able to connect with anyone in the longest time - friends, family, or romantic partners.
I'm painfully alone

I'm sick of suffering,
the allure of suicide has become too much to resist.
Once my lease is up next month I will  flood my body with heroin.
I've avoided opiods my whole life so that accidental tollerance will not be an issue.

I know my death will devastate my family.
My mother has told me specifically that if I killed myself she wouldn't be far behind,
but she brought me into this world without my permission,
I plan to leave it without hers.

I've been told time and time again that 'it gets better'
and I can accept that there's a possibility it might.
But one more day of this hell is not worth a lifetime of bliss.

Not exactly sure why I'm here,
I guess deep down I just want to talk to someone that understands hopelessness.

Why have you not killed yourself yet?
