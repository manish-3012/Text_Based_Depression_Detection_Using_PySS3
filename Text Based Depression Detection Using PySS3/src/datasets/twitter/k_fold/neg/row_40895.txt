Iâ€™m So Tempted to Google â€œHow to Kill Myself Painlessly.â€Or maybe I just need someone to talk to. I donâ€™t know... thatâ€™s the thing sometimes, you donâ€™t want to bother people about what youâ€™re going through because itâ€™s too personal. Killing yourself, ending it all... itâ€™s a ritual that lurks in your mind, a private act that you donâ€™t want others to know youâ€™re going through. (Heck, Iâ€™ve been pondering if I should press post for the last few minutes.) Plus Iâ€™m already filled with so much shame I donâ€™t need that rubbing off people. Thatâ€™s kind of the dilemma with suicide, you want it to end but you know youâ€™re going to fuck up your family even more. 

And if you somehow share it, it comes out as casual jokes. Sometimes laughing at it helps. 

I imagine slitting my own throat but Iâ€™m scared of the pain. I feel like itâ€™d be more fun than cutting your wrists. Cutting your wrists sounds like itâ€™ll take a long time. ODing on pills also sounds like a bad party time in your stomach. Hanging yourself doesnâ€™t sound fun either. I donâ€™t wanna flail my legs around waiting for the oxygen to stop. Dunno...
