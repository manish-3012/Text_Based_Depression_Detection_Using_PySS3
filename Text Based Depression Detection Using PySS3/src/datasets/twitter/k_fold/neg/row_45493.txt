A ex-poligamist into a woman-sharing monogamistI know it's stupid, but it gives me a mental breakdown

&amp;#x200B;

I've been sexually abused at school and I am addicted to a certain type of porn because of the abuse- it's mmf, gangbang, dp, dvp, dap, double-dick blowjob porn. I'm was a normal straight guy that preferred ffm threesome, but because of the bi-curious bullies somehow I my libido wormed in that type of porn. I hate it. I ask you -what can I do about it? I don't like it to me it seems like liking extremely kinky sex-and that's not what I would ever want to like. Do you get me? It got to the point that when I see a woman I have to associate the mmf automatically. I feel disgusted and really don't like this gay shit. How do I cure myself into a more polygamist (that I used to be) instead of sharing monogamist.
