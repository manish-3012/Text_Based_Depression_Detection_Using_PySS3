SorryToday during my school chapel they played a song my father sings. All the time I heard those first words and it was like I was transported back into my past. I wasnâ€™t there but I saw everything all the memories I saw them. They where only blurry images and seens but the feelings from those times burned inside me, growing and bubbling in my stomach. I felt so scared, so lost, So helpless. 

With 3 notes 3 words I was one again a trapped scared little girl. I thought I was past this. I thought wrong Ig. Sorry
