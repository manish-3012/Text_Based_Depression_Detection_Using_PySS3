Why botherThe only reason I was staying alive was my dog. Now heâ€™s dead and I donâ€™t want to be here. The world seems so much worse without him. He was the only thing that brightened my day. I canâ€™t get another dog because my roommates wonâ€™t let me. I hate my life. Iâ€™m so broken just beyond repair. Iâ€™m incapable of doing anything...canâ€™t do school work, canâ€™t clean my room, canâ€™t see friends. Life is overwhelming and it always will be, and Iâ€™ve lost the only thing that made it somewhat bearable.
