I think I am killing myself soon. Should I go to a hospital or something?All I've had for the past 9 years are suicidal thoughts. And now in the past few weeks, I have been seriously contemplating suicide. 

I'm too scared to get help but I don't think it would be cool if I killed myself. 

What should I do?
