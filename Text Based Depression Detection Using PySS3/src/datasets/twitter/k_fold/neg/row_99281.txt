Do you ever wish there was a way to 'give up' without dying?The last couple months I keep thinking about the concept of "giving up."

Over and over I've found myself wishing I could "just give up," but when I started to try to think through what giving up means, and what giving up looks like, I couldn't really come up with anything.

My suicidal tendencies are definitely on the passive end of the spectrum--I don't really want to kill myself so much as I sometimes think that I want to die or already be dead or never have been born or get some sort of magic do-over in life.

I think this is why my brain sometimes gravitates toward the idea of just giving up but like... how does one give up? At bare minimum the bills must be paid somehow. What would giving up actually entail, short of dying?

I wish there was some way to give up without dying; something between being alive and dead; some way to just get a break from being a human forced to keep going every day.
