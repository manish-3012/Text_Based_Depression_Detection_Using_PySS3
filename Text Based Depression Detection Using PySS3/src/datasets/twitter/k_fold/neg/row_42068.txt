All the loose endsI'm not posting here for help or for attention. 
I've already accepted my fate. Please don't refer me to any hotlines or reason with me. 

I'm here to ask, how do I sort my items?
I've written my scheduled email and will not give any passwords to anyone.

My money is being rounded up, I'm cleaning my room, taking care of personal hygiene that I've prior neglected etc, but I was wondering about the rest. What do you all reccomend for my personal items? 

My "art" and supplies, clothes, stuffed animals (yes, stuffed animals. I have quite the collection), what would you recommend to me to do for everything? 

Or, what do you plan on doing for your items?
