I dont have the desire for life anymoreI don't have the desire for life. I can't get happy no matter what i do. today i told someone i hated them because just got fed up with all the "I'm sorry".... i don't know what to do.. I never told anyone i hated them before but i couldn't take it because i fell in love. i don't know how to feel, i don't know what to say, i don't know what to think.
