I can feel myself slipping againI've tried to end my life on several occations. One time I stopped myself after I downed a bunch of pills and made myself puke them up. The other times I've had to reach out to a friend so that she could stop me and I ended up at the psychiatric ER for a few days. I'm currently 24 years old and I've been depressed since I was around 8. Every single day that goes by I find myself slipping more and more, and right now I'm not far from the edge. Frankly, I fear that I might try something again... soon.

I'm actually not sure why I'm writing this here... but I feel like this might be a place where people can - I don't know - give me tips or something. How can you get out of this endless cycle of just going down the same path time and time again? What do you people do to keep yourself occupied and put your mind on other things? How do you people cope?
