I want to end my life because I feel extremely alone and I can't stop thinking about this girl and making mistakes with herI'm 23 and have a lot of things going for me but I can help but dwell on my past experience with bullying even by my loved ones. I feel so alone and make constant mistakes and just find myself alone in my bedroom at the end of every night with my thoughts. Alone well the girl I'm in love with is out gettiong fucked by someone else because I'm too afrid to be forward with her. 

I know I'm a victim.
