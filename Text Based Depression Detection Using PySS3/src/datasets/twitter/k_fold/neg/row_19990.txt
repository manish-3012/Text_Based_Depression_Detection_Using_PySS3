Nobody to turn toI have no friends most family won't talk to me, no girlfriend never had one I'ma be on my own pretty soon since I'm 17. Nobody will hire me because I'm the typical creepy dude that nobody gives a fuck about. People despise me and want to destroy me. It's a nightmare getting mental health treatment because I'm a male. God this isn't for attention or compliments but I really can't stand it. I just wish somebody cared and I wish I wasn't so subhuman.
