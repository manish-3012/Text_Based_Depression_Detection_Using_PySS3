Finally readyItâ€™s not this overwhelming impulse anymore. Itâ€™s actually very calm. A calming decision.

On October 29th, 5am, I will head to the Golden Gate Bridge on my beloved motorcycle. Iâ€™ll hug her goodbye. Iâ€™ll walk along the bridge, displaying my mastery of performing for people, entertaining others, by wearing a smile. Iâ€™ll find my spot. Inhale, exhale, hands over my chest. Climb up, fall backwards head first. Everything will be okay.

Iâ€™m perpetually lonely. Nothing will make me feel better. Iâ€™m broken, incapable of feeling anyone. My therapist, bless her heart, has put up with so much shit from me. I care about her so much. Sheâ€™s the only person I care about. I donâ€™t want her to deal with me anymore. I donâ€™t want to feel lonely anymore. I want to die.
