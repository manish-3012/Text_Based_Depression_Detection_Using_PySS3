After a anti depressants change I'm the most suicidal I've beenBased off Emmegard's scale I'm at a 8 where I had been at 6 prior to today. I don't care anymore. I just want to be alone.  I don't want to reach out because I'm trying to decide if this is it. I'll use roach posion but I haven't done research into it. My husband is here for me though and I can hurt him by dying.

Work sucks. Customers and staff treat me like shit. My family had turned from me. After a FB post about people not wearing face masks being dumb my uncle and aunt sent me anti-semetic propaganda to explain why masks are bad. My uncle called my husband a snowflake and told us to grow up for disagreeing with them. My grandmother (who raised me) blames me for making the post in the beginning.
