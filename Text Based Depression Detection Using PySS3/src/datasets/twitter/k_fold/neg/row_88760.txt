Dying seems easier than learning to respect myselfAnother sleepless night, and I came to a realization that I know, sort of, what I need to do to improve my mental health. However, the person I value least in this world is me, and the hurdle of overcoming over a decade of self-deprecation, self-hate, and factors outside my control....

No, it'd be much easier to die. If only my younger siblings weren't so important to me. I mean nothing to me, but they'd be crushed, even though I live over a thousand miles away and barely see them.

I don't have the willpower to care about myself, yet I can't off myself knowing what it'd do to my family. My suffering matters less than their stable future. 

Maybe I'm a coward, maybe it's all an excuse, maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm comfortable, but I can't seem to change myself. I keep ending up here.
