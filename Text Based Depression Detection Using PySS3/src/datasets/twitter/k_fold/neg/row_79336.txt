Is life even worth it at this point?I want to be the happy one that makes everyone happy and laugh and smile, but I CANâ€™T WHEN STUPID PEOPLE DO SHIT LIKE THIS. GORGE, COVID-19, PEOPLE KILLING EACH OTHER BECAUSE OF ONE FUCKING INCIDENT THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. but NOW PEOPLE WANT TO KILL OTHERS!? Fun fact; genocide is the EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY WANT...and yet...they cause genocide to stop genocide...how does that even work....ok lemme tell you how this...â€worksâ€


One thing happens that have happened many times before and yet the decided to act now and not before. The cause violence to get noticed, witch is the exact thing they want to stop...the big people donâ€™t do anything about it because they want oil money now and forever because they are afraid of change (as all adults are) once they effect there money they listen and then give the people what they want...but it only works for a short period of time

And then the cycle repeats itself over and over and over again ...until we all end up killing ourself in the process


Change will never happen 
Stupid people will continue to get more stupid 

And I KNOW some of you will say
â€œOh WeLl ThErE iS hOpEâ€ NO THERE FUCKING ISNâ€™T...death shouldnâ€™t solve the problem

But the only way for us to have true change...
Is to off ourselves at the same time
Then for once in life



There will be peace
