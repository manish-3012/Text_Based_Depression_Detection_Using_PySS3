Bad at titles.I just feel like tonight is really it for me. It's been a rough year for me. I've been stuck at the same crappy job now for 5 years and I'm just stuck. I'm stuck needing to help my mother who didn't have a job for a long time and only now is making slightly above minimum wage. And yeah a big part of it is that I'm alone. My first relationship ended horribly  (lying, cheating, etc.) So after one or two other failures I spent the next few years not trying to date, sticking to casual stuff and not wanting more. Then I was set up with a girl who really changed my views on it. She seemed to actually care and made me want more for myself, she wasnt like girls I'd been with before. We were together about a year before I found out she had been sleeping with several of her coworkers. To say the least it crushed me. Every thing she ever told me that made me rethink my life suddenly faded away. Now everything seems like it was a complete lie.  And now to make things even worse, she is starting at my workplace in a week. It just hurts because she was the first girl I trusted in a long time. She started to heal old scars and then turned around and made them even worse and left me wondering if literally any second of the last year was what I thought it was. I've always struggled with depression but this year just seems to be kicking my ass. I really feel like I have no hope in life anymore. I've always struggled with an alcohol problem and over the last year I admit I've gotten much much worse. I dunno. These probably don't even seem like big deals but to me they are.
