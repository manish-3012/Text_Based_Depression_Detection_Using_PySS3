Why should I live?I know life is supposed to be a gift, but I feel like death is a bigger and better gift. Iâ€™m a introvert and extremely shy, and I have a personality where Iâ€™m just mean (I used to be able to keep it under control). But I think because Iâ€™m going through the stages of being a teenager and stress from high school I lost my control on it and now, for a year or two, Iâ€™ve just been hurting everyone I love (not physically) and Iâ€™ve just been thinking... if I kill my self 1. Iâ€™ll be dead, so no more stress 2. Iâ€™ll stop hurting my family 3. If Iâ€™m not around anymore like a giant black cloud, my family can be happy, but maybe not for a week or two, but they will be at some point when Iâ€™m not around anymore. I also canâ€™t just go and talk to someone about how I feel
