Please help me. Today started out fine, like most days usually do. 

But as I laid in bed, trying to fall asleep, everything came crashing down. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a bad person. I'm a failure. There is no reason for me to stay here anymore but I'm too afraid to try and end it all. I want to be better but all I've ever felt is self-loathing and how do I stop that? I don't know what to do anymore.
