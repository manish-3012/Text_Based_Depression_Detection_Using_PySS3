This is the endI've been thinking about killing myself for 2 years now and its only gotten worse since the beginning. Life has no meaning, no point. I've attempted suicide two times, obviously, I failed each time. The first I tried to overdose on melatonin (sleeping pills) but six was clearly not enough, the second I tried to hang myself however, the ceiling fan was too low. I'm going to try for a third time very soon, no one truly knows the pain that is my existence and I don't expect you to get it either.

This is my final cry for help, this is the end.
