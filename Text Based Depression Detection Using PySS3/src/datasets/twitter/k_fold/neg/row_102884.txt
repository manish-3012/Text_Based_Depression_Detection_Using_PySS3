just want it all to endI was happy but didn't know it. Thought quitting my job and starting the business would be great and make me happy, but all I have found is sadness and feeling of despair. Everyday I dread waking up, I just want to slip away during my sleep. I think of ending everyday but the thought of what it would do to my wife and family holds me back but it is getting harder each day. I so regret my choices have ruined what was a decent life. All I can see for the future is struggle and despair. Hanging on by a thread
