The reason I have suicidal thoughts is because of loneliness and wishing I had more intimacy in my life but not being able to get itSo yeah. I've always dreamed of being able to cuddle with someone. Kiss someone. Maybe having a girlfriend or even just someone to cuddle with. But when I can't find someone to do that with and everyone else is doing the things that I've also always really wanted to do I feel like I'll never be good enough for someone. The fear that goes through my mind that I'll never be good enough for someone and that I'll never be able to experience these things really screws with my emotions. It's like I want to feel these things too and I wonder am I good enough for someone? Will I be able to experience these things one day? Some of us have a lot of anxiety when talking to other people or maybe we're on the autism spectrum or are just socially awkward. So that makes it hard for us. But we want to pursue relationships too whatever type of relationship that may be. Even if it's just someone to cuddle with. But I fear that people might want to avoid me because I'm different or seem awkward and then that makes me feel like there's something wrong with me but I know there probably isn't. I don't know. I'm just really trying to express how I feel here. I know other people are going through the same types of feelings I am and I want us to be understood. I'm on the autism spectrum and have always been a little afraid to approach almost everyone just to talk to them. Everyone's situation is probably different but that's my situation. So when I'm thinking about these things a I feel lonely it really messes with my head and I want that to be understood. Not to mention other people will actually bully you about these things and say you're not good enough for someone which makes it even worse and that's why it's so hard.
