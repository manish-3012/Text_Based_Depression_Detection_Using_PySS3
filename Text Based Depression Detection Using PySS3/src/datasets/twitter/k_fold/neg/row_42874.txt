I have absolutely nothing anymore.I have no family where I live - and I see them rarely. Not many friends. The last, most important person I have/had (SO) has decided leave me for good. I'm completely alone, in the dark and have nothing to grasp onto. I feel like I'm going nuts. A job that goes nowhere. Schooling I have to catch up to. And all this depression I had when I was younger has crept up back into my life and causing me hell.

There is virtually nothing stopping me besides the pain it would cause my family and leaving my beloved pet. 
I just need someone to talk to. No one else wants to be here. PM me.
