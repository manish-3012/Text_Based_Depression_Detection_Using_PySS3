lost everything of valuei dont really know how to tell the story in a way that it makes sense to others. i was bullied from a young age, the first 20 years of my life didnt have a single moment of happiness, i felt alone no matter where i'd be, even when i got older and had friends, and i always felt like things were missing. there was never a moment where i actually felt good, sometimes things hurt less, that was as good as a day got for me.

a few years ago my life changed. after a lot of random occurences i met a girl. this was the first person to ever look at me like im normal and worth as much as anyone else, the first person where i felt valued and appreciated. she gave me humanity from having nothing. it made every single part of my life better, everything became easier, i became happy. she didnt even need to do anything, waking up seeing her there was enough to make my life feel perfect, and to me it was.

i went from spending every single day of my life feeling like shit and not worth anything at all inside while having to keep up a wall of being okay to actually feeling like i had value.

this girl might not have been perfect but she made me feel perfect, she made me feel like a human being, and i would have done anything for her, and i did.

we were together for years, everything was great, we talked about marriage just a week ago, there was nothing wrong. a week ago she went on a short holiday with her friends and yesterday i got a call telling me she was in an accident and didnt make it.

this woman was the only reason ive ever felt like i had any value. i dont know what to do. it was so hard to not just kill myself yesterday, to try and stay in bed and go to sleep. i feel so physically sick i dont know how to go on and i dont know why.

i really dont see why i should be alive tomorrow, i just dont see the point anymore. i dont know what to do
