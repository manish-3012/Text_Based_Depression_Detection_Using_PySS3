The notion of being foundIâ€™ve been really struggling lately and feel like Iâ€™m not even in control of myself or my emotions anymore. I really think the only proper solution would be to die but I donâ€™t want to leave that burden on my family to find me. Idk if thatâ€™s a sign of hope, truly just feels like an inconvenience in the way. Iâ€™ve gotten so good at pushing everyone away I have no one left. Iâ€™d never thought this is where I would be, feeling so hopeless and worthless, I just wish it could all be different.
