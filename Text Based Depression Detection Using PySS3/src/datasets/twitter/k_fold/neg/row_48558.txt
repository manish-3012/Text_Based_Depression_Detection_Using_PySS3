NFor people saying that suicide is a bad thing, yes, I know it is a bad thing, yes I know my family will be torn apart, but they'll recover. When you say do it for your family, I literally am alive today because I thought yesterday, mom would be sad. But that's the thing. Why should I be selfless for living but selfish for wanting to die? Where is the goddamn line??
I hate myself. 


The only reason I don't die now because of frigging difficulty in getting stuff to die, because I'm stuck with roommates. I'd thought of jumping, but now I don't even have that high buildings near me anymore... I hate this....


You know what my boss called me? Useless.  He didn't say the exact words, but he implied it. Then after a few days, he comes off and apologizes, saying he said those things at the heat of the moment.  Yes, but you also meant them you dick, thanks for doubling my emotional shit. I hate it. 


I don't know. I am numb. I just want to die. Nobody cares.
