Why the ill donâ€™t ask for helpDocs always say Iâ€™m depressed but never ask me more than a question or two. Meds never work bc the docs arenâ€™t asking me anything and I never had courage to tell them because they never seem to care. Years ago I finally called out for help. I called my mom and told her I was self harming and wanted to die etc. you know what she said. â€œIâ€™ve done that (self harm) before. Youâ€™re fine. You donâ€™t need help.â€  (HA my mom also said that when I was bulimic too.) So since then I just try to shove it down. So fast forward I told my boyfriend (also childâ€™s father) that Iâ€™m sick. He constantly sees me crying, upset, knows I have childhood trauma (though he doesnâ€™t know it all.  itâ€™s gotten a lot worse after having a child. I used to be able to deal.) I tell him I need help. I need a therapist etc. he says â€œwhat do you want me to do? I donâ€™t know how that works. Idk how to find you a doctor. Do it for yourself.â€ (FYI He has no idea how to talk to someone with mental illness.) anyway the two people Iâ€™ve cried out to before wanting to really kill myself are too are stupid. And people wonder why ill people donâ€™t ask for help. Thatâ€™s fucking why.
