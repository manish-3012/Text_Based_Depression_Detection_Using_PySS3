How do you open up to friends about dark thoughts?School is overwhelming me, I feel out of touch emotionally, and most days are just a big ball of nihilistic apathy. My grades are high so that's good I guess. 

I've been having suicidal thoughts since HS but I haven't had a depressive episode since then and recently it's been happening again. I am terrified to talk to anyone. I'm in 3rd year of university and everyone thinks I have everything figured out, but I'm just a phony. I'm made out as a high achieving superstar by my peers, but in reality most days I just sit at home on the verge of puking thinking about killing myself.

As pathetic as it may sound, the only reason I don't have the will to go through with it is because I took on a large commitment with the school and don't want to leave  the people involved hanging. 

I want to tell my friends I've been having these thoughts, but I coward out of it every time I get close. I don't deserve the attention, and don't want to appear as though I am seeking attention.
