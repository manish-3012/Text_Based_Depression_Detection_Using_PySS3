Life keeps getting worse for me. Iâ€™ve run out of options I have a illness that doctors canâ€™t diagnose. Iâ€™m just posting this to see if anyone has a similar situation because Iâ€™ve already written my note. 16 years old.For about a year I thought I had hope on figuring out what was wrong with me, so I could move on and have a job, family, or a life. But now I realize thereâ€™s no hope. Weâ€™ve been chasing nothing for 3 years. Iâ€™ve lost friends, relationships, and most importantly my happiness. I donâ€™t want to die I just want the pain to go away. But death is my best option. And my pain really never will go away. Every day I want to down all the pills in my drawer, hang myself with a HDMI cable, or shoot myself in the chest so I can slowly fade. My life is already so far down the rabbit hole no matter how long the rope is Iâ€™ll never be able to pull myself back up. All I do is wake up eat maybe 1 meal or drink 1 cup of water before lying in bed again just wanting to fall asleep because the dreams I have are the only place Iâ€™m not completely down. I have friends in my dreams, I get to see my mom and dad together and Iâ€™m actually running around having fun, I have a girlfriend that Iâ€™m happy to have. So when I wake up itâ€™s all swept away from me. So my real life is almost my nightmares where my dreams are my paradise. Iâ€™m writing this in my bed next to my dog captain at exactly 4:52am. I donâ€™t know if I will end my own life soon but my depression has fully taken over and for me you canâ€™t get out of that dark place. Iâ€™m stuck forever. Iâ€™ve been in my room doing nothing for a long time. And your mind starts to wonder to dark places, but this is the darkest itâ€™s ever been. Iâ€™m sorry mom, dad, 






Everyone keeps telling me itâ€™s gunna get better bet it always gets worse for me. If there is a god why would he have created me. Although Iâ€™m atheist I am now praying for a god because Iâ€™ve got no other alternative. I wonder whatâ€™s my purpose other than to sit in pain. Is there an afterlife? I donâ€™t want anyone to report me, feel sorry for me, I just felt like I had to post my suicide note. Iâ€™m not going to kill myself just wanted to see if anyone is in a similar situation.
