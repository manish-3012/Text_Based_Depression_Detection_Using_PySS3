Now it's only a matter of timeIt's been almost a year and a month since I've stopped working at a hospital, about 4 months of me being unable to search for job due to medical problem and the rest of the time because I either just didnt try (cuz I'm stupid) or I just coulnd't find suitable job - I doubt anyone here will understand, I live in Israel, in a type of settlement called 'kibbutz' (sort of like a village of sorts), the only easy to get job is working in fields and the likes, but I'm unable to work in such jobs because of poor health conditions.




My mother is unemployeed for years now and recently took up a job but quitted that one yesterday due to the work place having no suitable working conditions at all and there was no help from the kibbutz management.




As for me, I've become even more depressed than usual just from waking up and knowing I dont need to go anywhere, I have the whole day to be at home, playing games or talking to people just became a burden, it's not fun anymore, I've reached the point where I need to step outside - meet people, work, these kind of things  that I've barely ever felt but it just doesnt work, I just cant find a job at all.




If you're wondering 'why not just move?', well me and my mother have no income, and none of us have money to even bring food home, every week it's just the same struggle, so moving away is not an option at all, and there's not gonna be any help from the family since they are also not the most financially stable.




I cant get out of this stupid mess, it's like this family of mine is cursed and I was just born into it to suffer. I feel like dying everyday and even if I really meant to take my life I know I just cant, my body wont do it, the only thing I do is barely eat or drink, and my sleeping schedules is all messed up, I'm feeling like there's just no getting out of this. It's impossible. Now it's just a matter of time until we have nothing left and our lives just wither away.
