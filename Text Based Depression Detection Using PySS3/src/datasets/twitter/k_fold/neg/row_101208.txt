I think my friend is going to kill herself.I have a friend who always brings up nonchalantly that she is going to kill herself. She says that life sucks and stuff, and she says it to groups of people. Because she says is so nonchalantly, everyone else brushes it off as a joke. As some one who also feels depressed and suicidal a lot, I was having a conversation about it with her today. She told me that she tells everyone that she is going to kill herself, but no one believes her. No one takes her seriously. She said with 100% confidence that she will kill herself one day. She said this all so nonchalantly which worries me a lot more. I tried recommending medicine or getting some help. I have a friend who killed himself last May, and I have many other suicidal friends, and I don't want to see anyone else die. I am only 18. I haven't even finished high school yet. I shouldn't be worried about my friends dying. I should be worried about who is going to be prom king and queen and other petty high school affairs. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help.
