Gfs sisterSo Iâ€™m worried about my gfs sister. She called her twin brother Thursday night talking about how she wanted to kill herself and took all the pills she had. Her siblings called the cops and she was hospitalized. My gf and her sister drove 200 miles to be with their sister and she was combative and thought it was ridiculous. She came home and then went to work today. She told them they could come home and everything was ok. Iâ€™m worried this means she has decided to end her life for good. Am I valid in thinking this?
