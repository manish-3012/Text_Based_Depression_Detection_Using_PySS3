Any suggestions?I'm 24M. Have had thoughts of suicide since around my freshman year in high school where rejection and bullying was all too common. It's very hard to remember good times but recalling unfavorable memories just seems second nature  at this point and over the last few months noticed i'll twitch on occasion when remembering those times. Other times i'll hit myself to numb the emotional pain.

I've gone thru 5 different jobs. For one, I can't talk to people. I try but my mind goes blank. It's hard feeling you connect with no one. Another, is people still wanting to bully me. I guess I'm just an easy target. Eventually I just start spending my breaks alone. Well I quit my last job early January and am having trouble wanting to "keep going."

 Went to my doctor around February and got prescribed ecitalopram. I had gone to him years before but nothing happened so i've hesitated going back to him for help. It's been over a month since taking the drugs and I can't say I feel any different.

Have been distancing from friends and have never felt comfortable talking to my family about this matter so neither of them are an option. 

I don't want to say I have a plan, but definitely have an idea of how i would want it to happen. Nothing gruesome since my family would have to ID the body. And luckily I have had life insurance over a year now and am an organ donor, so that makes me feel better if I choose to take myself out.
