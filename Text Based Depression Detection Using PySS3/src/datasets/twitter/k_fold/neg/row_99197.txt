New To SWHi, this is my first time posting here and I don't really know what to do. I guess this is a rant of sorts, but I'm at the end of my rope. Long story short, had plans to off myself, friends got me hospitalized for a night and now a few months later everything is worse. My dad assumes that this is all a game to me and I'm manipulating people, he has basically given up on speaking to me. My friend's family is amazing but every time I am over there I end up hating it because I feel awful they put up with me. I just don't know what to do anymore. I refuse to tell my mom this because she is busy with my grandma who is severely ill. I'm sorry for the wall of text and my rant but I just needed to vent, thanks.
