I'm so lonelyI have a boyfriend. He's great but he has his own life. He's my only friend so when he's busy it's me, myself and I. 

I dont want to feel shit constantly. I dont want to feel like I need to die but deaths the only way I'm willing to go. Yeah therapy and drugs are suppose to work but that's a long term solution. I want it fixed now
