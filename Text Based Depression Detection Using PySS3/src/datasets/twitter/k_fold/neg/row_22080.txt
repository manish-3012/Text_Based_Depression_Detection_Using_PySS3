Excessive risk taking?I don't have the typical unhealthy habits \(drinking/smoking\) â€¦ but I'm very prone to excessive risk taking. Suicide is a conscious deliberate, active choice, there's no risk there for me. But risky situations just present themselves to us, and you *have* to act and often make decision ver*y fa*st and on an intuitive lev*e*l. High risk situations have a very, very nice â€œdistractingâ€ \(nearly uplifting\) effect and maybe there's short term gain \(e.g. sex\). So it seems very difficult to tackle thisâ€¦? Any ideas?
