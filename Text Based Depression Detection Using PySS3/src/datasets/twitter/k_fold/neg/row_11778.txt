God, I'm done.I don't even care about my life anymore. But it's not my fault. I can't control if I care or not. The circumstances leading up to this moment are not my fault. And the thing that lead up to this moment make me not care about my life. Therefore, it's not my fault. But since I don't care about myself, I am pathetic. I don't deserve my life. I never had a damn chance. I'm tired of having panic attacks, they scare me. I go to sleep afraid, and spend my days afraid. I've turned to harming myself to take my mind off of it; I punch myself so hard that I see colors. I don't enjoy anything anymore, not even spending time with my family. I recently failed a test because the day before, I was too scared to study. I spend my days thinking about what might happen to me. This is NO way to live, I wouldn't wish it on ANYBODY. I'm done.
