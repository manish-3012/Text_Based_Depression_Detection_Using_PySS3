I hope something kills me soon.I hope it happens soon. I've been guilt tripped too many times, told that I can't kill myself or that would make me selfish, that I need to keep bearing the pain, that I need to keep fighting or I will be weak. So either I keep enduring this life filled with pain, or I get killed. I really, really hope it happens soon. Please.
