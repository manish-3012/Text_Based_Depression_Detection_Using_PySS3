Shitty 2019 already27 still living at home
Anxiety and paranoia at an all time high
Girlfriend of 10yrs left me yesterday
Little to no savings
Work 2 shitty part time jobs
Addiction to vices returning for coping
Constant ball of stress


Feel like I've been living for 27yrs and wasted the life I was given and feel like maybe the best thing to do is end it before I fuck up anymore.
