whatâ€™s the point?my life is nothing. i am nothing. once i die, iâ€™ll be forgotten along with the billions of other people that have lived on this planet. whatâ€™s the point in even trying? it feels like iâ€™m on a roller coaster where iâ€™ll be â€œrecoveringâ€ for a couple of weeks and then crashing back down to the bottom where all i do is fantasize about slicing my arteries or jumping off of high bridges. my boyfriend is the only good thing i have, i donâ€™t even know why he still loves me. 

i wish i could just disappear, life is completely and utterly pointless.
