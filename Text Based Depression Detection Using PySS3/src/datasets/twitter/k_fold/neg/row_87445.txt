ventiâ€™m just sitting here overthinking about how once i get on testosterone and start transitioning physically im not going to get to see my family again. they say and do such awful shit to me but i canâ€™t help it!!! i just love them all so much!!!! and iâ€™ve already come to terms with losing my parents but sometimes it just comes back and i canâ€™t stop thinking about it and crying. i donâ€™t know if iâ€™ll even be happy once i transition or pass. maybe iâ€™ll still be stuck here. 

i want to stay alive because i know there is a chance i will transition and be happy and successful and independent but every time i think realistically i see myself homeless and worse of than ever. looking like frankensteinâ€™s monster. 

i donâ€™t know. i think this sounds dramatic but i know i will be kicked out by the time the year is over and i just keep procrastinating it. i just wish i could know now if it will be worth the heartbreak to even try. i hate disappointing them . pissed off at my brain
