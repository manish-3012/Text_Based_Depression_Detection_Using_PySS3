Okay I'm done.26, no friends, never had a relationship, social anxiety my whole life makes both impossible apparently, job I hate, no degree, no skills, no motivation, no hobbies i enjoy anymore except backpacking and running which would be way more fun with other people once in a while. What is the point.  I don't want to go to work anymore. I don't want to try different medications or different therapists. I can't keep going like this. I hate every second I'm sober. I'm tired all the time.  I'm pissed off all the time.
