I tried to kill myself 10 days go... I'm glad I survived.Life is incredible. Being locked up for my 51-50 really gave me an immense amount of perspective and appreciation. 

Anyone that wants to talk or anything, just message me or comment or anything. I get it. I feel it. 

Seriously though, it feels so good to be here and now and alive. 

We can do it together. I promise.
