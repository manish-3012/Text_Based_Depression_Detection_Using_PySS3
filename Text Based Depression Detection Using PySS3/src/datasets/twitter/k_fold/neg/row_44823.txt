Can't even kill myself properlyTwice I've tried to die, twice I've failed and gone to the hospital where they pump me full of drugs and send me out.  I tried to be grateful my friend found me, but all I can feel is disappointment.

I don't want to be happy.  I don't want to keep making mistakes.  I just want to leave.
