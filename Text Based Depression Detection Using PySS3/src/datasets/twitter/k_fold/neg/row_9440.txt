I'm sorry for doing this againLast night I talked to you guys, and talking to you was great help for that time, but today I started slowly feeling down again, I really don't want to die, but I can't take this pain , I've been crying all day and haven't eaten for 3 days, I don't want to keep troubling you guys, but since no one around me care I'm feeling so lonely, can someone give me a way to sleep for long, like  5 days or more maybe I'll feel better then?
