Therapy is a joke. What is it for exactly?I hate when people online suggest therapy. It doesn't work! My therapist has done zip to help me. So, I'm left on my own to get things done. I can't tell you guys my specific problem because you wouldn't understand. Just know that I'm (emotionally) dying inside a little bit each day.
