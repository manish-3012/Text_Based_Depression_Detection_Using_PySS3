On the edge for daysI've been staring at my bottle of Verapamil for days now, having read that it is one of the most lethal drugs you can overdose on. I've had depression for years and no longer have any motivation. I'm 7 weeks away from graduating college, but I've barely gone to any classes and the work is piling up. My friends have either left me or are too busy with their own problems and my fiance doesn't understand depression and tells me to stop being a grump. All I want to do is sleep. I'm so close to swallowing those pills.
