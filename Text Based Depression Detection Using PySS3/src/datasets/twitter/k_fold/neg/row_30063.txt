InevitableI'll inevitably kill myself. Don't know when or how, but I see it as the most sensible route.

Everything triggers me. It feels like chaos in my head. My emotions feels like it's switching by the hour, and I let it control me. I've hurt people because of it. I've started to distance myself from people, at least that way i wouldn't cause any more damage than I already have.

I couldn't care less about hurting myself, all I want is my family and friends to find peace
