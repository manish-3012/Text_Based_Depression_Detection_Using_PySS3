I don't know what's wrong with me.I'm sad without reason. Tired. All the time. I get angry easily. Super easily. I'm with my friends for a whole week, I thought they would help me be happier. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder a couple weeks ago. I have no antidepressants. I feel like shit all the time. I feel like I live outside of my body as well, like I'm a character in a TV show. What's wrong with me. I want to kill myself, jump off q bridge or jump in front of fast moving traffic. Something involving cars. Painful and a gamble. Could be slow could be fast. Who knows. I don't know what's wrong with me.
