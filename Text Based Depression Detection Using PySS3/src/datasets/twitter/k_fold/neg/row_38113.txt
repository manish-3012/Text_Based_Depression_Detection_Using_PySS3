helpLife just seems so pointless to continue now. I tell myself over and over, soon this pain will stop and perhaps it'll be okay. But today, this desire of suicide grows, I'm fighting it but there's no one to go to for help, no matter how much I want it.  I try to do the things I like, but I can't.  They just don't make me happy anymore.  Nothing makes me happy anymore, and I just don't know what to do.  Is there anything I can do so I can distract myself from this pain, at least for now?
