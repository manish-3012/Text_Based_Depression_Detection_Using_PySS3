No way I'm talking to someone on the phonethe previous post I attempted to make to this subreddit was deleted literally immediately, brilliant

pisses me off you go to these websites you spend the time to find and then they deny you because you're not some american

and all the other websites I'm finding ask for shit like your name and age (and your race? why would that be important in an online chat?) as a requirement and I don't have a vpn nor do I have money for one

I'm so tired and I'm so lonely and the only one friend I have never wants to hear about my emotional bullshit

I'm so sick of sitting in my room for over 6 hours, listening to the same few songs tediously and crying while contemplating death, just for my parents to come home and having to lie about my feelings because I know I'd get yelled at otherwise

it's been like this for 2 years

therapists and counselors give me someone to talk to briefly but they can't "fix" me

pills mitigate the depression and anxiety but it's always there, and my suicide ideations have never gone away

stupid fat cunt I am
