Whatâ€™s the least painful way to dieItâ€™s been 5 very long, very sad and painful years. The last year has been filled with so much heaviness, heartache and dread that i find it hard to stay positive, calm or normal when Iâ€™m alone anymore. The last 6 weeks Iâ€™ve been unable to stop myself from crying in public. The emotional pain I feel makes it feel like my legs stop working  sometimes if Iâ€™m having an especially bad day and I canâ€™t seem to make this go away. They go numb and it usually doesnâ€™t come back for 15-20 mins at a time.

Iâ€™m really not here to ask for help, Iâ€™ve tried so many times to get help and it doesnâ€™t last. People donâ€™t care to be near me unless Iâ€™m my usual â€œhappyâ€ self.

I donâ€™t have access to guns. I want to end my life very soon after closing all the â€œloose endsâ€ I have with family and friends and I would appreciate any advice.
