I'm A Worthless PersonI'm 15 and I'm as worthless as I can be I can't stress it enough I'm sick and tired of everyone I have meet is wasting there time even glancing in my direction . The hours or days people went and wasted there valuable time on me than someone so much more valuable is beyond me. I am the biggest bully to myself and I deserve it I need to never let people in I don't deserve there friendship and they don't need to waste there time worrying about someone that is a waste of air. I wished that I could get the strength and courage to get rid of this waste of space I have tried to hang myself over and over again but just when I'm about to finally pass out I failed every time I don't know what is stopping me I have no purpose and my family and friends will be stupid and waste there emotional energy on someone not worth a thing and try and help me and they won't stop they are the ones that are wrong and stupid for wasting 15 years of there lives on me Im worth nothing I have no girlfriend I deserve no one in my life to make me happy like anyone would want to be with me anyways right I need to just stop wasting time and kill myself already instead of beating myself up and cutting myself I need someone to help me to kill me I need someone to get rid of me so I can't waste anyone's time anymore
