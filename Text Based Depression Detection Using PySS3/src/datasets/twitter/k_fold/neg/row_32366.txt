I don't want to die, but it's getting harder and harder to go on....(Context) I suffer from psychosis, and my delusions and hallucinations are getting worse. Every day is literally insanity day in and day out. Medication isn't helping much and every day I find that my list of reasons to live is getting shorter and shorter.  I don't want to die because if I do then my family and especially my friends would be devastated and I can't, in good conscience, do this to my best friends, my mom and sis and everyone who is trying to help me.

Anyone have any coping mechanisms for this, or at least someone with the same issue for me to relate to?
