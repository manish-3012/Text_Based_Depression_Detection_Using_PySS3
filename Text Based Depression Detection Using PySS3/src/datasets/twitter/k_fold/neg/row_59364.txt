No one wants to deal with me. Itâ€™s all just amping up in my head now.Iâ€™ve been having increasingly anxiety and suicidal thoughts since the start of my sophomore year of college. My family refuses to deal with me. Every time I bring up how anxious I am she tells me that all I need is prayer and that sheâ€™ll pray for me (she knows Iâ€™m an atheist but I donâ€™t say anything in response to this). I keep telling her that I think any sort of treatment would do me good. She refuses to let me go see a doctor or a therapist because she thinks drugs are too risky and therapists are untrustworthy. She wonâ€™t even let me vent about the emotions Iâ€™m having. She keeps insisting that I should be able to speak freely around her but when I do she just scolds me or tries to pawn off my emotional issues onto god instead of dealing with them herself.

My boyfriend doesnâ€™t want to deal with it either, he just tries to steer the conversation in another direction. I donâ€™t blame him though because heâ€™s never been very good with emotional situations.

The severity of my thoughts are just amping up. I want someone to fucking see that Iâ€™m struggling. I just want someone to give a shit. I found a way to harm myself without showing marks in high school(I wonâ€™t say how so I donâ€™t encourage people). I havenâ€™t done it in years but in my head I canâ€™t help but think about cutting myself.

I feel so petty that Iâ€™d literally be doing it for attention but I feel like Iâ€™m so vocal about it. I have plainly told my friends and family that I am too stressed out and depressed and that I have implied that I want to die but everyone just squirms and pretends like this isnâ€™t serious. I feel like if I just bleed then maybe someone will finally see that I need actual help.
