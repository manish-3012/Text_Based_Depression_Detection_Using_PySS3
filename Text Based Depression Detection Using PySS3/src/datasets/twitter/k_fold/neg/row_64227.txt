i have a plan againHello there fellow strangers, i'm here once more to share my tale and maybe , just maybe not continuing my planing.

&amp;#x200B;

First sorry for the english.

&amp;#x200B;

For about 2 years i'm treating myself, tried to kill myself a couple of times, and its more harder than it looks, got myself into a clinic for about a week,  got meds, terapy and etc. But this it's not life this is just barely surving, i have a huge problem with my emotions, can't control them so the meds did this for me, but it was all fake it just numbed me, i tried to get better to be better, but shit still heppen.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother was diagnosed with cancer last year in november, i tried my best to be there for her the whole year and now that she is not so scared anymore, i think is time for me to go.

I had plans about that but them again something happen, an ex girlfriend from 8 years ago, appeared out of nowhere saiyng that she misses me that she  always cared about me and etc, and i had breakup with her , but i never stoped loving her, and you see that is somenthing that messes with my head so much.

&amp;#x200B;

all i wanted was to be happy, but that is not for me, i'm miserable, i'm in constant pain, the void inside me is eating me more and more it hurts, so i decided to stop triyng to be better,and decided to be the worst, is all in vvain, all that i did in the past few years it was all in vain. 

&amp;#x200B;

i have a new plan to kill myself again, just need to do some research i'm try to do again.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i'm writing maybe to get help again, maybe to listen to some strangers on internet again, or just to make sure that i want to go with this plan. i dont know.

&amp;#x200B;

my fellow strangers its time for me to go and try again to get rid of ths miserable life .
