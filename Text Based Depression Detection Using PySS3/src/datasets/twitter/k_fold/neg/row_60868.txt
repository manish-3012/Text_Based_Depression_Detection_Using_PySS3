Hopeless, Helpless, and no where to go... (abusive partner)I posted about this yesterday but I am having a really rough day. I can feel the downward "spiral" into an extreme breakdown... depression, anxiety, ugly crying, drugs... maybe more idk

nothing seems viable... I don't have an escape... and that scares me. I feel thinking about the obvious permanant escape...
