It's all meI've grown up socially inept, I've lived and breathed in every possible senerio which has given me learning curves

I'm 25 now and I don't know when I'm going to fully learn, I don't want to come across as rude and selfish anymore. I feel like apologizeing to everyone I've ever come across, girls, friends and family members

I don't want to hurt people anymore with my naive behaviour. I can't live like this anymore

I don't know when it will stop.
