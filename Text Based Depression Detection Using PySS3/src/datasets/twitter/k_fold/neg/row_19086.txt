When does it get better?I'm never enough. I'm tired of the way my life is. The only work I've been able to find is the most unfulfilling bullshit part-time retail jobs for minimum wage, or full-time unpaid internships that lead to nothing. I've been in school for ever, an extra year of high school, 3 years of a worthless college program, 2 years of adult school, now I'm in my first year of a 4 year university program. All while barely being able to support myself. I just wish I could make a decent living.

And I've been alone through all of it. 26 and never had a girlfriend before. I recently tried Tinder and got no matches or even likes with a months worth of Tinder Gold. I asked for advice on r/tinder and was told I need to work on my life first before continuing Tinder... well I've been "working on my life" for years now and it's not getting any better... and I'm not getting any younger. I guess I'm not good enough to have a girlfriend(or any friends for that matter either).
