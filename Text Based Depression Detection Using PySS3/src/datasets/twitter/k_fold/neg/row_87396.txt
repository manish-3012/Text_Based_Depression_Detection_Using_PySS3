Iâ€™m so tiredEvery day is a battle. Some days I feel as though they make me stronger. Others I wonder just how much more of this I can withstand. Then there are the days where a part of myself, my own mind, insists I must end it all. Right now. Right this very moment. 

Those days, I spend so much time fighting myself, trying to silence this part of me that wants to make it all stop. Itâ€™s becoming harder and harder to argue against. Itâ€™s been this way for over ten years. I am an adult now. I have fully supported myself for years. Things are actually pretty ok. So why must I fight myself to stay alive?

I am so tired. My lists of reasons to live have been replaced by reasons to not do it today. Minor inconveniences for those in my life, my roommate having to find a subletter for the rest of our lease or my coworkers having to cover for me until they can replace me. That list is quickly followed by all the ways I could prepare them for my departure: emptying my bank account to cover rent for a few months, doing it when I have a few days off in a row and theyâ€™d have some time to figure out the schedule. This list scares me the most. It makes me realize just how ready and willing I am. The right time will present itself soon enough, and Iâ€™m afraid I wonâ€™t be strong enough to fight back.

I know my friends and family would understand. They would grieve me, they would miss me, but they would understand. They know the pain I have endured since I was a young child. They have watched me suffer. They will not say it, but they know I have not gotten any better. 

Itâ€™s been so long and I am so tired. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard. Focusing on myself. Taking care of myself the best I can. I donâ€™t want to hear that it will get better someday, anymore. I need it to happen.
