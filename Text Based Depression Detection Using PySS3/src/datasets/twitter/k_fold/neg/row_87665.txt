All I feel is... nothingSo I'm not sure how exactly to do this but I'm going to try. See I even feel stupid saying that. Im pathetic haha 

For years I've been depressed. Pathetically depressed about nothing. What does that mean you ask. Well I literally am depressed and have been depressed a majority of my life but can't pinpoint why. My life wasn't bad growing up but I constantly fought off the thoughts of suicide. I honestly think and thought that I'm crazy. And I've thought I've needed professional help for a long time but could never get it. And now that I have the ability to I feel like they are going to tell me that nothing is wrong. I just feel like I make everything up. I really feel like everyone pretends to care but no one really does and why should they lol I offer nothing. 

Anyway the title of this comes from what has developed over the past couple of years. All of a sudden I started feeling less and less depressed. Great! But then I realized I was becoming detached from the world. I felt nothing. I mean I get remnants of what feelings are like but I can't feel it, if that makes sense. It's not the same anymore. I hope you know what I mean. I'm just so shut off. Like the fact my mom died a month ago and I have barely cried. I can't mourn her death and it drives me nuts!

Well I don't feel like going more into depth just wanted to write out a bit because I'm having a bad night. 

I'm honestly not sure why I am writing here.  No one will probably even read this and if they do they'll probably find me annoying just like I do haha.
