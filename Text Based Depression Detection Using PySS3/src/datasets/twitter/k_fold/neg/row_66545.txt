February 2nd, 2020.If February 2nd, 2020 comes around and I havenâ€™t significantly improved my life by then I will end it. This last stretch of months will be the last opportunity I give myself. My life sucks, iâ€™m a failure, a loser, and have no motivation to do anything even though there are so many things I want to accomplish. 

How poetic... to kill myself on my 22nd birthday. Itâ€™s almost cringy to think about. 

Iâ€™m going to save money so my parents donâ€™t have to scramble to cover my funeral costs. 

The only pure and joyful thing in my life is my 5 year old little brother. Iâ€™ll probably kill myself eventually so Iâ€™d rather do it while heâ€™s still young so I donâ€™t leave him any emotional trauma.
