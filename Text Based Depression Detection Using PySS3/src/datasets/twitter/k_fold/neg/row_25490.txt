Why am I too big of a bitch to end it allIâ€™m currently military ( wonâ€™t tell you anything else ) working long hour days with maybe the weekends off. I donâ€™t want to give too much info out bc I want to remain anonymous but I donâ€™t feel like I care about anything anymore, I signed up excited for the job I chose but I have hardly any interest in it anymore and Iâ€™ve recently picked up drinking as a substitute for all the bullshit I feel and it has gotten out of control, I show up to work drunk and keep crown and coke in a water bottle I carry with me everywhere, I donâ€™t think anybody has caught on yet, but Iâ€™m also a smoker. Both of which help suppress the bs and pain in the moment but a few hours later Iâ€™m right back to where I started but it has reached a point where I cannot keep suppressing it. Iâ€™m currently 21+ years of age but I first tried to commit suicide at 17 with a shotgun in my mouth, but I couldnâ€™t bring myself to do it and I tried to push through and focus on bettering myself so I joined the military but at this point I do not care what happens to me and I know almost everyone I know probably will just forget about me after I kill myself. Iâ€™ve been through an abusive relationship and I feel like it has warped my sense of a healthy relationship causing me to feel like I am also toxic now because of my ex and I feel hopeless as far as a future with anyone because Iâ€™m too scared of trying to be emotional or myself with someone and I feel like I cannot connect with people on that kind of level. The part that scares me the most is what will happen when I get out. I donâ€™t know what my plan is if I get out and I feel hopeless like I signed my life away and also ended up signing my own death warrant at the same time. I donâ€™t want to get discharged either because that would slingshot my problems and I would end up killing myself either in the barracks or at my parents house like I almost did when I was 17 which I donâ€™t want them to see as they donâ€™t deserve that. Any advice or help appreciated.
