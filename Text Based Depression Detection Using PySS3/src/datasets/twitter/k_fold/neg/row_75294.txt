The thoughts are backI don't even know what to do. I just finished summer school, I should be happy. But no. My stupid, anxious, and depressed personality had to fuck my chances with yet another girl. I get the whole, "Its only high school, don't worry about dating or girls" thing, I know that it wouldn't be permanent, or perfect. But it hurts losing people. I've lost so many people whether I pushed them away(intentionally or unintentionally) or died. One of my closest friends killed himself during the school year, I suck at school, I have no real hobbies, no money, no job, no dad, no girlfriend, and I hate myself. I only have one friend, and he's great, but I just can't keep going with this. Maybe I should get myself into BHC. Or maybe I'll just do what I've been too weak to do all this time.
