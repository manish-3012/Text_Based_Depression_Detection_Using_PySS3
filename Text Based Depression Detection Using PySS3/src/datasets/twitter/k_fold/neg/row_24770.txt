Suicidal thoughts, but not suicidal and unsure of where else to goI'm talking to a therapist now. Been diagnosed with depression. Today I felt really depressed because I started working night shift and there is no one up to talk to, no other co-workers, and a lot of downtime.

It's starting to wear on me after a few days and I can feel it mentally kicking my ass. I'm seeing a counselor, but my next appointment isn't until the after the New Year.

I'm already planning for tonight with movies, games---basically anything and everything to keep me distracted.

School will start back soon and I'll be filling my downtime with school work. 

What else can I be doing in the meantime to keep my sanity about me and not start feeling depressed again?
