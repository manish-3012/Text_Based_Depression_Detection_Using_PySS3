Leave a clean camp and a dead fire.I just wanted to thank everyone who took time out of their day to reach out to me after I posted in r/depression. I appreciated the replies and the PMs. It allowed me to hang on for a few more days.

It's time for me to go now, though. The noose is set up, I've printed out lists of important information, left the cats extra food and water, and scheduled a goodbye message to be sent to social media some time during the night. I took a leftover Codeine to help calm myself down through the process. I wish I had left the apartment tidier, but I haven't had the energy. I wish I had done a lot of things. 

I was incredibly sad Friday and Saturday â€” couldn't stop crying. Now, I just feel calm and serene. 

Thank you, and goodbye.
