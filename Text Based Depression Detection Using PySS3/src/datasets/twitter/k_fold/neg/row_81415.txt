The time is coming to leave to placeI think I'm going to kill myself soon. I seriously don't see any other way out, and I don't feel like looking any more. It's been 30 years, and I've struggled for 2/3s of it, never feeling like I belong anywhere, never making progress, never getting a good amount of success. I just drift through life, and whatever I touch feels wrong after a few weeks, and I'm seriously over it. I have no intention to continue living this way, and since nothing else works, the only logical conclusion is not to live at all.
