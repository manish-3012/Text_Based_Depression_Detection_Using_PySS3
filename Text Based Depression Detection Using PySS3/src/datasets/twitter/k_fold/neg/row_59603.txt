please help meI am a 22 year old girl and I believe I am suffering from PMDD. it has alienated the guy I have loved for three years. He hates me because i'm sad. 

I am hurting so badly I can't find any words. I am planning to end my life tonight. I don't have anywhere else to go. I don't even know what to ask for here. I''m shaking and weeping. can you pray for me? is it okay to go?
