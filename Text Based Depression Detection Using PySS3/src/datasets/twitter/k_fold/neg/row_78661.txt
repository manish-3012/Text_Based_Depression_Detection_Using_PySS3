Surely some people fail.It's not like every single one of us can be successful. In any natural system there is a continuum that ranges from the strongest to the very weakest of organisms. The latter may just not be up to the task of continued existence for any number of reasons.

For my part, I'm a completely failed artist. An idiot that has simply chosen the wrong "career". I've got no talent or insight. 

Until I went to Art School I am fairly certain I'd never regretted anything. Not really. Now I regret the entire last decade of my life.

I wish I had just chosen to be (more) normal. I'm not good enough or strong enough to compete. Maybe I wouldn't have even been better at something else. Most likely I'd just fail at anything I tried.

Regardless, it seems awfully naive to think that we all have a place in society. Surely some of us are worthless. I am a member of that unfortunate group.

I don't want to give any more background, and I certainly won't share the laughable crap paintings that caused this whole mess. This isn't even about me.

Thanks for listening.
