Hiding my true intentionsLately I have been trying very hard to hide my true intentions about my future. I have been doing well in school and I made the honorâ€™s list at my college. I am about to graduate community college with an associateâ€™s degree. I have also been telling my family that my mental health has been improving and that I have been feeling much happier. 

However, the truth is that I am hiding my suicide plan. In September I will finally go through with the suicide plans I had when I was 16. I am 20 now and I have decided that I do not want to live anymore. I plan to drive to a nearby bridge and throw myself off. 

It feels weird knowing that I wonâ€™t be alive in a month. Just felt like sharing this without telling anyone I know personally.
