Feeling like my meds suckI just got off celexa, and am on latuda now. I'm suicidal, but I know it's a medication reaction. The problem is that I can't figure out which I've is fucking me up.

I was on 5mg of celexa, but they upped it to 10. Then they changed it to 10 mg of latuda. I know it's meds.

Life sucks and I'm going to sleep before I completely decide on suicide. It's not that I'm un committed, but I know (rationality) that this is meds.

I can't continue to be okay. I can't continue to feel as if everything is my fault. I need someone in my life to tell me it's okay.  I can't do this anymore.

I need someone. I need someone you tell me it's going to be okay.
