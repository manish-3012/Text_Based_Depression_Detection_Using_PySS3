Trans. Lonely. No friends. No partner. Im ready to die.I hate living, and I sincerely hope I get a fatal case of the coronavirus. Iâ€™m 31 and my life has been a complete mess since I was 4 and got molested for the first time. Life never got better. Thereâ€™s no light at the end of this tunnel. I canâ€™t just kill myself because I donâ€™t want my family to live with guilt, so Iâ€™m doing everything I can to die from a disease of some sort. Drinking. Smoking. Iâ€™m just short of licking public surfaces right now. Nothing I have is worth sticking it out. Iâ€™m done but too much of a pussy to end my own life.
