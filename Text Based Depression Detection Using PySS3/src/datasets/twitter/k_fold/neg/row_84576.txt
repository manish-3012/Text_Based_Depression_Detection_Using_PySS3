Why bother staying alive?Everyone is constantly mean to me and for some reason they always get lots of girls. Why would I want to live if I can't be like that? I tried my best for years, but I don't get anywhere. I think I should just give up. I wish I had died in infancy. I am just such a waste of life. Life can be so amazing but not for me. I can only watch others have a good life.
