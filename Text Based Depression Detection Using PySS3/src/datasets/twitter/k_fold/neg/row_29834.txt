Wish I could go into 2018 not wanting to dieI'm tired of feeling this way.... I just hate myself so much.
I came 11hrs by train to spend New Years with a friend, I thought it would cheer me up but it's not. We are supposed to do mushrooms later to ring in the new year but I'm getting terrified that I'm going to be a buzz kill because I've spent the whole day wanting to die 
Why do I have to be like this? 
I'm such a waste...
