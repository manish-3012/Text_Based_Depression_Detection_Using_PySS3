I don't know where else to go or how to explain my feelingsI've tried to see therapists, but my mother never makes it happen. I'm a junior in high school. I have a job, and I'm taking college classes. I'm a good student and I'm proud of that, but it feels like the only thing that's going for me. I'm not even that smart. everything seems to be falling apart around me. Freshman year, my dad died. On the 8th of this month, it will be 2 years since he's been gone and I don't know what to do. I transfered to a vocational school this year to study what I wanted. At my home school, I had so many friends. At my new school, I have none. I sit alone, eat alone, do my work alone even when we're assigned partners. I don't know how to talk to people and the people at this school don't like me at all. I feel that I need to be alone and laying in my bed to fix my problems..to be able to talk myself down. But I don't have time in between school and work. I can't miss school or work but I need a break. I go to school every day, and I work 4 days a week. I know this is all over the place, but I just don't have anyone that cares anymore and everything just feels pointless. I miss my dad and my friends.
