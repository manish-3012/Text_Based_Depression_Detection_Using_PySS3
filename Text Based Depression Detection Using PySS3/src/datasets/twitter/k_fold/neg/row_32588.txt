I feel like such a rare caseIâ€™m so unwanted and lonely, I hoped things would be better by the time I was 19 (and everyone always told me that too that their life became better after they graduated) but Iâ€™m still the same way as I used to be years ago. All girls have experienced some form of love or some shit by now, why did I have to be the odd one out? Iâ€™m so worthless and disgusting, I donâ€™t belong here. I always had a feeling the universe is telling to end it, that I wasnâ€™t meant to be born.
