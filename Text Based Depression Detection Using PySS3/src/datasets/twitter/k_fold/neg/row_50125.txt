My Confession.I don't know if there is someone  out there that will read this. I've been fantasizing about killing myself for at least 5 years. I get home and I have the pills in my hand but I cant bring myself to pop them in my mouth and end it(I want to want to do it). I am a complete waste of space. My 4 and half year relationship with my girlfriend is a lie. All my friends have left me for better people. I lie a lot because of my incompetence. I am in so much debt to keep up with the status quo. I am embarrassed and ashamed of myself. I am not clever nor sporty. I have never been good at anything. I have 2 older brothers who have made a success of themselves. I try to start something and it goes well for a while then it always crashes and burns. I can not keep an interest in anything. I live a lie constantly and it's reached its boiling point. If people I know find this post, I am sorry I am not the person you thought I was.
