i wish i had the courage to do itOkay, every day now, I've almost convinced myself to just walk off and disappear completely, and live the way I deserve. In a sleeping bag, cold, hungry, under a tree somewhere, and hanging from a tree too. 

All my friends are gone, my family do not want me around, everything I used to love has now gone or has been reduced to nothing but dirt, I am now an empty soul, a ghost of a person, a shadow, and I will never be able to become whole again. 

I'm just listening to Suicidal Thoughts by Notorious BIG and Bullet by Hollywood Undead. Those two songs just sum up my mind right now. 

No one will listen, no one wants to listen, no one loves me, no one wants to be friends with me, no one wants to give me a job. The buck stops with me.
