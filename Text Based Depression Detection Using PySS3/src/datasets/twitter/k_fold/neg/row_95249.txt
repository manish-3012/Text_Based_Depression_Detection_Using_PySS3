Sad. Lonely. Haven't slept all night. Looking for someone to tell me i'm not aloneI've relapsed into another depressive episode and i feel lost and hopeless. I just desperately want someone to acknowledge that i'm not okay right now so i don't feel so alone but no one is responding. even lifeline kept me on hold for 3 hours before i gave up trying them. i know that i am not going to get an immediate response by posting this but i'm hoping that somehow ill be able to have someone connect with me, let me know im not alone. its a dumb, illogical idea, but i just kind of need it right now.
