I've been miserable as long as I can rememberI'm almost thirty and so goddamned tired of living like this. I was sad and scared and lonely and miserable at 7, at 17, at 27. I have no reference point for what a peaceful, content life is like. It's like trying to imagine a completely new color. And all I get is to hold in there, to get past this crisis... that's been my whole damned life. I'm tired of just surviving crisis after crisis and never getting to feel like a real human being. Why the fuck am I not a human being? What more do I have to do? I tried getting smarter, getting kinder, making myself useful. It's not enough. It's never enough. At some point, it's just straight-up cruel to string a person along with vague promises of one day not feeling this pain. I *know* what'll stop this pain, and if no one is responsible for me, then why the hell shouldn't I be responsible for myself? It's my responsibility to take care of myself, and unless someone else is going to step in, then *I'm* the one who decides what that looks like.

I don't know what I did. I don't understand what I could have done, as a little kid, that the whole goddamned world was denied to me, and it'll always be denied to me, and I'll always feel like this because I've *never* felt any different. And yet here I am; I held out almost three decades for a dream I can't even see. I'm so damned tired. I just want it all to end. I had one person - one person in my whole damned life - who genuinely cared about me and helped me, and then they died completely unexpectedly, and I know I'll never meet anyone else like them. There was one sliver of goodness in this world, and it's now gone. I never deserved it.
