I wanna know what is (or isn't) out thereI feel so restless
Can anyone relate?
Yeah I have a case of the sads too but that's not my primary motive for this constant rumination
I never stop thinking about it and I really want to because sometimes I slip up and say things around my mother, which fucking sucks because it hurts her feelings and I feel like shit afterwards
