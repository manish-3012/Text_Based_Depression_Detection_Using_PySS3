One year anniversary since my last big suicide attempt. Hello, redundancy.Since 13, I have been suicidal on and off, mostly on. Having been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, I've been told that for people like "us" suicide becomes kind of an obsession.

I am scared of the world, I'm not afraid to admit I'm a coward. I have just let myself go so far that I don't let myself feel anything for anyone. I'm floating away from life.

I've been through therapy, I am in therapy, I want to get past therapy but the drive to live has shrunken into a raisin and I have no intentions to rehydrate.

I don't want to be here, but I am posting here because I have to honor the little glimmer of hope there is, for my friends or for my family. Otherwise, I'm worried tonight is the night, yet again, but this time not an attempt. 

I'm sorry to bother you all, I'm sure I sound all over the place I just feel frantic and I dread every moment that I am still breathing.
