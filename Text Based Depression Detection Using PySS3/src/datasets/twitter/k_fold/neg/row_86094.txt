Got 2 reason to live now...It was weekend and I was just rotting away in my room, thinking to myself "what's the point of this?, I should just call it quits and be done" I was not even caring that it would hurt my family at this point.

Then I asked the universe to give me a reason to go on for few more days or months even AND.....

My mom got 2 kittens for me and my sister. Just watching these two tiny creatures put a smile on my face. Now i feel like i should be there for them and watch them grow. I named one of them Morgana (because of persona 5) and i waiting for sister to name the other one..
