everyday is harder anymorethe only thing keeping me alive anymore is the love that i have for my family, girlfriend, and my cats. i just cant bring myself to do that to them. 

i want to love myself but i canâ€™t. im 27 and i have been abusing any substance i could to get numb and escape since 15. second to drugs, i have an unbelievable debt because i have a compulsive and binge buying habit with credit cards and the money i earn. my girlfriend and i want to start a family so much but i know i would end up just bringing everyone down. im so lost and helpless all time. i dont know how much longer i can do this
