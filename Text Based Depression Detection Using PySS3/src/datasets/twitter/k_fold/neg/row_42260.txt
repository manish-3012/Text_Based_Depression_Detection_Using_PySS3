Not being disabled enough is a death sentenceNot disabled enough is the worst position to be in as a human being. You aren't disabled enough to claim welfare but you are considered disabled by normal people. It is truly a hellish position being stuck in the middle of being normal and disabled. You can function better than a disabled but worse than a healthy human being. Any help you get is to integrate you into society by offering you shit jobs that cannot be filled like data entry, janitor/cleaner, factory assembly worker, etc. And that's it. You have no chance of getting out of those jobs due to the limitation of your disability and the only exit is suicide. 

Such people like myself aren't even human nor disabled by definition, I looked in up there is a term for it, "subhuman". People like us are "subhuman" lowly organism that exists to serve the normal population.
