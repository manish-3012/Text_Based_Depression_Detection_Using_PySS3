I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreIâ€™m twelve (not technically old enough for this platform but I donâ€™t know what else to do) and in eighth grade. I have an F in every class and my mom constantly shouts at me for it. I donâ€™t feel like eating anymore even though Iâ€™m hungry. Over time my declining mental state has lost me all my friends, and I donâ€™t feel like I can talk to anybody. I have to hide my tears because Iâ€™m nervous what people will think. I stole a flip knife and have had several moments where I will just hold it and cry for several minutes. Eventually I calm myself down, but every time it gets worse. I have decided if things donâ€™t get better by December 15th, I will take my life. I donâ€™t think you can convince me, but youâ€™re welcome to try. Iâ€™m sorry Brennan, you deserve people better than me.
