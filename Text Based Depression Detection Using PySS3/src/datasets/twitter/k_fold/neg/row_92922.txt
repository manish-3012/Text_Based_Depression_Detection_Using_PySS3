How do I get through my days?I am a college student and I feel horrible all the time and often think about suicide. I have already got far behind the study schedule. This is supposed to be my last year, but I don't know if I am going to make it. I have days I cant come out of bed at all, where I can't do more than hang around my room or where I can drag myself to school, but can't get any work done. I try to get through school by working on the days I have slightly more energy, but the bad days keep ruining it. I don't see much point in life anymore. I sometimes get so upset I destroy my books or cut my furniture which I always regret afterwards. I am on a waiting list for a psychologist, but the wait takes forever let alone being helped. I wish how I feel wouldn't obstruct my life and I don't know what to do about it.
