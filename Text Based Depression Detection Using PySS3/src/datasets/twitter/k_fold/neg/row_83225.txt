I am really considering itSomething happened recently w an old friend, their family tried to blame me for their mental issues (even as far as visiting me in my own home). And coming from immigrant parents itâ€™s difficult to like take legal action or anything, and I donâ€™t really feel like letting my friends know how badly this took a toll on me, Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™ll make me look weak or whatever. So yeah suicidal thoughts are at an all time high atm :/ 

any advice on how to get out of this limbo?
