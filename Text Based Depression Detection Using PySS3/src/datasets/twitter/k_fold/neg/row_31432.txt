Near the end of a long horrible divorce, in which every aspect of my life has been under attack, and I am so beaten, discouraged, and ready to dieBelieve me, I know what it feels like to feel alone.  I am older than most redditors, and it really sucks.  I am finishing what has been an horrific divorce, in which my wife, who clearly has narcissistic personality disorder, accused me of horrific things.  My son barely tolerates her and my daughter calls me their safe parent.  

I have worked so hard to be kind and good.  To not engage in the insanity, but I am utterly exhausted.  

It's affected my work; it is clear my boss wants me gone, and the only reason I still have a job are due to reasons I won't divulge here.
  
As all this has occurred, I met someone I really cared about.  She became my best friend.  And after almost 2 years this week she dumped me.  Not because of me, but because of her.  She was afraid to commit.

Just one more terrible blow.

I have had a hard life.  Parents died when I was little.  Worked my way up from nothing.  

And I am realizing right now, for the first time, that no companion ever has loved me.  I don't think any of them (there haven't been that many) knew how.

I don't know how to feel complete in myself.

I don't want even to think about waking up tomorrow.

If it weren't for my children, I would have killed myself already.  Too much pain.  Too much.  But I can't do that to them.

I am ready to stop.  I want to quit thinking for just a little while.

I would like to find someone to love me.
