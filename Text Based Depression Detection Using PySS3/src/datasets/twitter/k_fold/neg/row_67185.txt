You're all i wantHey Jessica, I wanted to write this somewhere you'll never see, and have strangers on the internet laugh at it because then I'll feel less like I'm drowning. 

I've loved you for these last 10 years, I know how that sounds and I know it's sad. I love the way you can make the same dry jokes and digs as me. I love how you laugh and the way your eyes smile even when you aren't. I love the soft rain of your voice and the way it's tempo matches my heart beat when we talk. I love the curve of your cheek when you turn your head because you think one sides better than the other. I love your figure even as you complain about it. I love the way you take the darkness in my mind and quiet the voices of my own self hatred. But most of all, I love you. I know I fucked up when I told you about my problems, when I told you about trying. I know that I didn't share any of the news well about what I've been going through or take your feelings on it into account when I told you.

I'm sorry, but I am trying.

I'm trying to be better for you. I'm trying to cope better for you. I'm trying to look better for you, I've lost 17lbs now. I'm trying to be attractive and stylish for you. I'm trying to be there for you. 

I want you to know how much you mean to me. I want you to know how much I'm trying. I want you to know I'd give my all. I want you to know I'm working on it.

I'm sorry I'm suicidal.  I'm sorry I'm depressed. I'm sorry I'm anxious. I'm sorry I get jealous. I'm sorry I don't cope well. I'm sorry I sound so weepy about these things.

I love you Jessica, if you ever read this know it's about you. You can tell by the username that it's me. I know I've told you 100 times, and I want to tell you 100 more.

I love you, so why can't we try..
