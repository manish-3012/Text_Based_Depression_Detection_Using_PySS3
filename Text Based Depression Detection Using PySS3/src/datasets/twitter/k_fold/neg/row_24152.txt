Really desperate nowI just want to die. Nothing is improving in life and my efforts count for nothing. Now I'm a loser in every way. The last year was so miserable and I was hoping university would help me recover and went into it with some hope. I don't even know what to do next in terms of a career or life or education and I'm stuck in this state.
