21M diagnosed with depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts with a few years plan...So I don't know why I thought about posting here and if you're reading, I'd give more attention to other severe posts than this lame ass one. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 15ish but never did anything about it. However there have been times where I've made plans, or gave circumstances in which I'd kill myself, only to never meet the criteria. There have been times when I'll have a knife ready, only to be a pussy and whimp out. But I have gave myself an overall plan within the coming years.

If by 30 years old (if I haven't killed myself then anyways), I don't have a solid band following with my music, a reliable wife/possible family, or a steady career then I'll just off it then. Just need any one of those to work out. Really fucking dumb, but I'm so lonely and desperate that I just need something to work for me.
