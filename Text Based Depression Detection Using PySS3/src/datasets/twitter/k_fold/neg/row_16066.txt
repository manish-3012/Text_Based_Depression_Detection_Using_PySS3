Why does everyone get forgiveness, but not me :(.Hi I'm just so ummm I don't know just confused why everyone gets forgiveness but not me, for instance I really liked one girl, so I did something stupid just drunk stuff, not beating her up just talking that's all which got her mad and never talked to me since, while this same girl got beaten up by her boyfriend, which made her face fucked up and a month later she forgives him,,,, Yea to this day she still doesn't talk to me and that was like 6 years ago.
Same thing with other people I never done nothing like that, while other people treat them more worse, they just stop talking to me while they forgive they other people but not me and those were my so called friends.

Why is that? why can't I get forgiveness. don't have any friends to talk to or I don't know :P
