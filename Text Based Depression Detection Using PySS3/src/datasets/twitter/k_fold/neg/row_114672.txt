How do help a suicidal friend (without therapy)Ok so at school I met this dude he seemed alright. He is very new friend. For the last few days  I asked about people he knows he seemed kinda hesistant. Today I asked him if he wants hang out after school he said yes.

 Now he revealed he has only other friend and hardly hangs out with other people because people don't like him. After a few minutes of hanging out he asked have you ever had suicidal thoughts. I said no. Thats when he said yes( he said it was 3 weeks ago). 

He said people find him annoying. I am now trying to help him become more liked. Now its because he has a big social flaw and I could spot it. Didn't say it though. Anyways how can I help him. He is also sometimes bullied however not 24/7 luckily.
