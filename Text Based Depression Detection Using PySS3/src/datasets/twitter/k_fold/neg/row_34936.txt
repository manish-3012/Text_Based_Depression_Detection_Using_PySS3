Trying to give some comforting words...I would love it if some caring individuals would say very kind words in response to a message I received from a fellow I don't really know. I saw him in forums and kinda had a light argument with him. Later on someone else said some hateful words to him such as "kill yourself", and he responded by confirming we can expect that fairly soon.

This person seems to need someone, and I got sucked in. I sent him a private message, and he responded with...

&gt;Thanks for asking, I won't bore you with many details.  The gist is that after many years I've realized that *I* was the problem in almost every situation in which I blamed others.  As you can tell from my posts, I'm not very enjoyable to be around: too much venom.  I've tried dialing it back, even turning the venom into self-deprecating humor at times, but it is of no use: I'm just a natural asshole, and a pain to be around.  I can tell people enjoy themselves more after I leave, or before I arrive, and it's tiring knowing I constantly ruin the days of people around me because I can't handle myself appropriately.

&gt;It basically boils down to me not wanting to get in the way anymore, not to cause anymore discomfort to those that don't deserve it.  As long as I'm alive, I'll continue to hurt others whether intentionally or not.  The only fair solution is to take the problem (me) out of the equation and let people live the lives they deserve without me.  After all, the amount of positive things I've done for anyone but myself can be counted without taking both gloves off.

This man needs some encouraging words and advice people, please help me give it to him :) (I will be showing him this thread)
