I'm imprisoned in a cycle of madness inside my own headNo matter what drugs I numb myself with it never helps. Nothing does. I keep living and living but for what? Just to suffer? And satisfy other people? Because I can't live for myself. I hate myself. 

My life will never change. It will never "get better". Life only gets worse from this point. I wish I was never born. I wish I could just disappear, never to be seen again. 

I wanna overdose so badly.
