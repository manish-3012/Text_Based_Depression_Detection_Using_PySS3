Suicide maybe?The thought of suicide sounds very sweet right now tbh. 

Blue skies, people rushing around during lunch hour, and here I am sitting at a fast food restaurant, contemplating suicide.

I know it is a selfish thing to do, I know I may not succeed, but I really want to do it. 

I'm tired of trying, and I'm tired of dealing with the consequences from my passive-aggressiveness arising from my inferiority complex. I'm tired of feeling ashamed for being myself, and I'm tired of overthinking about what others think of me.

I don't know anymore to be honest - I know my parents would be feeling horrible, and my grandparents maybe, but other than them, I don't believe anyone would feel bad at my death. Sure, it would be a loss but I really don't feel like anyone would be that affected.

I have yet to set the date, but I know how I'm doing it.
