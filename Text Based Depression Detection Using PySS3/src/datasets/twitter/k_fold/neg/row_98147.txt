I'm sorry if I'm rambling a lot. Some of this post will not make sense because I just can't articulate my mind at all without sounding like an idiotic nihilistic incel. Idk if anyone could relate to what I'm saying but whatever.Hello, I am a Male and Throughout the 17 years of suffering with Major Depressive Disorder, I have observed and gathered lots and lots of data about my own experiences and how its progressed so far, I will try to not get into my personal life a lot, just moreso observations of the actual condition itself, So, when I was younger, about the time where I could form lasting memories (about 6-8 range) , I unfortunately was the child with little to no social skills, not having a father in the household seems like played a factor with my social skills as well. A single mother who needs to work most of the day barely has enough time to teach a child just about anything I suppose. 

So not having friends while I was a very small child paved the way for my accepting of lonely conditions, It was true here and it's true for me now that I carry an unexplainable disdain for people in general, I definitely consider talking to people for the most part as a tedious chore and it requires too much effort to converse with people, it's like mental gymnastics and it makes me irritable sometimes. So because of that I managed to embrace loneliness never play in recess and would rather spend the time napping or reading a book. 

So at that same time I also was considering myself as not needed, and as early as 8 years old I actually cried in front of my mother saying that nobody needed me and that I was useless. Now I was not referring to suicide at this time, I got to that point in my older years, at this point I was just wanting to be more useful to people and not thinking that I will never be useful to anyone, so overall it was not progressed at this time. And side note, I think that my mother not being concerned of me saying these things seriously to her was a really bad mistake on her part, it was clear that I was an unhappy discouraged child.

They labeled it as ADHD, I don't think I even had ADHD, I personally just think I was being a very energetic and sometimes rowdy kid, which is very natural in my opinion. And they never noticed the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder until way later.

So around age 10-13 I started to really develop the symptoms even more to a point of it being noticeable. I started to lower my self esteem to the point of self hatred at some points, now at this point I wasn't necessarily thinking about hurting myself yet. I would just keep the notion that I was inferior to everyone else and that I am not good for anything. My energy really started to lower and I started to just isolate myself more from people and I would avoid doing anything social.

My feelings about myself being unwanted and not needed never went away and only were intensified as I got older, I also that's where my sleep schedule really started taking a turn for the worst. and around 13-14 was when I first encountered suicidal thoughts, self harm as well. 

My mindset was thoughts of worthlessness, loneliness, hopelessness, boredom, nhilism, and thoughts of jumping off of a 10 story building, or hanging myself, or taking all the pills in the medicine cabinet.

(TW Self Harm) I would self harm a little bit with knives and blades around this time as well, it never became an addiction and I never self harmed badly but I've left a few sometimes noticeable scars on my wrist that I'll have forever, but they are decently small so it's not too bad. Quitting self harming was very easy for me for some reason, cutting my wrists just seemed to be not worth it as time went on and I lost interest in it. But nonetheless I still harbored the intent to die, just not in a cutting fashi

Around 15-16 I was very set on dying. Often making plans on specific days to perform the act. But always when I would plan on doing the act I would just stop myself instinctually not by my own free will, but mostly a body reaction. For example, I was going to hang myself but right when I was going to fall I stopped myself although wanting to die, interestingly my body reacted in a different way than my mind. But I consider this my worst times in my life so far, this was when I was at the most danger to myself, right now in the present instead of having the energy to actually do the act and wanting to putting in the effort to do it, I just consider it a chore like every other thing in life and although having the desire to die, right now I just don't have the motivation or energy to perform the act.

I'm 17 now, borderline 18, most has not changed from my younger years, I it's just intensified for the most part.

Idk if you're reading this far because this whole post is boring. I'm very sorry for rambling like a crazy person
