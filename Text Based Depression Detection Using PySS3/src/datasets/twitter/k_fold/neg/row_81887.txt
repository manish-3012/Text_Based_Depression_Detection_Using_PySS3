Suicidal but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll do itI have some crazy thoughts on reality and whatâ€™s happening in the world around us. Iâ€™ve had visions of time and space as this weird tube I traverse at length but I know only seconds have passed. 
There is so much more happening around us and I know Iâ€™ll never get answers. This makes me truly want to die. I donâ€™t know why.
