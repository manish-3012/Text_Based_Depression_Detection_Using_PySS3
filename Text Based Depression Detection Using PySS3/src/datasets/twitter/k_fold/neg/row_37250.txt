Just released from hospital and suicide feelings are extremeI was in hospital since sunday for a medical issue, not depression related.  Although they had a psychiatrist analysis while i was there because i was abusing codeine before my admission.

I got sent home and got back to my house.  Within minutes of getting in the door i had an extreme breakdown and spent all day on the phone with my psychologist and mental health emergency number who both essentially just left the problem with the other and both are telling me to contact the other.

I'm feeling abandoned and alone.  My feelings of suicide are really high and i just want to die.  I'm having constant anxiety attacks and don't feel safe.
