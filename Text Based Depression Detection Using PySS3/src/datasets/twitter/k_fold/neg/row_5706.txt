Hi ðŸ˜Š all i want is to have the courage to kill myself but in this too i am only a failureWell, i really don't know why i am writing this but... I know i think after writing this maybe i would feel any better about myself, but that is never going to happen  this felling is not something i can control anymore. 
I have a friend he has a lot of problems, he is very important to me and my group, my tiny dear group of friends. He is only 16, and i know that he will take xanax everyday and will continue with smoking, he wants and i know he's going to die soon, so everyday that i spent with him i have to think is the last. In the first moment i said to myself after knowing all of this he's the most courageous person in the world. 

Because life is really not worth it
