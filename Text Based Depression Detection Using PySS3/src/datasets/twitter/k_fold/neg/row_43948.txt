I need to get out of uni or Iâ€™m going to kill myselfIâ€™ve only been at uni for a few weeks and I can already feel it taking a toll on my mental health, in terms of the total independence, being so far away from home and loved ones, being alone, not fitting in, worrying about upcoming assignments/ presentations etc. 

I have two main tells for when my depression is getting really bad. The first is that I no longer enjoy or feel anything from music, and the second is that I will cry very often (every other day) and most of the time not be able to pinpoint the reason why. This has been happening since I arrived here and had only been getting worse over time. Itâ€™s gotten to the point now where I really just donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. My plan was always to commit suicide, since I know life just isnâ€™t for me, but I was trying to get myself to last a little longer, at least until Christmas when weâ€™re having a big family get together for my grandparents wedding anniversary, but I really just donâ€™t think I can do it.

Iâ€™ve already ordered part of the thing Iâ€™m going to use to end my life and Iâ€™ve started looking for the other thing. A part of me really just wants to call my parents and say, you need to come and pick me up right now or Iâ€™m going to kill myself, but Iâ€™d feel so guilty since my parents have paid for me to go to uni in terms of both accommodation fees and tutor fees, as well as just general living costs. I know it sounds weird, but suicide just seems much easier than letting down my parents like that. At least by ending my life I wonâ€™t be a burden to them anymore.

I just wish I could see them again before I do it, thatâ€™s what is making me sad the most. Instead of spending my last days at home, surrounded by people I love, in a place I know, Iâ€™m here, alone, and Iâ€™ll never see my parents or any of my family ever again. The day they dropped me off here is the last time I will have seen them. 

I just wish I could be back home
