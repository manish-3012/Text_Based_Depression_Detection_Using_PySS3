Iâ€™m (17F) worried about my internet friendâ€™s (17M) mental healthMy internet friend has been struggling with mental health issues since we met on Reddit two years ago. He says Iâ€™m his first real friend and the only person he can be honest with. When we first started talking, he had a self-harm addiction and was cutting every night, but he stopped when I convinced him this wasnâ€™t a healthy coping mechanism. Yesterday was the one year anniversary of the day he planned on killing himself. Since then, heâ€™s promised me heâ€™s not going to attempt anything, but only because he says he doesnâ€™t want to upset me. Iâ€™m glad heâ€™s no longer threatening suicide, but heâ€™s really unhappy, and he seems to be doing worse every day. Iâ€™ve tried to convince him to get help SO MANY TIMES, but he has a bad relationship with his parents and heâ€™s afraid of telling them. (When they discovered his sister had an eating disorder, they forced her to eat more food instead of getting her help.) Heâ€™s worried that theyâ€™ll think heâ€™s making his mental health issues up, which I know heâ€™s not doing because of the severity of his self-harm. He respects my opinions a lot, but I donâ€™t know what advice to give him. All I know is that he needs actual help. Although he says he wonâ€™t kill himself, he tells me how much he fantasizes about it. He...really hates himself. I donâ€™t like seeing him hurting. Heâ€™s had mental breakdowns and become inconsolable at times. Other times he just seems so sad and empty. I love him and donâ€™t want him to feel this way, but what can I do?
