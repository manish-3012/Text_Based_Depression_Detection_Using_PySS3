Todayâ€™s the dayItâ€™s motherâ€™s day my 3rd most despised day of the year apart from Fatherâ€™s Day and my birthday. Because my dad is dead and he is the only person I connected with on both sides of my family and because we share the same birthday.  2 years ago I found someone to fill the hole of emptiness and love that I needed. Weâ€™ve had our ups and downs (mostly downs) but whatever happened weâ€™d always end up together. We had a baby and I thought weâ€™d end up together forever but I was mistaken I guess. Yes I care and love for the baby but i am unfit to be a father and I will never be anything like my dad to her she is 1 of the only 2 people I care about and the other person could care less about me anymore. Iâ€™ve been planning killing my self for the past 3 months but Iâ€™ve been holding myself back because my mom would be sad but itâ€™s clear to me my mom and girlfriend donâ€™t care about me and yes I realize that me killing myself would put me out of the babyâ€™s life and yes that does make me sad but like I said I am unfit to be a father. So today after I get off work tonight while everyone is sleep Iâ€™m going to jump off of the downtown bridge, if I donâ€™t die on impact then Iâ€™ll hopefully break the right vibes to drown and then maybe hopefully someone will care
