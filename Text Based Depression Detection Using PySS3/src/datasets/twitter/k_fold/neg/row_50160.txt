I want a reason to live.And it damn well isn't myself. I by all means am doing fairly well and providing for myself and my cat but I don't see a light at the end of this tunnel. I can't bring myself to go out much because I work so much. My friends are all hours away and have little time for my problems. I have had a few talk to me recently but I feel defeated and purposeless. 

I want to feel like there is a reason to keep trudging but there are fewer reasons each day.
