Why..I'm so ugly and useless..

So sick of this existence. I want to end it every day. No escape in sight.

What should I work hard for?

Why should I do anything

Not only is life hard

but I'm ugly, acne scarred, friendless, poor, bored. keeping myself alive for what exactly?

No joy, no humor, dull person, so useless!!
