I feel so flawed that suicide seems like the only optionI'm 28, but I failed out of grad school, can't find a job I either like or do well at, and I have an awful marriage. 

I feel like I took all the prospects I had, and just blew them. I feel like I'm going to be miserable no matter what. I hated college, I hate my marriage, I hate my job, I hate my car. It feels like I'm bad at everything (and my husband constantly reminds me of that fact) - I'm terrible at driving, cooking, cleaning, socializing, etc. The only thing he thinks I'm good at is my job, which I hate so much. It's so dead-end (claims adjuster) and I get screamed at all day for my mistakes and others. I try so hard to be good at it, but I'm not and I seem to inflame people while I'm talking to them. My husband has a perfectly cushy PhD RA position, and I'm fucking miserable, but it seems like there's no way out.

I've tried to apply for other jobs in my pay range, but I keep getting ghosted after interviews. One that I thought I got responded to me today (after I sent a follow-up email a week after I was supposed to hear back) with "you'll get feedback tomorrow". 

It's so disheartening.  I feel so powerless, and like there's no escape from anything. I don't have anyone to lean on for support, which just makes me feel more pathetic, but to be honest, I've never really had anyone to lean on. I'm just naturally unlikeable even though I try so hard to be kind, I just come off as bitchy and cold. My own family doesn't even like me. 

I have an online therapist appointment in 15 minutes, but I'm just going to look at the screen, smile, and just pretend like everything is fine and I'm dealing with a minor case of anxiety/depression, because I can't even mention the suicidal thoughts/plans. I can't even get fucking therapy right.
