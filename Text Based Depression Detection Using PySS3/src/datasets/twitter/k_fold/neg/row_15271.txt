After years of depression I finally decided to give dating a shot again. Didnâ€™t go well.In the title. I went on a date at a nightclub and I thought the night didnâ€™t go that bad. I said bye and she agreed we should do it again sometime. When I got home I saw she blocked and unmatched me. Absolutely crushed and beginning to think there not a place for me on this earth... years of pain and self hatred just to have the knife twisted as soon as I try to help myself and â€œget myself out thereâ€ as many people tell depressed people to do. Completely lost.
