Thinking about my lifeI know we all have that time of the day where we think about our lives. 

I keep thinking I'm not happy with mine. 
I have a job I don't enjoy and can't get out of,
My love ran away to the other side of the planet,
I'm scared I'll never be successful or as successful as my parents.

I guess I'm scared and want to quit and restart this game called life.

Don't know if anyone is the same but I'm stuck ant don't know what to do.
