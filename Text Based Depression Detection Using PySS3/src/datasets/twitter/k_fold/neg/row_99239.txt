I've been dead for 16 years, I just haven't disposed of the body yet.Since I was 12 I've awoken everyday to a feeling of loss. That loss, is at a chance, a chance to escape my minds hatred for the character it creates. Around 16 I fell into a deep depression, I tried to hang myself but the shelf broke, I tried to od but it wasn't enough. I talked to doctors and cousellors and all that but I just wanted to sleep forever. Then one day things felt different, my headnfeltnfull of air, I felt numb but excited. I remember this endless feeling of being followed and watched. As I walked by groups of people I could hear them talking about me. I never slept during these periods, an hour here or there but only out of a sense of obligation. Thoughts were so fleeting that I could only sit still and wait for it to attenuate. 

16 years later and I am tired of hanging on, the highs ruin what I have worked for and the dark is just merciless at reminding what has been lost. 

But I met the one, or so I thought, she understood me and loved me despite my minds destructive nature. For 3 years we loved like no one could equate, so much passion and closeness. 

But on December 12 she called. She was different, it was like the love was gone. We had been through so much and I was being tossed, cut away. Its the worst pain I've felt and it's lingering, I can't breath. I've had the noise tied for days but my mind has been avoiding decision. 


If you stare into the abyss, eventually it will look into you, but what happens when you realize you are the abyss?
