my life is a JOKEi cant even write about it... But it was always horrible with drunkard parents, shitty job, strugling to become someone and etc. The thing is  my life goes on a cycle: 3-4 shitty almost impossible to bear years, then some hope for a half year-year and then all goes to shitter like HAHAHAHA you thought everything is going to be ok now ? WELL FUCK YOU! And i dunno why, im hardworking man, pretty smart, i workout, have hobbies and im pretty famous , yet still im not happy because of these life cycles. I tried to kill myself by taking whole pack of antidepressants but it didnt work, right now i dont know what to do with myself because shit cycle again started.
