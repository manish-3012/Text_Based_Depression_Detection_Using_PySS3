No enjoyment in life for 19 yearsAround age of 7 I developed social anxiety and hard a hard time forming friendships or llater relationships. depressed in elementary schools high school and undergrad. Took a college course which was again 2 yrs of depression due to how badly it's run. I got a job after was depressed moved to new job is which pays really well but the stress is so high that I'm still depressed.

The only thing keeping me going is 1) my gf of 8 years and 2) not disssapoint my family.

But for #1 due to my fucked up mental state and anxiety she feels im not treating her right. Even if my points are valid the tone is wrong and sounds confrontational. 

Basically #2 only thing keeping me going and I don't see if it's even worth it. I have a great upbringing great job and long term relationship and yet I haven't been truly happy in almost 2 decades.

I tried SSRIs which didn't help and I also have substance abuse issues with weed, opiates and benzos to try to mitigate my anxiety issues. I know it doesn't help in the long run but without these crutches I would've given up years ago.

Don't see much point in continuing if my relationship is fucked, work life sucks despite change jobs and fields many times, school was depressing, and I live only for my family but they don't know my real internal state just a mask of semi happiness. 

Some people say therapy but what is telling someone all of this going to do. It's the same as what I'm doing now except I have to take days off work and pay $. I tried some online CBT and while it helps me realise the ways im fucked up it doesn't change my thoughts or behaviours.

Any help
