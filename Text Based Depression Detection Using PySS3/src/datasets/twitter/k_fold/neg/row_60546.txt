anyone else struggle with misanthropy?not in an edgy 15 year old "people suck" way. the kind of hopelessness that you try so hard to fight. you read stories about people doing good deeds and how the violent crime rate is going down and blah blah, but the sadness doesn't go away. i try so hard to believe in people and i read about human nature and philosophy, and no matter what happens or what i read, i wish that i could kill myself so i could get out of this place. that i could check out and save myself the trouble of having to deal with all this.
