It's time for me to move onI've waited for so long. I've tried. I've done everything I'm supposed to. I've "got help." I've "talked to someone." And here I am. Maybe I think I deserve too much, but I know my self-worth. I bought a gun. I made a plan. I guess...I just wanted someone to know I'm moving on from this life.
