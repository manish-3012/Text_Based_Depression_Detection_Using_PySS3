I am so worthlessDon't know why I'm posting here but here goes. I am completely useless, I think about killing myself every day and nothing I ever tried makes me feel better for long ðŸ˜¢

No matter what I do I always end up back in this shit state, my mental health has always been so bad and my mind is a prison. The few people I speak to about any negative shit give me good advice but I can't act on it in any way. I think I'm just wired wrongly to survive in this world ðŸ˜”

I can't work in any kind of job, I am constantly getting sick notes and they all hated me for it, and on top of that I'm completely scared of people in general and it only gets worse as I get older.

I'm completely sober writing this nowadays and have been for years so it's not just the alcohol or drugs ðŸ˜”

I wasted the last year trying to be a musician but I know nobody and am too scared to ever actually network plus I have no talent so that was a deluded waste of time ðŸ˜”

I went back on the dole again and have to work 25 hours in a charity shop for 20 pounds a week allowance which isn't even enough for food. I wouldn't mind doing that but last time I went to jobs the bosses hated me for being so lethargic and useless and it made me feel even worse. For the past years I've not done anything productive. I'm basically the biggest loser alive and am an embarassment of a person ðŸ˜¢

I'm almost 26 and I'll be homeless before long I bet, which is what I deserve for being this useless ðŸ˜¢

My family hates me but I'm totally dependent on them which makes me hated even more ðŸ˜¢

I always feel really isolated and down nowadays and nobody understands exactly how bad I feel it's like they just go through the motions with good advice which may or may not works for themselves ðŸ˜¢

I have nothing and wish I was never alive. The world is just a horrible and hostile place at least for me ðŸ˜” 

So I'll kill myself soon or fail again like the last few times ðŸ˜¢
