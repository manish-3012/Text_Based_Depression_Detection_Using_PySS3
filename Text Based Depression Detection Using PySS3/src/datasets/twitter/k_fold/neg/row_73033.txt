My Dad found a letter I wrote. One I wrote just in case I diedHe is telling me I have to go see a therapist now. I know I possibly have a mental illness or lots of scars from before, my first love and mistakes i've made, but I don't want to go to therapy. It really makes me depressed, when I have to relive or talk about my issues or how things made me feel. My dad is not giving me any option about this. I am in my early 20s. I feel if I bring this up more often than not it will make me depressed, even more than I am now from just forgetting about it or pretending it doesn't exist.
What should I do? Even my dad mentioning my suicide letter, made me cry because I don't want to talk about this stuff. I did attempt to strangle myself more than once due to stress and overwhelming guilt about things, but my mother talked me down once she found me. I do struggle with thoughts of leaving the earth, lonelyness and sadness on the regular but I feel talking to someone would open me up to feeling worse about myself and reliving things again and again. I have struggled with my emotions for years. I also have a disorder that impacts reading social cues, facial expression, tone of voice, and other aspects so sometime things bother that me that might not even be there or come off as a slight because of my disability.
What do I do?
