Mom.I just want her to be happy.

she tells me how having me well basically ruined her life. She had me pretty young. 
I want her to have a good life, without me being in the way... Attempting again seems so scary.

attempting and failing is horrible. 
I don't know what to do anymore man... Life's wacky
