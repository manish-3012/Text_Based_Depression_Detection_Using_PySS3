I'm a 14 year old boy and I want to dieI am very depressed. I have been wanting to kill myself since 4th grade. In 4th grade, I switched schools and ended up going to this school filled with spoiled rich kids. They all bullied me since I didn't make as much money as them and didn't have Gucci shoes or whatever. The arguments never hurt me, but I spent 2 years at that school being relentlessly bullied because of something outside my control. Then, I switched schools in 6th grade. I ended up going to a very small private school for gifted kids. You get in by having an IQ over 130. Everyone else at the school was actually smart while I just have a high IQ. Everyone else was already done with algebra 1 and almost done with geometry. But because I was in this school full of smart people, my parents assumed that I am some super genius (which I'm not. I'm in 8th grade and I'm struggling with Algebra 1). Now that they assume I'm a super genius, they have started signing me up for much more educational stuff which I can't handle because I'm not actually that smart. One of those things was this really challenging online school. I somehow managed to get into one of the top schools in the country when I literally was struggling with grade level work. That year was the worst year of my life. I started the year taking computer science, English, Latin, and pre-algebra. I had already been working on the pre-algebra class for around 4 months when I went. I ended up failing all my classes except English, which I would have failed if my grade was 2% worse. During this time, my mother was abusive. She would attack me and beat me a ridiculous amount. I did research, and it turns out that she is a child abuser. I don't want to take any action because a really bad mom and an ok dad with a good job is better than some really abusive really poor family who doesn't care about me, which is basically foster care in a nutshell.

Now, I'm in 8th grade. I switched schools again, but this time, the people aren't bullying me. But I still have unreasonable expectations to live up to. My mother is constantly attacking me and signing me up for classes and other stuff that takes away my time for having fun. Until second quarter, I had no friends. Then I switched into the robotics elective and met Beverly. She was the first person at the school who actually wanted to be around me. She would talk to me, not because I'm the new kid or something, but because she genuinely wanted to be my friend. She has never been perfect, but she was the best friend I have ever had. Over the next month, I developed a crush on her. She had finally given me a reason to live. I finally had something in my life that I cared about. But I always thought that I'm not good enough for her, so I developed a crush on the new girl. Looking back on it, I probably could have asked her out back in quarter 2 and actually have a chance of her saying yes. In quarter 3, when I got friendzoned by the new girl, I wasn't really that affected because she was just someone who I liked because I thought I had a chance with her. After that, I decided that I will only crush on Beverly. I'm not sure exactly how much I like her, but on a scale of 1-10, I like her at least 12. But starting in quarter 3, her small, insignificant crush on my only other friend grew. It went from a 1 on a scale of 1-10 to a 7.  This obviously made me a little jealous, but I never let it get to me. He was, after all, my only other friend. Fortunately, it seemed like he didn't like her back. Recently, I found out that he has liked her for a while, but never had the courage. This just destroyed me. Now, my 2 friends are basically ignoring me most of the time because they are too busy doing whatever couples do. I know it seems stupid to be this sad over a girl, but she was the first person I have met since 3rd grade who values me as a person, and now she is ignoring me half the time. I have wanted to kill myself over the year because of how my mother treats me and how my father just leaves the house and gets drunk whenever anything happens. I have even cut my wrists (I now realize that that won't work because it will take so long that I will change my mind and decide to live)  in an attempt to kill myself.  However, what has always made me stop is thinking about getting a nice, long, comforting hug from Beverly. Thinking about it brings a smile to my face right now while I struggle to stop myself from going to a busy street and running in front of a car. I don't even know what I'm thinking right now. I'm just extremely upset. I'm sorry to anyone who read this whole thing. It's basically me just venting everything that has ever gone wrong in my life and contemplating suicide over a girl. I cant even believe it myself. a girl is managing to make me want to kill myself. I cant believe I'm arguing with myself in a Reddit post.

Basically, what happened is that my crush, who is the only person I have met in 5 years who has actually made me want to continue living is now dating my only other friend, causing me to be ignored by my only 2 friends for most of the day while I sit in sadness, realizing that I could have dated ger if I hadn't been such a pussy back in quarter 2.

Sorry to anyone who actually read this whole thing. It's basically just me venting all the things in my life that have gone wrong. Someone please talk some sense into me. I don't want to kill myself over a girl, especially since I can just wait for them to break up. The problem is that my 3AM brain doesn't think about anything, and will just go to the bathroom, take every pill it can find, cut my wrists, and put a bag over my head or just run in front of a car.
