Reaching out, but don't freak outJust reaching out because suicide has been running through my mind for years, it comes in months long cycles with week-or-less long repreives.

I am working poor, cant get ahead. Everytime i think I can make it work I just get setback again and again and I'm over it. 

I'm engaged, and feel guilty about really damaging him emotionally and psychologically, but I can't stand this purgatorial existence. 

I'm an athiest, but it kind of feels like we are already living in hell and we just don't know it.

I don't have any plans to kill myself, I just realize my mental state is bad enough that I should tell someone, even if it's a bunch of strangers.

Tl;dr gay guy, engaged, poor, athiest but convinced this is hell, concerned about intense suicidal thoughts as a way to escape.
