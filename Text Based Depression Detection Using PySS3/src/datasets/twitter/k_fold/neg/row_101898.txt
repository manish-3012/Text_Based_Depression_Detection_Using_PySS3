My Friendly SuicideTo be honest this is a long story. A life long story really. Though to spare you, I'll keep it to recent events. 

Not to long ago I sent a friend a suicide letter/email detailing exactly what I keep locked up inside my head every moment of every day. Really the only person i could trust and discuss my deepest thoughts and emotions with. I love them for that....

But this wasn't the same. I had betrayed alot of what I told myself and others I stood for. So even if I wanted that connection back, it's no longer possible. 

So I look at myself in the mirror intently asking myself why I couldnt go through with it. I had nearly mustered the courage twice now. The first almost landing me in the hospital. The second was just a reminder of why I always feel this way. 

Now I'm lining up for a third try. I feel fully justified in taking my own life. I'm a piece a white trash. I'd go into detail but if you know white trash like I do, you will understand enough. It's not what I wanted for myself. If I would've realised sooner or been better prepared for the real struggle that life has in store for all of us, I might have managed to be content. 

I ask myself this question alot. Why do I blame myself for what I cant change? Is it because I may have impossible expectations for myself ? Have I truly only ever felt regret and shame at the life I've lived? Is it because I've only wanted a world that could support me and nurture me to be a man and not it leave all up to me ? Life has always been up to me. I feel like I started late. Wasted alot of time not preparing for things to change. So I digress and mediated with myself. 

For my last go at suicide I figured I'd need to build up to it. So I figured out three things that will allow me to rest peacefully. A legacy, a project, and a promise. 

A legacy to leave behind so that the ones who knew me best could look back on fond memories and know that I lived my life. I was just never going to be happy. 

A project to make or break. To create then destroy. Something I've always wanted to do and experience. An achievement that no one needs to know about. For yourself to marvel at. 

Finally a promise. A promise to make things right. So that when what inevitably puts an end to this existence isn't met with malice and hatred, holding me back from the peace that I believe death truly is.
