The only reason i havent...Killed myself is because I am terrified of it just being worse or being stuck as a ghost or some crap like that, however much I want to live (and I really do) I simply cannot stand the pain of the reality I am in or the way people treat me.

I'm not really looking for sympathy or pity or any don't do it crap but feel free to say whatever you want if you reply

 I guess I just wanted to share that that is the only thing that has stopped me for like 12 years now... Maybe someone else feels the same way or has something to say about it?
