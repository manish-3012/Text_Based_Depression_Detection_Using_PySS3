My younger cousin is dealing with depression. Help me help her. [x/post from r/self]My 13 - soon to be 14 - year old cousin has been dealing with some depression. In the past year, she got her period, has dealt with pretty bad bullying in school, is the only kid her age in her community (a gated community that is mostly retirees), and is coping with really severe ADHD. Her family has changed her medicine, and taken her on and off of it. We recently found out that she's been cutting herself -- nothing life-threatening (just a few scratches on her forearms) but we're obviously still really concerned.

When I was her age, I also occasionally cut myself, and was depressed. She says that she can't identify anything that's really causing it, just that she's confused and overwhelmed and she doesn't know why. I remember, so vividly, feeling the same way. (I stopped cutting myself pretty quickly and overcame the depression in a year or so).

I've been talking to her and trying to be there for her by reminding her that we love her, by ensuring her that things get better, by encouraging her to be herself, and by letting her vent and talking things through with her. What else can I do? What should I say to her? Did you go through something like this?

TL;DR - 14y/o cousin is depressed, she's unsure why. I think it's just normal overwhelmed early-teen feelings. How do I help her?
