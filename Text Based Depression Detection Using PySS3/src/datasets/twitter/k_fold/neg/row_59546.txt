I'm a useless human and I'm failing everythingI'm too scared do it. I've spent years feeling suicidal and medication and therapy don't work. Ive spent years is therapy accomplishing nothing. I can't deal with life anymore. I'm in college and barley passing by. I hate my major and don't know what to change it to. I feel like a useless fuck. I was diagnosed as vision impaired when I was a kid and I've wanted to die ever since. I'm sick of relying others. I'm sick if having no Independence. I don't have the guts to kill myself though, because I don't want to upset my parents. Sometimes I wish they were dead do I wouldn't have the guilt on my shoulders. Sorry for the attention whore rant. I needed to get it out of my mind.
