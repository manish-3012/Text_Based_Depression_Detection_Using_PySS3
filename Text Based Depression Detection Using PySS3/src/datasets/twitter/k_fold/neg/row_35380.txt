People say life is like climbing a staircase to achieve goals but for me it feels like im just tumbling down the stairs.I think I might OD tomorrow, I know I have a small chance of dying but maybe for once I'll be lucky in life. I cant even handle therapy, every nice thing people say about me feels like a lie. I'm so fucking tired of this life? How much of a masochist do you have to be to enjoy living?

I've become everything I thought I wouldnt be, a failure, terrible at school, depressed, and more. I hope people move on fast, maybe theyll be happy I'm dead so Im not such a burden.
