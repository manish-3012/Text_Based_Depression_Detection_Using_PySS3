Help meOn my main account I comment here where I think I can help.  I never anticipated that I would be the OP!

I have cancer.  The chemo is terrible and my next infusion is next week.  I can't go through that again!  I have an LDR but he will be ok.  I have a dog which a friend/neighbour has agreed to take care of should anything happen to me, so I have no real commitments.  In the last 30 minutes I have gone from my normal (fairly stoic) self to preferring death rather than going through this.  I don't know what to do.
