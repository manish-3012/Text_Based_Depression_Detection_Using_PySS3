This life isn't meant for me it was a good trip but I want to come down nowHi I am 21 years old and I never wanted to kill myself more in my life. Today I got drunk for no reason to look for validation from strangers because my boyfriend broke up with me. Everything in life is boring nothing new happens. To me I just want to end it. I went online and somebody insulted my nose. I don't have enough money or a job to get a nose job I wish I did though
I was abused a lot as kid now I'm back in my boring childhood home in this boring town. In the midst of a pandemic. I hate living sometimes is it bad that I rather have people feel sad for me after i die than be alive
I know I'm playing the sympathy card but I'd rather be dead right now and know that everyone felt sad you have to keep on living over and over again
