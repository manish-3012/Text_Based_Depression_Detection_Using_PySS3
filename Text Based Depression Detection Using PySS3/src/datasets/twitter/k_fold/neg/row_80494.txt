hope and rest and sleepi wish i'd finished myself off back while i was younger and more reckless, woulda been so easy, just a few more mg of whatever thing i was slamming n a couple more drinks or whatever woulda done the trick, at least I woulda been able to rest

i cant even find the energy to leave my bedroom anymore im so exhausted how am i gonna kill myself now i just wanna sleep n never wake up

i hate it when people tell me to hold on to hope or keep looking for the light it only makes every defeat and failure more and more painful, i wish i knew i was fucked, it would be so liberating to know exactly what was going to happen to me so my actions wouldnt matter,
