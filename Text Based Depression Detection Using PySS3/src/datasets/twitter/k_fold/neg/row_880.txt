My parents found one of my suicide notes and brushed it off as a phase, this was the last strawI've had depression since I was 16 I parents never believed me they ridiculed me and brushed it off my dad was the biggest problem he made me feel worthless every weekend when he was home and every weekend I would add to my suicide note they found it and just brushed it off.
