I just want to vent...I'm just thinking about killing myself because I feel like I just cause too much stress and pains for those around me and I'm tired of it. I feel so useless and that have no purpose for anything. I can't do things right, I fuck everything up, and I'm usually clueless about what the fuck is going on anymore. I might just be over reacting and sound completely fucking stupid but I'm just tired of living like this and not knowing how to change myself. There's just so many things going through my mind and dont know how to put it in words. Im sorry if this post didn't make too much sense I just needed a place to vent without going too much in detail. I just don't want this post to get too much attention
