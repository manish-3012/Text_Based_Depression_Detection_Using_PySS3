Divorce or Suicide... weighing my optionsI don't know what to think about it. I feel I'll be just as miserable going through a divorce (and my life after that) than staying in the miserable marriage itself. This leaves me feeling awful and suicide feeling more like an option. Please has anyone felt this way?
