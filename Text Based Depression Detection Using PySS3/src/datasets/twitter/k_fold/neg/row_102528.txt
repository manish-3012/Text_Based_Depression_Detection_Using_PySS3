Not today death, I have dishes to do.I've thought about just walking into the woods one day and just keep walking. If I find a quiet enough place, I can just tuck myself in somewhere and die. Maybe winter would be best, I could freeze myself to death. I've heard it's not a hard way to go. I've thought about shooting myself but I don't want someone to be horrified if they find me. I just want to fade, not give another person horrid nightmares because they found me hanging or my head blown open. I live on a river that's really cold too. Thought about just going in but I'm too much of a coward to drown myself. I really don't want my last moments to be terror. 

I want to say something to everyone here. I want to convince you that your life does have meaning. That there is someone someplace in time that's gonna need you. It's hard, life can be hard and it's unfair. 

It's not those that care about me that keep me here, it's who I care about that keeps me going.

Some days there's too much beauty in the world to quit, other days I do the laundry.
