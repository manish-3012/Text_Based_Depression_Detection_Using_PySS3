fuck this worldMy mother just found out she has another abdominal mass, second one in three years. My brother got arrested last week and may not get out of jail for years. I lost my best friend two days ago because I disagreed with his white nationalism. I feel dead inside.

I want to hang myself but it would pretty much be killing my parents (or my mother at the least) or send my brother deeper down his addictions. I just don't know how to cope with anything. fuck this shit man, if my parents and brother weren't alive I'd be so gone
