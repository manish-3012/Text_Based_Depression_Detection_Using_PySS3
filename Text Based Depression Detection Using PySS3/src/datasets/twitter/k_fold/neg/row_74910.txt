life is pointlessive been depressed for almost three years now.  ive tried ending it once. i wish it worked. i hate life. it's pointless. boring. it isnt exciting. i have a few friends and i have an okay relationship with my family. i have self esteem problems. but i mean i am unattractive. i have to cover my face in makeup to feel confident and i cant leave my fucking house without it. i'm fucking pathetic. i care too much about what other people think. ive gone to therapy two times before and neither times worked. i honestly just want to end it again. i have no motivation to do literally anything. i think about death everyday. i wish i was happy. i dont know why i'm so sad.  it comes and goes at points. i dont find anything fun anymore.  i hate this. school is starting back up again and i dont see a future for myself. might just try and end it again and hope it works this time.
