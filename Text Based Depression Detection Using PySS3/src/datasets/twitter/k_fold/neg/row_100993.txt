How much is too much?Few failing grades at school, left by my only friend, my family is angry about my bad grades (I don't blame them), existentional crisis, classmates most likely know how I feel and do everything to bring me down even more without feeling responsible for my possible suicide, sociopathic tendencies (lying, manipulative, slightly sadistic, lack of empathy, lack of deeper feelings, feeling empty), obviously to this I can also add social anxiety and depression. Is it enough already or should I keep trying? It's unlikely for me to actually kill myself, but I was thinking about it today at one point. Just asking if you would do it if you were me. And no, I don't really wanna talk.
