I think i dont have a soulI feel nothing, and when i do its incredibly mild, never fallen in love, liked, hor hated some, not even my parents, everything is meaningless... and i couldnt give less of a fuck about rather you live or die cusz... whats really the point huh? Also i cannot phocus on something for longer then half a  second so the constant ongoing chaos in my head doesnt help. Diagnosed aspergers and adhd and i have been the punching bag of every group of friend ive been with... why not just be alone? Cusz when i have no distraction i get mad suicidal. Talk me out of it i dare you, cunts
