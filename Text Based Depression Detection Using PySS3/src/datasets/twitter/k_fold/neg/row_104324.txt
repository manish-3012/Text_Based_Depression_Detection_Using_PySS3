Louise here. I'm alive and in treatment. You literally saved my lifeSo, after posting here I took an overdose. Basically everything I had lying around washed down with alcohol. I then read a few of the comments that were posted on my last post. To say I had an "oh shit" moment would be an understatement. It was the most bizarre feeling I've ever felt. I genuinely wanted to die but in that moment I had some understanding of the gravity of what I'd done. I called the emergency services. Apparently I let them in but I don't remember anything after calling them to when I woke up in hospital. My family... Weren't thrilled. I don't want to say to much about that as I'm saving it up for my therapist (lucky lady that she is!)

I got out of hospital on Thursday and logged into Reddit last night but couldn't quite find the words that had weight enough to say just how much it meant to me that people even commented never mind the punch in the face the words gave me. A punch I desperately needed when I read them.

I have schizoid personality disorder (or would if I could spell it correctly) so feelings and connections don't really come easy for me. I just want you to know from this we random, middle aged, Scottish ginger, you saved my life. I will never forget it and hope, someday, I can pay it forward. Thank you guys. You are amazing.
