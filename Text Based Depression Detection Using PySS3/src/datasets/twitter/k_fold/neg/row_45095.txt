I was going to leave todayI was going to leave today. It's been almost two years since I lost the person I loved the most and today is her birthday. I haven't been the same ever since and I feel like I don't belong anywhere or to anyone. I feel like I'm a toxic entity to everyone around me and like I'm not enough. There's nothing I can do to help myself without breaking even more. I was going to hang myself at home today instead of celebrating the holiday with my boyfriend and his family.. I even went so far as to look up how to tie a noose (ha). I almost jumped off a ship at sea last year, thinking it would be the best way to go, but in the end I always end up thinking about others' pain and guilt if I left. I wish I had the courage to do it, I wish I could rid myself as a burden on other people's time and lives.
