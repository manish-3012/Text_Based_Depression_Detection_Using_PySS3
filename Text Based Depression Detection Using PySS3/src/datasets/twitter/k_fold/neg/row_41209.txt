Iâ€™ve always cared about people but itâ€™s getting much harder now.I was a genuinely nice person. I honestly cared about what everyone had to say, I would listen to everyoneâ€™s advice and take it into consideration, no matter who you were.

Iâ€™ve been pushed away, let down and forgotten, by friends and family. I was lonely then, and still am now. I hate myself so fucking much, and I assume everyone else feels the same way about me. How could someone love me when it felt like my family and friends didnâ€™t. My family, they only do the easy stuff... they say, I love my son, heâ€™s doing great, when others are around. But when itâ€™s just us, no words are spoken, only this mutual feeling of someone failing the other. 

Now I donâ€™t trust anyone, people do things for others not out of love but obligation.
