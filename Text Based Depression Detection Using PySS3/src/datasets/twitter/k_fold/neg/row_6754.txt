I'm just so done. I'm over it. I'm tiredI weigh 500lbs.  I'm nearly 30yo.  My husband only loves me half the time.  Our home is a trashed mess with barely any room to walk.  There's a leak in the ceiling of the living room and I'm pretty sure we've got black mold.  I have OCD, severe anxiety, and severe depression.  My life is fear, disturbing thoughts I can't get rid of, and a lack of enthusiasm for all of the things I loved once upon a time.  Sure, I could try and lose the weight but  literally doing anything hurts and is unbelievably difficult.  I can't stand for very long with my legs cramping or my back seizing up.  Why even bother losing the weight at this point?  My body is already ruined.  Why bother continuing on at all?  I'm lazy, unmotivated, and disgusting.  I hate myself.  I hate my life.  I actually have a decent job but I hate going there.  Being around other people is terrible because I have to pretend I'm happy and I know every one is constantly judging me.  And before anyone suggests it, therapy and medication are out of the question.  We can't afford the doctor or a therapist or anything like that.  I live in the US.  Healthcare is insanely expensive and the services that are available for free are either wait listed like crazy or of such a low quality that it's not worth bothering with them at all.


My husband is severely depressed as well.  He's been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a long time as well.  Last night I suggested we go out together.  He's trying to talk me out of it but I can tell his heart isn't in it.  I think he's considering my suggestion.  We could re-home our cats and then do it.


I'm just.....so.......done.
