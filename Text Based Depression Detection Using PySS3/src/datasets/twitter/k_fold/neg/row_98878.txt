For the second time this month I get screwed over by a landlord.I'm house hunting. I'm disabled. I cannot find a place for the fucking life of me. Couple weeks ago I see a place and say I'll take it. The dude never contacts me again despite me contacting him. An hour ago I spent 2 and a half hours on a bus to go see a place. I see it. Say I'll take it. Landlord is like awesome. I leave. Just got a phone call while on the way back. "Hey were really sorry but got some bad news. The person you'd be living with? Her husband came home and he only wants roommates from his country. Sorry but you can't move in."

  


I can't keep this shit up. I have a little over a week to find a place or I end up homeless. I'm falling apart at the fucking seams. I can't keep doing this. Every day it's something new and now this? I don't believe the landlord for an instant. I think he just didn't like that I was gay. His tone sure changed when he found that out. So now I'm sitting on a bus crying and being a general fucking wreck.

  


I just want a home. I want somewhere to go to sleep. That's it. Why is it so hard?

  


What makes it more infuriating is that they kept asking questions about why I'm on disability and what my disability was. So I ended up detailing my PTSD and how I got it to satisfy them. So I fucking went through all this for NOTHING? My whole life is like this. Tons of effort with zero pay off. I just want to stop fucking carrying and worrying. I want a break. I want a couple days where I'm not worried about my FUCKING LIFE.
