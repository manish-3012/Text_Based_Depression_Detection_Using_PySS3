My reason for living is goneMy boyfriend killed himself while we were on vacation at his familyâ€™s lake house. He left us to find him with a belt around his neck. We tried CPR, I held his head while the medics worked on him. I canâ€™t get it out of my head. I canâ€™t be without him. I donâ€™t know how to be by myself. I havenâ€™t gone more than 2 days without seeing him in a year, and itâ€™s been 3 since it happened. My whole family is worried about me and I donâ€™t want to be selfish but I canâ€™t see myself here in this planet without him. I donâ€™t know what I believe in, I donâ€™t know if heâ€™s reincarnated or in the spirit world or in heaven but I need to know. I canâ€™t do it right now. I have a wait a while. I canâ€™t do that to our families. Itâ€™s my fault for not knowing heâ€™d do this, his family didnâ€™t even know he was depressed but I knew. And I never thought anything like this would happen. I need him back. I canâ€™t go on anymore. Thereâ€™s so much pain in my body. Every night when I lay down I feel the pressure around my neck and I just want it to end. Iâ€™m too scared to hang myself like that. I just want to slip away peacefully. I just want as many pills as I can take and go somewhere where my family wonâ€™t find me before the police. Iâ€™ll leave a note, unlike him. Iâ€™ll give people answers. He took all of my answers away from me. The only answer I have from him is to go with him. I donâ€™t know why heâ€™d do this to us. I feel him slipping away. Heâ€™s my soulmate. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m waiting for him to tell me if I should do it, but heâ€™s not answering me. I donâ€™t want to be here without him. I just canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m not strong enough without him.
