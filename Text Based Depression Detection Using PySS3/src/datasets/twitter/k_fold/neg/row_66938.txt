Over with school and life in general.This is my 2nd last year in school \(year 11\), I haven't been doing that well. I seem to be only passing IT as that is something I find really interesting. I am scared to talk to any of my teachers \(Maths, Physics, English, Business management \(probably going to drop it\) and Engineering \(as\-well as Information Technology\)\). I start my exams this Tuesday and I already know I am totally fucked.

It's making me feel like shit, I'm barely passing maths. But every time I see a test with 45, 30 or a 4/10, I don't know how to react. My parents are trying their best, but I just cant talk about it to anyone. I really don't want to deal with any of this anymore...
