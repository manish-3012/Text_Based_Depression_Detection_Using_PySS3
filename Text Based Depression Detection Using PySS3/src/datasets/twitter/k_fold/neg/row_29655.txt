I wish someone could do it for meThe amount of times I've been driving in my car wishing the semi coming at me would swerve in to my lane, or the times I've been walking down the street hoping a car wouldn't see me or hoping some murderer would decide to make me a victim. All the times I've wanted to to fucking die but i just cant do it. I wish someone else would be kind enough to rip the band aid off for me. There's only one person ill really regret leaving behind but its not enough to outweigh wanting to die. I love her but im ready to die.
