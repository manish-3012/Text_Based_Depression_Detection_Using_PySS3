Redditor in depression subreddit needs help.[Someone in the depression subreddit seems like they need help](https://www.reddit.com/user/lonelylosercreep) pretty badly.  I can't provide any more help now, because I already took a sleeping pill and am going to be asleep in a few minutes.  Can some night owl who is more awake than me try and talk to this guy?  I read his post history and I think he's pretty serious about making an attempt tonight, and pretty desperate to be helped. 

(I hope it's OK to post like this, I haven't been involved in suicide prevention online for a few years or on reddit ever and don't know the etiquette here.)
