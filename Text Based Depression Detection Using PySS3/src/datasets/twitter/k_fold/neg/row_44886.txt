I'm not asking for someone to talk me out of it, i just need help convincing my best friend it's not her faultIt's her fault 

With that out of the way, how do I convince her that it's not? I love her, but she keeps breaking my heart when she knows every other area of my life has gone to the dogs. It pushed me past my breaking point and tonight, I swallowed pills. I'm going to send her one last text and I don't know what to tell her
