I feel like killing myself todayIâ€™m trying to recover from an emotionally abusive ex. I have a very toxic inconsiderate boss even if work from home is implemented. I have a family whose struggling financially thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m forced to give all of my earnings to support them leaving a little bit for myself (thatâ€™s how Filipino family culture works). That made me forget my self worth. That made me think thereâ€™s no room for me to prioritize myself and Iâ€™m gonna live all my life supporting this family and pleasing other people.


I kinda wish Iâ€™m the one whose dying of cancer. I donâ€™t want to live if all Iâ€™m gonna do is to sacrifice for other people. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s the purpose of this life anymore! I wish to die now. I donâ€™t need this life.
