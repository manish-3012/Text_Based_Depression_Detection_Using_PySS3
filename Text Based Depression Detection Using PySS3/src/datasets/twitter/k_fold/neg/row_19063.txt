I think I'm doneI sort of felt like finally we'd found the right combination of medicine. But now I just feel strange. I feel like nothing is real, however I felt like nothing was real even before all this.

I'm just so tired. I feel bad for my boyfriend who has to listen to this. I feel exhausted. It's so hard to get up in the morning. I was so angry at my anxiety disorder yesterday because I couldn't make myself go see a movie on my own, so I took 9mg ativan in the hopes of really removing my anxiety for just a little while but instead entered a strange deliriously drunk-like stage. I spoke to my boyfriend this morning and I said things to him that I don't remember saying.

I'm so exhausted. I never thought I'd make it so far in life, and now I'm here, and I'm alive, and I don't know what to do. I have a therapist, I'm on three types of medication. I have anxiety and depression. The suicidal thoughts aren't nearly as bad on this new combo of medication. But I still find myself thinking of killing myself. I'm just so fucking tired.
