I'm tired of hearing it gets better.I feel unattractive and ugly. Any girl I'm ever interested in is always interested in my friends over me. I've lost my best friend who hates me now and everyone that we both knew chose him over me. My confidence has been beaten out of me. I don't feel cool or good looking or anything. I'm isolated and alone. I can't pursue my dreams anymore because of an injury. I've lost my sense of self and I don't feel like myself anymore. I used to be different. I used to be so much more than this. I'm tired of hearing it gets better. It's been 3 years and it has literally done nothing but get worse day by day. I just want to die.
