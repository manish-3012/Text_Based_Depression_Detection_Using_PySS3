I just feel dying right nowI feel like this world is going to be a better place without me. I'm losing friends because i cant seem to stop being so emotional. I tend to overshare and rant alot. It's gotten to a point where everyone just doesn't care anymore. Lovesickness is a horrible thing. I feel like I've said to much. I feel like drowning myself right now. I'll explain the whole later if i do surive.
