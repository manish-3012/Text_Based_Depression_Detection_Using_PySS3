stop...me from ending my life pleasemaybe i am looking for attention or maybe i'm trying to get my voice out...

i'm a no one. been alone all my life. treated like an outcast by family because i'm the only one standing out. i'm a failure, i stutter, bad academics and some things i don't tell anyone...but willing to share here because i have nothing to lose.

i'm a pathetic useless 19 year old that cannot talk to people. when meeting people its almost impossible to even get my name out.

backstory, how i got my stutter, years back. stayed with my uncle..he sexually abused me for a year.. i started feeling insecure, my cries for help everyday by him started hitching till i developed a stutter and over the years of school..got bullied alot. beaten up..stutter worsened. i had hobbies that kept me on the straight path but it didnt last. stutter worsened. affected my marks in school. met my uncle years later and same thing happened again. please...dont get any thoughts...it was painful.

i lost all kinds of confidence. my father always complained im the opposite of him. his fit. sporty person. me: a indoor weak person with no sense of ambition of the future. by the way, i told my parents about my abuse when i stayed with my uncle (that time my parents were out of the country) and they didn't seem concerned..

I've started doing drugs..weed was regular, tried mushrooms...high dosages (cried everytime on doses over 5grams...looking at all my flaws) I tried ecstacy (alone with music through a speaker, because i'm insecure about parties and i have no friends) done coke, codiene (not reAlly a drug) but nothing could help me find myself. i tried overdosing but it just made me more insecure. Its so painful...

i tried cutting myself afew times..bled out once, blanked out but didnt die...

theres so much more to my life but its going to be rambling. im sorry for the long text... im sorry if i bore anyone. i'll stop complaining. have a good day
