In love with the wrong personIm in love with my best friend/ only friend. she doesnt feel the same. i know she cares a lot but i know if i were gone her life would have progressed so much more. im a fucking low life failing school. she has helped me out of many hard times and motivated me. but i am such a piece of shit i cant do anything for myself. i know if a guy slightly better than me came into the picture i would be shoved aside. i think back to a time when she was super drunk and i was scared for her life and she let a guy take advantage of her and she almost went to his room. i feel physical pain thinking about this i dont know why. idk what it is but i care so fucking much about someone who could forget about me so quick. im literally dragging her down and she doesnt see it but everyone else does.
