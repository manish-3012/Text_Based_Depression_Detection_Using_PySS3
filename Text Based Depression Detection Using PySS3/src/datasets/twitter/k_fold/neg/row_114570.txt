Fuck.  What a day.Hello,

I'm 40 years old with two small kids.  I've been married for 20 years.  On Saturday morning, I caught my wife in a lie about her whereabouts on Friday night (she said she was going to the movies with friends but didn't get home until 4:30am).  

Anyway, on Saturday morning, she tells me she doesn't love me anymore and that she had an affair with her 2nd cousin in Vegas a few months ago.  

So here I am, Sunday morning, hurt, confused, destroyed.  To top it off I also have Chronic Lyme Disease which makes me feel all fucked up all the time.  

Not sure what to do next.  I see no light at the end of the tunnel.  I see only more pain and suffering.  I've had this disease for 15 years and it totally fucks me up, now it would appear I have an upcoming divorce to contend with also.

Feeling hopeless.
