I want to sleep and not wake up anymoreIâ€™m so tired of everything. From dealing with the break up, online classes, piles of readings and recitations that I canâ€™t answer. I just want to stop feeling everything. Iâ€™m just 21 but I feel so tired. I donâ€™t wanna die but I canâ€™t think of a good future ahead of me.
