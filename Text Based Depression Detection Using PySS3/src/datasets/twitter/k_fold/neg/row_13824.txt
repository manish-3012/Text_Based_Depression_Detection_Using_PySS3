This is my final weekI've thought this through greatly, things don't get better, you just find ways to distract yourself or get used to it. After countless attempts to try and treat my depression, I finally just give up. I tried exercise, I've tried reading more, although I'll admit I didn't give reading all that much effort. Even medication wasn't effective. They had moments where they did help and I thought things were improving, but eventually they all stopped being effective and had no impact.




I don't feel sad, upset or anything about it anymore. I feel at peace with the decision. I have no contribution to anyone's life, no contribution to society, and I don't think I ever will. And I'm okay with that. 


My mom is out of the country, she doesn't come back until next month. My sister is gone for the rest of the week, so I've got plenty of time on my hands. I'm playing a few games I enjoyed for the last time, I got McDonald's today for the first time in so long. I took a walk today, looked around at everything, and actually looked around. Memorizing the details of every little thing I possibly can, controlling each breathe I took, and I genuienly feel at peace with this decision. 



I turned 20 in December, and thinking back to when I was 15 or so, i was thinking about how I imagined my life would be by now, and how it actually is. I know I'm a disappointment, and I know that won't change. I've tried over and over to change that somehow, but it never worked. And I'm okay with it now. I'm okay with being a disappointment. 




One thing I do want to ask, I want to leave a note for each member of my family. And I'm going to make a video to my girlfriend, offering each person an explanation, but also I want to make them know the role they played in my life, that it's none of their faults, and that there's nothing they could have done to stop it from happening. How do I make sure nobody carries any guilt about this after?
