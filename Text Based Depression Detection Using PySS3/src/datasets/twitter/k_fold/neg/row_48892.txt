No one really cares until youâ€™re deadYou know what Iâ€™ve noticed? Weâ€™re in an age where mental health is being preached but when in reality no one actually gives a fuck until youâ€™re dead. Iâ€™ve been told too many times to get over it and to keep on trying. Ha. As if that cures my depression. 

You know, Iâ€™ve always thought that saying â€œno one really cares until youâ€™re deadâ€ was guilt trippy, but I completely stand by the statement now.

So many people say they care about everyoneâ€™s mental health but the MINUTE it starts affecting THEM negatively theyâ€™ll become hypocrites. Calling out of a job because youâ€™re depressed? Consider that a strike. Yes. Seriously. And guess where I work at? STARBUCKS. Where theyâ€™re always preaching about mental health. My manager always said â€œyou come first and remember, youâ€™re mental health mattersâ€. Guess what she told me earlier when I tried calling out for the first time? â€œYouâ€™re gonna get a strike. You just got partner of the quarter and now I feel like youâ€™re bailing out on meâ€ Just goes to show she was following protocol and actually doesnâ€™t care. She told me that this Thursday to come in prepared to talk to her because she needs me to â€œdecideâ€ what to do moving forward so that the store doesnâ€™t suffer. So yeah, we donâ€™t really matter.

My boyfriend who has proven to be emotionally unavailable and unsympathetic always tells me that heâ€™s always there to talk to if anyoneâ€™s feeling suicidal. Heâ€™s a parkour instructor and tells all the kids that he teaches that. He instills trust in them. Me? Completely tells me to get over it and that itâ€™s life. 

The world is full of hypocrisy. People stay nice until it starts affecting them negatively. Weâ€™re all just pawns
