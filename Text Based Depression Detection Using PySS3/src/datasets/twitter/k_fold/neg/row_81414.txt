I don't want to bother anyone, but I think it's getting worseI've had a couple times lately of drinking with my close friends and talking about our problems. I live for these moments, I love to comfort people and I need to get certain things out of my system. Two of my biggest needs get fulfilled at once, and I get to be drunk for it? I'd do it every day if I could.

I've had multiple friends tell me I could talk to them any time, but I don't believe them. Or it's not that I don't believe them- I think they're stretching themselves too thin. I think they're saying it to be nice, but that if I actually wanted to talk when they were busy then I'd just be a nuisance. I never have anything important going on, so I can drop stuff, but most of my friends are much busier. They might have a test the next day, and so either wouldn't actually be able to help, or would help but it would get in the way of their own life and I'd feel like an asshole.

It's just so frustrating. The reason I'm depressed, or the biggest reason at least, is that I got molested as kid. I think about it constantly. I've been messaging this girl lately that some friends set me up with, but I kinda stopped because I know it'll go poorly. I have a freak out if I experience anything that goes past a hug- it reminds me of the abuse. I'm emotionally crippled, but I really want to be able to be with someone. I just wish I could grow old with someone, you know? I don't want to go on too long about this, but it really hurts sometimes.
