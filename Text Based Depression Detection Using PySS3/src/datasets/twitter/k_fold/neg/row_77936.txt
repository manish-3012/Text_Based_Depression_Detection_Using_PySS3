I post for everyone here who is trying to help.Hey guys, you might not remember me but I remember you. I while back I posted on here with the intention of one last shot in the dark before I finally would have caved in and hanged myself.

The entire time I was dealing with depression my family and friends passe d it off as a phase and that pushed me further and further into a dark hole, one I did not see a way out of. I posted here as I said, for one last chance for help and that would be it.

I did not expect what you guys did. I got help, support, encouragement, people to talk to and would give me advice, people who would just listen to my problems and people who would not tell me my problems are "Just a phase". You were all there for me when I needed it most, none of you know me, I meant nothing to any of you, yet you all took time out of your lives to try and help me with mine. For that I send a thank you that I really cant put into words. (I will try anyway)

Thank you for everything, thank you for being you and thank you for caring about me when I did not care about myself. I saw no reason to go on but you all gave me a reason to fight back against my depression, to seek medical help. You made me realise my life is worth the effort. You saved me. Thats all I can say, you saved my life. If it was not for this subreddit and its amazing people. I would be dead. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, you have no idea how much it means to me what you all did. 

You are all amazing people, you showed me people care and that my problems were not just in my head but genuine problems that needed help.

Thank you all so much. I love you all
