take me back (tw) 

Take me back, 

To whenever I was just a small child.

Take me back,

To whenever I would always be happy and smile.

Take me back,

To whenever I was never used.

Take me back,

To whenever I was never abused.

Take me back,

To whenever I was proud to be me.

Take me back,

To whenever I felt free.

Take me back,

To whenever life was good.

But I can't go back...

And that's something I wish I understood...
