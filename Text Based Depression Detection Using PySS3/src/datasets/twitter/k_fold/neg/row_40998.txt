I got fired from my jobNow Iâ€™m really done with life , Iâ€™m fired because Iâ€™m not motivated to work or do anything, my boss scold me a lot and call me stupid which made hate going to work and I started calling in sick which resulted in me getting fired. Iâ€™m relieved that I donâ€™t have to deal with this crap anymore but itâ€™s make me feel like a looser and that I canâ€™t keep a job I canâ€™t even force myself to work Iâ€™m really is useless.
