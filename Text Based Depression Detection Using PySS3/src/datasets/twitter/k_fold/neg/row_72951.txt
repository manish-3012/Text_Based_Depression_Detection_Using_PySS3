I feel so alone, my heart is broken and I don't want to continue living anymore, I can't handle this life anymore. [25f]All day I have been uncontrollably crying, I can't deal with my life any longer, I have tried so many times to be successful in my work, relationships, school and every time I fail. I've now accepted that's all I am and will ever be. I don't have anyone, no friends who live near by, family who doesn't understand depression or why I can not be happy. I live alone now and have every mean of just ending my life and my suffering. I don't know what to do, I can't go check myself in at the hospital I've done it too many times with no result ever ending in success but being treated more inhumanely then just ending my own life. Please help, someone please let me know there is a little hope left, because I can't see it, I can't feel it.
