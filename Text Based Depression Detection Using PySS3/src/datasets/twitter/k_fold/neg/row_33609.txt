Trapped all the timeI donâ€™t want to die I just want things to be different. But they canâ€™t be.  I jumped off a bridge and survived - I couldnâ€™t accept I was transgender. (AMAB) my ankle never healed bc I went back to the bridge, I know cant do waitering jobs at 20. I know like thatâ€™s not all there is in life but they were good money n I could have worked to pay for transitioning. Idk how else to get money and Iâ€™m so depressed I canâ€™t bare to go through an interview and have a job as a male and have the whole trans crisis about transitioning again. Iâ€™m so tired of being injured and I just feel so mentally and physically broken. I canâ€™t believe what Iâ€™ve done to myself and I canâ€™t undo it. I honestly just wanna go to Dignitas but itâ€™s so unlikely theyâ€™d take me. :(
