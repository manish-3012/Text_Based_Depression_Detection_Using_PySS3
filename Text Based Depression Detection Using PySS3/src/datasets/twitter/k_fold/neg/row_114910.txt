Goodbye I guess.This is a new account, I thought I was past my bad mental health or atleast I would actually get better. Nothingâ€™s really changed, the more at peace I think I am gonna get at I end up at an even worse place. This is kind of the most clearest POV I have had on my life. I know all my trauma, all my mental illnessâ€™ , all the people who actually like/love me. 

Itâ€™s not worth being like this. I was never in peace, my whole life all I ever wanted was some peace and happiness. Nothingâ€™s gonna change that fact. No matter how much I try or even almost get help. If by the end of next week (10th August) I canâ€™t go back to my university (I am an international student so like my university is in an another country), I wouldnâ€™t make it here. 

My mental health is getting worse, I havenâ€™t left this house since March and being in my country especially my house is a constant trigger for me. If I canâ€™t go back by 10th Iâ€™ll attempt suicide. I am so done with myself. I just canâ€™t do this, itâ€™s so exhausting being me stuck with these thoughts which have been tormenting me since I was 5 years old. 

Honestly even going back to my university wouldnâ€™t change things that much for me except Iâ€™ll have weed to make me happy. It truly doesnâ€™t matter where I am, I am always miserable.
