Finding anyone to spend real, quality time with sucks.The only people I know are in relationships and couldn't be bothered to give attention to a true friendship where we can be completely honest about our lives and our feelings. But shit. Finding anyone to spend real, quality time with sucks. Guys want to do things while gals want to talk about things they do.

I wish I could live out in the woods somewhere, where I could feel some sort of self-reliance and accomplishment by being away from people instead of feeling in limbo being so far away from people while at the same time living right next to them. Being dead seems like the easier alternative, since living in the woods would require buying land with money that I don't have.
