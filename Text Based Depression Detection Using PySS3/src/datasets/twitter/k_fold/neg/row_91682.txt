I Just Feel Like Everything's PointlessHalf the time I don't get the point of living. I'm turning 21 in a week. I don't have any friends to speak of, so it's probably just gonna be a day of me nursing a Jack Daniels by myself. Honestly, I haven't had a real friend in almost two years, just 'allies' and people I follow on Facebook. If I was living by myself, no one would know if I was gone if I suddenly dropped dead. 

It just feels like there's no point to anything. I don't know what I want to do with my life. Fuck, I don't even know how to drive. I'm not creative or talented or even half interesting. Hell, my own relationship's falling apart and it feels like it's only a matter of time before my partner has enough of me. 

I used to self harm and I was a lot more suicidal two years ago. I'm supposed to look like I'm doing better. I'm not supposed to still be craving my harming tools after all these months but honestly I still do. I'm transgender (FTM), and I'm supposed to be a success story, not pathetic. People tell me I'm funny, cool, and deserve a chance but it feels kind of empty to me.

I try to do what I can to improve my situation. I join groups and try to get out and meet people. But it feels like I can't connect with anyone. I work from home and it's not because I really wanted to work in my boxers but I don't want to be around people who are going to judge me. i feel like that's all people have ever done to me all my life. I was either fat, a freak, a queer, or stupid. 

I was sexually assaulted a year ago by a date and I want to be able to go one day without thinking about what happened anymore. I'm seeing a therapist but I don't feel like it's doing any good. I feel like too much is wrong with me. In fact, the last friend i had basically stopped talking to me after they found out what happened. 

Why shouldn't I step out in front of traffic?
