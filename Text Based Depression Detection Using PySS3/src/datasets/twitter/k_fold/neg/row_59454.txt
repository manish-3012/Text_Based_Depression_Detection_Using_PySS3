I am noticeably shorter than average and now I want to kill myself so I don't become a dwarf at 80I am only 5'6" at 20 and almost all 14 year old girls I see at at least 2-3 inches taller than me.  I am already considered short for my age group in the UK and when I am 80 and the average female height is over 6' and I have shrunk 4 inches like my ancestors did I am going to be this tiny midget that people make fun of and don't take seriously.  It is so embarrassing being shorter than virtually all 14 year old girls.  Combine that with an obese body and a fat face and I look about 12.  Strangers talk to me in a condescending voice because I look like a little kid.
