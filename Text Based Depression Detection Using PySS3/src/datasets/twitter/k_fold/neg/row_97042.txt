I don't want to feel like this anymoreI don't know how to explain how I feel anymore. I don't really want to die, but I don't want to live the life I'm living right now. But every pathway I look at to escape this way of life either doesn't seem possible or is such a huge step that I might regret it. most of the stuff I hate about my situation doesn't seem that bad from an outside perspective. There's just so much shit I hate about my life I can't even begin to write it all down. I just wish I could start over. And I know I can't blame anyone for how I'm feeling as I know that's completely unfair but I can't help but always think of how much happier I would be with different parents. I hate the way they decided to raise me. I'll tell them how I feel and they may try and help, but shortly after they'll go back to their same ways of parenting that made me this low to begin with. My dad doesn't seem to care about what makes me happy. Every fucking night he always tells me about something I'm doing wrong. Saying I'm ungrateful for what he's given me and that I'm lazy and a punk. It's almost funny how much he tells me how much better I have it then he did and how I'm nothing compared to what he was like as a kid. I don't know there's too much shit going on through my brain to write in one post so I don't even know why I wrote this.
