When all else fails what do you do?Will anyone listen to my drunken rambles

What to do. When the realization finally hits you that you might never be happy. When you lose the love for the people you've known the most like your friends and family and cant seem to get it back. As every attempt to be something fails. As you realize that you lack the desires to leave a fulfilling life, and the only thing on your mind is getting away. you just want the strength to get away from everyone that hurt you, everyone that you no longer care for, because your just unable to. to just be alone. But as your life is crumbling and your mental health worsens, as your body begins to give up on you, is it really worth being alone. if i am to accept that i'll never be happy, if im to keep wasting money on therapy that doesnt help, should i really commit the rest of the year to living alone. do you ever just want to say goodbye to everyone? to cry infront of them and see them one last time before departing? i often fantasize about getting a terminal illness. then i could finally say goodbye to this world and not have to worry about doing it myself. I dont know how long i can do this knowing i'll never be happy, how much money i can continue putting towards therapy when its never worked for me. Because i dont think i suffer from depression. Im just not a person who can be satisfied with life, so im depressed. and now more than ever i wish to let go. because its hard to fight a war you'll never win
