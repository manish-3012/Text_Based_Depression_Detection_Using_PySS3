I'm ready for my life to be overI don't want to have to be the one to take my own life, I keep hoping for a car accident or something. But I don't feel like I want to wake up anymore and I'm getting impatient. 

I'm already planning on skipping school tomorrow, even though I'm borderline failing, but tonight's a really bad night. Supposed to graduate in two weeks but it's not a sure thing. I don't care about my major or any career - I could literally give a fuck.
I'm so beyond miserable I have to lay here with my sinus infection and chest pains sobbing to my poor cat. 
The guy I love has been jerking me around for about 6 months, and I'm so codependent that he's the only chance for me to be happy. 
But I know he's trying to let me down easy because he has someone else, and I know she's prettier, happier, more successful.
I'm such a pathetic miserable being and I go to bed every night praying not to wake up in the morning.
