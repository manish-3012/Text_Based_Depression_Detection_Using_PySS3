I can't talk about it.I can't tell my family and friends because they'd worry or judge me.
I can't tell my therapist because she'd have me institutionalized.
I sit here alone, suffering in silence. 

Can someone please distract me tonight? Tell me some good news. I need to derail my mindset of harmful thoughts.
