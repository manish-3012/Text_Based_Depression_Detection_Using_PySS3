I can't get a girlfriend and I can't take it anymoreAll I've ever wanted is to give and receive affection. I just want to love and be loved. I just want to have a relationship like everyone else has. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong or why only I am not allowed to have the same kind of happiness others do.

Girls talk to me and act like they're being friendly then they suddenly stop actually communicating or just ghost me entirely. Every single time, for years and years now. Nothing I do will ever be good enough for them. How hard do I have to try to be able to succeed? What do I have to do to gain the approval of women? Why is it never enough?

All I want is just to have a normal, happy, monogamous, affectionate relationship. It's all I've wanted since before I even hit puberty, and hitting puberty just made it worse. I've been trying for years, and years, and years and still am constantly ignored and forgotten. I can't take it anymore. I'll never be good enough to meet anyone's standards. I'm just a boring, non-existent, meaningless, piece of shit that people feel nothing but contempt and condescension towards. No girl will ever love me. Nothing I do matters to anyone or is ever appreciated or cared about.
