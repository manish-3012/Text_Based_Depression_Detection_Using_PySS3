Fear of JumpingHi. This is my first post, so, any help is appreciated.

I am married, two kids - one lives with me, the other is 15000 km away, with my ex wife. I have a decent job, and everything that I possibly may want.

I always had this irrational fear of heights, nothing can explain it, as i have no problems with glass lifts, or airplanes. Just windows, balconies and edges.

A few years ago, I realised that it wasn't fear of heights. 

It was the urge to jump.To end it all. Oblivion.

My best moments during the day are when i'm holding my son, playing with him, or playing online games with my friends. 

My wife is becoming a stranger, incapable of noticing these changes, my family has no idea of all of this, and i have no one to discuss this with.

Don't get me wrong, I love my wife, but she's more distant by the day, always finding a reason to be away from me. No infidelities, just... distance.

I find myself being the yes, ma'am, so i can stay away from arguments. Avoiding her seems to do the trick for a while. For a while.

Thanks for reading this.

It means a lot.
