How to get help when I don't feel in immediate danger?I've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts (with minor periods of self-harm) for the last 5-6 years... and maybe most of my life without having any idea of what it was.  In the last few weeks I've started seeing a licensed counselor, and she is strongly encouraging me to get in touch with a medical doctor who can prescribe and monitor medication.

It is going to take 2-3 weeks to see a family doctor and 2 months before I can get an appointment with a psychiatrist.  I feel like I needed this help 2 months ago, and I'm worried that I might quit my job in the weeks or months it takes to get an appointment.  Just yesterday I had to go home from work early and without warning because I was getting so overwhelmed with emotion that I started crying at my desk.  

I constantly think about killing myself.  If someone asked me right now if I am in immediate danger the answer is solidly "no", but for me, the question is illogical because I can't predict the moments when I feel like I've lost it.  One of these moments happened yesterday after I left work and just drove down the interstate.  All I could think was "if I crash this car I can get medical attention immediately".  Should I go to an emergency room?  Do I wait until I get to the point I was at yesterday?  

It's so confusing.  I don't feel like I can talk to my boss about it (or I don't know how to talk about without breaking down).  I can barely function.  I just don't know if I'll even be able to hold a job for 3 weeks or if I'll get to a point of "emergency" or what will happen.  I don't know what to do.
