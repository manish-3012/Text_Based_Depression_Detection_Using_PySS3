"you should break up with your girlfriend until your mental health is better" bitch if i left her I'd be dead.I write this as i prepare myself for bed i tell you all about someone who suggested that if my therapist tells me to break up with my girlfriend to listen to them. Im 16 she's 15 we're both female. 

She's helped me through my darkest hours she's helped me improve as a person and i get suggested i leave her so i can improve my mental Health? Fuck that. I'll find a way to fix everything that happened (massive fight) and if one more person tells me to leave her i swear to god im going to cut myself.
