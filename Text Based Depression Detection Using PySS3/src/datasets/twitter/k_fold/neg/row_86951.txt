Gonna fucking do it I canâ€™t waitLife has made it clear to me that I do not belong here.  I will always be used, abused, and thrown away like trash when they get their use out of me.

Life is hell.  This is hell.  There is zero chance that death is worse no matter what happens when we die.  

Iâ€™m getting a gun, Iâ€™m going to go put into the woods a few hours away, blow my brains out, and no one will ever find me.  They wonâ€™t even look until like a year or so at earliest.

Fuck everything
