Numb, Alone, DoneLate 30s male thatâ€™s been battling depression since I was 9 years old. Iâ€™m exhausted, worn out, numb, and ready to go. I have a successful career that I donâ€™t care about. I have friends, and when I want it, a great social life. I just donâ€™t care about anyone. Iâ€™m not close to my family, I canâ€™t hold down a relationship, and ultimately, I have lived my life with no ability to love or be loved. Iâ€™ve been in and out of therapy all my life, to no avail. Every gf Iâ€™ve had ends up leaving me. Going to put my 45 in my left hand and my 9 in my right, take a breath, and pull both triggers.
