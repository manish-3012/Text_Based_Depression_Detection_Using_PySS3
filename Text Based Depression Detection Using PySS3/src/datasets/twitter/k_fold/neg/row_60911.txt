I dont look before I cross the roads anymoreI just want it all to be over. Living is so pointless and draining and painful and repetitive. I get up every day and I dont know why. I want to die but i cant bring myself to do it everytime i get close. So maybe im hoping death will just come to me.

I dont make any effort anymore but it hurts when people dont reach out. I dont even need to respomd to things people say; noone seems to care. People say they care but it's like i want them to care more; enough to drop something for me. I only have myself to blame. Ive lost all my close friends and my family was never really a family i guess. Even like this i have a few somewhat close people because of the facade of happiness and whenever i reach out or talk about it it just rubs off on everyone. I dont want to burden anyone anymore. I'm so tired.

I wrote a suicide note last night. I dont know when I'll need it but at least I have it. I feel like I'm just being shoved through this horrible routine everyday. I dont know how to explain it but its like a montage from a movie where you are just stuck with the same blank face in the same postition just in different situations over and over again. And everything else keeps happening around you as if you werent there. And once i stopped trying to be perfect for everyone i realised how little everyone else cares. I dont care anymore. But at the same time its all i care about.

Ive tried therapy, exercise, medication, and everything basically that i was told to do but im so anxious and so depressed and so tired. I never thought things would get so bad that i would self harm or want to die but here i am.

This is a long post and i doubt anyone will read it or respond but im lost. I have nowhere else to go. If anyone has any advice, or anything...
