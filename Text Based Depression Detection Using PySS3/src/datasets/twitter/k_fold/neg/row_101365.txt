serious: Fighting DepressionI recently ended a friendship (cheesy) but it kind of hurts bad and all these emotions including depression hit me as I spent alot of time on this to end up like this....I don't know how to feel right now and its affecting me to a point I could end it....basically this friendship went bad and it went really bad to a point it can be toxic. I tried saving it and it didn't help. I am not in the best mental shape and have thoughts in my head.....I don't know what else I can do.
