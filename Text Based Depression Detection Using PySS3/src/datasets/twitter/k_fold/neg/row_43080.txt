hi againI posted something a few weeks ago, and anyway. I felt better for a few days after all that happened but since I've been waking up with suicidal thoughts again and it doesn't go away. Yesterday I stayed in bed all day. I need to find a new apartment by the end of the month or I'm homeless, and I'm too tired to do that. I plan on jumping from the roof my friend's five story building by the end of the month if I can't fix things in my life. My ex said would we could be friends, but now it's been a month since I ran into him and he hasn't even opened the email I sent. I can tell he's completely moved on and doesn't care. I'm so tired. anyway just thought I'd write it here because I can't talk specifics with friends without them freaking out.
