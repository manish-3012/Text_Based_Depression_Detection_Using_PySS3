If everyone is â€œlovedâ€I canâ€™t help but wonder are the people who make consistent bad decisions and find themselves all alone loved too? Are murderers still loved? Are rapists still loved? Are people who abuse their children and pets still loved? Who gets to decide whoâ€™s loved?

This â€œyouâ€™re lovedâ€ thing has gotten out of hand.

â€œLoveâ€ is cheap and conditional.
