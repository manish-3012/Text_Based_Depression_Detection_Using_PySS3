One of the reasons why I am still alive is not having a sure, painless waysI don't have a car for making me asphyxiate or pills that would lead to death, mostly just seizures or liver damage. Cutting myself hurts so badly, I might just faint from it, before doing any proper damage. No gun either. Most high buildings have suicide blocks in my city.
