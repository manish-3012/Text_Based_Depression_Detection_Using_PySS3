I've always thought of it was inevitable in a way. Seems to be creeping closer.I quit a job in January because the schedule and and environment made me depressed. I thought to myself if that's all life is, it can't be worth doing... but at the same time the economy and my trouble with the job market to begin with made me feel like that crappy job was probably the best life was ever going to be for me. I'm not special and life surely owes me nothing. I don't think that I deserve to exist in a way that would make me happy. I've worked hard to try, but it doesn't work out. I have a meaningful degree from a meaningful university and I can't even get emails back on bank teller positions.  


Rejection is a specifically hard issue for me because my father, or the man I refer to as my father, rejected me my whole adolescence. I found out when I was 14 that I'm very likely the product of a rape, which explained a lot of things. Still, hearing my dad say that he thought I was someone else's kid is something I've never been able to get over. All I've ever tried to do was to get his approval. I quit doing things I loved when I was young to do things he like. It's all I've ever done. Sometimes I wonder who I am underneath this all, because all I am seems to be a series of failed attempts to win my father's love. I think about that moment every day. It's been over a decade and sometimes it's like I'm still right there in the living room.

So when I get rejection emails and phone calls it's difficult. Dealing with the rejection of the world is getting harder and harder when I feel like I've already given up as much as I can. I googled "cheapest way to commit suicide" today. It's hard to even get sad about it now. Life just feels done.
