Brother is being evaluated in a psych wardTherapist said he's a threat to himself, comitted him this afternoon. He attempted last November, and was talking about trying again soon. He'll be evaluated for 3-7 days and we'll go from there.

Still trying to process all of this, not sure what to do. Advice?
