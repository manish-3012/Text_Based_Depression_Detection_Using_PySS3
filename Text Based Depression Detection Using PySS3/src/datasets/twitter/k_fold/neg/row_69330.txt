I think itâ€™s overHey guys and girls,

2018 and 2019 welp hasnâ€™t been good to me.  Pretty much my whole life really. Iâ€™m successful have two beautiful daughters and now I have nothing. Sure my kids my job but the only thing that made me happy? That made me feel normal is gone. Either I got played again like my ex wife or Iâ€™m just a worthless piece of shit. I thought hey the second times the charm. Youâ€™re happy for once. Happy for the first time in your life.  This person has made everyday better then the last. I guess thatâ€™s not the case. Everything was a lie. I can never trust again. So Iâ€™m done. I donâ€™t see a point anymore. Iâ€™ve hit the bottom and I donâ€™t think I can climb out this time. Im worthless and well i have nothing else to live for. I canâ€™t let my daughters see me as a failure again. I canâ€™t look them in the eyes and tell them I failed again. I failed another relationship because I fell for the wrong person. Iâ€™m sorry. Fuck this life. People are trash and I donâ€™t think anyone can be real. I hate I have to do this but my lifeâ€™s over. Itâ€™s time I meet whatever it is after this fucked up life.
