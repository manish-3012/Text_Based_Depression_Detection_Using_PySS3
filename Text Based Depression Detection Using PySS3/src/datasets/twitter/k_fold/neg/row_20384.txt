Trying to assert boundaries with my abusive family, gonna get disowned anyway, what's the point?For the first time in my life I'm setting boundaries with my abusive, narcissistic mother, as you'd imagine she didn't take it well. My dad and my relatives keep telling me how I need to be mindful of showing her "respect." and all of that jazz. But .... fun fact that none of them know about, I'm bisexual and I've had a boyfriend for nearly 10 months now..... I'm gonna come out to them one day and ruin everything... what's the point.?? I'm gonna be this huge disappointment.... It would be easier if I just died and saved everyone else the trouble.
