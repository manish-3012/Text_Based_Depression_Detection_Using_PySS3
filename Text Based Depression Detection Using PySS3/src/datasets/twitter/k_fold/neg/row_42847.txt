Where can I kill myself so I wonâ€™t be foundIâ€™ve been thinking the best way to end it and not be seen as selfish by my family and friends is to kill myself somewhere I wonâ€™t be found. Iâ€™m hoping to just be considered missing. I canâ€™t face the thought of anyone blaming themselves  or finding my death preventable. I know this isnâ€™t the perfect solution but I also am just getting tired of feeling this pain for over a decade that wonâ€™t go away.
