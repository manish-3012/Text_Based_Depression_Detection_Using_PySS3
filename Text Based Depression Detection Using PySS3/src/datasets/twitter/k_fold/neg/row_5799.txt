Contemplating suicideNot going to try and make things poetic. 

I'm a massive cunt and I'm sick of hitting the people around me 

I just want it to stop. _x000D_

This has been something I have thought long and hard over the last few months and hasnâ€™t been a decision I made lightly. _x000D_

I have come to terms with the fact that while my death may cause some pain in the short term, overall, I will save everyone the long-term pain of dealing with my future grievances. _x000D_

Mum, I love you so much. You have always been a kind and supportive voice no matter how hard the circumstances, please understand there was nothing you could have done to help me and I will love you forever. _x000D_

Dad, you are my biggest role model. I have always looked up to you and I never want you to blame yourself for my failure. I will always love you._x000D_

Sam, while I may of had difficulty expressing it while we lived together, I truly do love you and wish you all the luck in the world. My estate should be left to you, I trust you will do right by Rowan but then feel free to use any capital I have acquired to the best of your ability. _x000D_
