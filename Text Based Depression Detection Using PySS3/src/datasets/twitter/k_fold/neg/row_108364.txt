Im tired drained... I went through her phone and saw her texting my best friend and she told him she was leaving me and sent him all my responses and I told her i didn't want to live anymore and he told her not too listen to me... I have no one left... Im so so tired I have a 9mm sitting in my closet ive been eyeing for awhile and I just need the motive to do it ðŸ˜” im tired of working my ass off everyday and can't even vent too anyone. Shes the last thing I have left... I wish I wasn't such a bitch... no one knows how I feel and the people I thought I was closest too obviously don't give a fuck
