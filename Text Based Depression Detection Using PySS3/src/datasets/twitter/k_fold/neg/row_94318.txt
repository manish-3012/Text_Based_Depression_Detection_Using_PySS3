Hope someone read this and prevent this from happening.Dear Reddit,

I am 26 years old this year. I manage my own business for about 6 years. Unfortunately things had to come to the end. There is no longer a purpose or motivation to drive me further.

My Father impersonated my identity to took out credit loans through the banks. He orchestrated everything from forged emails, phone calls and signatures. It took 1.5 years for me to found out once my Father could not keep it under wraps. 

I have attempted to sell my house and my car in hopes to reduce my debt burden and expenses. Banks wouldnâ€™t care much about how the loans were signed. All at the expenses of my business liquidity. 

I had painstakingly left school to operate a shop front, worked everyday with little sleep, only to found out my Father had sold me to the banks to be a slave. The emotional blow was too hard for me. My family members could not support me due to the past experience with my Father and ended up finding fault in me. There is so much indignant in my situation.  The thought of no hope in climbing back up at all pains me too much. I regretted trusting my family members so much. I regret trying my attempt to be a entrepreneur. I should have known my place and be ordinary. Iâ€™m sorry to anyone whom I had unknowingly  offended. Iâ€™m sorry for being arrogant that one day I could use my abilities for charitable purposes. 

If anyone read this, I hope you could learn or take extra precautions to prevent these from happening.
