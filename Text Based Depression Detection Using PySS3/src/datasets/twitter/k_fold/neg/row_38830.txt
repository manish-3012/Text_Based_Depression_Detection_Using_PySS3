I lost my friend and tried to folloeMy best friend took his life. We were close i mean we didn't know each other to long. But my kids considered him they're best friend.  But I miss him.  I blamed myself for a long time for a lot of reasons. We were drunks. Like hard-core. And about a year after he passed I tried to take my own life.  It was tough but I've learned and grown. But here I sit still missing him 3 years later. I've got kids a loving wife didn't stop my guilt. And years later I sit here by the fire where I miss him the most.  But I've gotta remember his wisdom through my struggles. But here I sit still doubting my worth.
