Just Done With ItSo, my long-term SO broke up with me again. It's my own fault for pressuring him again and again. I thought we'd gotten back to the point where we could work things out without breaking up over it. But I pushed him to depression and continued hatred of me.

It's a terrible feeling realizing your SO lied to you for several months about their feelings towards you. I know I messed up, but I did everything in my power to make it up to you. I'm sorry I became needy after that *thing* you refused to talk about happened. I'm sorry that I kept coming over and couldn't give you space. You were my home and I was happy.

Once again I find myself alone with friends who don't really understand the depth of what I'm feeling. I decided that I'm going to end my life after graduation next week. We're over and I want to die. Not because we broke up. But because you lied about forgiving me. What a terrible, horrible thing to do.

It really sucks to love and hate you so much. I just want the internal fire to stop. I just wanted to help you. Why couldn't you let me help you.
