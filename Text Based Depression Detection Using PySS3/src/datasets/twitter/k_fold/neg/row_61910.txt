I am too tiredI don't know what I should do anymore. I'm too tired to live. Everything seems pointless. And I am all alone. I want to keep on living, but everything is just gray and tiresome. All I want to do is cry all day long, because I feel no one loves me, and what's the point in living if no one loves you?
