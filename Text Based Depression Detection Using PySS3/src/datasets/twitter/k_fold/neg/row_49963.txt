I fail at every single relationship. I want to die.Every single relationship I've been was a failure.

I can kiss girls at parties but I don't feel anything. I feel alone.

I met someone that made me feel good just with her presence.

Last Tuesday we had an argument over petty stuff. My fault.

I got fed up with that and everything that was going wrong in my life and told her to go fuck herself.

She came to tell me that she didn't answer because she was in a funeral. I didn't talk to her up until today.

Today I got to know it was the funeral of someone that she loved very much.

I told her to go fuck herself when she was at the funeral of someone that she loved very much and stopped talking with her for six days instead of giving her support.

She's the most awesome person I've met in years.

She's not answering anymore.

I feel like garbage. Thrash. Piece of shit.

I wasn't feeling motivated with my college things because of a project that didn't go well and now I'm feeling even worse.

I want to stop existing.
