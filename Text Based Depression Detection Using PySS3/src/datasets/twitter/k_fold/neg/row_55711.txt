Healthcare professional in training and Iâ€™m so so tired.Itâ€™s finals week. Something happened and I got pushed to the breaking point. Two panic attacks in two days. Looked for the Oxycontin I had left over from my surgery a year ago and couldnâ€™t find it. I just wanted to see if there was enough if I wanted to one day end it all. But I canâ€™t find it and itâ€™s making it all worse. It feels as if my way out was taken and I have no one I can talk to about it that wonâ€™t 96 me. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever actually go through with it but it was nice to have a choice.
