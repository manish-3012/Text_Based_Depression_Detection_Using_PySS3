I want to flyI've always been in love with the idea of flying. Since I was a little kid. I never imagined that my love for flying would be a way to end things. I'm tired of being on this earth. My mom constantly puts me down, my dad says nothing about it. People in my family claim that they love me, but they only show it when I show them love. I hate who I am. I've lost a good 7 pounds in the past week because of my eating disorder. I just don't see anything good happening in my life. I want to jump because I want it to be quick. I considered taking a bullet, but I wouldn't want my family to discover me that way. I just don't know what to do.
