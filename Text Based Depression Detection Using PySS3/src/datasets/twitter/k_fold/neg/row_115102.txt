I canâ€™t see anything good from livingIâ€™ve been feeling horrible about myself for a long time, but more and more so the last few days. I figured for a while I was 350 pounds and I confirmed by scale this morning that I was right. Not only that Iâ€™m balding on the top of my head from rapid weightless years ago (110 in 13 months) which I gained back after several suicide attempts. To make it all worse I discovered today that Iâ€™m not even the 5â€™9 I thought I was, but 5â€™8 without shoes. So to add on to the balding, the morbid obesity, the bipolar depression, and of course smaller than average penis size (yeah big surprise) Iâ€™m short for a guy! Iâ€™m trying to get things on track and get in shape after seeing that my ideal type of women do exist during a trip to Walmart. Though all weekend Iâ€™ve been panicking and crying my eyes out over all this. Every single physical trait that matters I have the exact opposite of. Sure people say Iâ€™m funny and really caring and fun to be around, but none of that matters if no one will even give me the time of day. No matter what I do I still look like a ugly fat short dude and at 27 I know most of that canâ€™t get better. Does anyone have any advice to keep going?
