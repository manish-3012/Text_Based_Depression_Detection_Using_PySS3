It's not an if, it's about the when...I began writing my suicide notes. I don't want to go without letting everyone know that it is not their fault and that I just want to go. I especially feel so bad about doing this to my girlfriend because she says I am her everything and it breaks my heart in a million pieces when I only think about it. But I can't deal with myself anymore. I am so, so incredibly sorry. I wish I'd never kissed and never let her love me. I wish I had the power to just let everyone forget about me. Just a simple "Obliviate" and poof I'd be gone. I guess nothing you will say will change my mind about my decision. I just wanted to let someone know.
