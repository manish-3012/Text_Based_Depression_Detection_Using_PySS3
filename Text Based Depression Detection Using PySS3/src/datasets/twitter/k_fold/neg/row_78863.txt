I know Iâ€™m going to hurt myself this weekItâ€™s late but I just wanted to get this out somewhere because my family would make fun of me if I said anything to them. Itâ€™s really hard to explain.. itâ€™s not just the feeling that Iâ€™m going to, thereâ€™s a lot of stuff thatâ€™s been going on. Iâ€™ve been having nonstop thoughts about suicide and instead of feeling scared or whatever like I usually would I just feel peaceful, like I just have to roll with whatever I might do. Iâ€™ve been drinking and cutting and acting out to try and distract myself from my thoughts but I just know something really bad is about to happen to me.
