i want to diei submitted a post a week or so ago and people were helpful but i'm feeling worse than ever and i want to die - not planning on doing anything at this current moment though.

i'm 16, very depressed, fat, ugly, super gay. in love with my best friend who attempted suicide about a month ago, shes back at school and it looks like she is going to get back together with her shitty ex. i'm jealous, so, so jealous.. i'm stressed and upset, i hate myself i have no redeeming qualities and i don't see my life going anywhere, i wish i weren't here..
