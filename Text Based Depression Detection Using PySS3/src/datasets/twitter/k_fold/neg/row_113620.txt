I've already slashed my wristsThese cuts are just going to get deeper, *much* deeper. 

Sick of my garbage life, i wish it'd just end already. I'm 100% worthless and useless to everyone i know. I pushed away my best friend and i get the feeling he hates me so there's literally no point in messaging him since it'll just create more drama than it's worth. And this isn't the first time it's happened. I keep fucking up with everyone because i don't even know why. I'm a fucking idiot that simply doesn't belong in this world. 


There is no fixing stupidity or mental illness. Fact is i'm a fucking mistake and i'm better off dead.
