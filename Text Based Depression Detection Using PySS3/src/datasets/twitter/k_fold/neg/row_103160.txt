On top of everything, my fucking puppy has cancer.I have already been grappling with intense suicidal urges and depression for many months- for reasons real and imagined, external and internal- and the one thing that was giving me moments of joy was the puppy that my spouse and I just got at the beginning of this month. 

Just got the news that she might have cancer, even though she's only 11 weeks old. We hadn't yet gotten pet insurance, so I'm not sure how much treatment we'll be able to afford.

Not doing ok.
