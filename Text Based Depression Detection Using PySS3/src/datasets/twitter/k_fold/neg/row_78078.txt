I want to commit suicide, but I'm too scared to do itI'm 15, living with my parents and younger sister.

Every day I feel worse regardless of what I do.

As a hobby I play video games, so much. If anything, it's an addiction more than a hobby.

I'll play mostly TF2, or some retro games from the gba-gcn era, usually replaying games like Zelda, metroid and Mario.

Even though this is the only thing maintaining my sanity, I still feel worse after making no progress on something productive in the real world.

I've been learning piano for around 5 years, 2 years ago I started grades and I'm at grade 5, I've lost the will to practice as I make no improvements no matter how long I spend revising pieces.

I'm unattractive, by society's standards and very underweight.

I lack any form of intelligence and my grades have been waning in recent years.

Wherever I go I'm treated as though I am an invalid.

My only options I have are to drown myself, slit my throat or stab myself, all of which I'm too afraid to actually do.

I cut myself and drink heavily behind my parents' backs to not sate an alcohol addiction but to amend my misery and lust for pain.

I despise the taste of the tonics I come across in the small cabinet in our dining room, yet I refuse to stop.

I don't seek any kind of help, I'm long past that, I'm broken, if anything.

With all of the past failed suicide attempts that I had chickened out of and my parents had come across, they have done nothing to prevent my eventual death or help me.

How can surpass this fear and muster enough courage to end my sorry life?

I'm begging you, I can hardly take it anymore.
