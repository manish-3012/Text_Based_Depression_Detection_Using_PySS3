IdkI'm Useless I'm dead weight, I'm no help to anyone. I'm a loser, I'm numb, I'm empty, I'm dead, I'm good-for-nothing, I'm unreal, I am *not* *real* . Dead. Dead. Dead. When is the world gonna wake up? When am I gonna wake up from this nightmare? All this can't be real. God Help Me! God Help All Of Us! Please God Please! I don't know what's going on anymore. I can't even talk to someone without dissociating. I can't even look anyone in the eyes. It hurts too much. I want to hang myself so badly.
