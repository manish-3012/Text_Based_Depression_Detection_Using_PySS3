I'm not even sure what I'm feelingI guess I've been feeling this way for awhile. I'm not even sure what I'm feeling, but it's something eating at my inside. The last few months have all just made me feel so alone. It's almost as if I'm on a merry go around and I just keep spinning around forever. 


I have a boyfriend, and he's great. He does everything he can to help, but I just feel so lost. He doesn't know how to help me, and I don't think he ever will. I will likely end my life before he gets back. I don't want him to be the one to find me. I have enough friends, but sometimes I don't feel I'm good enough to be apart of their lives. Like I'm just a leech killing the joy on their existence.


I actually have a friend I talk to every day. He's great in the sense that he understands me, but I'm not quite sure he understands how bad I actually feel deep down. I blame myself for that though, as I avoid telling him things that could bring him down. A good example of that, is the Dodgers made it to the world series tonight. I certainly don't wanna be like.."so I think I'm gonna kill myself. Sorry to kill the fucking vibe." I hope he never sees this, as he does browse reddit and the Dodger sub frequently. 
I just hope he's happy and will think I just stopped replying to him, not that I killed myself. 

I guess this is it, as I have ran out of things to talk about. I was planning on going dark tomorrow on everyone, and then killing myself the night after that. Bye reddit, it's been fun. I wish I could say I have found some magical reason to live, but I haven't, and this rambling did absolutely nothing to help it.
