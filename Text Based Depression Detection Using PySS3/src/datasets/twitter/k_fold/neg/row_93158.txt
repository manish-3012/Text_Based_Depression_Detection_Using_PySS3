Hello.I am having trouble finding a reason to live.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a scientist. I consider myself one of a minority of humans who can comprehend, although certainly not visualize, the vastness of our reality. And, next to all of that, I can't begin to put an urgency to any thought or feeling I have. Of course, I was already on my way into a rut well before I began my career in science, but it really hasn't helped anything.

&amp;nbsp;

I have talents/hobbies, skills, and a family. I currently have no friends, primarily because I don't go anywhere or do anything. I don't *want* anything. I have no desires. I don't want money or things. I think I might enjoy sitting atop a mountain somewhere, where it's quiet and there's nobody to judge or expect anything of me. And I think that may be the crux of the problem.

&amp;nbsp;

I hate the pressure to perform. The stress of being subjected to someone else's expectations of how I should function. I feel very much alone in my head. It's impossible to teach everyone I meet whose focus is two inches in front of their face that the whole of human culture and civilization is entirely inconsequential and why. So, I stay silent and servile to keep the comments at bay, and then go home and ponder my purpose. I don't know how much more of this I can take.

&amp;nbsp;

So, why, Reddit? What keeps you going every day when there's already far too many people on this planet? What value has a single quark in the infinite sea?
