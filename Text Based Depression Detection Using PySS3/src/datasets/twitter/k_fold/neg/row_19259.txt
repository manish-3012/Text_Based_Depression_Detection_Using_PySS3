I feel like I should die.I had a gf for a couple of years. During that time, She cheated, lied, and used me. 
When I found out she cheated, I almost crashed my car into a tree. 
She cheated, had her fun, then the guy raped her. 
Guess whose shoulder she came to cry on? Mine. And I was there for her. I held her when she cried, kissed her when she felt like crap, and listened to every word. 
We got together after that, and things were ok for a while. 
Then one day, she told me she couldn't be with me because she's not gay and her family would never accept us. Probably a lie but I'll never find out the truth. 
So we broke up, and I was left a shell of who I used to be. 
The girl I loved broke me twice. And I was stupid enough to believe her false promises. 
This girl still breaks me. It's been a year and a half, and she still call me when she's lonely, or needs money and I fall for it. 
Then today, she posts a picture of her and her new man on instagram and I just lost it. 
It's been a year and a half and she still strings me along, like we'll get back together. 
She's poison in my life but I can't let her go because i still want her. 
Help me. Please. I know I'm better then this. But I just can't deal right now and I've been depressed and suicidal for a long time. 
I feel like no one will ever love me. 
I'm too broken.
