Going to gun rangeI canâ€™t take this anymore. Any of it.

Thereâ€™s so much emotional pain in my heart and mind and the physical agony Iâ€™m in is too much.

J, I know youâ€™re gonna find this when you go through my phone. Youâ€™ve seen me go through all of this bullshit, and today when I said I felt like going to get a gun you told me you were going swimming with our son. 

I get it. Youâ€™re tired of dealing with me. I donâ€™t blame you.

I canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t feel this much pain from so much trauma and I canâ€™t handle this spine injury and I cannot deal with knowing that his life is hopeless.

I talk a good talk at suicide bereavement group. I help â€œguideâ€ those as I grieve for my cousin. I tried. I tried and Iâ€™m giving up.

I know youâ€™re gonna see this. I burned all the notes for the kids and my family and you awhile back when hope was alive. Sorry but you guys just have to understand that this is hell and I canâ€™t do it anymore. I love you, kids.

Tomorrow morning when you leave for work and school Iâ€™m going to drive....ha, drive; I hope the adrenaline gets me there bc I donâ€™t know how the fuck Iâ€™m going to drive with these discs bulging. 
Iâ€™m going to that gun range. Iâ€™m going to act the part of charming girl who just wants to feel safe in this big bad world.
I know you know how good I am with people. They wonâ€™t question me. Iâ€™ll have that gun in my hands and once someone teaches me how to use it, once itâ€™s me and the target....Iâ€™m gone.

At least you wonâ€™t have to clean up brain matter and jaw bones and teeth like I did. Sorry for the ones who will.

Iâ€™ve tried. I canâ€™t do this. It hurts too much.  The pain outweighs everything now.

Iâ€™m sorry
