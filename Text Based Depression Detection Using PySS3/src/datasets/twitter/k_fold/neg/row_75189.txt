Anybody else keep setting death dates for themselves and changing their mind when the day comes?I feel like Iâ€™ve been mentally doing it since I was 16. Iâ€™m 23 now. Every year Iâ€™ll say something like â€œIâ€™ll do it this winter breakâ€ or â€œIâ€™ll do it when the school year is doneâ€.

Iâ€™ll mark a day on my calendar and have a goal in mind along the lines of â€œif life isnâ€™t like this by this time Iâ€™m gonna do itâ€. Something has always made me change my mind. I havenâ€™t gotten better but Iâ€™ve always encountered somebody or something that makes me wake up and think â€œnot todayâ€.  Maybe Iâ€™m scared to follow through with it but I guess the lack of courage isnâ€™t such a bad thing.
