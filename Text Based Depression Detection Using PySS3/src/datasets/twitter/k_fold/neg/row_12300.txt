Canâ€™t talk to anyoneIâ€™m so sick of holding this all inside. Yet I feel like itâ€™s my only option. I canâ€™t speak out or Iâ€™ll scare everyone away. People donâ€™t like broken, theyâ€™re afraid of hopeless. They avoid suicidal people like they have the plague, which only leads us to feel more alone and more suicidal. Will it ever end? Sometimes I feel like I canâ€™t stop myself from trying to kill myself; it becomes a compulsion at some point.
