Stress.I'm in college, studying engineering. Its fucking hard, and I'm struggling. I dont sleep as much as I should. I never get the breaks I need. When I do get breaks, all I feel is guilty for taking the time off. I feel so alone. I sleep alone, eat alone, live alone, work alone. Sure I chat in classes with friends, and I do a club or two, but nothing feels like a real meaningful connection, and I just feel empty inside.

I have fun, but its not satisfying, and never lasts. In fact, I feel like almost immediately afterwards, like a light switch, I am back to the suffering and pain of my unrelenting schedule.

I love the work I do, and I'm pretty good at it, but at the same time, its slowly driving me mad, and no matter how good you are, it takes a ton of time and effort. I dont want to do anything that I cant undo, but at the same time, its gotten worse and worse every single week, and I honestly dont know how much longer I can take it.

In fact, after all this work, I dont even think I really feel anything in my core anymore. I feel superficial emotions, all temporary and external, but on the inside, I just feel empty and achey. What on earth do you do when you cant slow down and cant stop working? I cant stop, I need to do each and every piece of this, and I know for a fact that I'm not turning back and I love what I do.

I dont want to be dead, I just want some time off from living.
