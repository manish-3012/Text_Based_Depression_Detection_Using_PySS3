It's been a long battle, and I'm growing weary...I've struggled with depression my whole life, as it runs in my family. I have a chemical imbalance paired with the shit of life. I am poor and cannot afford to see a good therapist. My husband says he wants to leave me. I know I have my two little girls to live for, but I don't think I am preventing anything bad from happening by staying here on Earth and I don't think they will benefit from anything I have to offer that they couldn't receive from my family or another woman in my absence. I could struggle on, but I'm tired of the roller coaster, with every up, teasing me and making me feel good for a few minutes, just for the floor to fall out beneath me any minute. I've struggled financially and emotionally for so...long. I've been fighting my entire marriage and now when he finally says he wants me to leave, I feel as if my world is upside down. I feel too weak to do what it takes to get through this when it would be so much easier to drive my car off a bridge on my way home from work. It kills me to think that my little girls would never know how very much I love them, but I'm sure my family would tell them...I'm so down and so sad and this world is so full of unfair shit and how are people supposed to endure it all? We are humans with real emotions, not robots that can turn off a switch and go about the day without a care. Being intelligent is so lonely. I understand myself and why I am who I am but if nobody else does, then what does it matter?

 Now I have to go to work and smile at people and pretend everything is great while I am literally dying inside. 

Help me...
