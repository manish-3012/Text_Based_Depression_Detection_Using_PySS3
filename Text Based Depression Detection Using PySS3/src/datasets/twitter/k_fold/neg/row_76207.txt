Nobody supports me or has my back. My mind's a broken mess and I'm a worthless person. I really feel like I'm starting to get to the end of my rope. I can hardly take care of myself most days anymore... And everything in my life just gets worse. Everything feels like more and more of an uphill battle.

 I have people that would technically be "sad" if I kicked the bucket but they don't support me now while I'm alive lmao. My family is very emotionally vapid, toxic and dysfunctional. Always has been.

 I can't even bother to care for myself anymore. I don't sleep hardly, I barely brush my teeth and shower about once every week. I'm starting to put on quite a bit of weight from comfort food binging when I'm anxious.

 I'm 17 and I got my GED already but everybody already moved past that and wants me to go to college already and figure my whole life out. Besides that I'm a closeted gay and my family is very Christian.

 I just can't take this shit and nobody even cares about me. I was homeschooled since I was like 8, I have no friends and I've been extremely lonely for years. I haven't felt loved since I was a very young child. My parents fight daily and are talking about getting a divorce soon too.

 I just wanna take my dad's shotgun and paint the walls with my skull, but I don't have the guts to do it.
