I've pushed away the only part of my life worth living forI just ended a three year relationship with the only person who has ever understood my depression and anxieties. We lived together with a cat and a dog that I loved as much as someone could love anyone. Over the course of our relationship I pushed away everyone who cared about me. I isolated myself and now have few friends who care about me. My best friend who I talked to before posting this brushed me off, I know I'm a burden on him too. I'm sorry that I'm rambling, I'm having a really hard time gathering my thoughts. I just don't really know what to do with myself. I don't feel like I have anything left and I forced everything away from myself. I'm not surprised that she stopped trying to deal with my shit, I'm not surprised that after years of neglect I have lost all of my friends. I just want to lay down and never get up. I don't see any reason to go on. I'll never be successful, I'll never have a family, I'll never be happy, I'll never believe someone loves me, and I'll never be able to trust people. I'll always be pushing the people who I care about away from me because I can't get my life together. The worst part is that I don't make enough money on a single paycheck to afford a gun that I trust to do the job, so if I really do decide to end my life I'll have to save for it. Sorry I'm bad at writing.
