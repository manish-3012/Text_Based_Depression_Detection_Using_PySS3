I don't feel safe by myself, with friends and family, or among psychiatric care.The amount of opening up to people about my despair has lately either reducing them to tears or screaming at me, or in one life coach's case, having the cops called to my place behind my back, handcuffed for the first time in my life, and locked up alongside a man raving to kill the whole hospital. I no longer feel safe among friends, among professionals, or by myself, so should I just jump?
