Where did it all go wrong?I became a parent at a young age. I worked odd end jobs for awhile. I always joke that I am not smart enough to back to school. I have readin and writings disabilities. I always had problems focusing. I had friends, at one point. But they all seem to have disappeared. My SO, well he has his own problems, I am suppose to be the strong one. But I'm not. I have fallen apart. I have applied over and over again for jobs, and nothing. No phone calls, no interviews, nothing. But even when I get a job, mainly if it is retail, I can't stay long. Not because of the people, I don't mind talking to people. It's because all I can think about is something bad could happen. I witnessed a shooting when I was younger in my school. I saw everything. I still have nightmares, I still jump at a car that back fires. My mind goes from everything is okay to all of the sudden someone comes in and starts shooting. The thoughts keep getting worse, the have taken over most of my mind. This is starting to affect everyone around me. My child understands that sometimes mommy can't come to something because something is going on inside of her. So, here I sit, in my car, it all needs to be over with, my family would be better off.
