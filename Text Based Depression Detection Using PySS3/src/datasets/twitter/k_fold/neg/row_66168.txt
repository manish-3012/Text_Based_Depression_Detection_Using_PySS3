Too much of a bitch to do itI want to die, but I'm too much of a little bitch to do it. I'm miserable, I'm ugly, I've got no friends and I know my family is ashamed of me, and like I said, I'm the ugly sister. They'd all be better if I was gone, the only thing in the world that loves me is my dog who's turning 13 in December and the thought of him getting older makes me sadder and more hopeless cause I know one day he'll be gone. I got raped last year and I don't think I got fully over that, even tho I go to therapy. I don't remember last time I was fully happy, and if I could, I would've done it by now, but I'm too much of a coward.
