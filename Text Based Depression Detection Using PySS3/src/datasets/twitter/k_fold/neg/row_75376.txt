My girlfriend is five hours away and contemplating suicide.My girlfriend of three years went to a college five hours away from mine and she developed depression, though I'm fairly certain it's genetic for a variety of reasons. The depression caused her to self-harm and that has gotten much worse. I told her parents when she was suicidal a few months ago and then she got antidepressants.

Now her depression seems even worse, and she is thinking of suicide even more. She claims if her roommate were not around today, she may not be alive to talk to me tonight. Should I tell her roommate? Her parents? The college?

Honestly, her depression sucks the life out of me sometimes, but I just want her to be okay. I understand I can't cure her depression, but I at least want to stop her from hurting herself and possibly ending her life.  
**What do I do?** Thank you.
