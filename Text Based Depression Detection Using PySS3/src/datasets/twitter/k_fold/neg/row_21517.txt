lowkey feel like a burdenI try my best. I get fine grades, but they just expect more and more. The school sends tonnes of homework. I never do anything. All I am good at is procrastinating. It has dawned on me that I will never get a job. I have not even chosen what profession I like. I do not like 10th grade. There is so much pressure. They want me to score 97 on 100. They say no one scores lower than this. They say I will never get a job if I fail to do so. I will just die worthless, doing no good to humanity. Why am I hogging up the resources that could help another get through life? It seems like there is no reason.
