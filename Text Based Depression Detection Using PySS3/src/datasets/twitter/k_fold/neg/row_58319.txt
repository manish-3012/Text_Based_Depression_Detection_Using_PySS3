I don't know...17 Male. In hs. I'm dead inside. I want to die. I was a good kid. I made a mistake I can't talk about. I don't even know what will happen. I can't tell anyone. I want to end it. I've made too many mistakes in my life. The shame of them all eat away at me every day. As soon as I get over one, another comes up and I can't take it anymore. I want to be done with it all. The only reason I haven't is my family. But I can't tell them anything. I can't do it anymore. I am over it. I tried. But I feel like I'm swimming against the current. I used to be smart. I got the best grades. Then I got lazy. I stopped. I get mediocre grades at best. I can't even look at my mom when she asks about school. I don't want to dissappoint her. But I will. I have. I can't do it anymore. I'm looking up ways to do it painlessly, but I don't think I can do most of those. Maybe I'll just crash into a pole or tree on the way to school. Then it will seem like an accident. I cant let my mom think she failed. I cant. It has to be an accident. I'm sorry. Im sorry mom. I love you so much even though I don't show it enough. I'm bad at showing it. Im bad at showing a lot of things. I love you too dad, and Rachel. I can't take it anymore. Mom it's not your fault. I don't know if I should leave this on my phone or not, maybe I'll delete it to make them think it really was an accident. Mom i really am sorry. I don't want to. But I don't want to live either. You didn't fail. Please. I Love you so much. 

I'm sorry. I never thought I would become one of those attention hogs. Why am I posting this. I guess I want a reason not to. But I also don't. I just want it to end. I'm sorry. Im sorry I'm sorry
