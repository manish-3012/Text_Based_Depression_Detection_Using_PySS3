Feeling worthless,lonely and I want to die.Hi there.

I'm not good with words so I'll try and keep it short.

My family doesn't like me at all (they consider me a disappointment and are on the verge of kicking me out.),There's nothing I'm good at, and in general I'm just a worthless fuck up who doesn't deserve any love.

I don't see myself living much longer (not past January anyway though no date planed.)

If anyone wants to talk about it I'll try and respond soon though I don't expect anyone to.)
