My Best friend lost her husband to suicide 6 months agoShe was unfortunately the one that found him and is suffering from PTSD from the incident. They have been switching her meds around and she recently started telling me that if it wasn't for me and her mom she wouldn't be here anymore. 

I feel like I cant do anything. Like I'm not helping anymore. And I don't know what to do. I'm so scared of loosing her.
