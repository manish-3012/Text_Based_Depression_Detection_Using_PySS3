I miss my son...I'm going to be 100% honest about something.

The only reason I didn't use my handgun ls back in America (I am back in the UK now, my son is still there) to end my life was because I have to fight for my son.

I'm depressed, without him I spend every day empty and completely at odds with my reasons for staying alive.

I'm alive for him and a chance of seeing him again one day so I can show him the messages where his mother maliciously kept him from me and prove her inevitable lies to him wrong. 

Personally if I lived for myself I'd be fucking dead already.
