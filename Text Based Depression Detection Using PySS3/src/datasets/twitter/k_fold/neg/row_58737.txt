What am I doing?Honestly, I dont know what I'm doing typing this out. I dont have anything planned and I'm just typing the first things that come to mind. 

I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done pretending. Pretending to be someone I'm not. Pretending to be...happy. 

No one cares what I think anyway.

No one would notice if I dissapeared.

Forever. 

I don't have any friends anyway. Never have. Never will. 20 years and I've always been alone. My sister walks outside, gains 20 new friends and becomes prom queen. I put one foot out the door and everyone disappears. 

This probably sounds crazy (I probably am) but I used to imagine myself inside the world of my favorite TV shows. Imagining conversations with characters as if I was actually there. 

I still do from time to time. 

Maybe it's just a way for me to escape this world. A way for me to pretend someone out there actually gives a damn about me. 

Maybe when I'm dead people will finally realize I've been here all along.
