I really feel like I want toSo last month I tried to do it, but I backed out last minute.  I thought I was okay, but I'm not.  I feel like I'm a burden and a bother to everyone so I may as well.  I can't take the loneliness, the disappointment, the pain.  I'm too scared to love so I think I pushed away the one person I could have had love with.  So I can't face pain.  I don't know if it's too late but he doesn't need my bullshit in his life.  I'm too terrible and insecure.  I ruin everything.
