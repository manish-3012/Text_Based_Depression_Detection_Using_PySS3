I can't go on. It's over and I'm done.I want to kill myself. I don't know what else I can do. It's the only thing  I can do. No money. No job. Crashed my car. No money to fix it. Deep in debt. There is nothing I can do but kill myself. I said my goodbyes. I gave my girlfriend my suicide note. Now she knows. Now I'm done. I'm too tired to fight.
