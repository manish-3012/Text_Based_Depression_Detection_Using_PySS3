why i dont kill myselfi fuck everything up in my life, i have 1 friend, i am a dumbass in school, got no college plans, i have nothing to live for. except the fact that i would be leaving behind my family. i cant bring myself to actually commiting suicide, bc i would only be transfering my pain to them. i have this girl in my life and i enjoy her company so much, but i know she doesnt feel the same. i have a feeling she hangs out with me bc she feels bad. i am completely lost in life and feel like i have no purpose. i have one reason to live, and thats my family.
