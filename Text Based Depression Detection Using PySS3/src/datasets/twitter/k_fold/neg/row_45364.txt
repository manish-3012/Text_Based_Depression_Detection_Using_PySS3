Is suicide selfish?I've been hearing people say that life should be lived for others and stuff. Sometimes they even tell us to think of our families and stuff, but what if you're utter garbage and good for nothing? Won't it be a pleasure to lose someone who's just an annoying pest? Will suicide be actually selfish in that case?
