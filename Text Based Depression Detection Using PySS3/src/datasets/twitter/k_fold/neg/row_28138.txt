Found friend's diary entry about me.Firstly, I thought it was a sketch book, as she's a talented artist.  She's been my friend since we were around 9, and we live together now.

I know everyone complains about everyone else at some point, but my brain isn't listening.  My arms are throbbing for my craft knife, and it's terrifying me.  

My sense of humor is bullying people.  I didn't realize that it was still bullying people.  I want to undo everything I ever said and I'm so overcome with guilt and embarrassment, I reached out and apologized to the people she mentioned on messenger, but I want to delete my facebook now.  I don't want to exist.  I want to die.  She said that no one is attracted to me because I seem aggressive and insane.  I'm so sorry.  I can't tell her I read something so personal, but I also don't want to see her.  

I'm just going to take the sleeping pills I have left and hope i don't wake up again.  No one needs another insane, angry person on this planet.  I can't believe I've been so blind.
