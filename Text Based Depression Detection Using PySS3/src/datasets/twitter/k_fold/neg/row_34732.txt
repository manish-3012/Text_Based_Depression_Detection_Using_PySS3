I'm ending it this week, fuck everyone.Fuck anyone who reads this, you all just up vote my shit and don't even bother talking, you pretend to care but you actually don't; if you do comment you only claim to listen and say it'll get better, that's a fucking lie, it only gets worse for me, I'm tired, I'm ODing when I fly back to university, fuck this cruel world and every one of you poor excuses of human beings.
