Iâ€™m so fucking stressed and feel like all my problems are insurmountable, I feel the easy way out of all my problems would be to just fucking end myselfI donâ€™t know if this is the right subreddit or what. Iâ€™m just in a very bad place right now and this is the first I found when I searched for suicide on Reddit. Iâ€™m in college and in such financial debt itâ€™s insane. I have no way of making nearly enough money to pay this off. Iâ€™ve been so depressed that I barely go to classes making my fucking hard work for nothing. I just constantly feel this nagging feeling that all of this would be over if I just killed myself. I canâ€™t even fucking open up to people because I feel like they donâ€™t care enough about me or that thereâ€™s nothing I can do to help. Whatâ€™s the point of telling them this shit if Iâ€™m just hurting them more if they do help me. I have no real emotional support system at all and I just feel so isolated. I canâ€™t even tell other people my fucking problems without thinking that Iâ€™m a pathetic piece of shit. I just feel so lost on what to do. Whatâ€™s the point of all this? I donâ€™t know what I want from this post but I just needed somewhere to say how I feel
