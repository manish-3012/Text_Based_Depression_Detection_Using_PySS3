Itâ€™s just the logical conclusionIâ€™m done. The only thing I suffer from is who I am as a person. Iâ€™ve tried long and hard to become the person I want to be and the only thing that I am consistently is a person I cannot keep living as. There is something about me that is broken and Iâ€™ve tried everything to fix it. I would stay for my sisters that I love but, my relationship with them is even deteriorating. The only person Iâ€™ve truly felt love from hates me and for good reason. All she will ever see me as is the failure that Iâ€™ve tried so hard to correct, a freak and a waste of time. I hate me. I have so many memories that I am ashamed of and I refuse to keep living with them. I have people that reach out to me but, I know itâ€™s just out of pity. All I ever wanted was to be like everyone else, somehow Iâ€™ve never even come close. 

I tried a couple times before but, somehow Iâ€™m still here. I just wish that I couldâ€™ve been the person that deserved happiness. The person that could make others happy and find love. I love my sisters and my family with all my heart. I just hope theyâ€™ll understand why I canâ€™t keep doing this. 

If youâ€™re reading this, you deserve love and respect. I may not know you but, I love you and I hope you overcome whatever youâ€™re struggling with.
