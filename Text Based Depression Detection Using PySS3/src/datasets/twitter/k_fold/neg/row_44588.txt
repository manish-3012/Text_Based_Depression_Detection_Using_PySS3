Hey guys, finally figured it'd be time to pay this subreddit a visit.First off, I'm pretty sure I won't do *it*. Such a hassle and I don't really know any quick and painless ways to go.  _x000D_
I've been chronically depressed for three years now (I'm 19). It gets worse when it's late. There's nothing holding me in this life except video games, I feel like. I have a pretty bad job, but it pays. It's obviously not all bad, but there's just nothing stopping me. I won't do it. Probably.  _x000D_

I'm not sure where I was getting at. But I need friends, someone I can ramble stupid stuff to, vent, y'know. Someone who would in return say, "Hey, it'll be alright, tomorrow is a new day and you know I'm here for you. I'll always be here for you. You're an amazing person and I know you can pull through." Someone like that.  _x000D_

I'm not sure what I'm doing. Ask away if you want to know anything. If nothing changes, I don't think I'll live more than 2 years from now.  _x000D_

Edit: I've been told by other people that had a talk with me about this, that my situation and emotional state are pretty bad.
