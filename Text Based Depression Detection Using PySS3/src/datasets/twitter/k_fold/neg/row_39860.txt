Still thinking about dying, I am so alone in this world because of my appearance.If you are curious about my story see my previous post.

I used to be driven and determined to make a better life for myself, now I can barely get out of bed.

I am objectively too bad looking for anyone so I am guaranteed to be alone and miserable until the day I drop. So why shouldn't I just finish myself off? Whats the point of even trying? Its just like polishing a turd. I am not wanted in this world and never can or will be.

All I do all day now is sit on my computer ranting online about how disgusting looking I am. People try and console me, but it doesn't make me feel any better. The fact is I am arguably the least attractive guy on the planet. 

Death is my friend.
