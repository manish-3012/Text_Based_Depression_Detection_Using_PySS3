I want to not exist but I'm scared about the universe starting over again (the big bounce)I'm sick of living but if I die won't I come back eventually again? 

If the universe constantly begins and ends won't that mean the same things will happen forever and there is nothing you can do about it 

I just want the universe to end and never start again but we live in a cycle of big bangs for who knows how long
