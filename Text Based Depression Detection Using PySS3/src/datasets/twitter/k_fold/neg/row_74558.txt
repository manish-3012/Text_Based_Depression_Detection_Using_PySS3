Drowning, but Gladm six inches below the surface, and I have been for a while. Â I float to the surface often and forget what it's like to hold my breath. Â I feel "happy" when I'm afloat, but I know that's not what happiness is. Â That happiness is empty. Â I'd call it something else, but I don't have a word. Â I don't know what happiness is, but I'm certain of what it is not, and that I don't deserve it. Â It's not comfortable for people to meet me where I normally am, and it's even worse for them to meet me at my extremes. Â I deserve to be underwater, suffocating, because that is where I choose to be. Â It's better that I don't open my mouth. Â If I do, someone will just waste their time trying to pull me out and get me to breathe again, when I know I'll just jump back in. Â I'd rather be on the bottom where I can see how far I am beneath the surface, but I can't control my depth. Â People would miss me if I sank completely, but they wouldn't if they knew how close I am already and that I can never float again. Â I find myself looking at all the people that pass by above me, delusionally thinking that they'll real me in if I bite. Â I then remember they would just recast and throw me back, hoping to catch something better. Â What kind of person thinks like me and wants to live this way?
