Nothingâ€™s gotten betterIâ€™ve been doing stupid shit that hurts other people and I canâ€™t stop. Iâ€™ve faked a recovery for my parents so many times and they always believe me. I wish I could be honest for once, but I think Iâ€™m past that point. Whatâ€™s the point in living if itâ€™s always gonna be this way?
