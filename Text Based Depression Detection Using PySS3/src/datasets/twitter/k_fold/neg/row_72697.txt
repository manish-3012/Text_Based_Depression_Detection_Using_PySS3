Killing myself tonightWelp I guess that's that. 80k in debt for a useless major. Was making minimum wage in my field before I quit. Crazy how one decision can fuck up your life so much. If I just picked engineering instead of biochem, maybe things would've been different. Rent is due soon, and I can't afford that plus my loans.

For whoever is listening, I guess the lesson is: Do research on your major.
