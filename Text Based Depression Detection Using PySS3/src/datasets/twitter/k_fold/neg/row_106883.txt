got rejected and failing university (with ONLY ONE COURSE!)Ok im so fucked guys. Im only 19 years old first year uni, im only part time because i have to pay 15k out of pocket for my orthadontic treatment. I also have to get bunch of surgeries because of my fucked up body. 

I had a crush where she constantly was there for me, looked out for me, promised to never leave me. Her personality is so amazing, we call each other donkey/servants (we both work at MCD), and now she ghosted me. It hurt me so much. Everything is going downhill. She however texted back so idk im not gonna open that shit. 

I'm failing ONLY ONE COURSE ! It's not the content itself, it's how i have so much thoughts both suicidal and homicidal. Im so depressed because of my looks and my crush told me looks dont matter...still rejected..so everything crushed me. I thought if i got jaw surgery and braces MAYBE SHE WOULD LIKE ME.??? Guess fucking not. I'm so done with this world. Anyways, how do i step up again? It's only been the first month of school.

So far we had a quiz that i failed, and an online assightment that was due literally at 12am but i was too busy watching high school shooting videos because it soothes me. Im destoryed, my self confidence is destoryed and i have concentration problems and identity issues and brain fog. 

I just want to study man but i cant i have so much thoughts. My next assightment is due October 4th, i had 3 weeks to do the assightment and yet i didnt do shit because my mind is always focued on her, always focued on pleasing others.

Bare in mind, shes my first crush and i have OCD so im constantly over thinking. Shes just so special to me. 

is this my fate? failing only one course at university over a girl? Fucking end me.
