Thereâ€™s nothing left for me.It feels like everyone has taken the good parts of life right now, and Iâ€™m just waiting for my turn. Just waiting and waiting. But when will I have my turn? I donâ€™t know. I feel like Iâ€™ll only have it once Iâ€™m gone. I hate everyone else because Iâ€™m jealous. Iâ€™m jealous because they get to look at themselves and be proud. I donâ€™t like who I am. I always have to be there for my friedns but theyâ€™re never there for me. Whenever I tell them whatâ€™s wrong they just say â€œoofâ€, or â€œr/im14andthisisdeepâ€. It fucking hurts me. Theyâ€™re not even trying to help. Theyâ€™ll call me an attention seeker if I tell them whatâ€™s wrong, but if I donâ€™t, theyâ€™ll say itâ€™s my fault. Iâ€™m stuck. Iâ€™m never gonna move on. Iâ€™m still very young and already want to die. I feel like shit all the time and school makes it worse. I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m gonna make it to college at this point. I have so many missing assignments, and my grades are dropping. Iâ€™m scared for my future. Iâ€™m scared if Iâ€™ll even have a future. I donâ€™t know if I wanna live or die. Living makes me wanna die. But I donâ€™t even know what happens when I die. I just want a break. Let me take a break. Please.
