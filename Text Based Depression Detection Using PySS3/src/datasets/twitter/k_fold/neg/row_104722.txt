I'm 17 and I locked myself in my room. I don't see this getting better.First post. First reddit account. Forgive me if I'm doing this wrong.
I was diagnosed with "major depressive disorder" and extreme anxiety when I was in 7th grade (11th now), and I'm running out of ways to deal with it. I was hospitalized for two weeks in October because the depression kept getting worse and I couldn't force myself to get out of bed. After I was discharged I started seeing a psychiatrist and a counselor, neither of which im very fond of, and for a little bit I thought there might be some hope of me getting better. Then my psychiatrist told my parents I was on the computer too much so my dad put a password on my computer and I've been limited to 3 hours a day. For as long as I can remember I've turned to videogames to cope, they've been my rock in the endless river that is depression, and now the rock is being pulled out from under me. I've been trying to make it work, I really have. But the games and the people I play them with are the only reason im still here. My parents refuse to listen and just say that "that's a big problem" when I try to talk to them about what the games mean to me. There's no lock on my door so I'm currently in here with my bed pushed against the door and I'm not sure what to do. If I pull the bed away I'll be in deep shit with my parents, if I don't I'm not sure what I'll do. I feel myself drowning and the only people who ever cared to reach in after me are being taken away. My parents like to remind me that they're running out of options, they don't seem to notice that I am too. I'm not actually sure if any of this made sense, I'm having trouble thinking at the moment but hopefully I can clear up any misunderstandings.
