There's a limit to everythingI've been unemployed for months, not eligible for government assistance, and working my ass off to find a job. I put in at least 40 hours a week searching for work and nearly half of that is pounding the pavement. I've run out of money and have no idea how I'm paying my bills after this month. I was graciously gifted a few hundred bucks to stock up on groceries, household items, and to pay a bill. I was only able to do a little grocery shopping before it was stolen from me. I have 15 bucks in my PayPal account and no idea what I'm going to do if I don't get a job in the next couple of days. Tonight is the first time I've cried about my problems because I really don't know if I want to wake up tomorrow (if I can even sleep at all). I'm a fairly positive person, but there's a limit to the amount of shit someone can take before it's too much. I'm pretty sure I'm at my limit. Everything seems so chaotic and all I want to do is cease to exist. I'm tired.
