I've decided that I'm going to overdose this JuneI'm tired of being alive, and when I made the decision, I felt like a huge weight was removed from my shoulders. June feels like it's so far away right now. Thank you for reading this. This is all I can think about, and I can't talk to my co workers, friends, family, or wife about this. I'm definitely not going to talk to another damn therapist. I refuse to be hospitalized again. Sorry if this reads like nonsense, I just needed to tell someone.
