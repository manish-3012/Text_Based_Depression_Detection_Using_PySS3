why should I stay alive?I was taught dying is bad the moment I knew how to speak but is it really that bad? No one knows what happens when you die and just assumes itâ€™s bad, even if you just lose all consciousness when you die itâ€™s still better stuck in this horrible world where everyday is just full of disappointments and let downs.
