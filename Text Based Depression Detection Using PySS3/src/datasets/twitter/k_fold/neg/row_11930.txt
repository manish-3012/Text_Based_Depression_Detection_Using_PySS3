I want to run away from home but don't know if it is a good idea.I am from Pakistan so my parents are very conservative. Grew up in a home where women are considered good for cleaning and cooking. I am rarely allowed to go outside and have to lie to even hang out with my boyfriend or any friend twice a week for a few hours. I am 18 btw and live in Canada. I don't do drugs, don't party, don't drink. Never done anyhting illegal. I am a girl with good character traits and I am genuinely a good person, or atleast I like to think. but because I have a boyfriend my parents do not trust me to go out or anything. I can't share any experiences with my parents in fear that they will get angry with me and I live in constant anxiety. At this point I am so detached with my parents that I don't feel bad for lying to them. They have disgusting views and beliefs which I don't agree with and don't want to grow up with. I constantly get depressed and suicidal. I was never allowed sleepovers and basically never given a chance to be a normal teenager. I truly feel like I wasted my childhood because of my parents. Is it a good idea to leave and say I have had enough? This is not the only reason I am leaving. my parents are the type of parents that think discipline through hitting is the best way. so I can never speak up. Please help me. I am just looking for answers on what to do. I am truly unhappy with life.
