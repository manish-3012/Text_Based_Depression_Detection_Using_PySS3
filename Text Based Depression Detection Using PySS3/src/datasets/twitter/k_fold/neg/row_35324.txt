I've had enoughI'm in middle school (Grade 8, USA) and I can't take it anymore. I'm struggling so much, I'm buried in work. I can't handle it. The suicidal thoughts are endless. And I've sought help. I'm on Zoloft (an antidepressant), and it worked for about a month. Since then, the suicidal thoughts have been constant. It doesn't help that I'm a regular visitor on 4chan. If life is this hard this early on, I don't want to know how bad it gets.
