I think I am doneI cannot continue like this and if the past two years are any indication, I cannot change either.

I am overwhelmed by my studies, I care little for my friends and although I know my family are kind and would care, I don't mind leaving them behind. I have not slept during the night in so long. I sleep at least 10 hours in the day, I cannot remember when I last saw daylight. It would be nice to see the sun one last time.

I have written a few things, I owe everyone a brief explanation at least, and I have decided on a method. I think I am done

Thank you for reading
