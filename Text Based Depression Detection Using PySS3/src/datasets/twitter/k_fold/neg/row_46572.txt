Mounting stress at school is driving me over the edgeMidterms are driving me off the wall. All my classes are online havenâ€™t left my room in 2 days

Have to wear masks in hallways canâ€™t interact with anyone on my floor

Midterm assignment wants me to use simulink which I have no experience with. 

Im really close to hanging myself from all this stress
