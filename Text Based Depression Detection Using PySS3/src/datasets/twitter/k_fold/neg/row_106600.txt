I hate reaching out for helpIâ€™ve always hated asking for help.  I donâ€™t have any friends or family that will help ever so I kind of shut down.  My depression has gotten so bad that it has affected my teeth though. I really want to be happy with the smile I have.  If anyone is willing to help Iâ€™d appreciate it. gf.me/u/wsijif
