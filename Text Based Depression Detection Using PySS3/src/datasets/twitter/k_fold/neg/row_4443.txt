I'm sorry Nick.I'm a 15 year old boy. Depressed for years now, tried to kill myself when I was 12. Nobody likes me and I've only ever kept a few friends at a time, I always drive them away. I had one really good friend. My best friend who I would have given my life for, Nick. But I fucked that up too. And I'm serious I would give my life to save his. Any day, even now. I loved him like a brother, it was like I existed through him but now he is gone and he is never coming back. He has given up his entire life to hate me. He isolates himself in the library at lunch to read by himself. He doesn't talk to any of our friends because they associate with me. I don't think here is a single fiber in his entire body that doesn't loathe my existence. I tried talking it out I tried ignoring it it makes it hurt worse. It physically hurts, I can feel it. But it's not anywhere on my body. Its like is tearing apart my soul. So I guess I did what any 15 year old would do. I decided to try pot as an escape, and now I smoke like a fucking chimney. And I like it, even though I know I probably shouldn't. Because when I'm high as a motherfucker I don't have to feel anything. What am I supposed to do? Is the fact that I'm posting this at all make me pathetic? I feel like I shouldn't need moral support but I really do. Thank you very much for taking your time to read me poorly worded post. But I just don't know what to do with myself.
