I've been very suicidal and there's no real support from my bf or family.I told them how I was feeling a month ago. I was in high distress, I almost slit my wrists until my bf had to send me to emergency. Eights hours of sitting in the emergency, we left with nothing.. we we're waiting for a doctor for what seemed like hours. 
Then we get home, bf hides the knives and I head to my family's house for a couple of days. I tell them I'm in high distress and I really wanna kill myself. 
They took it lightly. I think the only person who checked up on me, checked up on me once. 
I can't talk to anyone on how seriously it's affecting me. It's all I can think about. All I picture is how easily I can kill myself. Where I can kill myself. And I already prepared notes. I made a checklist. I made sure that whenever I did it, to atleast wait Valentine's day with my bf and to spend a weekend with my little sister. 
These thing have been checked out. Now it's time to look at the location. Which I am going to check out today. 
So I don't know.. I think I've gone too deep to ever come out of this.
