Insanity is the final refuge of the sane manBasically when I wake up in the morning the first thought in my head is "oh, this place again." And then I slowly remember who I am...momentarily consider why I'm me at all...momentarily ponder the absurdity of existence at all. Why the hell does anything exist, I ask myself.

Then things start feeling weird, like a dream. The fact that I have eyes is just so surreal; I can fucking see shit. Where is this image being projected? It's just there, I can percieve it right there around me, immersing me in its environment. But where the fuck am I? These thoughts running through my head...I am hearing them now. But not quite. How am I perceiving my thoughts? What a peculiar sensation. So absurd.

Then I recall who I am, the things I do, the things I have "to do" that day like school, work, etc. And I ask why? I've awoken in this immersive 3D environment, that I and others call reality...but what truly is it, and why should I take it seriously at all? It feels like a chore to exist at all, a constant state of uncomfortableness. I feel constantly detached from my body and life feels like I'm viewing a movie in first-person. That is, I'm just observing all my own bodily actions, as well as everything around me.
So tell me, do I sound crazy? Depressed? Am I still logical and coherent? I just am truly curious how prevalent feelings like these are in the human condition.
