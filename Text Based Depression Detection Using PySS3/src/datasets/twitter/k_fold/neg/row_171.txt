I don't want to get better. I want to die.I can't see myself ever being happy or content anyway. Even if I got over my social anxiety, got a good job, moved to a great new country, had caring friends and family, had a partner, had a nice house and fulfilling hobbies, even then, I'd still be depressed and empty. I might be less depressed, but it wouldn't go away.

I'm tired of being told to get help or open up to someone. The only advice you ever get is "it gets better" and "think about your family". Well, I don't care anymore. I'm tired. Why is not wanting to live so frowned upon? I tried living, and it's not for me. Stop trying to save me and just let me die painlessly.
