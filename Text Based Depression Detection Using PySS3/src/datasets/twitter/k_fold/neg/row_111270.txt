Life is UnfairPeople make choices. Some are good some are bad. Through out my life I made bad choices. I see people make choices that turns out to be good for them, but why every possible choices of mine is wrong? Why I have to be the loser all the time? Why I'm not getting what I am working for such a long time? I am very depressed.
