Don't give a damnI don't even care if anyone reads this I just needed to write it. 2 years ago the person I was closest too overdosed and everything's been crap since . My friends don't understand they don't what to talk about setups in things , they say to me talk about anything but I know they don't mean it. They're tired of me being so sad. I don't even talk to anyone any more no one gives a crap.
I'm terrified to die but I hate being alive when I can't relate to anyone and Don't have anyone else to talk too
