It feels like a really big coat.My depression feels like a coat. I think it sits on my shoulders on any good day and I feel like I actually like the warmth of it. Because really, if I'm being completely honest, and open, I'm sucidal 80% of the time. My head feels too heavy and my skin feels too strange. I can't recognize myself in the mirror. It's all weird, and goopy, and thick, and I feel like I'm lying to myself because I feel like I like it. There's comfort in knowing I won't ever get better without taking some pills to correct the mistake my brain made along the way. There's a peace that comes with knowing that telling anyone in a medical field this would get me locked up. Because it's something I can control. No one has to know, really, no one has to ever know but I'm still writing this so I guess I need to let it out. 

I was finally digonosed, I was validated, I was freed from that stupid question, "what's wrong with me?". I have a piece of paper that tells me in a lot of black ink. So every single day when I feel that weight, that familiar itch, that constant panicking nag I'll know why and I can blame my trauma and I can blame my brain overthinking and I can blame my digonosis, but it won't fix it.The only thing that could would be dying. I know this and yet I can't do it. I can't leave behind that type of hurt. I refuse to. But everyday staying alive hurts worse than being dead, I know it does. And I can't do anything but sit, and think, and drown in my oversized coat.
