I feel disappointedIâ€™m starving myself to death and I know it. That should mean I donâ€™t care right? But I got in a fight today with my friend and he hit me multiple times in the chest stabbing me with the end of his pencil. But when I fought back I felt weak like it was doing nothing to him. Iâ€™m disappointed in myself and want to go in a bathroom and stab myself multiple times with the sharp part of a pencil. Or take a blade out of a pencil sharpener and slit my throat right in front of the class. Iâ€™m weak and donâ€™t deserve life. I guess this is the last 30 or so days of my existence Iâ€™ll give daily updates. The weird thing is, Iâ€™m not treating it like itâ€™s my last 30 days. Iâ€™m actually caring. I just realized I can go to jail if I want and it wonâ€™t matter. Itâ€™s like a video game because I donâ€™t care if I die so I win either way.
