I just want to be happy?I'm honestly at my wit's end. I've been feeling this way since February of 2015 and I don't think it will ever end. 

Everyone tells me I just need to start taking steps to make my life better but I don't even know what I want. I want to be back in high school with my whole future ahead of me and a great group of friends instead of a college drop out in a shitty job with no one. I feel like I'm just existing every day, either working or waiting to go to work. I don't have anything to look forward to anymore.

I'm tired of being optimistic and hopeful only to be let down. I'm tired of trying. I've been looking up ways to end it and I keep hesitating and I don't know why because there's no hope for me anymore. I hate everything about me and my life. Even my username makes me sad because it's an inside joke from a friend who no longer wants to be associated with me. I feel like the world will be better without me and I just want to be at peace instead of constantly sad. I'm tired of my throat hurting because I'm so sad, probably happens twice a day
