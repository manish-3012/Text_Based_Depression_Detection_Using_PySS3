Goodbye people, I'm going to kill myself todayThis world is a pathetic joke. All the rich people have bought all the politicans and changed the rules up to fuck all us non rich people. Even if you have ambition, it doesn't matter since you have to suck up to the right people to get anywhere in life. I hate this world I hate myself and I need to put an end to this. I have 0 motivation to get anything done, and what's the point because if I try to do anything it will end in failure Everytime. I just want to not exist anymore so I don't have these horrible depressing thoughts in my head 24/7. I wanna die so bad. It's scary when I think about actually doing it but imagining it already done and the relief for doing so makes it seem worth it.

Idk I'm rambling, I just want to get this out there in case anyone finds this account on my phone and goes through it. This is me. I am suffering and I want it to end. Goodbye.
