I dont know where to post this but Im losing my fucking mind. This cant go on much longer or Ill be lost forever.Im so angry I feel like im gonna explode. My parents are screaming at each other over me and i dont have a car and i dont live near any friends. i feel stranded, and have for sometime. My meds arent working and for some reason if i stare at something for more than a minute i start to hulicinate mildly. I killed a rabbit with my archery bow last month and nailed it to a tree. after cutting it open i let it decay over the past month. every day i go out for a cigerette and check my progress, but theres no more satisfaction left in my daily life. i wish i could kill my parents, all 3 of em, and just decay in my house alone. im waiting for something bad to happen. either ill do something stupid to cause a chain of events ending my life or hopefully some greater force will just cease my existence. i hate the world we live in and the people around me make me sick. I cant focus anymore because im shaking and sweating now. I fear insanity please reddit tell me whatr to do im desperate to leave this behind
