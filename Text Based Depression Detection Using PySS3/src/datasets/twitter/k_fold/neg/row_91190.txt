Iâ€™ll probably delete thisI donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t have the worst life... or really even a bad life. Just realistically I donâ€™t see myself seeing 30 (20 now). Iâ€™m kinda ok with it I suppose. Iâ€™m just tired of walking through crowds alone, turning around to see no one, tired of being alone. I close my eyes but instead of day dreaming I see myself in vivid color slitting my wrist or throat. I see the blade slide through my skin and the blood trickle out. Iâ€™m so young but feel so old.. I canâ€™t relate to anyone my age but yet anyone old enough for me to think around I am too young to be with. 

I just feel lost.
