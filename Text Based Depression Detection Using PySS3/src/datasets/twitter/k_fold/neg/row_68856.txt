Not sure how long I can take it - I need help, I know I do, but I don't have the accessibility to it. 
I'm an atheist lesbian living in a fundamental christian household STILL at 19, can't afford to move out. Spend a few days in the hospital this past weekend for health issues. I just want to end it and for it to be over. No one loves me, truly they do not. I miss my ex girlfriend. I read the 'read this first' thing on the sidebar a few weeks ago. I waited. I still want to. I was moved around a lot as a preteen and have been depressed since then. It's not acceptable to be sad in this house. I'm failing 2/3 of my college courses, a guy on the train calls me a faggot every day. There is so much tension with all the hiding, lying, trying to be what my mother wants me to be. She's on my jock so much I can't even get away to call a fucking suicide helpline. I just want to end it.

/thanks for listening
