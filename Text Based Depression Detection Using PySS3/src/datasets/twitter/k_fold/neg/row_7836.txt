Passive SuicideI want to die, but I don't want to attempt suicide again. I'll end up vomiting all over the place again or end up being in pain again, so I'm just waiting to die. I'm going to slowly wind down on eating, moving, and whatnot. I'm just going to smoke and vape until I eventually die from something. I've also come down with a respiratory infection, so there's that. I'm just really bored and tired of living life. Nothing's interesting. Nothing's exciting. Nothing makes me happy. Family's getting on my goddamn nerves with bullshit. I don't want any more friends or romantic partners. I just want to quit being present.
