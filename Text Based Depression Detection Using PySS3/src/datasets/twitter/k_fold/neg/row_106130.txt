Can I just talk to someone?I know I'm not going to kill myself. I just can't stop thinking about it. I want to be done so fucking bad. I want to stop feeling like a shitty person, I don't want to feel anxious all the fucking time. I don't want to self medicate to get rid of these feelings. I'm tired of sitting here feeling like there's nothing I can do aside from waiting it out. I'm tired of sitting here crying until it goes away. I just need someone to say it might get better.
