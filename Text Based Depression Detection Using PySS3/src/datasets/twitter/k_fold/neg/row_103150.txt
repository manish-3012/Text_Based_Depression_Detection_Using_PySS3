Every day is one day less. I can't keep justifying my existence.I don't really know what to put here and putting in effort seems a little contradictory. 

I'm  not gaining any traction anymore. can't find a job, even if I do getting fucked for 8 dollars an hour doesn't seem like a life changing move. I'm so fucking ready to do this. i think about it at least 5 times a day. I've already called a party supply store for a helium tank. the irony of which is not lost on me.

nothing i do seems to matter or change anything and the longer i sit by myself trying to scrape together choices the less i find to scrape together. every morning is just one day less, like I'm running out the clock.

I can't keep doing this. I'm just wasting everyones time and money.
