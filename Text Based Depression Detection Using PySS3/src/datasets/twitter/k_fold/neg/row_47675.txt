I've never been so sad...I did something really stupid to my very close friends. Basically we all go on a chatboard (we all talk and know each other in person) and talk to each other under these screen names which we all know so we know who is who. Basically I thought it would be funny to be a new member under an anonymouse name. However I then had some pent up rage about a girl I did not like and I ended up insulting her, and then I said some other stupid things, then everyone didn't like me and then I just left and decided never to go back on that account again. No one ever knew it was me except for my girlfriend... Then eventually we broke up and she told all of them about what I did. I know this sounds not as bad as it seems, but those guys were my best friends and I've actually never been so depressed, like they meant so much to me and to lose them all like that. I've never been so sad in my life. I've already apologized but it's too late. I can't even begin to discribe how much I actually needed them, I can't even put it into words, they were the friends I always wanted and the family I needed. I don't think I'm suicidal... I'm just really freaking sad and I don't know how to cope with it. My keyboard is honestly filled with tears now and I haven't cried in years now. I'm not mad at anyone either like I don't mind that my ex said that I kind of had it coming for betraying their trust.

I just don't know what to do, I feel like I just lost a huge part of my family....
