I am a 14 year old suicidal boy.I don't know why. I know it's stupid. I know I'm probably never going to go through with it. I need to talk about it. I've been this way for a while. I've ideated extensively. I have an IQ of 148. (I don't know why I said that.) I'm not in the best mood right now either, but go ahead with your questions.

edit: please, keep going ahead with your comments, but I'd just like to say that reddit has helped me a lot already.
