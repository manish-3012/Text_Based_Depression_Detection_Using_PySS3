I'm tired of not being enough.I'm never enough.  
Never.   
And there's nothing I can do. There's a reason why I've attempted or had suicidal thoughts ever since I was young.    
Three times in the past six months alone.   
I don't want to die, not really, but I want to rid the world of myself.  
And I'm only 17, and it's probably only going to get worse from here on out.   
A high school dropout, barely going to work because of panic attacks. I feel worthless.   
And the truth is, I need someone.   
Friends, lover, pet, family, no one knows how to help me, so they do nothing.

This is my last call for help, a vent if you will.
