I guess I'm backI made some progress since last time I posted here but it seems like I'm back at square one. I feel so worthless, I'm not enough, for anyone. I'm not enough for a girl apparently, she just left me and said it's better if we just stop talking altogether, I feel no love from anyone except my friend, he helps me out so much, I haven't even told him I'm suicidal, I'm so afraid of disappointing him or losing his support, the only thing that's keeping me going is the idea of studying abroad and leaving all this misery behind but there's sooo much time between now and then, I already struggle to envision making it past May. I just need someone, I'm so tired of being alone, it's been so long, I can't stand the thought of continuing this solitude. What is the point of existence if I'm constantly drowning in sorrow? Why bother?
