HelpI have my belt wrapped around both my neck and the stairway hsndles. I want to throw myself off the stairs to end the constant internal pain that is my life. Nothing good happens. And very few want to help me. I feel alone. Always. Even around other people. I have been treated before. I was meh ok for a while.  But now I realize that the rest of my life will not be pleasant. I want to end it. I am currently writing letters for certain people to read so that they can feel less sad and perhaps even better themselves.  Im sorry but this is the way I am.choosing to go. I would have rather gotton some opiates and OD on a good dose, but that is not today.
Dad: you are far from innocent in with which brought me to today. You, kinda, tried, but that wasnt good enough, you spent all yoir time on my older brother and forgot about me. 

The future looks so bleak and I cannot keep lying about it any further.
