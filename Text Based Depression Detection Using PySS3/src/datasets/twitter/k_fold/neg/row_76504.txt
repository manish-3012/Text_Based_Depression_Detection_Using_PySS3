Why is it all so hard, can I just cease to exist?Everythingâ€™s so overwhelming or doesnâ€™t feel like anything at all and I just want it to end. I know I donâ€™t have it as hard as a lot of the people on this sub and that Iâ€™m really immensely lucky to have loving parents and financial stability (although this also makes me so fucking worried because I donâ€™t know how iâ€™ll be able to get a high paying job after college with how absolutely depressed and mediocre I am), but each day just feels like the same thing over and over again. Itâ€™s just a cycle of forcing myself to get out of bed to doing work and feeling so lethargic and drained to sleeping again. Is this all there is to my existence???? Iâ€™m 21 and Iâ€™ve never even been in a relationship before and honestly it just attests to the fact that iâ€™m unlovable outside of my biological relationships. Iâ€™m not even horrendously ugly or illiterate, just unlovable. My friends are just... they say that theyâ€™re there for me but always hang out without me. And I canâ€™t even bring myself to reach out because I donâ€™t want my depression to linger on anyone else. Thereâ€™s literally no meaning to life if I canâ€™t have a net positive so why canâ€™t I just move on? I canâ€™t even kms because I know my parents will be so heartbroken and I feel so guilty for hating my life and being the way I am. But fucking hell do I want it to end. Sometimes (okay actually a lot of the time) I wish I had some terminal illness or cancer so Iâ€™d be able to pass without hurting my parents that much. 

I wish euthanasia was legal and that suicidal people were validated more often too. It sucks to see so many other hurting people only being able speak on here. It sucks to see everyone struggling with even performing the act and it sucks to see people suffering even more after failed attempts. The world is a cruel place, but only to some. I guess that applies here. 

Sleep is the only thing I can do now. Sleep gives me temporary death, and thatâ€™s all that I can do.
