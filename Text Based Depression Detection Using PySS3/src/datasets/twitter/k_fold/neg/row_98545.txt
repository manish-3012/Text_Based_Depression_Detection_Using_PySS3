getting help is so hardIâ€™m starting to have suicidal thoughts every day now to the point where I just want to lie around and do nothing, and my quick distraction fixes are starting to bore me and Iâ€™m losing interest. Iâ€™ve tried calling the office for the therapist 3 times today and no answer. I have phone anxiety so itâ€™s already took me enough courage to just be able to call this place like three fucking times, I really donâ€™t want to be bothered to try and call another doctor, another office, set up an appointment, fill out the paperwork. I think about dying and killing myself constantly. Itâ€™s getting harder to reach out to friends the further Iâ€™m starting to head down. I know Iâ€™m too pussy to actually carry out anything, but the thoughts and nonstop fantasies are overwhelming and exhausting. 

why is getting help so hard if i could just kill myself?
