Pretty much doneI think I've finally reached the point of no return. Getting 28 years out of life was more than I expected anyway, but there was a period of about 4 years where I had a use (nursing my terminally ill mother), but now I can't even really say I exist. I'm terrified of everything and I can't really face living like that. There's no possible future I can see for myself, particularly in this country where things are only getting worse and worse. I have fairly severe bipolar, avoidant personality etc blah blah, I talked to psychologist about hospitalising me, but two months later and nothing. They can't even be arsed to put effort into helping me. I could rant on, but this is as far as I can vent without freaking out completely. I don't want attention, I don't want sympathy, I don't want anyone claiming to understand. I just wanted to express this (as poorly as I did), and I am grateful that I could do it here.
