Depression is an anchorI feel like I can hardly move sometimes. When the sadness is more than just being sad, itâ€™s hopelessness and all consuming. Iâ€™m always carrying around a heavy feeling of nothingness in my body. Even when I tell myself, â€œThis is the depression, itâ€™s an illness and this isnâ€™t permanent.â€ The feelings of it overpower the logic and I canâ€™t convince myself that itâ€™ll ever truly be over because I know even when things have started looking up in the past, they will always get worse again, the feelings of despair will always come back so the thought of living is almost as terrifying as dying. And the WORST part is knowing that someday none of it will matter anyway, it wonâ€™t matter if I was happy and fulfilled or depressed all my life. Whenever I start to feel less depressed and become proud of myself for exercising or doing something beneficial for my health, it reminds me that the world is still fucked up and terrible things still happen everyday. There are people with depression who are miserable for the majority of their lives so how am I suppose to be calm and believe that one day things will be okay and life isnâ€™t just hollow misery?
