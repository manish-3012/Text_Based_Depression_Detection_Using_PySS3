why do I keep going?So for some context, I'm just turning 20 years old, 6'2, 470lb, Transgender Woman (born male transitioning to female). I dont know what I'm doing. Why do I keep going? Maybe I'm just stubborn. But I don't have a reason to keep going.

I don't feel a real connection with my family. They're not abusive, they just exist. My friends I love dearly, but they're not there enough to fill whatever hole I have. I have a full time job making decent money and end each month with excess. No matter how much stuff I buy it never makes me happy. Whenever I get upset, I eat food. It's just how I make myself feel better for just a moment. But it never last. It makes me gain weight and get even more unattractive. I've downloaded every dating app I could to try over 2 years to see if I just need a romantic partner. I've gotten a few messages, but they either want a one night stand or nothing at all when they realize I'm transgender. 

I've thought about going out and meeting people. But where would I go? I enjoy D&amp;D and trading card games, but all local game shops have closed down. I can't go to a bar because I'm under age, and even if I wasn't, I don't like drunk people. I don't even know why I'm writing this. I'm reaching out and even if people send me love and support, where will I be? 

I keep telling myself "Things will start to change after you open the next door in life" I don't know how many "Next Doors" I've opened, but so far it has just been more of the same.

In conclusion, I feel less joy than pain. It seems like feeling nothing would be a step up. But I'll probably just do what I alwaysd do. And thats just opening more doors.
