VentThis THING, whatever this is, started around a year ago. It used to terrify me. I used to cry all the time. I would lay in bed and try to hug myself to sleep. I could never sleep. I would take sleeping pills. I was desperate for a few hours of sleep just to escape this thing in my head. I would have panic attackâ€™s. I donâ€™t know if it was because I was scared of it all or just exhausted from not sleeping.

It doesnâ€™t terrify me anymore. I canâ€™t cry anymore. I still canâ€™t sleep but I stopped caring months ago. Now Iâ€™m just angry. I donâ€™t have the strength or courage or whatever the fuck it is I need to make this end. I donâ€™t want to exist in this world anymore. People who do want to exist, people who have a lot going for them, people who have friends and family that care about them are dying every day and here I am angry as fuck that Iâ€™m not one of them. It doesnâ€™t seem right, it doesnâ€™t seem fair. For fuck sake take me instead.

Iâ€™ve read too many stories about failed suicide attempts. Thatâ€™s what my problem is. Some girl tries to shoot herself in the head and just deforms herself instead of dying, some people are brain dead, some people just have a lifetime of debt. Attempting this and then failing is beyond scary to imagine and because of it, because I canâ€™t stop over thinking everything, I feel like Iâ€™m stuck here in some lifetime of misery and pain. Iâ€™m wasting space. Iâ€™m wasting resources that others could be using by being alive. 

Iâ€™m a shell of the person I used to be. I just want this to end. 

Iâ€™m feel like Iâ€™m stuck in my own hell because I canâ€™t stop overthinking how wrong things can go. How do I turn off my head?
