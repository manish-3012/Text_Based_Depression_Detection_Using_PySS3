Tried to kill myself.......and failed, some weeks ago. Rope broke and now Im left with a huge scar on the neck. Thing is... Im just as before, most time what I feel is just like watching paint dry on a wall, a sense of boredom and nothingness, with the occasional burst of sadness and anger, most times coming from drinking whatever I can afford.Some would say that after all of this I should be glad I failed, but I dont, I honestly wish rope hadnt broke, I had already blacked out, so it was all easy from there. Now Im in the awkward position of not being willing to go through all the process again, not my best experience and definitely something I wouldnt want to repeat anytime soon. Dont really know if looking for help, just tired of all the retarded jokes from people that doesnt suspect a thing do about my scar (most got to do with erotical asphyxiation) and wanted to let some unknown know about my little secret.
