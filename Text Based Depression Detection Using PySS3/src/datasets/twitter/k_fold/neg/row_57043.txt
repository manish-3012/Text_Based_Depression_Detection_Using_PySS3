Not suicidalI'm not sure if this is the right place for this and I'm sorry if it isn't. I don't really have anywhere else to turn. I've been struggling with various mental health difficulties for 6 years, I've only recently stopped self harming but im thinking about ending it all. I don't want to and probably won't do anything to myself at all. I started hyperventilating at work today over making too many mistakes and I only started the job yesterday. And managed to make a scene by crying and mess it all up. Im18 on Sunday and it feels like I'll never have a good life because I can't do anything right and I can't handle working which is something I have to and want to be able to do. I feel like giving up and ending it before all the failure to stay in school and be normal really starts taking it's toll on my life and I'm jobless and homeless because of my own incapacity to do things I should.
