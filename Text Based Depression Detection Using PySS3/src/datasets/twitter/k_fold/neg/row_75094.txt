I'm young and this is stupidI'm 16 and honestly I feel like an idiot right now.
I know what's hurting me. I know I'm depressed. I know I probably have no reason to be depressed.

I'm successful in school getting straight A's. This year I've been more social than ever before, talking to chick's and going out with my mates. I'm beginning to get independence and at the end of this year have the chance to tour Japan through my schools music program. I do all the co-curriculars -  sport, debate, mock trial.

But when I'm at home none of that matters or means anything good to me. I'm a tryhard with no proper social interaction. My mum drinks so I spend my time avoiding her, but what can I complain about when she and dad worked so hard to send me to a good school?  And how can I reason with her when really I'm just talking to a bottle of wine each night. She's unreasonable and blames me for her shortcomings. When I try to talk to her, to tell her i need some love, she gets angry and confrontational and says that I'm just calling her an alcoholic and that I should be grateful for her. She blames me for her issues and says I'm at fault not her. 

I am. I really am. I shouldn't be depressed. I'm a white kid in Australia at a private school with parents who don't get along the best but at least live in the same house. I get straight As.

If all this isn't enough, then I have no more left to give. Its not worth destroying myself if the only response is an extra bottle of wine she drinks in celebration. Why should I keep trying at all?
