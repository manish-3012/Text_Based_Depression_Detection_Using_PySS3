I don't even know what I want.I want no one to know me so I can kill myself without causing pain.  But I like knowing that I'm cared about even when my mind is like this.  It's so painful.  I don't want to live.  I don't know what I want.  There have been so many times when the only thing that saved me is the fact that people would be hurt if I died, and I don't know how many more times that will save me and prevent their pain.
