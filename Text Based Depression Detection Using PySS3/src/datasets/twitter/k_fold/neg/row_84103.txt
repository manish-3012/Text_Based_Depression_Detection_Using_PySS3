Everyday gets harder.. I just want things to stop..Im 25 i take care of both my mom n grandma..I help with bills.. I work 60 hours every week. Iâ€™m currently dealing with bankruptcy due to opening credit cards to help my family and I signed my name on my cousins loan to help fix his transmission.. he stopped paying.. I guess u could say I have friends but I donâ€™t really talk to anyone consistently.. I have a boyfriend but I feel like Iâ€™m just a burden to him.. weâ€™re an hour apart every other weekend we spend a day or two together. I bought a PS4 to play with him n weâ€™ve played it a few times.. but he has his friends so I try not to bother him too much. I just hate being on my own so much. I grew up alone. My parents never let me outside after my dad and granddad died. I wanted to move closer to my bf so I could see him more. But Iâ€™m worried that my mom n grandmom wouldnt b able to survive on their own. Theyâ€™re constantly sick or in the hospital... I really need the space my mental health is degrading every single day.. but my mom doesnâ€™t want me to leave or my gma...Iâ€™d like to quit my job so Iâ€™d have more time to paint and work on my business but itâ€™s a bit of a gamble. Iâ€™m at a loss.. Iâ€™m tired.. I donâ€™t have anyone to turn to. All I do is work sleep repeat. I feel like no one wants to be around me. Iâ€™ve naturally grown into being a loner but I wish there was At least one person I could be around. like I said I feel like a burden to my bf.. he has his friends. He loves having his guys time. I try not to pester him too much. I just wish I could have that companionship with someone. I wish my life could be easier.. as Iâ€™m sure we all do. Iâ€™m just tired of bleeding for everyone. Iâ€™m tired of having to give up my own happiness for everyone. But idk how to be selfish. idk what to do. I really just want to give up but I donâ€™t have the spine for it. In turn Iâ€™ve grown to hate my life...
