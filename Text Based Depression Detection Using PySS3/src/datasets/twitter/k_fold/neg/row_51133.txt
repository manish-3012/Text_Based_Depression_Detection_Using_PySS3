I dont know what to do anymore if someone wants to listenI am 18 years old and a huge list of mental problems. Ive been hospitalized twice for drug overdose within the last year and have just stacked more and more shit on my fucking life. My story is long but I have to tell it. 

I'm a pathological liar, narcissist, possible sociopath and much more.. Ive gotten expelled from school for beating a woman for no reason and I got away from 5 years of prison because I was deemed unstavle after my drug overdose shortly after. I dont know how or why I'm allowed to walk among the general public. I have horrible self confidence issues and no friends, I spend all fucking day on my computer unemployed just pretending that I'm happy. Ive blown through rehab, therapy and many other services over the years and I'm overall just fucking finished with the mental healthcare here in north america. I'm also fucking crazy, as in I think I have schizophrenia. I believe insane shit anr implement it into my daily life, I mean maybe its real but I dont know wether to trust the stupid fucking norm we call reality or my ideation and spiritual studies. I'm also super insecure and dont like taking part in non manly activities due to my insecurities. I neglect my family because I have this image in my head that I should be this super cool rockstar or mafia man for some fucking reason and I cant just accept myself because my stupid fucking biological father.

Here I am, 1 am on a Saturday night balling my eyes out in my bathroom for no fucking reason, thinking about mortality and shit and how my family will one day fucking DIE. 

Oh and I just lost my best friend of 4 years because I made up a story about being 30 and made some werid plot that I acted out in real life. He was scared and blocked me without a trace and I'm not even gonna try to save the friendship because I'm so worried about my ego.

So what do I do what should I have happen guys
