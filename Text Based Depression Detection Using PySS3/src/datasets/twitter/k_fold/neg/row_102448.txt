Incompatible with lifeI feel this way everytime I lay down and reflect on life, that I wasn't made for this. The idea of continuing life and becoming an adult is just so unappealing to me, I feel so empty all the time despite all my anxieties and worry.  
  
I've thought about suicide a lot, now it wouldn't be a question if people wouldn't miss me, but since people would it's just really hard to do. I guess that's good ultimately, just thought it was worth mentioning. I'm in uni right now and have a few assignments coming up, I feel capable of doing them but for some reason I just can't see the end of this year coming true, that I'm gonna be perpetually stuck in this moment, waiting here. I dunno.  
  
I wish I could have some clarity and enjoy life. I've taken quite a few days off uni but, I might take tomorrow off too. Or maybe not, I dunno. I've thought about self harm a lot more often. Life just sucks and I wish I could cry instead of being so empty.
