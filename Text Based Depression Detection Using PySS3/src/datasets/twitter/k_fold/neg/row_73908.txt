I just can't do it anymoreI'm such a different person since my stroke. I don't know who I am. I can't control a lot of my thoughts, feelings, or sometimes actions. I've lost all connections. I've lost all my friends.

My husband and I are struggling hard. We frequently tell each other we can't keep going like this.

I know I'm going to drink soon despite being a week from a year of sobriety. I'm at Rock bottom. I wish I had a reason to live. One more thing. Just one more and I'm giving up. I wish I could get the help I need but I don't even know what that means anymore. I'm so lost. I'm so exhausted. I miss who I used to be and I can't get back there. I don't want to accept me as I am but my brain is just... different.

I don't want to be like this anymore.
