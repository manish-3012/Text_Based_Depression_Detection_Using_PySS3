goodbyegoodnight.

i want to die while i'm peaceful, yes i feel pain but i know in the future it'll be much greater and i won't be able to handle it. 

i want to die while i still know i'm still loved and although i know that'll be painful for them, i feel more prepared.. knowing i'm cared for and not forgotten.

so i'm sorry, brother, friends, myself but tonight i must say goodbye.
