Gonna just let my health go to shit and dieAt 28 I was the most healthy guy.  Always in good shape.  After suffering from depression for years at 31, my health is deteriorating.  My blood pressure is through the roof and Iâ€™m not sure why.  It could be that I eat anything unhealthy I see.  Iâ€™m still in good shape but my body inside is falling apart.  I wake up with headaches everyday.  I have panic attacks every few days where it feels like Iâ€ll have a heart attack. 

My plan is to just treat my body like shit until I die.  Eat fast food everyday, all day and drink loads of energy drinks.  I donâ€™t drink alcohol or smoke but food has always been comfort.  I pray Iâ€™ll have a heart attack soon.
