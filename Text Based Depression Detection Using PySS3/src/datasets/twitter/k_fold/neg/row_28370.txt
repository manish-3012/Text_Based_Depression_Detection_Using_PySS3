Withdrawn for over 24 hours now.My career is a horrible mess. I had everything going for me, got a full ride to a good university. But I ruined it by majoring in something I didn't really like/care about, did poorly, and for the last four years have been working in awful admin and receptionist jobs.

I'd been working desperately to get out of this rut. I applied to different grad schools but was rejected from everything. I finally gave up on my last admin job because I wasn't even able to even be half decent at it. I quit and applied for a job that I actually wanted, but was rejected from it.

I feel so hopeless. I can't get into grad school to move up in life. I got rejected from design school as well.

I feel completely hopeless. No job, school doesn't work. I'm 28 years old and feel like the biggest loser. All I can see is that I'll be 36, unmarried, in financial termoil, no friends, and continuing to toil away unsuccessfully at impossible "big dreams" that will never be realized.

All my friends from high school are in medical school, law school, or are in successful professional careers.

I don't know what to do. I just want to have a career. 

The only two options I have are suicide or continuing down this path of failure. The universe hates me, I've always known this. Even when I changed my mentality I still wasn't successful.
