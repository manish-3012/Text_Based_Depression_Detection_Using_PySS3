I started thinking about writing my suicide letter.I've been feeling horribly for quite a while now. Five, maybe six years. I feel like i don't matter to anyone and when I kill myself nobody will me affected by it in a long run. Of course my parents will be sad for like a week or two but they will move on with their lives. My brother will have to explain to his young daughter what suicide is and why people do it. Maybe my class head-teacher will give  a small talk but nobody in the class will give a damn shit about it. If I write this letter I will apologise for my miserble existance and how I've let everyone down. How I did everything in my power to turn everyone against me even if it wasn't my intention. Yesterday I wrote a post on /r/Depresion in which I said that I would never kill myself because somewhere along the line of my life I might find meaning, after a sleepless night full of tears I think I've changed my mind.
