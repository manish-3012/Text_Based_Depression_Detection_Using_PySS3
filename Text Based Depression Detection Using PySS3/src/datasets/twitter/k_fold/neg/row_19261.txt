What is happening? Long post sorryI never thought i will end up like this. As long as i can remember i was a very happy guy, i never actually stay sad too long because i enjoyed life. This thing began about 6 months ago. I decided that i want to leave college because a want to pursuit my dreams. I was really happy about it. (i feel like i should say that i have a girlfriend that i know its the love of my life, a lot of friends who love me and a family that accepted that i needed a breake from college). The thing started that day. I was really thinking that i need to start raising money by working so i can move out and starting doing what i really want. Every job that i try was leaving me more and more devastated because i was feeling that this wasnt the life i choose. Working like that is the worst thing that i could imagine. I even promise to myself that i rather be dead than working on a regular job (i want to be a dota2 caster). When i quit the last job i try i told my parents crying that i was sorry for dissapointing them and i really want to start doing what i want... but it was too late. The day after i could get up my bed. Nothing that i can think make me happy. Nothing. I feel like i lost the ability to feel happiness... and its killing me... Today its my aniversary with my girlfriend.. and i just cant smile. Its the happiest momment of my life and i just cant feel good about it. Every day i just think about how i would preffer being dead than feeling this way. Im just sorry that my girlfriend and my family have to go through this. especially her. She decided to stay with me even now and all i can think about is how to kill myself without hurting her to the point of her emotional death. i just want to know what is wrong with me. why cant i keep an smile on my face.
