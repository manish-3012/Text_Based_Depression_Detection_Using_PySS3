please don't let me dieim just going to be as raw as I can because I don't know what else to do

I have this big lump in my leg which I don't know what it is, but suspect might be the sign of something really bad, and I'm so scared ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜– I don't wanna die rn, I still have to live because I still have to make music, my life is just not over yet, I have to make music, and I still have to do my weird stupid fetishes which I never did ( read my old posts if u wanna know what they're about, I'm not saying it here for the sake of keeping it sfw) but most importantly,

I NEED TO MAKE MUSIC

and I'm so fucking sorry to myself, oh my little prince I'm so sorry I never gave you what you wanted... I'm so sorry I always thought you were trash... I swear if i get better from this I will love you and give whatever it is that you want/deserve ... I love you so much, dear me.. I know you want to make music, and I know you want to tattoo yourself, and whatever else it is that you want. you do deserve those things, and you are a great person, since the day you were born. I still can remember when you first watched that weird movie when you were like, 3 years old or something, and the music in it was so beautiful that you were sure that it was the most beautiful thing in the universe at that time.. and how you thought in your young innocent mind that it would be the purpose of your whole existence somehow.. I'm so sorry my little prince... i love you so much, and so does music... and I will never let your magic die again
