At what point should I call a hotline?Hi,

I currently hate my life and am going through a very rough week. Iâ€™ve had weeks like this before and every time it just gets worse. 

During these times, I donâ€™t want to live, but I donâ€™t want to die either. I want to reach out to someone, but I donâ€™t want to be a bother. I will probably not kill myself, which makes me wonder if is should call a hotline then. 

Would I be taking up the hotlines resources, to divert them to someone who will not kill themselves. Would I be a selfish jackass then?
