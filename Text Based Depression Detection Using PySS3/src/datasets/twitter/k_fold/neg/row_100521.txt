Whats the point of living...Lately I just feel like my life is pointless... I have no friends I can count on and my relationship with my family is almost nonexistent... My grades are shit but I'm too depressed to do anything about it... I feel like I've ruined my life before it's even begun and there's no way I can fix it so what point is there to even try?
