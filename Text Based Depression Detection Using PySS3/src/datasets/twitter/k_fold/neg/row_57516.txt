17, Suicide etc.I am 17, and for various interpersonal reasons over my life and especially fairly recently I have decided to kill myself. I worry about how my family will react. I plan on using helium, but I have access to firearms. Infact, my father is a collector, but I know that using one of his would have them all seized and he has gone through a great deal of pain to keep them to begin with but that is another story.

I am kind of scared. I will fill up something with helium (the interior of the car maybe) and potentially be using some home made chloroform (1 part acetone, 5 parts bleach). So I guess I will just drift off, and that is what scares me just being completely out there. That is why I would prefer something quicker and more decisive like a gun or a guillotine.

I don't see life as much of a possibility anymore but I don't know what to do because I don't think I want to die
