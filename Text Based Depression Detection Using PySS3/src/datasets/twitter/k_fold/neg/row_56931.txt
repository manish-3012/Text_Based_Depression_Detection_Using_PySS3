Sick of all of this. This right here is exactly what makes me want to give up.I'm sick of people saying that my problems aren't that bad. Im sick of people saying to just love myself when I feel so unbearably alone. I absolutely hate those people. They make me feel even more alone and isolated. They just make everything worse. It seems whenever I talk about something usually someone says something that makes everything worse. So I'm done trusting people. I'm sick of being seen as weak because I can't be alone. I mean I feel like I do love myself. I just can't take being alone. I just don't want to be the only one to love myself. I want people to love and accept me for who I am. There's nothing wrong with me. I swear if I hear any more of this loving yourself bullshit and someone says that to me when I feel like I really need someone then I'm just gonna end it. All I hear when you say that is that other people get to be loved and I don't and that it's okay to treat me like an outcast and abandon and isolate me. All I hear is that I'm unworthy of love and caring from other people. I especially hate hearing this from those who have people and have someone to listen to them when I don't. Quit telling someone they're unworthy of love because of their struggles and quit saying that it's my fault for feeling like this because I won't change my way of thinking. I'm not gonna change my way of thinking. Maybe they're the ones who should change thier way of thinking. It shouldn't be considered weakness to want help and understanding.
