Is it weird that I sort of romanticise suicide in my head.....Like I daydream about it and think about it at night. But not in a pained way, not while in distress. Just calmly. I like the visual idea of me being in a hospital bed sending a Snapchat story out of me being there and alerting everyone on my social media that I tried to take my own life. I sort of idealise me being in that situation. But not me being dead- me having attempted but survived. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a thing of me wanting people to care about me or if Iâ€™m being weird. I sort of feel like a bad person for romanticising me being in that place. Maybe I think if I was really in that situation people would care about me, people would finally like me. That I would have to be living on the edge for people to show they value me. I daydream about being in a hospital bed or being in a psych ward, sending a snapchat of my hand with a drip taped to it or me crying. I imagine if I would get replies of people showing concern and that they care about me. I sort of want that to happen. Not to attempt suicide but to receive the care some (not all) people receive afterwards. I want people to know how much I am struggling. Maybe I think I would have to be in that place to speak up. To reach out for help and write on social media about it. Then maybe people would listen
