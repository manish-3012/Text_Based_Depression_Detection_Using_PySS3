I should have known I was better off not being here.My mentality has been "Stay alive so that you don't hurt the people who supposedly care about you". Ever since my last attempt went south three years ago, I've tried desperately to live by that. 

But I don't think I can do it anymore. Being alive is becoming more and more of a burden on one of the only people I truly care about. I've lost my will to live, to eat, to take care of myself...I should have already had a job. I've been living here long enough. And it isn't from a lack of trying, god only knows I've filled out as many applications as I could find. But nothing has panned out. Nothing.

I feel like being dead will relieve the financial burden that I have become. I just can't do this anymore, I'm hurting people more by being alive at this point. I keep fantasizing about jumping from the balcony I stand on every night. I wish I had the courage to do it already.

What 22 year old has never had a job? I feel like I'm some kind of rare species of stupid. There are people less educated then me, poorer then me that can get and hold down a job. But I can't? I clearly shouldn't bother living if I can't do such a simple task. 

I give up. This is too much for me. I can't do this.
