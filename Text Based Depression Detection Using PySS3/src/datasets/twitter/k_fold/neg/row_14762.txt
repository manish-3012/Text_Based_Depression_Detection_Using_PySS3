I'm terrified of what i am going to try againIv have been trying to write this for the past 14 hours and each time I get worried or distracted to brake down and curl up, last night my first real relationship ended, I am gay and 19, it wasn't bad and my boyfriend explained why and that he didn't want to hurt me.

But since I was 13 I have suffered with depression, self harm and suicidal attempts, I have recently been placed under eve more pressure with university, college and general mental health, my relationship was only 2 months but it was still the best iv had ande he was the only person to ever make me feel loved and I have not sexually active with.

With all the stress I have and that will only get worse in the next 3 months, with my boyfriend braking up with me I am terrified I will try to end my life a 3rd time, there's nothing in my city Ti do I find interesting so don't tell me to look I have most my life I have there's nothing, no one in college gose out they just dint there all loners who stay in there rooms.

I go to furry meets once a month and that's where I met my boyfriend, no one there lives close to my city as its in Birmingham.

I am honestly terrified, I'm getting more unstable and this has only speeded up my problems.

P.s. Iv had "help" via the NHS but it was just talking no meds no real help and just made it worse and I ended up just ignoring everything the women said as she didn't do anything
