My cat is extremely sick...this sucks. :/My poor Ginger-cat was very sickly this morning when I got up. She would hardly move or respond to me. I called the vet about an hour ago and I have an appointment this afternoon.

Man...this sucks. A lot. I know it's kind of pathetic but that cat is one of the few things that gives me legitimate happiness in this life.

Everything bad always either happens around the holidays or around my birthday. Fuck this.
