I really want a reason not toI don't care about attention. I'm a failure, I live with my parents yet I'm in my twenties. I feel as though I'm a burden. I know I will inflict pain if I end it, yet I know I inflict pain simply being. I've been suicidal literally since I can remember. I feel like ending it will hurt at first yet it will overall benefit my family. Shit I don't even know what I'm asking here really. I guess I'm just trying to justify it
