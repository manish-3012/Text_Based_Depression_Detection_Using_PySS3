Good Luck and God SpeedIt may not be tonight, it may not be tomorrow but it's coming soon. I have suffered so much over the years over the years, but I'm a good person, I feel I have justify it, have spent 1000s of hours volunteering for free at schools, youth centres and food banks. All whilst I have a job where I lose money every month, I can't even provide for my little girl every month.

I see her fornightly and it was the first time she didn't call me daddy she came to greet me.

I only live for my daughter these days, she's the only reason I keep going but after today I feel like for her it's best to step off this mortal coil , I've reached the end of the road and I don't have the energy to carry on. UK male 32 years old. Good luck to you all and God Speed.
