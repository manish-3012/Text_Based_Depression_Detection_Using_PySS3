Lifes too hardI want to kill myself tonight. And last Friday. And often. I don't know how to handle myself, my thoughts, my emotions. I don't know any person close enough to tell my thoughts too so I'm vomiting here. My girlfriend and I broke up a year ago and she's dating a once great friend of mine. It's been a year, but it's built-up into something terrible. I frequently get sleep paralysis and suffer delusions of demons and malicious agents suppressing me. I used to always have my girlfriend near and she would hold me and ground me. I had one recently and she wasn't there and I had nothing to keep me grounded in reality. It lasted longer than any delusion I've ever had. I'm scared to sleep and I'm scared to wake up. My friend recently quit his PhD and I was so scared of another attack that I stayed up for 48 hours. I make plenty at my job but I'm broke because I spend more than I make to make myself feel better. My thereapist quit recently so she's not even there. I'm alone and despise myself. I overeat and watch TV for hours then show up hours late for work. I hid it all. I smile around my co-workers who are the only humans I see anymore. The thing is, life should be going well for me. I know plenty of money. I got accepted to multiple graduate schools and a NASA internship this summer. Everything points to me having a good life but I hate myself. I hate it all. I work in a lab with chloroform and phenol and acid. I have sleeping pills at home. I own a gun. I live alone. No one would know for weeks. I want the delusions to end. I want my ex out of my head. I want it gone.
