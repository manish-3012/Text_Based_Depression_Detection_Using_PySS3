Just a story I wanted to tell.Yesterday my sister tried to kill herself. 
I was at work and my wife called me from home. I couldn't understand a word she was saying, but she said she found my sister in her room with her wrists and neck cut. I work construction with both of my parents and my other sister. I told them both and we left as fast as we could. The whole ride home I thought I was going to see my sister lying in bed dead. I kept thinking about her kids and what was going to happen to them. We finally arrived at my house after what felt like the longest drive of my life. I ran inside of the house. My wife and 2 year old daughter were crying and screaming. I went inside the room and saw my sister in her bed with blood over her shirt and all over the bed. My parents ran in behind and started crying. I rushed over to her and talking to her all the while my mom was holding her face begging her to stay with us. My dad kept talking, tell her that this isn't the way. I was so scared. I've never been this scared in my life. I didn't know what to do. My wife had called the ambulance right after she called me from work. It felt like they were taking so long. I kept talking to her telling her to stay with us. All she kept saying is how happy she felt that it was going to be over. I had so much adrenaline pumping through my body. I noticed every detail. There wasn't as much blood as I would have expected. I knew in that moment that she was going to be okay. 

She's doing okay now. She got admitted to the hospital yesterday and is in treatment. I'm so happy that I have another chance to be with my sister. I hope no one ever has to go through what we went through that day. 
I just wanted to write this out. I wish every one of you good luck.
