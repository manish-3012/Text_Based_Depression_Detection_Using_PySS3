I think about suicide every dayI'm anti-social with no close friends locally.
I've been going to therapy for many years and am on medication.
Years later, I'm still crushed by my divorce. I cannot trust again.
I work to pay my bills. It does not inspire or motivate me.
I don't have any hobbies. I'm not interested in much.
I take klonopin to get high; not to combat my anxiety. 
I'm very lonely.
I do not like this world: politics &amp; social media have made me hate the human race.
I have an unhealthy view of women from reading hundreds of shallow online dating profiles over the years.

I'm so tired of it all. I don't want to feel or worry anymore. I want to release all the pain that I've compiled over the years. I want some peace.
