My GP is urging me to go to a hospital and check in with the ER.So recently I've become very suicidal and the few people I've told have told me to check into my local hospital and tell them, now my GP has done the same.  In fact, (he's a nurse practitioner) he brought in the head doctor of the clinic who flat out told me when I said no that "do you want us to call the cops to escort you?".  I was physically shaking and sick and I guess it gave them enough sympathy to let me go, I told them I'd think about it.  My GP then called me hours later and asked me to please check myself in, I again said I'd think about it.  Now I'm scared that any minute now cops will come over and drag me out of my apartment.

Ironically, all this has only made me more suicidal.  I have no idea what I'm going to do.
