There's no point because no one caresI simply can't see much of a point in continuing to exist. 

Every day is exactly the same - wake up, gym, go to work, come home, deal with crushing loneliness until bedtime.

I have a couple people I could call friends but I don't truly believe they give more than a passing shit. I've never been the person who people contact to chat to, i'm always the one initiating, and sometimes I don't even get a reply - i'm sure it isn't malicious, but it does hurt when I know my friends are messaging other people and I don't get a reply.

The only two people I believe really care are my parents. Once they go, I swear i'm fucking done. 

I worry so much about losing touch with friends and being left completely alone and i'm sure it's going to happen. Every time I've got close to someone we drift apart - I feel like it's going to happen again soon and i'm going to lose the closest mate i've had in years due to simply drifting apart. 

I can't take the loneliness. I just can't handle it at all. I don't feel like i'm living for anything at all. I've achieved a good paying job and a mortgage and for what? Somewhere warm to feel isolated and cripplingly alone in. Nice. 

Everyone else has so much going on in their lives and so many friends and I just feel always left out and put on the sidelines. 

Some of the closest friends i've had in my life are now just pictures and names on a Facebook profile. And I hate it. It's happening again now and I've just given up. Perhaps I wasn't ever supposed to have friends. 

I'm just so, so lonely and tired of going through the motions every day.
