I can't take it anymore...and I have no doubts this time.I posted here a few days ago..and I left with a positive attitude..but things are just not working out for me. There are times when I'm so high on life that I can't contain myself...but shortly after that follows a long period of time where I just want to die. I can't stand the transition...it crushes me. I have no one to talk to...my friends don't understand me and I don't think my boyfriend likes me anymore. 
I'm a worthless piece of shit and there is noting I can seem to do about it. I'm planning to kill myself as soon as I get the chance.

I don't know if posting here will do me any good...but this is more or less the only place where I can talk without having to hold back.
Thank you for taking out the time to read this.
