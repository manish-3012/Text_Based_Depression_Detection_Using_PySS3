i want to kill myself because i'm transbeing a trans girl who didn't transition when they were younger is literally the worst thing on the planet. i can't get on hrt because there's no gender affirming psychiatrists in the area, every psychiatrist and therapist i've had has laughed at me and told me i'm making it up when i told them i'm trans, and i'm so insecure that every step i take to try and be more feminine just results in me having a breakdown because i know i'll never look as feminine as someone born female. i'm so done. it feels like the only solution i have to my dysphoria is suicide and i'm getting real fucking close to pulling the trigger. to top it all off i have asd so communicating with other people and making long lasting relationships is literally impossible for me. god made a mistake when he created me. i should probably fix it soon. i'm so tired feeling like i'm living in a stranger's body.
