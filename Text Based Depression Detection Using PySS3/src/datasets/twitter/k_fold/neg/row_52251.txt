whats the point?it's all bs. i want to end my life, i don't want to wake up tomorrow. its as simple as downing a bottle of pills, or cutting deep enough into my wrist to die. you randoms don't care, i barely care. my girlfriend cheated on me, dumped me, is fucking another guy. i got drunk, and then i was alone, and then she came over for a minute and then im an asshole and my wrist is bleeding but im too pussy to go deep enough. what is the point in anything? life? can't get a decent job. can't get a decent girlfriend. can't make a decent living. can't be happy. she made me happy, until she found someone else. now i still love her, and this subreddit won't make me happier. i don't want to exist. what the fuck is the point.
