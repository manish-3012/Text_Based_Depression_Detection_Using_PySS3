I've been used as a pawn in my parents divorceI am a 17 year old male and my parents split up around 2 and a half years ago, and my life has been nothing but shit since then. My mental health has kept getting worse and nothing seems to be improving.

I only found out recently that for 2 years in court, I have been completely used by both parents to try and get more money from each other, and because solicitor fees are so high, they now both are struggling for money. I am being made to leave my childhood home and it is looking like we have nowhere to move to. 

The parent that lost the court battle now is not speaking to me, and I have lost half of my family. 

I think it has got to a point where it is easier to just give up.
