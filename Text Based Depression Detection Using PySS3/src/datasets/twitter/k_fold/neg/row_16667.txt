Is there even a point anymore?I just donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m needed.

I guess I shouldnâ€™t be here because I know that Iâ€™m not going to commit suicide. But I feel like itâ€™s the best and easiest way out...

I have an F in almost all my school classes because I canâ€™t get myself to turn assignments in. So now my teachers donâ€™t bother to even consider trying to help me at this point. Like I mean, when I donâ€™t turn something in, they donâ€™t even waste their breath trying to get me to turn it in. And maybe because Iâ€™m that much of an failure that the people meant to look after me arenâ€™t even going to look after me anymore.

My dad is pretty abusive, itâ€™s better, but itâ€™s like this every time and I just know he is going to get mad at me again because I failed to put bags in the trash can again, for the hundredth time. I feel like he doesnâ€™t want me around. Like he just wants me to do what he says to do. He has practically taken over my life. Iâ€™m not even allowed to choose my high school classes anymore. (Also I know your all thinking, a belt or slap isnâ€™t abuse, yeah but this is tearing out dishwasher full of ceramic plates and metal silverware ~including knives~ and throwing it at me) 

My girlfriend kind of seems like she doesnâ€™t want to be with me anymore and I think Iâ€™m being a burden to her by just constantly following her around. (But I do because I love her and want to be with her every moment) 

Edit: With all this quarantine it makes me worry, she is my top priority to everything and she doesnâ€™t have a phone. I miss her, a lot.

My friends donâ€™t respond when I text them and they seem to ignore me up until they need me to help them with their classes. Then they donâ€™t respond to me when I talk to them, they are more obsessed with eachother than they are with me. Iâ€™m just dead weight to them. Right? I mean who would enjoy spending time with me anyway, maybe my girlfriend just because I let her get away with anything. 

Thatâ€™s what it is, I have to let people bully me and use me. Thatâ€™s what drives the fact that Iâ€™m not needed, that they donâ€™t care, they rather eat shit than talk to me, even though I would die for them.

Iâ€™m a boyscout and Iâ€™ve almost made eagle, but for what? A free rank in the military? Some extra credit? It doesnâ€™t matter because we all die someday. I wasted this time, advancing through the cub ranks, getting to life scout. Now all I have to do is build something and order people around, and for just a little â€œqualificationâ€ on a job.

I know Iâ€™m not going to be killing myself. But really it feels like Iâ€™m not wanted, or needed. Plus Iâ€™m a burden to everyone around me. Iâ€™m looked down on and eventually Iâ€™m going to die anyway so why not just skip to the finale.

TL;DR: Iâ€™m not killing myself but itâ€™s the smart thing to do because Iâ€™m a burden to everyone I come into contact with.
