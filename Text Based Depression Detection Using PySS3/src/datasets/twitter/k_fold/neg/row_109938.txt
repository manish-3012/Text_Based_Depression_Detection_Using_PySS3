Iâ€™m about to finish university, but I donâ€™t think I have the strength to go on.I completely failed my previous semester, &amp; now I gotta take more classes than I shouldâ€™ve. Iâ€™m going on my 3rd attempt in one class already because Iâ€™ve dropped it twice. 

Iâ€™m at my whits end. I hated my time in university b/c I was afraid &amp; unwilling to make friends or try new things. I was jealous of everyone I knew who had a great time. I hate my major &amp; I still donâ€™t know what I want in life. 

I. want. to. give. up. Iâ€™ve already isolated myself from my family; I donâ€™t talk to them much as I used to, mainly b/c Iâ€™ve changed my opinion on many things. My life will be much worse if I go through this, I just know it.
