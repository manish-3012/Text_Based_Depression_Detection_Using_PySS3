So I don't have friends.I have never had any real friends, to most people I am a happy person. Only a hand full know that I have tried in the past to kill myself. I thought I was past that until tonight. Yesterday was the last day of the term for the community college I am going to. This meant saying goodbye to the only person I have ever connected with. She is going to another Uni a couple states away. I feel like I can't see any reason to live without someone there, and I feel like I should not feel like this, that I am not normal. This makes it worse. I don't have anyone to talk to. And I don't see why I should keep going.
Edit: I think I can get through this, thank you all for the kind words. Last night was one of the worst I have had in a good long while. Things seem brighter today (if only slightly).
