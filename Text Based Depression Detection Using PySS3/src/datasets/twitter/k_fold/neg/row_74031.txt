Met a girl, she says she's suicidal and she cuts. I already am feeling the guilt and I don't even know where she lives. I need helpI met a girl on omegal while my friends and I were just messing around. Got to her, she said she wanted my snapchat and I gave it to her. I had no intentions other than to just talk, I assumed I would delete her in a day or two. The first thing she sends me is "you're cute" which hit me hard because I have had so much trouble with body image and relationships in general, mainly because I was never in one. I didn't delete her. She sent me a picture of herself with the caption "suicide?" with a gun and knife emoji. I immediately messaged her and asked her if she was suicidal. I told her she could trust me and it will never change my view of her. She told me she is suicidal and she cuts herself. I got her to send me her full name (I don't know if it's real or not) and I think I found her facebook profile. I've messaged 5 people who liked her photo that all go to the same highschool to see if they know anything about her. The problem is that this highschool is in the UK. I live in the US. I can't make international calls so I called the national suicide prevention hotline and they said that they can't do much without the information and I should try to contact anyone who knows her. I already have a knot in my stomach about the whole situation and I'm afraid she might do it. I don't know what to do if there is anything to do. sorry if this was the wrong kind of thing to post in this subreddit.

tldr; met a girl on omegal, she's suicidal and cuts herself. I don't know what to do about it and the suicide prevention hotline said they cant do anything. I'm starting to feel guilty already.
