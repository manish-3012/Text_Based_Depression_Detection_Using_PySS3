Low of lowsI live less than 1/2 a mile away from a busy highway and am currently walking there. Iâ€™m going to wait on the shoulder until I see a big rig coming and walk out. 

It will be quick and painless. 

This doesnâ€™t make me selfish.

Iâ€™m finally doing something for me. My family and friends will never understand, but Iâ€™m taking control of my life after 31 years. 

Invest in your mental health, itâ€™s worth more than any stock. I wish I knew that earlier.
