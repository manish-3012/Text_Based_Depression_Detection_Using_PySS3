Beware of "Concerned" Users who hit you up on RedditA while ago I posted here about me being thin. Then a user hit my inbox and asked me if I could sent him photos of my body so he could check if I have anorexia. Long story short, I did send him photos of my body including my chest and butt. However he asked a photo of my most private part. I resisted when he asked for my butt photos. He kept insisting then I told him to stop. 

He threatened me that if I don't send him more photos, he would share them online.

He claimed to be a medical student in 5th year. 

Please beware.
