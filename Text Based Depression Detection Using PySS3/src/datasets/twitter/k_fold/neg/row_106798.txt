Hope will be my silent killerSome context here: this is about relationships and loneliness.

I don't consider myself a stranger to rejection. It does not bother ma that much by itself. However, I tend to easily get hopefull whenever I meet someone and start talking a lot with them. Hopefull that it might be the beginning of the end of my loneliness. So far (a dozen years if we are counting), that's all it have been, hope followed by rejection.

I really hate that word, hope, if I knew how, I'd carve it out of my skull in a heartbeat.

As I kid I tried to develop a system to prevent me from being hopefull. Everytimeif would see the color red (which is not so common), I would recite myself a mantra along the lines of "this will not work out, you'll still be alone after this", in the hope (and the irony isn't lost on me, as that "system" never worked) that I wouldn't get my hopes up whenever I met someone, and not be hurt that much by the rejection that would inevitably follow.

Last iteration, which was a couple months ago, I very distinctly remember feeling hopefull, and being weary of it at the same time. Cue sucker punch.

One day I will kill myself, I cannot imagine another end. But it won't be because of loneliness. It will be because I have been hopefull one time too many.
