I know sheâ€™s gonna move on and itâ€™s for the betterIf I kill myself tonight my gf will realize our relationship wasnâ€™t that great and was probably toxic asf. Sheâ€™ll move on and find someone better than me and I doubt sheâ€™ll miss me as soon as three years later. Iâ€™m doing her a favor honestly. I donâ€™t buy that theyâ€™ll miss you forever when youâ€™re gone cause time and distance makes people change their mind about everything. The thought that Iâ€™ll hurt people in my life has officially become not true to me.
