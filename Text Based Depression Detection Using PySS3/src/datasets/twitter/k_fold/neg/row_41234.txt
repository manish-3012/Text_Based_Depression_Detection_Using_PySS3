Feel like I messed up and can't go backI didn't have many friends in school. Maybe 1-2 who were close to me and when they left, we lost touch but then they were replaced with another group. I was never alone, but I always felt lonely and not understood. 
I had a great time in Undergrad, and I have maybe 9-10 close friends from those days. 
Then I left for grad school, far far away.  
And I kind of fell for a classmate pretty early on, and it was the first time either of us had been in a relationship (we're from a conservative country, and we were away from home for the first time). While this was all fun and games we ended up spending all our time together, so I made 0 friends in grad school and lost touch with all my under grad friends as well. Now we left and broke up and I woke up from my almost 2 year stupor and realized I don't have any friends anymore. I drove away all my pre grad school friends . I didn't make any friends in grad school. I literally just talk to my colleagues at work and that's the extend of my social interactions. The weekend reminds me of how lonely I am. I just feel so stupid. And lonely. And filled with regret. 

And I'm super shy and introverted thanks to a conservative, religious upbringing. I feel like I'm unworthy to be loved or even cared about. 

The last few times I've had these thoughts I try to reach out to someone and have a little chat. It's worked sometimes but mostly I just feel lonely. Oppressed. No one listens to me. No one cares if I'm here or not. 

I just want someone to care. 

I just feel so alone, and I'm scared of living alone for the rest of my life.
