I don't know what to doA friend of mine that I met online is contemplating suicide. She lives states away, and I only know what city she lives in. I only have a first name. Right now I'm just trying to encourage her to hold on and seek help, but I don't think I'm doing enough. Part of me thinks I should call the cops in her area, but I don't *know* her area, her full name, or address. I feel so helpless.
