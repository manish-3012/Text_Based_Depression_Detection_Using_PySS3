Havenâ€™t felt this close to it in a whileHello everyone. Hope youâ€™re well.

There have been a lot of little things going on recently and I just donâ€™t think I can hang. I want it to be finished so so so badly. I donâ€™t see a reason to keep going.

My girlfriend just broke up with me. I gave her my everything and really tried to love her as best I could. But apparently that meant nothing. She first broke up with me telling me she wanted to marry me and just had some mental health issues to work through. Then, she cut me out of her life when I checked in on her because I was worried. She told me she ended things and that she no longer wanted me in her life. She then told everybody in her life how great she was doing.

Even her brother whoâ€™s my best friend feels that I was really screwed over. So, how fucking worthless must I have been for her to just throw me away? Or how absolutely stupid am I to still be dead worried about her and missing her?

Now Iâ€™m just sad and a complete burden to my family and friends. My computer just died so I canâ€™t do any architecture school work or anything and Iâ€™ll be screwed in school anyways. 

She also texted me the other day offering to talk and all my feelings flooded back but I canâ€™t talk to her because I know sheâ€™s just gonna break me more.

I really donâ€™t see the point right now. I know itâ€™s all dumb petty shit. But, Iâ€™m really just so tired.
