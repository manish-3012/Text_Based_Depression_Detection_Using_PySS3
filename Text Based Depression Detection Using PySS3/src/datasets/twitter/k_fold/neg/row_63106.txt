i feel dead.i was supposed to kill myself on april 1st, 2017, and ever since that day passed i feel dead. i wish i could've done it, but my parents found out about it, and supervised me the whole day. i can't kill myself on april 1st of this year either--it's easter, i can't ruin easter for everyone. i just wish i were actually dead, because feeling like your dead isn't exactly fucking fun.
