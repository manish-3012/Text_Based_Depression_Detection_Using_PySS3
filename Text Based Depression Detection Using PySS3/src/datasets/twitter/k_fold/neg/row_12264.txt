Need some advice (post suicide attempt)It's been three weeks since I attempted, told my parents almost two days after my failed attempt.

I'm telling you all asking for help feels so good (if you are thinking of attempting, ask for help. it might not feel the best way right now but trust me asking help is the one thing you need.)

anyways I'm here for advice about something else.

Since I told my parents, slowly my family (cousins, uncle) started asking questions, now I know that they all care about me and want my best, but every time that I answer these questions, it is like a mini experience of that day when I almost died.

What do you suggest I should do?
