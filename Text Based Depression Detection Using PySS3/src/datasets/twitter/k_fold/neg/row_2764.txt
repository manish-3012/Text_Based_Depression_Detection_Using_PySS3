I was creepyI had a crush in 8th grade. Iâ€™m in 9th now. I still really like him. But. I was creepy. I realize that now.  I homeschooled until I went to 8th grade in public school where I had a blast and met my first crush. God I wish I could say it wasnâ€™t a shit show. Homeschooling literally did not prepare me for what I was experiencing for the first time and I RUINED a potentially amazing relationship. God I wish I could redo it. I was so toxic when I first joined the middle school because no one ever showed me that those behaviors were wrong. I wish I could redo everything. But I canâ€™t. I know this isnâ€™t that big of a deal but to me it is. Itâ€™s literally tearing me apart I canâ€™t even focus on school and I was so creepy about it why canâ€™t I just be a normal fucking human. WHY COULDNT I HAVE DONE PUBLIC SCHOOL FROM THE START I WILL NEVER BE ON THE SAME SOCIAL LEVEL OF MY PEIRS BECAUSE O STARTED 13 YEARS LATE FUCKKKKK AND NOW WITH COVID AND EVERYTHING ELSE THATS FUCKING HAPPNEED IVE BEEN FORCED TO SPEND 8 GOD FORSAKEN MONTHS WITH MY FAMILY WHO THINKS IM JUTS AN UNTRUSTWORTHY PIECE OF SHIT!!! IM FUCKING TIRED. SCHOOL IS OVERWHELMING AND I CANT DO IT ANYMORE. PLEASE JUST KILL ME
