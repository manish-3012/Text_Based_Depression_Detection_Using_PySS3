Iâ€™ve decidedIâ€™ve decided the day Iâ€™m going to kill myself if things donâ€™t get better. Iâ€™ve always had an inkling but today I snapped and put a timer in my phone. Maybe Iâ€™ll forget and this will be a fleeting memory, but Iâ€™ve been up this creek so many times that Iâ€™ve come numb to the idea of taking my own life. Recently I saw a video about someone who had survived his attempt, and he said â€œIâ€™d never thought of suicide before.â€ It made me wonder, there are just some lucky people out there who couldnâ€™t even fathom the thought. I envy them. Wish I could be like them. Wish I could change and be better, but Iâ€™m too stubborn and Iâ€™ve lived my life as an evil person this long, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be able to recognize myself if I actually started to show I care. Deep down I do, but I canâ€™t show it, because if I lose someone else I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do.
