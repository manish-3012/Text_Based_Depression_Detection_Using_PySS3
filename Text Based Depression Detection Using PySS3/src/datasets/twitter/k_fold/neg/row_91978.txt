Psychedelics and depression?Has anyone here used psychedelics and had it have a positive impact on their mental health? I'm planning on dropping some acid and hoping I maybe gain some new perspective or motivation in life as I've been severely suicidal and antisocial for about half a year now. And yes I have done acid before and I know its not some kind of  miracle drug. Just wondering if you guys have any positive stories about changing behavior through psychedelic drugs
