My ramblings about my life.\[Note:I am not on drugs or anything.\]

I don't know what i am anymore. I don't know why i exist? I am living like leech, a pathetic ,coward, worthless, jobless, penniless, ugly, disgusting existence. I never bothered myself to make friends, so i have none.  I don't honestly want to live anymore. 

I was religious and believed everything. **I understood the reason, that i became like leech is the fault of religion. I had spend all my damn childhood and teenage years on god and religion**. **Religion is far worse than drugs or anything out there. Why the f\*\*k is it not banned and its costs hell lot more than any drugs.**

My parents is addicted to religion and spends a lot of money on it. I am afraid to open their minds because i don't know, what if, they become like me.

I don't even understand why the hell do the parents make children. Why the f\*\*k was i even made. I didn't even ask  to  be made.  These all damn parents made children for their personal crap. I hate everything.

*\[ I know we are  like A.I, our personality to everything(likes to dislikes) is decided by what we learn and how we learn from birth to adulthood\]*

**I wonder, if it is the side effect of intelligence that causes suicide. Either way i know death is inevitable. I wonder what would happen if animals got intelligence, will they commit suicide. What if A.I got intelligence, will it commit suicide. Why the hell did hypothetical god didn't commit suicide. I don't even understand how the hell did god became intelligent when there was nothing around him/her ?**

*\[I know no one knows the answer\]*

What the f\*\*k is life ?

Drugs can alter state of mind. It can make one mad or sorrow or happy. So what are we ? We look like some software ?

I know i am not special. I know my life serves no meaning. I just can't take it anymore. I feel like i have bipolar disorder. I can't learn anything anymore. I feel like its pointless to go on. I want everything about my life to end.

**I know this is one and only one life i have. There is no after crap. I know all species lives are same. No one's life is above anyone. We make stuff up so to continue living a lie that we are special ?? We only want to live if we have some desires. I don't have any from the beginning.**

**I know how to overcome what i am having, but i don't know why should i bother. What's the whole damn point in continuing. I don't want to repeat the cycle. I want to be out from this system.**

**I don't want to lie to myself, that i am special and sh\*t and continue progressing.**

I feel the entire point of life is to create stronger and intelligent species that is capable of adapting according to environment.

*\[What for: Maybe the hypothetical creator wants to do experiments, either way its never will be anything good. i can only assume with limited intelligence i have.\]*

*I am no longer bound by religion and i am thankful for the people in the internet  who helped me understand what reality is.*

`The only solution is to have small realistic goals in life and keep moving by tracking and correcting the mistakes one make over time. I know everything will change if i do that. But what for ?`

`i know that the present only matters. Live in present.`

I no longer live in fantasy but  i had spend too much time in it, it's a living hell to get rid of it. I don't even understand why every being even need some purpose to exist.

`I know being depressed and simply thinking won't get me anywhere. It is not even logical thing to do.`

**Should I continue or end myself, I don't even know ?**
