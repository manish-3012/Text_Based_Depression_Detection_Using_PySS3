My life is falling apartThis might be something small for many to cry about but for me it's not. My parents did so much for me and wanted me to get a good education. 2 years ago I started college and went for engineering. The first semester was lightwork but after that it all went down hill. My second semester i started struggling and started getting Fs. I was put on probation and lost my financial aid and scholarships. I decided to work real hard my third year and get out of the probation. Even though i tried so hard but still got straight Fs in the engineering courses. I was 20k in debt so I decided to drop out of that school. In january of 2018 I started going to my community college and the first semester i was there i got Cs so it wasn't too bad and I switched to computer science instead. Now this semester that passed I got 2 As and a C but the java class which is for credits I got a D and physics I will get an F. The 4 year college I want to go to won't accept anything below a C and I need a 3.0 at least. I'm taking 5 winter courses before I apply and even if i get all As my gpa will be a 2.96 (if i get an F in physics which is likely unless my professor is nice and gives me a D). 
I feel like my life is falling apart. No matter how hard I try i can never go forward. Everyone around me is succeeding and they will graduate in a year and i'm basically stuck in my first year still. I've been diagnosed with depression at 22 and my anxiety is getting worse. I just need some sort of reassurance because as of right now life is not worth living for me. Not because of just school but because i just feel like a failure because i genuinely try really hard but I haven't progressed at all.
