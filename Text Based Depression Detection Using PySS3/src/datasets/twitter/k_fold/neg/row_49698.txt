I tried.Trigger warning.   


Info I am a 16 year old male from America.

I have tried. I told people when I was raped at 4. I told people when I wanted to die. The only things I got was being called a f\*ggot and beaten. for years. that stopped once I grew to 6ft when I was 14. They know how I stayed up late at night and cried from this aching anguish that I feel in my soul. Sometimes it feels like I lost the ability to love long ago. My Dad and Stepmom who I live with dont care. Ive told them consistently for months. They do not CARE. They threw me in a psych ward after I listened to them complain about how much of a burden I was. After listening to that I said that maybe it would be easier on everyone If I just slit my wrists. At which point that b\*\*ch said that she had enough and told my dad to take me to the hospital. I was crying so much on the way there. I was unbuckled and leaning against the door contemplating about just jumping for it. I watched the speedometer go to 80. I didnt jump. Sometimes I wish I did. They sent me to the ward for 2 weeks. In that time I had more release and peace than I ever did before. I didnt want to come back.   


I found love there. She was also 16. we met in the ward and immediately I knew she was the one. It sounds corny. I know. But thats how it was, she liked me too and she gave me her number, we've been talking for a few months now. I had to hear that her father gave her a concussion. Hes lucky she lives 3 hours away and I dont have a license because I would have done something. whether I killed him or not I dont know, but I have nothing left to lose. Nothing but her and my brothers and sisters. They are the only things keeping me alive. I guess we will see how long that lasts before the string breaks or it becomes a noose.  


Thanks for reading my bitch post.
