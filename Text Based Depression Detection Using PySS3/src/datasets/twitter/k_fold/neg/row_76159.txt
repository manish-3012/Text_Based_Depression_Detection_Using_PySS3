Oh so emptyI don't really what's going on right now. I'm only 17 and of course that means this just might be a phase, right? I feel so sad and empty right now, but a few minutes ago I was pretty good. I found out that someone I liked did not like me back the way I wished, but that really is not surprise. I've been rejected so many times, that it's hard to keep track. Everyone always nags me and picks on me for being in bed all day and being a bit slower than the rest, which I've slightly gotten used to but it still kinda hurts. I really don't want to exist right now. I feel so unlovable and worry I don't actually have anyone who genuinely likes me. I've grown up very independent, having to spend one or two month alone without my mother home. I've also never had a stable home, in fact i've lived in 17 different flats. I've dealt with eating disorders all my life and have been binging since I can remember and recently tried to throw up, in which I did not succeed. I was doing better, so I haven't gone to therapy for a month and my next appointment is in 2/3 weeks.  I feel dizzy and numb and just want to hit my head and fall asleep forever. I can't kill myself, because I cannot do this to my family, although I feel like I have very little love for them. I look at everything around me and just wanna cry and I can't really explain why... I feel like there is something wrong with me.
