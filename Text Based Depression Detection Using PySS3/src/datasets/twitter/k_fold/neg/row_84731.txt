I think I need more help than I thoughtI am just laying in bed imaging what it would feel like to have slits down my arm. Its been awhile and I don't know if this will help at all. Typing this out   talking to you but I think I've finally made it to the end of my rope and I was given an to hang my self .I am just tiered and done with this this existence. I keep self sabatosing my self and I can't get out of my own way . I try I seek help I've gotten on antidepressants I had seen a therapy's but I often miss my anointments due to fear thats the reason I miss many of my classes and I fee like I have dug my self to far in to the dich that took my father when I was 14 .I have a life Cotch but I lie to her I dont want anyone to know how far down I have gone . I can't see past the next couple days I never could . I live buy my self in a pit of filth decaying around me  and I can't bring my self to to do anything about it its to much  I dont really know what to do or how to keep going
