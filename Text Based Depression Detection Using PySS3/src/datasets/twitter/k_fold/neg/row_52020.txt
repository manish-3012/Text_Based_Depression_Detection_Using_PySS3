What do you do if your friend is suicidal?So much like the title suggests. What is kinda the process? I know to give them plenty of comfort and make time for them. I know to get them into therapy. Though is there any more I can do? Like if they are saying risky things do you call suicide hotline or wait for an incident or right before? 

What things can you do to help?
