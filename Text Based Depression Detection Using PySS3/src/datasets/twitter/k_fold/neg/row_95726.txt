FridayI've lived with depression all my life, in fact...I cannot imagine who I even would be without depression.  I cannot picture life without the constant weight on my shoulders.  Any time I talk to someone about it I just feel weak, as if I'm not enough, like there is something wrong with me, and that just leads me to isolate myself from once trusted friends.

I'm tired....I've pushed so many people out of my life, and.....I'm over it, I just want to sleep.

This Friday, I plan to eat a bottle of sleeping pills and drink down a nice wine.  I want time to put my finances in order so as not to leave my finances in a bind.  As well as finish out my work week, and then I'm done.

Thousands of dollars and years worth of therapy and medication have just left me with nothing but wasted effort....and I'm so tired.

Thank you for your time.
