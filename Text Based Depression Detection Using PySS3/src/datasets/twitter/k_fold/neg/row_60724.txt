suicidalHello I've been Depressed for about 4-5 years and been on medication for 2, I have OCD, turrets, dyslexia ect... anyway I have tried to kill myself 2-3 time but failed (I'm glad i did) but it never seems to stop, allways being depressed now It's really taking its toll on me. and I dont know what to do :(

Any advice?
