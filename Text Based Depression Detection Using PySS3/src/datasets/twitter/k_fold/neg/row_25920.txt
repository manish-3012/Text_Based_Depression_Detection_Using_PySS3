Suicide is selfishYou know what i think is selfish? Guilting someone who wants to die into staying alive just so you donâ€™t get hurt by their death. Pretty fucking selfish if you ask me. And donâ€™t people say to do things for ourselves? To follow our dreams? Well what if my dream is to kill myself. Would you say the same thing? No, cause you canâ€™t â€œhandleâ€ that because your so fucking full of yourself and you donâ€™t understand that not everybody sees the fucking rainbow and that constant pain and fear are things that iâ€™ve just become accustomed to and that are literally eating away at my mind and that iâ€™m simply fucking done. LET ME DIE
