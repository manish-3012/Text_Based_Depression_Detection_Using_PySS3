A good friendship ended all because of meI will not be releasing too much, i had to delete my other page because of this matter. a friend Ive been friends with for 5 years finally decided to no longer speak with me after he found my Reddit page. He saw the unsent letter to him where i admitted some feelings toward him. I was already going through a dark spot, and he, along with everyone else, just left. Honestly... this is a lot to take in rn..
