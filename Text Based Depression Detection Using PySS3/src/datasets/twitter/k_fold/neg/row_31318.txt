How can life be so cruel...That poor poor girl.. I live in the UK and woke up to the news that famous singer's younger sister passed away from a heart attack. She was only 18 wtf, we're the same age.. She had a life, she had friends, she was so beautiful and loved by so many. But it's not like she didn't also have her own personal battles...

God, forgive me for being so selfish and inhumane but I would give anything to switch places with that girl, it's so cruel out here sometimes, people dying left and right when they WANT to live. Why her and not someone who sees life as a burden? I'm sure she wanted to live, had plans, but she's gone.. She's gone and that hurts so fucking much.

To even compare myself to her feels disgusting, and so very pathetic, and it is; she didn't take her own life, her life was taken from her. The thoughts are racing right now, they have been these last couple of months. Fuck.
