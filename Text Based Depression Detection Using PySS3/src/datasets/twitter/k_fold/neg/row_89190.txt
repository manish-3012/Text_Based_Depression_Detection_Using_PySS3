Why even try anymore?What's the fukin point? I bet none of you fukers will even read this. And even if you do all you'll think about is you depressed selves and see yourself in what a write cuz you grasp at strands of possible narratives to fit your life to make yourself feel better. And fuking truth be told it's all anyone e does anyways the other people just do it with a smile. But what's the fucking point it's not like we ever accomplish anything,. We all just end up as chemical and newspaper stuffed bodies slowly rotting in a box. Or we get burned and scattered as if some spiritual power will help tether us to some long lost memory of happiness at that spot. But in the end it's not even worth living that life cuz even if you were tethered to that spot you'd just watch time decay and destroy everything you love and built in life till you yourself are nothing but a hollow empty shell a person floating silently through the fog of death. And that's only if you're lucky enough to see that trailer spire in death. Some of us watch our live rotting from the inside while we smile and wince at the pain of maggots eating us from within. And with every 'friend' we make, and every 'relationship' we form, we just give ourselves more to watch rot. So who the hell cares if I die, I'll just be some long lost voice among crowd, some echo in darkness. But the world will move on, the sun will rise and people will go to work. Life will continue on. And because of this it is my right to die by my own hand. My life will end but all others will move on. I've tried my whole life never to hurt others, and in this I have failed. But I find in my failure a driving reason to be dead. For if I can only hurt other people when I'm alive, then I can only heal by being gone.........so why even try anymore? Who cares? I dont. So I guess I'll see you all on the other side. Peace.
