Just venting about my pitiful self.I don't really have anything going for me. 33 male. Nobody really cares apart from family and at this point I almost resent them for it. I don't want to be here. It only gets worst. History is proof of that. I'll die alone and I wish I was ok with that. I'll never get a job I care about. At this rate I may never get a job. No friends and I live alone. in a typical year I maybe say less then one hour of speech to people face to face. Looking up from the bottom of this totem pole I just don't see the point anymore. Sometimes I post here but I don't get a response from anyone. When I die I hope I don't look back on life as one big regret. But I know I will. I may sooner then I think. But I'm a coward so maybe I'll just wallow in self pity for the rest of this miserable life. All I do is bring people down. I try to avoid them but life doesn't work like that. I just hope it all ends soon.
