I am dissatisfied with my life.Since I was a young girl, I was suicidal. When I was ten, I promised myself that if I had not found something to live for by the time I was eighteen, I would personally bring an end to it all. At the time, eight years felt like an eternity. Today, August 7th, it is three days before my eighteenth birthday. 

I have quit everything I ever commenced. I was in theatre. I quit. I was the drummer at my local church. I quit. I was accepted into two of my "dream" universities. I quit. I wrote for my city's newspaper. I quit. So why not quit life? 

Three days left and all I feel is inescapable dissatisfaction.
