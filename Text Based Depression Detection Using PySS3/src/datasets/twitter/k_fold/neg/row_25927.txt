How niceSince Monday I've been trying to get a job and to become able to cope a bit more with anxiety.
This is me, trying to make my life better, my goal. Because if I don't I may not be able to keep doing my treatment unless I take a disability certificate, which I refuse to take, for I do not apply, even if it's being offered to me out of convenience.
Not doing poorly, but I'm certainly impatient after such a long time of nothingness.

I have realized that if I stay put doing nothing another year I might lose it, I won't be able to listen to all that nonsense in my head without trying to silence it somehow.

This will be difficult, I have things to do that I don't want to, and after telling a friend about it, I suddenly feel distanced, it's not all bad since I'm not sure I can handle a group of people right now, but I must admit I feel very lonely.

I'm truly scared, I'm scared that it will come to nothing, that my efforts are in vain, and what that means for the future.

I really can't believe how uncertain and scared I am, and if anyone close finds out, I won't know what to say.
