So... no progress with depression in 7 years. Statistically nil chance of losing weight and keeping it off, but all I want is an SO.I don't even know. I went to the emergency room for suicidal ideation a few weeks ago. Been off work since then, but awaiting a call to go back and I just can't do it. Anyone want to talk?
