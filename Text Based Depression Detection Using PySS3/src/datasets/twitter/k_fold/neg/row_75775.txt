Life with teenagersI've been struggling with massive depression for a few years now. Put myself in some awkward situations and not sure there are ways out. Now even though they know I'm sad my kids who are both going through puberty are behind sarcastic jerks. All I want to do is run away. Just be done. I know they need me now more then every but how do I tolerate the meanness from them with everything else.
