I feel guilty? I can't get past it.Over Christmas break my coworker died.   I know its been a while since then but I can't stop thinking about it.   I really liked him a lot, and hoped that we could be friends.   But I am not so good with people and I think, all my attempts at creating a friendship with him were too small and unnoticed.

Sometimes we would pause and look at eachother and try to think of something to say and carry on the conversation but I am not so good at that.

Before christmas break, things were getting frustrating at work.   everything was piling up, as it does, and people were reaching their limit and getting frustrated.    So when he said to me "I'm going to fucking kill myself", I did not take it seriously.   that is my mistake.   could I have helped him? I don't know.   should I have done something? yes, definitely.   I know that now.   

I have no way of knowing what he was thinking.   was he reaching out to me because I was only an aquaintance? or did he feel that sense of kindred spirit with me as I did with him?   I can't even imagine what could have been.   I feel ashamed that I didn't say anything after he told me that.   that I didn't tell anyone.   that I did nothing.

and now I can't tell anyone anymore.   what would saying anything do now?   what would apologizing do?   wouldn't it just bring more pain?

I just have to live with it? by myself?
