Proof no one cares until youâ€™re deadA schoolfriend of mine killed herself recently. She was popular but whenever she showed signs of mental distress e.g an eating disorder, excessive alcohol consumption, people would scoff at her, make fun of her, call her attention seeking. (I hadnâ€™t seen her for a couple of years but there were presumably other signs before she died that people ignored). After she killed herself the same people who made fun of those worrying signs are now the ones saying how upset they are, how they loved her so much, how beautiful she was (idk why people always say this?), how much theyâ€™ll miss her etc.

I see this as proof that no one cares when someone is struggling mentally, but suddenly everyone cares when they kill themselves. I suppose death and suicide are seen as tragic whereas a mentally ill friend is just seen as a nuisance.
