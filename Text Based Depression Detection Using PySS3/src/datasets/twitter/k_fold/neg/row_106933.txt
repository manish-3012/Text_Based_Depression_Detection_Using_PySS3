I really feel like I need to be hospitalized...but I can never imagine getting over the stigma it will cause in my life. I am a very private person, and I have not told many people about my depression or my struggles. I am a respected member of my religious community and hold a leadership position there. I am just getting ready to transition back into the job market...but all I want to do is run away from it all for a time.

Do you think I could make up something? Lie? Say I'm in a regular hospital for a regular illness and come through this unscathed, reputation in tact?

It's overwhelming, all of it.
