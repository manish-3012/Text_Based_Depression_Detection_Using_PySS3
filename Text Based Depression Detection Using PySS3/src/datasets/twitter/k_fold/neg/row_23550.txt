Suicidal memory laneStill suicidal but I remember when I was new to this and browsing online furiously on all those committed suicide. I remember:

The Indian girl that left after she left her boyfriend.

Christine woo when she felt overwhelmed with life.

Lucy Gordon when knowing her friend left years before.

Laura Vanessa Nunez after when she knew it was over.

Tara Condell when at 27 she felt like it was time to go.

Abraham K Biggs when he thought his who life was meaningless.

Lu Chang Wang when she didnâ€™t want to wait for her pills to kick in.

The Indian couple who left when they realized that they were done living and enjoyed life. 

Just to name a few. I miss yoU Tara ! Laura! Vanessa! Abraham! Lucy! Christine!
