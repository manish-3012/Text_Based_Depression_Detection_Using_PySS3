...Life went from child abuse to toxic relationship. Two kids are now born from that relationship in which Iâ€™m dealing with parental alienation. My son is everything to me and now itâ€™s like heâ€™s dead but not dead. Some days I can function. Other days Iâ€™m closer and closer to just calling it a life knowing it doesnâ€™t get better but worse from here. I donâ€™t have anyone I trust. I donâ€™t have any friends. I literally go to work.. go home.. go to work.. go home..  just to pay legal fees for being locked up in an attempt to feed my now broken family when I couldnâ€™t find a job.
