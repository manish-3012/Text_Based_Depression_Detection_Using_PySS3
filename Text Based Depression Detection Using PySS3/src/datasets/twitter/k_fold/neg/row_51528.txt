They tell you to reach out to others. What they don't tell you is that others can't and/or won't help you.I'm reaching the point where I'm moving from suicidal ideation as a coping mechanism to thinking suicide could actually be in my future because everything is just well and truly hopeless. Just about anything written on the topic of being in this place would tell me to "reach out"..."talk to someone." A lot of good that ever does. Tell friend A that I want to die. Friend A's response : "*sad face emoji*" Tell friend B that I want to die. Friend B's response: "Please don't be dead." Tell friend C. Friend C's response? "Look at this cat gif. It will cheer you up." If I told a therapist I felt suicidal, their response would be to have me locked up in a hospital for 3 days like that would solve absolutely anything about my hopeless life circumstances. I went into a crisis chat room, and their suggestion was to go to my "community center" and ask where I can go to group therapy. Yes, what I need is to sit in a room and listen to 8 other people's problems when I can't even handle my own. That will make things better.

People will say I didn't try to reach out, but I did. I did so many times.
