Some thoughts.I was born precisely a minute before midnight in Amsterdam, 2003. We moved to the states when I was a baby, and my parents would tell me tales of Holland like it was some magical land. 
When I visited Amsterdam for the first time again, 15 years later, I felt at home. Heck, the airline lost my luggage so I lived off of two shirts and a pair of leggings for those five days, and hardly even noticed. 

I hate back â€˜homeâ€™. I hate my life here. 
I live in the suburbs- where you have to take APs or youâ€™re considered unmotivated, where you have to drink every Friday night to fit in. The town has tried to suppress my individuality and I let them- but this year, I bounced back. I did my makeup super punk and heavy, I wore clothes that I liked, I tried talking to more people. 

So while I feel connected to myself, I feel so detached from the world around me. Iâ€™m lonely. Iâ€™m basically being cheated on, my friends canâ€™t help me with my problems, medication doesnâ€™t do anything. 

I just want to be gone. 

I canâ€™t keep turning on the TV and witness Cuomos address of the rising death toll. I canâ€™t live in a world where the economy is put over basic human rights and lives. I canâ€™t live in a world where THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO GET RICH, HAVE KIDS TO DO THE SAME THING, AND DIE. 

COVID 19 DEATHS KEEP RISING AND ITS JUST A NUMBER ON THE SCREEN. I WANT TO KNOW THEIR NAMES. I WANT TO KNOW THEIR STORIES. 

THIS WORLD IS SO VIOLENT. 

I wonder all the time what wouldâ€™ve happened if I just stayed in Amsterdam, but I donâ€™t know. I never will.
