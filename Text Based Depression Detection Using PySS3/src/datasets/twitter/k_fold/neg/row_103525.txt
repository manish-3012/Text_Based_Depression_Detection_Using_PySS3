Why cant I do it?I have nothing to live for. Life is not meant to be lived without love. No one should have to live like this. Everyone always says "you can talk to me." Fuck them. They're back stabbing ass snakes, and I hope they burn in fucking hell. I should not have to apologize for wanting to kill myself. I should not have to filter myself out of fear for being shamed, and locked up in a psychward. Fuck everyone for not even trying to save me. Fuck everyone for forgetting about me. Fuck everyone for treating me like Im different. Fuck every damn person who says they love me. My entire world is full of middle class cunts who think they're hot shit. I'm so fucking stressed for not reason. I'm so fucking depressed because no one loves me. Love isn't important? Say that at my fucking funeral. I need to focus on myself? I'm perfect. I'm God's fucking son. I'm 10x better than people who have love. Fuck the entire world. Fuck my parents, fuck my family, fuck my friends, fuck the people who know how much pain Im in, fuck the people who ignore me, fuck the people who "love" me SO much. Why cant I just pull the trigger?
