I just tried 8 depression and suicide hotline over the last two hours, and I was sent here by a bot after trying to post on Amitheasshole (good bot)I probably don't qualify as suicidal, I love life too much. But I feel desperate, trapped in a life I didn't choose and lonely. 
Especially after opening up to my parents about having suicidal thoughts every now and then.
They told me on the phone to come here and that everything was going to be fine, but now they refuse to listen to me for more than 15 minutes and only think about going to the beach... (while the weather sucks...) 
My life sucks. For the record I am 28.

And at this point, just having anyone asking me what is going wrong and knowing that someone cares would make me very happy. 

I don't expect you to solve my problems, I will seek professional help for that, but those past three days here have been exhausting and I won't be home until tomorrow evening (in my shitty apartment with my shitty life, but I will be able to reach out to a professional or see a friend from there).
