It turns out it wasn't paranoiaYou may remember a post of mine earlier from here (check my history for it) - I talked about how I felt my "friends" hated me. 

Life went on and I dismissed it as paranoia and felt better about myself - even met a knew friend.

But today I got into an argument with one of them and he stopped responding and just started showing me kiks with my name in it where they called me (verbatim) "toxic" "disgusting" "an awful person" "don't let him (I'm a her but trans and they know this) into your house" "a case against humanity" etc.

He ended it with (again verbatim) "Perhaps you should stay away from my friends because we don't need you anymore".

I've been sitting here crying, one of my "friends" whose been a little more nicer to me could do nothing to apologize or explain himself besides (not verbatim) 'Idk, I just agreed with them'. The friend I met has offered me comfort but she's the only one.

Idk what to do anymore - these people were people I held in confidence and as best friends.
