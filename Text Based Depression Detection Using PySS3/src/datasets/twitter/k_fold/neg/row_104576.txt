2020: BananasI don't think that I would be able to make it to the end of the year. I feel like the future I wanted is slowly crashing and burning and even when I try to pick the pieces up they slip out of my hands. I'm faling my classes. Failing when others thought I would be successful, failing when others want to see me successful. I can't bear the disappointment I'll see on their faces if by the end of the semester I've failed.

It's selfish, but I only want to feel happy. I want to feel whole but I feel hollow. Now I try to live just to see other people happy. I live to see other people smiling. I try to laugh and joke, but all of it is a mask to hide what I really feel. Nobody knows who I really am, and I'd like it to stay that way.

I've been thinking about potassium overdose by bananas. If I'm going to go, I might as well go out eating my favorite fruit. (Although, I might as well find Brazil nuts, cherries, apples, peaches, rhubarb, or even just peppers... incase I can't really die of potassium overdose.)

I don't want people to know I've been thinking about this for a long time now, so I think that if I just ate too much of a food it would just be some kind of strange accident. I don't want to harm people, and I don't want to make anyone feel any guilt for me. 

I just want to see other people happy, even though I may never be. I'll don't think I will be able to stabilize my mental health and get my life back on track now, and I don't know if I ever will.

I don't know what to do anymore. I wish I was perfect, I wish I was amazing. But I'm not, and that's the problem. People expect so much from me, so much that I can't bear to see the disappointment on their faces if they found out. I only want to see them happy, but they won't feel it once they find out I'm a failiure.

I've failed life. This year has blown up in my face, and I only see one way out.

I'll go buy bananas.
