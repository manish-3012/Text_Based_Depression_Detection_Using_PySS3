I've been fighting my thoughts for two whole years, and it's getting increasingly harder to keep goingThere are very few people I can be myself around and feel safe.

Outside of those people, which I have not many chances to interact with often, I'm afraid of how people would see me, and yet am uncomfortable with how people currently see me.

I have both anxiety and gender dysphoria going on. Both find new ways to screw me over. And both have been building up over this time.

I don't know who to talk to about this, because I'm worried that either I won't be taken seriously about this, or that it will be taken too seriously and lead to changes in my life that aren't what I want.
