Cherry Blossoms-make your life like Cherry blossoms, bloom , then die-

A phrase i heard long time ago.

I think my death will be the messages to my friends, to tell them -its not your fault , but its out there-

That's the way my death will be meaningful, be like cherry Blossoms.

And all of you out there that is suffering, hear me out , 
We human lived for a purpose, make your purpose something meaningful.

We'll see each other on other side.
