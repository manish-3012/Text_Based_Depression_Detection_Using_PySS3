I just donâ€™t enjoy lifeIt feels empty. Itâ€™s just a constant cycle of things I donâ€™t want to do. Even things I used to love now do nothing for me. I donâ€™t want this. I donâ€™t want to live like this. For the last year or so Iâ€™ve gotten more and more broody and felt like Iâ€™ve actively wanted a child but then I think what the fuck do I want to bring a child into this misery for? I wish Iâ€™d never been born so why do the same to another human being? 

Iâ€™m never happy. Sometimes Iâ€™m less miserable but Iâ€™m still always unhappy to a certain degree. 

Sometimes I look at elderly people and just think â€˜how the fuck did they manage to go that many years in this pointless, numbing, soul destroying life?â€™ Iâ€™m never going to reach that age. In the last year or so Iâ€™ve realised itâ€™s not a case of â€˜ifâ€™ I kill myself but â€˜whenâ€™. Could be years from now. Could be tomorrow. I have no idea. Some days are just unbearable and others I manage to crawl through with a big smile plastered on my face pretending everythingâ€™s fine because I donâ€™t know how much the people around me can cope with me being a depressed piece of shit anymore.
