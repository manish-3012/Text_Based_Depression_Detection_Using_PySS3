I hate being around humansI hate how I have to be surrounded by people. I canâ€™t connect with them at all and I donâ€™t give a fuck about the shit that they care about. Itâ€™s bad enough when Iâ€™m not forced to socialize with people but when I am holy shit is it a nightmare. I donâ€™t see the point of society, work, and all of this other crap. Perpetuating the stupid cycle isnâ€™t a existence worth going through. I realized that life is silly trial and that thereâ€™s really no point to doing all of this shit especially the shit that you hate doing. I just want to be left alone forever. Fuck all of this shit.
