Honestly considering it.I realize how pathetic writing about my deeply troubled mind on an Internet forum is, but I can't really find any other way to ease the pain.

I honestly can't take much more. It's a feeling of total emptiness that only nihilism can fill, and even that is only a temporary solution. See, I'm ugly beyond doubt. Tall forehead, long wavy hair, oddly shaped eyes and an overall screwed up set of features. Unfortunately, being an ugly guy makes stuff unpleasant. My mates don't respect me at the slightest, and nobody really does. I'm the trash of society, and all for my face.

I've lost motivation for anything. I don't want to go to my engineering high school tomorrow, I don't want to do astronomy on Wednesday. I want to sit back and bathe in self-pity and sorrowful thoughts, and even that becomes a drag. I'm losing my will to live, and have considered death a more merciful option than this lonesome road of a life.

There are so many people worse off, and that just makes me feel worse. What kind of a horrid person must I be to complain about such lowly issues? Makes me think I really deserve a .44 through the skull.
