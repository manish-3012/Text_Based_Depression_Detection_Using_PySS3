i dont know if i want to die or noti mean,, i do want to die. really badly. but somehow im still scared of it.
i dont give a shit about how itll affect other people but im scared of the concept of physical pain or whatever from like slitting my wrists or something. even though i do self harm ive heard it takes too long to die from it.
im also scared of not existing i guess. or what comes after death. if theres an afterlife i know i will go to hell. if reincarnation or whatever exists, im scared of ending up with an even worse life. not enough karma or whatever.

i dont have a future. i cant comprehend the though of myself growing older and getting out of school into the real world. 

i dunno this is all just stream of conciousness. i feel empty but scared at the same time. im just sitting in the bathroom with a razor blade sitting on my knee deciding if i should do it. yeehaw i guess
