Lost......I didnt think I would ever be able to post on this sub reddit but here it goes. 

I have been contemplating suicide for awhile. Dealing with past experiences and present life has been difficult. Trauma seems to be a life long battle and recovery but my spirit is so tired. I dont even know what to do anymore. I keep pushing myself to get help, try meds, do something new, spend time in the sun ect. But the thoughts still come. 

I dont even know what I am looking for by posting. I guess just to say it out loud.
