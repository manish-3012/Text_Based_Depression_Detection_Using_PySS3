I have no energy left at all...if I didn't have to do anything, I would lay in bed all day...just don't like existingI am blank and empty. Everything means nothing. I'm so blank. Struggle with faith. Drained constantly. I could so easily die. Know deep down inside I'm not going to make it. I can't put up with this. I don't think things will get better. They have never gotten better. Been struggling with something since I was 13. 29 now. I am still shocked and stunned by the people I encountered the people I let in. It makes me want to vomit. It's so pitch black. There's no hope left. I waited too long for things to get better. They haven't. Each day that passes by makes me want to vomit. A cruel test and a cruel world a burden I never asked for what in the hell did my parents sign me up for without my permission I never asked them to give birth to me how is it fair if I had a choice a say in the matter I would have resolutely told them no. Pass it on to someone else who'd probably appreciate the opportunity more than me. Feel so unlucky I am stuck in this body with these thoughts with these memories in this place in these circumstances what a shitty fucking sick joke.
