I turned 18 yesterday.I'm an 18 year old girl. 18 since yesterday. I woke up that day feeling like shit and cried.

I have lost almost all my friends over the past two years. All but three best friends. 

I have my best friends and my family who loves me a lot, but the pain doesn't stop overwhelming me every day. I know I'm selfish. It's just not enough for me to stay.

I see nothing beyond 2017, my life is a waste and I've dwindled into nothing. 

I'm hopelessly pathetic, unable to be anything but numb and desperate. I only feel anger and sadness.

I dropped out of school from anxiety since last year. Everyone else had senior prom two nights ago.

The only thing I want to do is to take a handful of xanax and wash it down with whiskey, or lay my head on the road and have it split open like a grape under the wheel of a car. It's the only thing that will finally bring me peace.
