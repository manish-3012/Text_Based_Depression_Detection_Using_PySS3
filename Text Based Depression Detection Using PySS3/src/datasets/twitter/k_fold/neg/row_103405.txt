I'm done.Hello, my name is Bailey, I am 16 years old and I am a resident of the city Grants Pass, things have been very negative for me recently, I have grown up watching my mother, Chantel, get abused by my father. Recently my father has been coming into my room and sexually assaulting me. I've been raped, molested, and sodomized by my father, I have notified trustworthy adults about this and it hasn't helped. I am sick of this pain and suffering I am going through, and I think it's only fair to spread this pain and suffering to the rest of this cold, dark world we live in. I was also bullied severely at my last school, Grants Pass High. I have already committed to this plan and I will not be changing  my mind, I've shot and killed my brother last night with a newly purchased AR-15 purchased off the dark net via my computer.
His body is in the kitchen laying in the floor, I've also murdered my mother with a butchers knife only a few hours ago after having her tied up and kept in the basement since last night. I will continue this massacre in the morning, I will start off by bringing my AR-15 to my old school and killing as many people as I possible can, I have some good friends of mine planning to do the same to a few other school in the area such as, New Bridge High, South Middle School, Brighton Academy, and finally Gladiola Campus.
We've already had this plan in motion for a good bit of time now, we have multiple pipe bombs installed with timers planted randomly at each one of these schools, inside and outside of the buildings. Me and my friends will carry out these attacks on December 15th, at approximately 12 PM. Any attempts to stop me or any of my friends will go very badly for you if you try to take one of us out, any indication of something happening to one of my men will result in the detonation of every single bomb that we have planted in these areas.
