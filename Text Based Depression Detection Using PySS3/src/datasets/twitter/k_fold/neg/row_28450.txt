I just can't take it anymoreI just want the pain to stop. Everyday is a burden to myself. I was raped when I was thirteen. I ended up living a very dark and bloody life. Did things I can never forget. But I still tried to pick up a "normal" life. But ist been so hard on me. I was diagnosed as borderliner, ptss, fear of abandonment and a fear of getting a bond with someone (don't know what it's called sorry). It just doesnt matter how hard I try. I get stabbed in de back. Doesn't matter how or why it just happens every time I have something Iam comfortable with and proud of. Then it happens again the whole tower falls over. And iam back to square one.
