What happens if you go to the ER in Canada with suicidal thoughts?I have been planning an attempt. If my husband realizes what is going on with me, he may call 911 as our marriage counselor has instructed him to do so if he is concerned about my safety. 

Does anyone know what happens when you end up in the ER with suicidal thoughts? My greatest fear is being prevented from carrying out my plan and having to deal with the embarrassment of my family and employer/colleagues finding out (e.g., if I miss work).
