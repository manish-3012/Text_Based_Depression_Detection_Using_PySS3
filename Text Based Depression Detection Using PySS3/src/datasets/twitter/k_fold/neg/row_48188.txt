I need to go on, but how.Hello,

Been here for while but first time posting.

I have been fighting depression for a few years now. Thoughts of suicide have been a common occurrence given the condition.  Much of my depression has been triggered from things surrounding school ( from highschool to currently upper division university ).  It's eventually snowballed into a monster inside of me.

I have had the gift of a wonderful girlfriend who has been the most understanding and kind person for the last 6 years. She has been my world.  However, the pain of watching me suffer especially in the last year or so has become too much for her to handle.  We broke up 2 days ago. I'm not angry because I respect that she shouldn't have to go down with me. In fact I'm happy for her that she doesn't have me to drag her down anymore.

I've received treatment in the past, and have taken medication but this breakup and an unusually difficult semester has    me in a place where I feel that it's not in my best interest to go on.  With finals week looming around the corner as I struggle through my classes, I don't know how much more I can take.

Please help.
