What actually happens when you commit suicide?Like, obviously if you have people who care about you it will heavily affect them. But what if, like, you have no one who cares about you and you just pull the trigger? What then? Someone will eventually figure out you're dead, either your neighbors realize you never leave the house, someone smells your rotting corpse or your house owners come to collect the rent. After that will you just be forgotten? Will you appear on the news at least?
