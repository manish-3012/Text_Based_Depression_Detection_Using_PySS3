Losing someone.Lately I noticed there has been lots of "I recently lost someone to suicide" topics.  Now.. I could not imagine what i would feel or do if someone like my mom or a family member took their own life.  I would be completely devastated to the point that i could die from just a broken heart.

but here i am.. everyday wishing my life would end.. wishing i could fall asleep and never wake up but one day it will all be over.
