I reached out to my friends about being suicidal and all they wanted to do was argue with me about it."You have nothing to be depressed about compared to me . . . I just learned I have a bad medical condition."

"You aren't sick, stop talking like that."

"Suicide would be the most selfish thing on earth for you to do."

"Promise me you won't do anything."
