I can't stop cryingI feel used and worthless I have so much regret, I made so many wrong decisions I feel so stupid, one day I'm completely fine and strong and the other I just keep looking for a way out, ever felt like you're bleeding tears? I can't control my heartache I wish I didn't feel emotions this deep
