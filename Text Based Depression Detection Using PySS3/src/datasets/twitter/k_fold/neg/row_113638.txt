Suicidal or CatfishI have a girl, she was-is my girlfriend.
Her live has supposedly been fucked up and clings to me.

This morning she went from
â€œGood morning baby!â€
To
â€œHave a good day, I love you. Donâ€™t take this goodbye for granted.â€

And I did nothing wrong, I told her I was working and she just turned around 180.

Sheâ€™s been offline for nearly 3 hours. She might or not come back, she has done this before, many times actually.

Supposedly sheâ€™s been in the hospital many times. But I donâ€™t know and I have been holding on, â€œwhat if it is all real you knowâ€

But itâ€™s exhausting.

I donâ€™t know what to do, her friends (who might or might not be real) are not responding.

Iâ€™m a grown man but Iâ€™m worried and scared.
