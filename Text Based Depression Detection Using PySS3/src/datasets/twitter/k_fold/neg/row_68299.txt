I can't take it anymore. I just want to kill myself and not have to deal with this anymore.I barely have any friends. Im in my senior year and Ive lost quite a lot of people. I'm not good at making friends. I have bad anxiety. I spend my time over analyzing things. I get on here and talk to guys and sometimes show them my body so I'll feel validated. I had a crush on this guy and he found out and didn't like me back and now all his friends talk about me. I was with this guy who said we were "dating" only to see that he didn't like me that much and was probably talking to other girls. I can't get help for my depression because my mom thinks it's a manifestation of demons and refuses to believe I have it. Back to the friends thing, I try to make plans with people I wanna get to know better and everyone always turns me down. What's the fucking point if I've been rejected, betrayed, ignored, and looked down on???? I don't see none. People say it's get better, but they've been saying that since I was 12 and getting talked about and ignored by people at church. It's only gotten worse for me here. I just rather fucking kill myself. Who actually gives a fuck? No one.
