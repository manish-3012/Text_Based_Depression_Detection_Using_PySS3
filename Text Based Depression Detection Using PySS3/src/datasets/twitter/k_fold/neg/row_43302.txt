I really can just stare at my keyboard.why do I have to announce it here? I don't know. You can piece together my story with my post history.

To all the voices in my head, listen up:
War's over. It's a wasteland, and you're dying with me. The being unstable is one thing but the hallucinations are another. Despite the fact that you are my greatest demons personified, you are not me. You're tumors. Parasites. Unfortunately for you, that means you need me.

Maybe the is a rough draft of my suicide note.

Mom and dad and brother, you never did anything wrong, despite the quarrels and detachment in my final months. I don't love you - not because you weren't adequate, I was incapable. The smiles and laughs were at most temporary and at least fake. Please live. It's the reason I fought the thoughts at first.

[Friend]. I'm sorry. I really am. Please don't connect yourself to this. You were my anchor and lifeline. I can't say much else.

[Friend 2], I'm sorry that I'm putting you through this. I saw a webcomic, once, where God was just sort of an ordinary guy. When you committed suicide, he shot bullets into your stomach to make you feel the pain your final act inflicted. I will face your bullet with agony.

The school was shit. Its entirety was intolerance and thundering hate. Nobody was safe. I'm guilty too, but at least I can acknowledge it.

Oswald. I can't wait to see you. I'll be waiting. The thought of you makes me smile.
