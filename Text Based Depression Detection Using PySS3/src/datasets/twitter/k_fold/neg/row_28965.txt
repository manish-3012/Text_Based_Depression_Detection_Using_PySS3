What will my therapist do if I told them I tried committing suicide?Last night I had a major panic attack because of an argument my boyfriend and I had which triggered me. I started running around the house screaming pushing things over and panicking while he was trying to calm me down. He got me to sit down on the floor and breathe to calm down but I saw a plastic bag in front of me and put it around my face and tied it together to try to stop my breathing. He eventually got it off me and I'm ok. If I told this all to my therapist would they admit me to a mental hospital? I really don't want to go there. I'm 21 by the way not underage.
