I'm pretty worriedI've tried talking about it in the past to my "friends and family" and my "brothers and sisters in arms" in the military. The stigma about suicide is real in my life. When they say "ew I can't talk about this" or immediately get you sent to doctors and mental wards instead of just BEING A FRIEND, it really suppresses me. Like wtf. What can I do or say that isn't a punishment that is MY FAULT. I want to be better, I want to trust, I want to  (in my mind) be more than this person who can solve problems for those around him, that people chose to use until they have to answer my call for help. 
Do I trust my own observation for what I know to be true, or do I keep trusting in the failed promises of those around me who "want to be there for me".
