oh hey here I am making another post that will be ignoredYou've all heard it before.  I'm sad, I feel like a disappointment, a waste of space.  I'm a pathetic loser who failed high school and can barely handle a job.  I'm never fucking good enough for anyone, not even myself.  yadayadayada.

There's no point in me making this post.  The suicidal thoughts are there every single day and they never go away.  Not a day goes by that I don't think about it.
