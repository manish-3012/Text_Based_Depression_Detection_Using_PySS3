Dude, honestly, fuck this.Life is some fucking bullshit. Nothing makes sense to me anymore. There is no justice here. Everyone is thrown into this world without their say in the matter. I'm broken. My brother is dead. I'm a fucking mess. My life doesn't mean shit because I'm just going to die anyway. Why am I here dammit.
