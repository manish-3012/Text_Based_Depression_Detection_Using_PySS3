The woods.I had my first panic attack last night. Iâ€™ve never felt so much pain in my life. Iâ€™ve been depressed anxious my entire life, even more so since I left the army. But today is the first time Iâ€™ve really discovered all the fucked up things things that are wrong with me and all the horrible choices Iâ€™ve made. Everything I do, I canâ€™t finish because of this awful shit that gets it my head. I woke up with almost the same anxiety, and it was the first time Iâ€™ve ever really decided I was going to do it. Thought about it, planned but never really decided. Now Iâ€™m sitting here in the woods, drunk because I thought it would kill the anxiety away enough to change my mind, weighing the plus and minuses. Man I just know I canâ€™t fucking live like this forever. Iâ€™ve made the wrong choice in my job, relationships, life and Iâ€™ve tried to dedicate my life to helping but when I realized even thatâ€™s too much... I just cant see anything other than game over.
