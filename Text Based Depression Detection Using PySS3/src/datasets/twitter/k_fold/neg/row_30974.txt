I don't think I can come through it this time.I think I'm really close to going.

I'm so tired of waking up every day and seeing that I'm still alive and I have yet another day to struggle my way through.

This time, there's nobody to talk to. I'm pretty sure that everybody who knows me will be better off without me. I'm a burden and I ruin everything that comes into my life. Going through depression over and over again is really taking it's toll on me. I really feel like I'm dying as a person.

I can't stop thinking about my chosen method. At work, when I'm dreaming, when I'm in the shops. I'm dying. I just know that I'm dying because this pain is just so horrifying that it's taking who I am away.

Honestly, I'm in so much pain. I'm so lost and I'm really, really scared.
