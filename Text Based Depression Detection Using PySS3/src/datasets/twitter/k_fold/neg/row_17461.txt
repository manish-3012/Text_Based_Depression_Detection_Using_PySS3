There just isn't any hopeAlright, SW, I've lurked here for awhile and I know the kind of comments I'm going to be getting to this. I'm not even really sure why I'm doing it. Maybe just so that somebody, somewhere, hears that I'm having a hard time? Whatever.

Basically, I'm in my late 20s, and I graduated from a top 10 law school in Spring of 2009. I got good grades, and have been an over-achiever from elementary school on. I was valedictorian of my high school, for instance. But today, and for the past year and a half I've been unemployed. I don't see this changing any time soon.

I can't count how many applications I sent out (although I can count the number of interviews I've had) and the worst thing about this is that this situation is my own fault. Now, it is true that I graduated in the midst of the worst economy most people can remember, but there were a series of bad decisions I made that put me in this position. Put succinctly, I underestimated the depth of the economic down turn and I turned down two offers of employment. One right before graduation and one right after. These decisions were probably the worst ones that I have ever made.

So now, I'm living with my in-laws. I have no job prospects, and, given the job market for lawyers, am unlikely to ever have any. My priorities have always been about personal accomplishments, my career, my upward potential. But now I'm faced with a lifetime of poverty, and, at best, the prospect of being a "failed lawyer." 

Basically, life doesn't seem like its worth it like this. Life isn't worth the struggle, pain, and effort when failure is the result and can be the only result. I feel like its the 9th inning, my team has two outs and is down two runs and I strike out. So maybe the game should end, eh?

EDIT: Thanks everyone. I wish I could share the optimism expressed below. The ability of the reddit community to be so supportive really is amazing, and I do appreciate your kindness.
