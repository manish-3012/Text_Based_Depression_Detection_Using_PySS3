logistics etcout of curiosity.. and I promise to keep this brief.. but I live alone. my family reaches out maybe once every 2 weeks.. Iâ€™ve gone on disability leave due to my depression.. 

my question is.. I have two loving dogs. I donâ€™t want them to have to wait for someone to find me... it could be weeks. is there a way to address this?
