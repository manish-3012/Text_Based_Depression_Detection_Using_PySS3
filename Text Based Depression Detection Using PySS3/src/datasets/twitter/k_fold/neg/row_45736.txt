Seriously considered jumpingAbout the only thing that stopped me was the fact that it was a 4 story building. Trust me I know the score. If I was lucky Iâ€™d get a broken neck. 12 gauge or nothing haha

Yâ€™know the funny thing is that I think people are catching on. Like they put 2 and 2 together and started being  kinda concerned and shit. I mean, when D-day finally comes and Iâ€™m in the right mindset with the right situation Iâ€™ll probably do it. But hey thatâ€™s life right? It doesnâ€™t matter in the end. Nothing matters
