Feel Like Iâ€™m Almost DoneIâ€™ve had small attempts before but I think Iâ€™m ready to make a bigger move soon. I donâ€™t really have any friends that I care about or that care about me, I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to, to hang out with, or even to just casually care about. My therapist I was seeing for free isnâ€™t free anymore and I canâ€™t afford to pay for one (I wouldnâ€™t even if I could), birthday is coming up mid next month and, yeah itâ€™s super debatable whether or not Iâ€™ll have the courage to go through with it, but every day of being alone, being unable and unwilling to reach out, to even post my feelings on any social media aside from here, is really helping me get to the point where I think Iâ€™ll be able to kill myself. I really donâ€™t mind either, like, I really donâ€™t.
