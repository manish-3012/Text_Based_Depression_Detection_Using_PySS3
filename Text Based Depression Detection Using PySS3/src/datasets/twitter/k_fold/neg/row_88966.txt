PointlessFor a long time Iâ€™ve believed the universe and all within it exists randomly, for no reason, it just happened. So did I, my whole existence is next to impossible. Some people embrace that idea as a reason to live.  All I hear are two choices: suffering and not suffering. If Iâ€™m not here neither are my depression, anxiety, mistakes, regrets, influence, ideas, beliefs.  So what stops me every time I start planning my escape? Guilt. My family and a few friends would be upset. 
Iâ€™m starting not to give a shit how they feel though, my life doesnâ€™t belong to them. I have no passion, I make bad choices and I take up resources. I think it might be time to just get out of the way
