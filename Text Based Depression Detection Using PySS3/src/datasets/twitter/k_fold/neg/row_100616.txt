I just can't get a graspI don't know what I'm supposed to say here, reddit has helped me for laughs and discussion over the years, I thought you can help me now. Problems with: friends/family/girlfriend/health. It just seems so easy to walk up the stairs, load the shotgun, and just have sweet oblivion. I'd prefer an alternative (which is obviously why I'm here), but I'm just so alone. Is there anyone that will talk to me for a little while tonight or anything.
