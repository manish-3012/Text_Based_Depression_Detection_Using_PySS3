I'm a wretch"Like a baby, stillborn

Like a beast, with his horn

I have torn

Everyone who reached out for me"

I relate to those lyrics so much. You, who are reading this - please, don't try to change how I perceive myself. I have tried for so, so long.

I have hurt so many others, and I now find myself purposefully avoiding forming new bonds, even though it's hard not to. I feel so alone, but I don't want to hurt anyone else.

What hurts the most is how painfully aware I am of the machinations of my mind that force me into this cycle of toxicity, and as I struggle to break it, I try to simply withdraw from interaction where possible not to continue it. 

Yet, there is a thought that never leaves me: that I never will be able to fully overcome what eats away at me. That my problems have consumed whatever I was before, and that I am no longer myself, but a husk. 

You, who are reading this - thank you. For listening. You, who listened when I could not dare write any of the very few people I am in contact with.
