I don't want to kill myself but i need to dieMy boyfriend left me because he didn't love me, didn't see a future with me and was not happy with me. Says I brought him down cause I'm not helping myself or my depression.

I had been doing okay. Upped my therapist visits and went to a support group. That was the weekend before last he left me and then last week i was trying to be happy and move on. I felt good last night. Like i could do it. 

When i woke up this morning someone had stolen my car. It had been a struggle for me to get my license but i overcame a lot of obstacles. It was a great car. I will be riding the bus to the job i loathe now. Who knows when i will get a new car. Whatever. 

I just want to die. Why bother trying to move on and live? My life is always nothing but one miserable period after another. I've been depressed my entire life. I want out of this. But I'm too chicken to hurt myself permanently. I will beat myself but actually killing myself seems impossible. I wish I could just never wake up.
