Iâ€™m going to blow my head off for the sake of my wife and kidsIâ€™m trying to plan my suicide so my wife and kids will not have to suffer.

So Iâ€™m going to die. I donâ€™t know when yet but Iâ€™m trying to make plans. I have 3 little girls and an incredible wife. I am doing nothing but destroying them with my anger and self hatred. My life was meth, homelessness, physical and mental abuse. Because of that I have grown so bitter and angry at the world. I canâ€™t remember the last time someone looked at me as a human. My wife even called me a narcissistic asshole the other day... 2 of my kids are the product of my wifeâ€™s ex husband who thought it was ok to rape her. Her family shows more hate to me then him. She is constantly being told she should leave me by her family, coworkers, my job, my family, and even her friend. I truly love her and for that reason is why Iâ€™m going to literally blow my head off. I thought that since I live in the mountains I could hike for a week until I find a nice pretty spot then pull the trigger. Then I will get to see my mom again. My youngest daughter who is mine by blood is young enough to forget me so soon is the best option. Do you guys think a sawed off shotgun will work? I just truly donâ€™t want to suffer if possible. I heard shotguns are mess but thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m going far into the mountains. Or maybe a pistol? Idk:(
