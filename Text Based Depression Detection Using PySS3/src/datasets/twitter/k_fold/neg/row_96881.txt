PhD in Engineering (Top 10 in my Field) without full time job for more than a year, rejections after rejections is slowly killing my confidence...I am an international student. I graduated with PhD in Engineering from University of California and I am currently on OPT, and interning at a small firm. I have applied to 600+ jobs, but all rejections, it has been more than a year and I still have not found a full time position (I trained a student who struggled with everything, but had a green card, that student had no difficulty finding a job), I feel my OPT status is very disadvantageous, employers are reluctant). I have been in the US for almost 10 years, I call US my second home, my closest friends are here. I have loan of $40000 and I don't know how I will repay this large loan. I am almost 35, single. If in future I had to go back, I don't know how I will repay this loan, because in my country, it will take me 5-6 years repay this amount, I won't be able to find a partner, I won't be able to start my life. All this is causing me nightmaresâ€¦rejections after rejections is killing my confidenceâ€¦I am barely able to survive from internship salaryâ€¦this is very depressing for me, sometimes I feel like ending my lifeâ€¦all the education and hard work will go wasteâ€¦I have been a good citizen here in the U.S. â€¦I have always been good and kind to othersâ€¦helped others in needâ€¦been there for my friendsâ€¦this pain has to endâ€¦I am doing my bestâ€¦but in the end I will have no other choice but to end my life...
