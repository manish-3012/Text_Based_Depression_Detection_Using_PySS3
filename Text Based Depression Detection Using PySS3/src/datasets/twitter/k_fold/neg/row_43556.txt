In a few monthsIn a few months I think I'll be ready to go.

As messed up as it is, there is nothing more calming than continuing to plan out my own death.

I have to wait until then, though, because there are some things I must still do and places I must still visit.

After that, I plan to go. 

I just finished a call with the suicide hotline so that I could keep from leaving tonight, so that I can stick to my plan. They weren't really helpful and didn't know what to say to me. It's funny though. I thought I heard the voice of my therapist from one of my inpatient stays in the background of the call. I guess I'll never know.

Does anyone else find knowing your plan inside out very calming?
