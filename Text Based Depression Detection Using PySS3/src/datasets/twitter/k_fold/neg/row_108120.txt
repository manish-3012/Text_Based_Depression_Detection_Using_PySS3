Free inside our own hellSelf pity leads nowhere but its where im at.Fuckin super lost.Damn unemployed.No career to chase.No random jobs that fit me,especially after last job i had that raised the bar and i quit it too.That job was the last straw because it was the best i had but it was personally meaningless.Couldnt sell my soul.Seems its not all about the stupid coins but now i have none,fuckkk.Also got distanced from everyone in multiple ways for multiple reasons.Dont even care all that much anymore about that,makes you tougher with time,but also makes you kind of numb.Lost or messed up connections just suck.Spending time contemplating.Days months pass and im stuck.Got put back by asshole that is universe back into the awful position i was in years ago,only this time i got less hope.It is UNBEARABLE.Joining this support group where everybodys lashing out or pushing it down sounds better,proves it.
