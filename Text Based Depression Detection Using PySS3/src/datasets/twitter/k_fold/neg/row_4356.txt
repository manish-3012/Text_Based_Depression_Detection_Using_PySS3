Called out for being quiet/tiredCan anyone relate to this?

Unless I'm being forced into a situation where communication is necessary, I usually don't talk. I find it to be exhausting and can go hours without opening my mouth. Immediately my dad started comparing me, to my extroverted, happier, and louder counterparts like my sister or himself. Most of the time they talk about it behind my back. 

Depression has caused me to become very sluggish too, and I've been called out for that. I eat slow, walk slow, and go at my own pace. The world around me just feels like it's moving slow. 

I just can't be as animated as the rest of my family or the people around me. I lie in my bed all day, my eyelids heavy, feeling unmotivated, empty, lifeless, and curled up in a blanket so that I can waste my life away and contemplate suicide. People need to just leave me be sometimes. Hurts to hear people say all this stuff about you, I really don't mean any harm.
