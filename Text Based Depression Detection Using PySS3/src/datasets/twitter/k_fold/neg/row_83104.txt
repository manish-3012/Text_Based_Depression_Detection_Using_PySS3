I feel like itâ€™s too lateI havenâ€™t accomplished my dream of being a singer, a lot it do with dealing with my health issues. Iâ€™m currently in a band which has success, but Iâ€™m 30 now and having issues staying in shape and feel like Iâ€™ll never be the front woman the band deserves.  I feel like Iâ€™m too old to achieve my dreams, and Iâ€™m stuck in a career that I donâ€™t really like, and I canâ€™t get out of this rut. 

Sometimes I think, â€œwell maybe Iâ€™ve done enough, I could end it now. Better to burn out than fade awayâ€
