I'm so tired of fighting just to live and even to survive, the drugs, the booze and the false hopes!So this will be my 1st Reddit post and will be a extremely long and detailed story if I told the full story but ill i'll try to summarize and be as quick as possible here, I was born to essentially without a father he was barely there and i only have a handful of memories  with this "father"/ more or less person in my now almost 22 years old life.Lost my mom at 9 yrs old to cancer and was taken in by my grandparents my grand father was fun(loved to fish and ride along with him when he need to buy something he would always say "around and around where we go i don't Know but were we stop ill never know so lets have an adventure) my grand mother was controling domineering and an absolute psycho bitch cunt most my life was an extreme u don't believe u go 2 hell and u die fully religious (old school i even fight with here from time to time now even as our relations ship has improved) she would rarely hit me only a few times ( i was beat more in my younger life than later apparently i repressed it until i was talked to by a close cousin later in life) but she would demean me idk exactly what emotionally/mentally she would always say if i didn't do better in school (which i was bullied heavily in for my size and appearance) that i would be a useless, worthless, alcoholic leeching piece of shit like my uncles (lmao she never even has the idea of how bad i got. In thew worst i drank a handle and a half of 50% vodka a night i would drink 15 shots from when i first woke up to an hour into my shift at work get home buzzed and drink myself into oblivion) so with this mindset growing up plus being degraded almost daily and hating my self i took to self harm intensely i would cut, stab, burn, punch myself, and smash my own head against walls at (50% strength on punches and walls the single most (the single thing i'm sure of based on my physical/punching strength and fast thinking mind is that if i had good eyes, have to wear glasses or im completely blind i probably would easily be the world undisputed heavy weight boxing champ I understand this is somewhat narcissistic but all heavy weight punches seem to go into slow motion to me both live and broadcast. and it just so easy to out maneuver and tank combatants fighting and have been trained by one of my uncles informally and i know i can take hits and give out absolutely dangerous punches the one fight iv'e been in i almost shattered a dudes jaw in three places from a counter punch (won almost a grand from that street fight from one punch.)) to make sure i never became retarded  and now as an adult i hate working minimum wage 40-80+ hrs a week just to survive when all i ever dreamt of (from the depressing upbringing) was to create worlds for other to feel happy in and i wanted to be an animator and content creator like Monty Oum (RIP) and make people feel their emotions like iv'e so desperately wanted to for over a decade of my life but in all honesty all i've done is lie and fake my way through the last decade and i feel like (since i'm about to be "homeless" potentially car-less and thus from my job requirements jobless im thinking of taking my self out on Thursday (9-12-10) the latest i can pay rent 
(which im almost 380 short on and cant find anyway form drug dealing to fighting  in the streets to make enough)
