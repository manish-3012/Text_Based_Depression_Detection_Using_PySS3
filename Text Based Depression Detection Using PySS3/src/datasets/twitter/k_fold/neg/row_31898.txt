why am I not getting responses from therapists? am i doing something wrong?Im going through losing my two closest and best friends and i am struggling. 

Im not actively planning anything, I couldn't do that because my disabled mom lives with me and she would be homeless if anything happened to me. 

I just wish i didnt have to exist and deal with this overwhelming pain. I dont feel like this every day, most days i just feel numb like im on autopilot just along for the ride. some days though are incredibly difficult and i can feel thoughts kinda drifting towards a bad place. not actively trying to off myself, but more of a 'meh i couldnt care less if i dropped dead from a heart attack/aneurism/whatever right now'

So while i appreciate what y'all do here, I want to let you know to not worry about me doing anything, im just looking for advice on getting help.  Also dont offer to talk to me please, talking to people online about this hasnt helped. I need to talk to someone outside the situation face to face. I recognize that might be hard what with covid, but i didnt really have a choice when my best friend decided to fuck up our lives now did i



ANYWAYs onto the meat of the post:


Ive reached out to a handful of therapists via email and calling and leaving voicemails but its been two weeks and i havent heard anything back. 

All ive told them in the messages is that im going through something difficult right now and need help learning how to cope and that i would like to set up an appointment. 


Am I taking the wrong approach? is this normal wait time? ive never had to do anything like this because ive always been a fairly happy person until now. I cant remember the last good day i had.


Thanks
