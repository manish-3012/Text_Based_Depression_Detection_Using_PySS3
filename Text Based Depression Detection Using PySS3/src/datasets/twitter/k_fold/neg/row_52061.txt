Whatâ€™s the pointI just feel so alone. Trapped in a situation of my own creation. Iâ€™m exhausted of the facade and I just want to end it. Every single day is a constant debate about when to do it. Iâ€™ve already accepted that Iâ€™m going to take my life one day. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s stopping me tbh
