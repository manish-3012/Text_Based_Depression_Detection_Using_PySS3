GoodbyeIâ€™m (16m) tired of things going down hill on me, every attempt to do something has gone horribly wrong. Now Iâ€™m scared to even be happy, I realize nothing I do will help. Everything seems to go better when I do nothing, my family seems more happy, friends do much better without me. It looks as if the world is better off without me trying to get in it.

I donâ€™t remember much before high school, just every mistake Iâ€™ve made and everything horrible. Iâ€™ve seen my sister pull a knife on my mom during elementary school. Twice apparently Iâ€™ve seen her attempt suicide from her boyfriends breaking up with her. My parents want me to work hard being athletic and work on school as well, but I canâ€™t do it. Every attempt to get help hasnâ€™t gone anywhere past an hour of them asking if I was okay when I have.

I donâ€™t have any reason than a couple to keep on living out. My friend has been really good to me, heâ€™s like a brother to me but I know heâ€™ll be fine, heâ€™s stronger mentally and physically. I have crush Iâ€™m into, I know she doesnâ€™t like me the same way I like her so thatâ€™s kind of out of the way now. Video games donâ€™t give me much happiness anymore, itâ€™s more of how fast can I lose the game if anything at all.

Iâ€™ve been planning those for four years now, only thing thatâ€™s stopped me was a note for people I care about. I believe itâ€™s better to not leave them any, I know my words can be misleading. Iâ€™ve lost my appetite, but I think Iâ€™ll enjoy some ice cream for a final snack. 

Thank you, everyone for trying
