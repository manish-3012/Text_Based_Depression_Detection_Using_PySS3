Should I kill myself? I mean at this point my life sucks and it will continue to suck and idc if it is selfish or if someone is going to cry ab me (although deep down i know only 2 ppl in my life will give a shit) i won't always put other ppl's happiness first once i have to think about myself and i feel like suicide is the only thing that can take away my pain
