Should I got to the hospital?I'm diagnosed Bipolar 2. For the last 2 days I've been seriously considering killing myself. I'm on seroquel but its not helping. Last night I nearly killed myself. I sped up to about 90 mph and tried to drive into a group of trees. I swerved out if the way at the last second. Today I was driving on the highway and all I wanted to do was swerve into an 18 wheeler. I even took my seatbelt off. 
I'm tired of suffering, I'm tired of being damaged. I cant change my life, I want off this ride.
