Give me a reason not to.Seriously.  Give me a reason to live.  This sounds dramatic, because what fucking person that wants to kill themselves isn't dramatic?  The whole goddamn concept of suicide is dramatic.

I'm angry and hateful and cynical and so fucking miserable and it's changing me.  I've been severely depressed as long as I can remember.  Despite that, for a long time, I felt like life was always worth it, a beautiful disaster if you will.  I don't feel that anymore.  I know objectively life in general now is far greater than it has ever been in history, and all that does is make me feel worse for feeling so fucking horrible all the fucking time.  I can't see beauty anymore.  I can't see love anymore.  I can't see anything good anymore.
All I can see is hate, and violence, and bigotry.  All I can see is how the world is set up to punish those without.  All I can see is how pointless it all is.  How unfair it all is.  What is the fucking point of being alive if all it does is hurt?  Why can't I feel anything but pain?  Why do I have to hurt so much, every goddamn day, just to spare my loved ones some temporary pain?  
Fuck giving me a reason not to kill myself.  Give me a reason why living is worth this pain.
