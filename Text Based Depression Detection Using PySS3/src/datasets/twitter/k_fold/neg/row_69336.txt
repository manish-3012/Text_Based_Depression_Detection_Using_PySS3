Just got word Iâ€™m getting 0% disability for PTSD from the military since I did cocaine onceThe military has chosen to give me 0% disability for my PTSD and horrible sleep apnea since my discharge is categorized as dishonorable (even though I received an other than honorable discharge) after I had confessed to doing cocaine to one of my friends shortly after deployment and he snitched on me so he could join OSI. 

I mean, what would you expect someone with PTSD to do after returning from deployment? Doing cocaine once and confessing to it sounds like someone that needs help, not someone that needs to be kicked out and completely forgotten about. 

That doesnâ€™t matter anymore, I made a promise with myself, I was going to kill myself if I was turned down by the VA for my disability application, and thatâ€™s exactly what happened. 

I wonâ€™t kill myself today or even this week. I need to pay next months rent and pack all of my stuff into separate bags and label who it will belong to, but Iâ€™ve already hung a noose made out of para cord from my second floor and cut out some memory foam to wrap around my neck so itâ€™s not painful. 

I just want this reddit post to serve as a wake up call, once I do kill myself I will provide the link to this post in my suicide letter so people may see just how pathetic our military is, maybe it will help those in similar situations, but someone has to do it.
