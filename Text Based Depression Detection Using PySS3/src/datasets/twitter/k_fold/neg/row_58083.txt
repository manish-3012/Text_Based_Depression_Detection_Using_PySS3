Repost: I was an abusive partner.Recently I apologized to an ex partner for my actions and behaviour.
I was having alot of problems with drinking back then and I went off rails. 
At a point in our relationship she started to have health problems that caused her discomfort when we tried to be intimate so for a long while we were not.
When I was making amends, I asked her if she ever felt pressured by me in that way and she said
"You pressured me a bit" so I asked what she meant (if I assaulted her or anything) she said no and that I only made her feel pressured at times by some rude comments I made. 

I then asked about a time in particular when we tried to make love and if she felt pressured into that.
She said "I dont really remember, you werent that great at understanding and I felt like you didnt like being told no"   
Which really has made me overthink the situation so to be sure I asked "I didnt do anything horrible besides the rude comments right?" 
And she said "Thats right."

She accepts my apology for my behaviour but does not forgive me. Which is fair.
Given the above part though I cant help but feel truly awful about it and that I might have done something horrible.
Im having so much trouble forgiving myself and Its taking its toll on me, i'm strongly considering suicide.
