Can someone please remind me of reasons life is worth living?I sincerely don't understand why I need to keep going.

My anxiety and depression are so overwhelming that it's almost impossible to leave the house. I keep wishing something awful would happen to me so I don't have to feel this way anymore.

No one cares about me, or what would happen to me. I don't know. . .I just need reasons why life is worth it.
