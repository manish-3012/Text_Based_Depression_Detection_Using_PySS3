Dunno even what to doim fucking 18,feel like 50 and somehow wasted away my life. feels like i got no personal autonomy in this house. ever since 7th grade havent felt happy a single fucking moment of my life apart from the few couple of times we visited relatives(2-3 times a year),or hanging out with friends (also only 2-3 times per year). other than that only saw them in classes we took together in school. 
honestly if i dont get 95% or above in college entrance exam ima kill myself cuz then i cant go to a half decent college(in pakistan here) and instead of following my dream of becoming a game dev, will have to stick with a shitty med college with a shitty future ahead of me.
sucks cuz my parents love me and i know from their perspective i dont know whats best for me but does not help if instead of explaining,they try to win every argument and ordering me on how i should spend the day,what hours i should study,how much time i need to take out for them,for sleep etc. wish they would just stop.
i apologize for shitty english, or if anything was confusing in my rambling. sucks because alot of people have it much worse than i do and im just...well...
