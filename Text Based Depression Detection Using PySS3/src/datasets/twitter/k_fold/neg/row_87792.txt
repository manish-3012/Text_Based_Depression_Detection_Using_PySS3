I think about how nice death would be a little too often for comfortThis past month was great. I went on vacation to see my boyfriend and everything was beyond amazing. But now Iâ€™m back at home and am constantly reminded of how much of a miserable fuck I am.

My problems are still there and I feel like a complete and utter failure at school. Iâ€™m starting to feel like my boyfriend is just staying with me out of pity. Iâ€™m literally such a boring person in general that none of my friends hang out with me anymore.

This is pretty much your typical â€œno one would even hurt that much if I dieâ€ post I guess. Iâ€™m only 20 but Iâ€™m so so damn tired of life. Iâ€™m tired of feeling. I can only sleep so much before I get headaches, so unless there are magical pills to make me stop feeling, death would be the best way to just end it all. To stop the hurt, the doubts, the constant anxiety, the self/hatred. To stop feeling in general. I just want to be numb.

I feel like Iâ€™m such a waste of life. There are so many people out there who can do so much more that are fighting for their lives every day, but Iâ€™m right here wishing for it to end.
