stuck in a&amp;e overnightto be clear, im not in a bed or being watched. i didnt do anything but my doctor made me go to a&amp;e just for suicidal thoughts. Theyâ€™re saying itâ€™ll be 12 hours til Iâ€™m seen by a psychiatrist and itâ€™s 11pm now. Iâ€™m tired and angry I didnâ€™t even do anything and thereâ€™s nothing they can do to me.
