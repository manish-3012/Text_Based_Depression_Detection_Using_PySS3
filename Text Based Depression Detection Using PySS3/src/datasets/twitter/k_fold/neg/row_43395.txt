Want to end it allLately, life has been giving me shitfest after shitfest. I'm 22, and I just can't imagine what my shitty life is going to look like 10 years from now.

A girl that I love lately rejected me and is going to be engaged to another guy soon. I spent 3 months with her, and I only wanted her to see what a catch I was. But all I got was some shitty excuse about "doing things the right way" and how I was being too forward with her. Everything stopped between us, and I just feel so miserable because I don't have a job, only a part-time freelance thing that barely keeps me alive. None of my college friends are available as they all travelled away, so I'm socially crippled as well.

My family are all kinds of fucked up, and I only have an elderly mother to take care of. What the hell am I supposed to do? I'm going to off myself because life is horrible and is not for everyone. It's only for those select few that get everything handed on a silver platter. Just FUCK this bullshit!
