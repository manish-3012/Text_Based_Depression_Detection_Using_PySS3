Is life worth living?Im only 17, 18 in 2 months. And ive already lost the will to live. Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for years and now i just feel like im already at the end if my rope. I have no hopes or any meaningful dreams, no friends to speak of. The only thing in life that even relatively cares is my pet snake.

So i wanted to ask if life is still worth giving a try.
