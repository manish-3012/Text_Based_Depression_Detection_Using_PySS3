Very worried about a siblingHello,

Just a few hours ago, my brother posted a weird drawing to his Facebook. he's a cartoonist, so he usually posts drawings of his characters. Unlike his regular posts however, this latest drawing has no caption, isn't scanned, and isn't his regular drawing style at all, which is very meticulous and geometric. In the background, there are lots of meaningless scribbles, and on top of those are aggressive looking arrows pointing down, and in the middle is something that looks a lot like a noose. He posted this about 1 AM yesterday. 

To give some background, I have been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses, and he has been diagnosed with OCD. I know he can get very stressed about his schoolwork. He's nearing graduation from college and the school is about six hours from where i live. I don't know if he has many friends. My counselor has said that seasonal affective disorder has been prevalent among a lot of her clients around this time, so maybe it's affecting him too. 

I've contacted him on Facebook, but he said he was in class (which makes sense because it was about 8 AM at the time). Hopefully, I'll be able to talk to him in an hour or two. 

I'm really worried. What should I do?
