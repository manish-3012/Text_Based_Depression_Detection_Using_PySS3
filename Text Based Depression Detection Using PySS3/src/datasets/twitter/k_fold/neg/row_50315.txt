iâ€™m losti feel lost and empty. i shouldnâ€™t feel lost or empty but i have a sinking feeling in my chest and stomach that iâ€™m never and never had ben good enough. and itâ€™s just this world gets worse and worse with every day. iâ€™m too sensitive and the world hates sensitive people. i canâ€™t take a joke because i take it to heart. the world hates those people. i cry too much and i never mean to but i come off as manipulative the world hates manipulators. i canâ€™t talk to anyone because iâ€™m just too depressing or someone else always has it worse. the word seemingly hates me. i donâ€™t know what to do. 
i called the suicide hotline and the operator said i was just in a moment. do moments last for years? iâ€™m stuck. iâ€™ve been told iâ€™m too pussy too kill my self and didnâ€™t know how to take it. iâ€™ve been told nobody would forgive me, and nobody would really care that i was gone. i donâ€™t want to live in a world that things iâ€™m cowardly for not doing something and in an unforgiving world and a world that wonâ€™t even miss me. 
i donâ€™t know what to do anymore. 
i donâ€™t know.
