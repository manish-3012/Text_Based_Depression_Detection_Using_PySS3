I heard that burning charcoal in a sealed tiny space is the most painless way to do it! Anyone can tell me if this is true? i am really contemplating of doing it! I am so desperate. HELP please!So I came across the internet and did my own research. I found that if you burn enough charcoal in a sealed room or small space it would increase certain amount of CO in the air which can cause you unconscious within minutes and you will feel like sleeping until your brain completely shut down. 

I have read also about those suicide survivors they described the first few minutes to coma is painless cuz they couldn't even recall when they passed outï¼Œbut the aftermath the sequela can be intolerable if u didn't actually die from it!

And with this method it has a high rate of success than others besides shotgun in the head and jump from height(very high). From my research i learned it is allegedly the least painful way of doing it.

I am really thinking about doing this. Bc i just CAN NOT deal this mentality anymore!

Anyone who attempted this method and didn't die please tell me what was it really like when the first few minutes into unconsciousness. 

Any info would help bc i don't want to do it and fail.
