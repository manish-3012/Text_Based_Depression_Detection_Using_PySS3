I need helpI see no point in living anymore i
 dont do shit all day cause im depressed 
cant sleep 
keep sabotaging myself
f people see me as a failuere because when i was young i was smart social had lots of friends and now no one
 the taught of killing myself keeps getting stronger and i just fail at everything i do in life 
my family hates me 
Cant keep relations with people
My dad killed my mom when i was like 4 years old and i keep getting more traumatized by it as i get older 
Live with my uncle and aunt and they want to kick me out 
Skinny because i cant eat 
Always had toxic friends 
Keep drinking more alcohol 
Cant see a therapist because im broke
Cant get happy about anything 
Shame about my self care 

List could go on...

I dont want to do it but it keeps getting stronger and i have no one to talk to about it 
I see this as a last resort
