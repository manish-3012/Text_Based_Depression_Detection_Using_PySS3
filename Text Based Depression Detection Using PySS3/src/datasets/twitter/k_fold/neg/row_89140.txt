I tried slitting my wrist but didnâ€™t have the willpower to break skin and get it over withI just felt so done today. I felt broken, beaten, worthless, ignored, misunderstood, ashamed, depressed, idk I felt it all. I needed it to stop. 

I opened my knife, pressed the blade into my arm and I felt the pain. Iâ€™ve never done self-harm out of self harm Iâ€™ve only done it when trying to commit suicide. I was pushing as hard as I could manage with the tears streaming down my face thinking of how this could be my last day on earth. 

The only reason I didnâ€™t break skin or go far enough to make myself bleed was because I hesitated and right as I was about to just go for it a friend texted me so I texted them for a little bit.
