Idk anymore manI did it! I finished several projects I had been trying to make for years!!! I began to heal in certain places, my abusive past, my self-hate, and even had the desire to workout my chicken-leg frame. 


And I have absolutely nothing to show for it. I also began to heal from my naivety and realized the people who I grew up thinking were awful, the people who proudly hate others, the people who disguised their abuse as love and correction, they win. 

I grew up religious. I was taught that God is proud of every big and small thing you do. So I gave money, I helped people move or do chores, I watched peopleâ€™s kids, all for free, because I was taught God would pay me. However, the people I watched refuse charity to their sick relatives...THEIR OWN FAMILY MEMBERS, now openly mock me. I canâ€™t tell you how many times in the past I was beat up, laughed at, and even blamed for things I had no part it, and I took it, because God will protect me. 

Iâ€™m over it now. God sees everything, he knows that I really did try. So I set my date for October 21. I have had bad run of things in the past. Iâ€™ve had ropes snap, cars refuse to start, and even my own emotional brain break down and I sat there and cried like a baby for hours. This time, it will be different. No matter what breaks or how much I cry, I feel like I have to push on, no matter what happens
