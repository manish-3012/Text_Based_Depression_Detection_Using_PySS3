I am losing itI am extremely emotional and sensitive person, I have been feeling really depressed for awhile now. I gave up on university, pressure was too much, I feel useless, I have no skills or any talents. 

The only reason that keeps me going is a manic bipolar girl I met online. Ironic. As much as she helps me, that help can turn me suicidal of how upset I can get with her. It's an extremely long story I just have no nerves to write right now. Feeling extremely down and I am gonna lose it, I am super close to just fuck myself up, I never ever felt this way, I used to feel fucking normal until I met her
