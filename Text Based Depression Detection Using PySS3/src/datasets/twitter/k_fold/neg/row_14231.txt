Someone explain to me what is wrong with killing yourselfSeriously, short of religious reasoning, why is it wrong to kill yourself?

Psychiatrists believe someone being suicidal is caused by an illness, so there is a biological reason for a person to want to kill themselves not a situational cause.  For other illnesses if your heart stops you can request a DNR and die.  Some states and nations allow assisted suicide.  This is basically saying nothing else can be done to fight this illness, so a physician will allow death.

So if being suicidal is always medical then why canâ€™t mental illness be recognized as being a terminal illness which is valid for one to die by suicide over if other biological illnesses are? But when it comes to mental illness you can be forced into any number of abusive treatments to get yourself not to commit suicide and suicide is never considered an option ever at all and is a sign more forced treatment is needed.
