May be first and last words hereI dont want to sound like a person who does not have any problems but still complains about life. But most of you will think exactly it after reading this post.

I can't complain about my life, yes I had some bad moments with my family, some really good moments in my studies. Had success probably in anything that i started to do.
But I always had the feeling that i am lagging behind. When I watch back i can't see anything...Yeah most of my relatives, friends would think that oh great you have done a great job. BUT NO, FUCK YOU ALL.
I am sick to be the RIGHT person, by doing the RIGHT things. I am tired of this life. Now, i try to just let them all down. It is not what i am trying to do deliberately, probably the loud shout which was shut in me for years. I feel myself like a shit, with no past. I don't care about anything. If the suicide thoughts were scaring me in the past, now even when I am coming back to my place at 4 am in the places where anybody probably could be killed, I don't care if someone just comes and stabs me. I just don't care about anything anymore. 
I am not asking for any help cause all the motivational words are not working. I just needed to say this, sorry if I took your time
