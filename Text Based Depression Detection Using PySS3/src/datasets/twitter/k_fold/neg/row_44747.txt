why shouldn't iI'm seeing posts about people not wanting to live or die, or wanting to die but can't bring themselves to do it...but I can. I do want to die. When I think of my surroundings and people who care for me after I die I see them sad, but they love me. Wouldn't they sacrifice being sad so I can stop being so sad? my cats will be cared for. My mum will understand. My partners and friends will all know its the best option so why don't people want whats best? my only regret would be my cats, I love them so much, but they will have a much better life with my mum. its going to be so much better and I can't think of any reason to stay
