Just found out my university can expel you for being suicidalHereâ€™s my problem: we have a program that talks to people who are suicidal or do concerning things. They always intervene when a professor is concerned, an RA receives a concerned message about you, or the police do a welfare check. Iâ€™ve had to see them 4 times since February of last year. I want to take mental health leave and I emailed my programâ€™s coordinator asking if I could take it, not providing any details that would get the program consulted. Then I realized the program may be consulted anyway because theyâ€™re in charge of mental health leaves. I looked it up and found that my schoolâ€™s program can get you expelled if they think youâ€™re a serious danger to yourself. If I see them a fifth time, thatâ€™s going to get me expelled. Whatâ€™s the point of doing that to suicidal people? All weâ€™re going to do is kill ourselves because weâ€™ll be in massive debt for a degree we didnâ€™t even get. Plus we wonâ€™t have the degree we worked so hard for because of our mental health. That should be mental health discrimination, but it isnâ€™t in the state of missouri. What a load of bs. Iâ€™m in my second to last semester. Imagine getting expelled so close to graduation for having issues you canâ€™t control.
