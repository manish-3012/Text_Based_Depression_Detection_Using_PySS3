It doesnt get better. You just get used to it.The default is suicide. Without religion and without happiness, the default path of life is termination of your own life. Unless you're talented at something or satisfied with being micriorem, you'll want to kill yourself.

Life isn't for averege ppl who kwno they're average, only brilliant people and those who cant accept they're not brilliant.

For the rest of us, like me, a tall building is the closest they'll get to heaven.
