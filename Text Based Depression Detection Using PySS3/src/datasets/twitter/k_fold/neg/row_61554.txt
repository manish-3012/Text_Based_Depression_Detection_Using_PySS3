Hi, I'm very much scared.I've been up for about 4 hours just straight crying. I'm scared because I feel like self harming and I don't want to go down that road again. I already tried to off myself last year and I ended up in a mental hospital. I'm very much scared cause I don't want to lose the ones I love but it is progressively getting harder.  My dad is straight a piece of shit and my mom loves to take her anger out on me. I have problems with my whole family and I know I won't be able to ever repair them because of the way my mind is set. I'm so scared as I feel that my whole past life was a lie and everything now is just horrid and painful. I'm not sure what to do but I'm trying to keep myself from doing anything I can regret. I'm not sure how this works but if anyone could give advice that's great. If no one can't do anything then I'll make sure to delete this post cause people here are depressed enough and don't want my sob story dumped on them.
