I'm not suicidal anymore. I just want to die. Reason I haven't killed myself yet because when I see if anyone has done it before they either failed or it was painful. Life is just one slow death.I thought of taking some pills and drowning in a bathtub or black out and drown in the bathtub. Nothing is helping. I guess the fear of failing suidice is the reason I'm here. I don't wanna be here anymore but i have to. I got no other choice besides dying in a accident or something like that. It's werid that I've never been this hopeful to die. Idk maybe I'll regret it. Maybe when I'm laying on the concrete floor. Bleeding screaming people running towards me. Idk i should be grateful for life.
