Need help before a family friend fades away.To the point because I need answers right away. She lives in Pennsylvania and is saying her only chance to recover from wanting to kill herself would be to go away somewhere for a while (like a retreat or a rehab place or something). She does not want to go to a hospital somewhere but i dont know if there is somewhere like a facility she can go to for being suicidal. Her son died of an overdose but before he did He was sent to Passages in California and she said about how he was so happy when he came back from there and i think she is looking for something along those lines, but like i said, i wouldn't even begin to know if that exists. Can you guys help me as quick as you can?
