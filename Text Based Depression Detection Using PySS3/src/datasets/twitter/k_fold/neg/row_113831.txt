4 months ago I promise myself I would end it if it hadnâ€™t gotten betterWell surprise it hasnâ€™t. Iâ€™m so depressed but literally know one knows because every time Iâ€™ve tried talking I pussy out and say I was joking or I was just tired people actually believe me too soâ€¦ 4 months ago I told myself that when I got my drivers license I would crash my car into a tree or off a cliff or something to end it and make it seem like an accident so my parents arenâ€™t â€œsadâ€ but they just will keep calling me a disappointment, unmotivated shithead. I have actually started talk to a girl I like she seems to like me as well which is nice but thatâ€™s the only thing thatâ€™s gotten better out of so many things that have gone to complete shit. I have started doing nothing in classes I went from a 3.8gpa advanced only classes to like a 3.0 no adv class and no doing anything in them just sitting and sleeping in them. 

I have had suicidal thoughts sense I was eight, EIGHT years old I had no fucking childhood Iâ€™ve almost always been depressed Iâ€™ve a couple of happy days sometimes even a happy week

Iâ€™ve literally spend hours mad at myself before sleeping just wanting to never wake up again. I havenâ€™t cried since like 13 or 14 but a week or two ago I cried myself to sleep Iâ€™m such a pathetic piece of shit. No one will ever love me. I honestly just want all this pain to go away any way possible, also one of my moms friends did it and she cried for 3 days straight but now hasnâ€™t talk abt her or cried over her or probably even remembered her so Iâ€™m pretty sure if I did it everyone would be sad that Iâ€™m dead for maybe a week then no one would even care or remember me

Any way I get my license this Monday and I think that in a month when Iâ€™m driving alone Iâ€™ll probably drive myself off a cliff. 

TL:DR :fuk this bs life shit I want to die and never come back it hurts so bad just make it stop
