I made someone kill themself, and I feel I should do the sameNow Iâ€™m not sure if they actually killed themself or not, but I think they did. This happened just a few hours ago, but Iâ€™m not going to get into too much detail. I pissed off a friend so bad that they said they were going to kill themself. I tried talking to one of their friends for help, but they told the friend that they had poured gasoline in themself, and thatâ€™s the last thing the friend heard. Iâ€™ve been extremely depressed the past few days, and I just want to fucking die. Thereâ€™s just too much shit going on that I canâ€™t handle, but honestly Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to actually kill myself. But idk what to do anymore, I really donâ€™t. Iâ€™m going to live with this guilt for the rest of my life, but I canâ€™t handle the guilt, I just want it all to end.
