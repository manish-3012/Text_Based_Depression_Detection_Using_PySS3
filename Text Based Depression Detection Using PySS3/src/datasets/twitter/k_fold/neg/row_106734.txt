Well, Iâ€™m out of options.Went to college when I was too immature to do so, and have flunked ~30% of my courses since 2nd year. First year I did great because my girlfriend at the time hyper organized my life for me and I wanted to impress her so I busted my ass. Thatâ€™s the last time I ever saw a 4.0. I found her in bed that summer with our roommate, and that crushed me. Obviously I left her after that, but losing that once source of organization I had created disastrous consequences, as I moved in with a friend who was in my classes, but far away from school. I figured GREAT, well both go in the morning together and keep each other focused. Unfortunately he didnâ€™t give 2 fucks about school and I started skipping as well. Without his car it was a 35 minute bus ride at best, so on days with bad weather I started to skip as well.

 After that I knew I should leave, but couldnâ€™t get a job better than minimum wage because I donâ€™t own a car. And had t considered the military/AF/Navy at the time. 

Iâ€™m About to flunk another 2 course this week. Iâ€™m now about to finish my 5th year with a 2.5gpa and still 5 credits shy of finishing my degree. I FUCKING HATE my degree, but I was to busy being depressed to do anything productive about it. Now Iâ€™m stuck with an irredeemable grade in a field I want nothing to do with (finance) got get me wrong, I used to find the market very exciting, but accounting makes me want to blow my head off and more accounting is used than i know what to do with.

I was supposed to be able to do anything, I had 148 IQ (clearly not anymore) was the varsity captain of 2 high school sports teams that won multiple state/provincial championships, finished in the top 1% in national math contests, got a 1560 on the SATâ€™s without studying, the world was my oyster. Only caveat was a bad case of ADHD.

My dad always paid for things for me (for necessities, Iâ€™ve had a job to support myself/living arrangements since Iâ€™ve been 14), and while heâ€™s a great guy and I love him dearly, he was never around, I saw him maybe 3 days per month. Why is this significant? Because my mother is a chronically depressed, bipolar disorder career failure (and she might even be smarter than me) . So I spent most of my childhood with my mom in bed until 4-5 pm at which point she would grab a bunch of food and sit in front of the TV. I had to learn how to cook my own meals at 6 year old, and for no reason, we werenâ€™t even poor, (thanks to the divorce settlement).

She was incredibly emotionally abusive my whole life growing up, and I didnâ€™t want to be anything like her. I was way to embarrass to ever have friends over because there would always be stacks of dirty food containers everywhere and sheâ€™d go days, sometimes weeks without showering. It really emotionally stunted me, as i always felt inferior to other kids, no matter how good my life was. Super glad I picked up all of her traits anyway (except for how I treat people, thatâ€™s the one thing thatâ€™s different).

Got involved with some stupid people started doing drugs as a way of escaping my problems instead of dealing with them (mostly pot and cocaine, but other things too) I got clean at the start of this year, but too little to late, all it did was clear my mind enough for me to realize how fucked I am. Iâ€™m way behind all my peers, even though I was supposed to have the biggest potential of any of them.

I canâ€™t imagine being a bigger letdown to my Dad, siblings, friends or myself than I already have been. I should have gone into the military when I was 19-20, gotten my head on straight and learned how to be a goddamn functional human being. Now Iâ€™m turning 24 with a 87.5% of a degree and the worst transcript youâ€™ve ever seen on your life. (No actually, like 8 Fs and 4 Ws)

I was actually going to drop out a the start of this year and do exactly that, but while getting in good enough shape again I slipped 4 vertebrae, which then lead me into the darkest depression yet. Now with a medical history of depression, and the inability to pass the fitness test, thatâ€™s completely ruled out.

In hindsight I think I would have loved to be a pilot, Being on the move all the time would have been great for me, and I kind of like small group of known colleagues better than a big group of office worker anyway. But that ruled out too, Iâ€™m a little old to be pursuing it as a commercial pilot (24) especially when you consider the cost (since as I said before I canâ€™t even enlist in regular forces, let alone a highly competitor pilot program.) and again my medical situation DQs me.

Even if I got a job with my hilariously bad transcript, I know that I wouldnâ€™t enjoy it in my chosen field (Iâ€™ve done the internships). 
More school clearly isnâ€™t the answer, Iâ€™m not able to apply myself at it anyway, and I wonâ€™t be able to get a loan anyway.

So now Iâ€™m completely fucked, and destined to spend the next decade of my life earning less than 1/4 of what someone with my potential should be earning. That wouldnâ€™t be such a tough pill to swallow if I actually liked what I was doing, but I donâ€™t. 

The only conclusion Iâ€™ve got is at this point, Iâ€™d much rather be dead than alive and wasting anymore of peopleâ€™s time and effort. 

The world doesnâ€™t need anymore â€œbrilliantâ€ losers and my health has massively deteriorated to the point where all those prime physical attributes I once had are gone. Still coordinated, not scared of heights etc, but Iâ€™m weak as shit, slow as shit, have shit cardio and always have pain from my back (chiro/physio didnâ€™t do shit). 

My best friend was murdered a few years ago and I think this is what set of this spiral of self destruction, but Iâ€™ll never know for sure. All I know is Iâ€™m ready for it to end.
