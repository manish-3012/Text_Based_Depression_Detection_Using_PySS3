I can't do it anymoreIm sorry if this doesn't make sense. I can't sleep and its 3am where I live and I just started crying because I can't do it anymore. I can't go on. I feel hopeless. My life is falling apart. I can't go on anymore. I feel so lonely. I have no one to talk to. I lost my job because I can't control how I act because of my mental illness. I'm doing horrible in college. I'm failing every class I'm taking in college. I dont know what to do anymore. I  I have no one in my life. I want to end it all. I want to tell my therapist I feel suicidal, but I can't because then I have to be hospitalized and I dont want that.  just feel hopeless. I feel that everything is going wrong in my life at the same time. I feel so lonely. I have no one.
