Can't stop feeling depressed.Hi, i'm 17 and from the UK.

For the past 6 months or so I've began to feel increasingly depressed, i can barely sleep, i'm hardly hungry and when i do eat, i often feel sick.
I'm a closet-gay in denial and crave a relationship.

Each night i try to cut myself trying to make me bleed just to take the though of life away, I've got no life prospects, i'm not doing too great in college, i'm scared to actually become an adult and have to force myself to live a life i don't want. 

There really is no reason to live, i'm going nowhere fast. What's the most painless way to kill ones self?
