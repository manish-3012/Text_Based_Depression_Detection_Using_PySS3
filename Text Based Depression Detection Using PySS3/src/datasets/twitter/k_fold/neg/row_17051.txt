"Slow burn" suicideSo this is probably how it'll happen.

I don't think I have the guts to hang myself (I hate myself for it). I don't have access to a .22 caliber pistol. I have failed in slitting my wrists a few times, not going quite that extra mile of severing arteries, only nicking them.

I'll probably end up overdosing again, or exposing myself to phenol. Something to cause organ failure. It'll be painful as fuck, but I think part of this is for the pain, part of it is to be able to tell myself that I finally did it.
