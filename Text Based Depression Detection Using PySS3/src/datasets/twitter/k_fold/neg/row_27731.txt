Male 27. Been depressed for a couple of months following split from the my gfWe split up. Was my fault. Texting other girls and she found out. Now im dealing with being a piece of crap that hurt her so much. Been drinking every night since. As it makes me numb. I just wanna stay numb  for ever. I just think it would be better if i wassnt around
