Gonna try to make my last memories warm and fuzzyI want Friday to be my last birthday. My whole life has been leading up to this moment, pure misery in its entirety and me too much of a coward to go through with it. Abused, neglected, hated, alone. My body is scarred, mind empty, heart broken. And I think I've found the ideal time to finish it off. 

My two best friends will be there hopefully, it'll be just us since the pandemic, which is fine, since they're the only two people I really care about deep down. I love them more than anything, but their love for me can't hold back the tide of unrelenting hate that I have for myself. I feel so horrible for hurting them, they both struggle with ideation and one attempted recently.  It's likely I might inspire them to try again. But if anything, in my dark twisted mind I feel like a suicide together would be the greatest way to display our love for each other, even if it wasn't all at once. But I'm to much of a coward to ask if they want to form a pact, so I guess I'll just have to imagine.

So I plan on spending that evening together, giving them both a kiss and hug before they leave, and once they're gone, I'm gonna upload video of a song I wrote, a kind of note for anyone that needs to know why. After that... [specific method redacted]. I might mix it with something to make it a bit more palatable, but it's more than enough to kill me. I have a sad playlist lined up, so I can vibe before I slowly become delirious, throw up a bunch, pass out and have my heart stop, or at least go into aggressive liver failure. It'll be quite fast, all things considered, though still take a while before I'm unconscious. But at least I'll be far too delirious to be in any pain or panic and to call for help like I did at my last attempt.

It'll be a tragedy for sure, and I pity anyone who has to come deal with my corpse. I'm gonna set my phone to autodial 911 the next morning so at least I don't rot or anything. But all in all it'll be a great way to end the year, and my life, and my own sad song â¤ï¸
