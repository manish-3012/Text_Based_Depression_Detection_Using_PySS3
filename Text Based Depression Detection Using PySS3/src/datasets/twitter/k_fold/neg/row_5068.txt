Why can't we choose when we want to leave painlessly and without the fear of failing?I am tired of life...I hate myself, my whole face, my head and everything and it will never change I  tried everything, I tried getting help, thinking positive, doing some sports etc but I am back again in the same shi\*\*...I don't want to live I just want to go to bed and never wake up...why can't we choose to die painlessly...why we must hurt ourselves badly to actualyl die and be scared of failing???

I don't understand it...
