Just waiting for them to leave.My parents are leaving for church in a couple of hours and I'm going to hang myself while they are gone. I've tried to kill myself on several occasions lately. I'm under supervision every second of everyday except for when they go to church. I'm not worried about how this will make anyone feel. I have no future. I've thought about this a lot and I am ready to just get it over with. Goodbye.
