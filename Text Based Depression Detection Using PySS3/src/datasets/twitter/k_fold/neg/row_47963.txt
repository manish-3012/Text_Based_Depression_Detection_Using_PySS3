I feel like I set others back and I'm just in the way.I can't work, I can't do a lot of chores, I have to have help with a lot of things, and I give nothing in return and I don't know if I ever will be able to. I feel like I have no purpose other than to take up space.

Thanks for the downvotes and no help. Why even try?
