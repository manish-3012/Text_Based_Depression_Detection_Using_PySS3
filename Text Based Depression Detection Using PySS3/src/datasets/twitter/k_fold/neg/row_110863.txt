Middle aged and already doneNevermind.  There is no "help" here.  Every once in a while I write in some forum out of desperation but the reality is from seeing hundreds if not thousands of people posting is that it is hopeless.

This place and others like it are full of suffering people...and people trying to feel like they are doing something by saying "we care" and "it get's better keep trying" and other such bullshit.

I am 40 fucking years old and it hasn't ever gotten better.  Never.  

It's not temporary...or attitude...or going to change because you say some shallow nonsense.

I hope every one of you who do this crap end up suffering what we do so you can see how aggravating your patronizing bullshit is. People never learn unless THEY feel it.

Actually help or shut the fuck up...but stop parroting ridiculous non helpful sayings and crap.  And if you need to ask "what can we do?" then you shouldn't be talking at all.
