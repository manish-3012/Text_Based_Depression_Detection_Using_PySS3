i'm sick of feeling nothing im so fucking tiredi'm 18. I still live with the person who sexually abused me as a child. My dad doesn't give a shit, tells me "Its life. deal with it". Mom can't do anything about it. I am fincially dependent on these abusers. I am stupid as fuck. I have no fucking social skills and scared of everything. I'm such a pussy. Everyone knows it. 

I have no one. I just want someone to love and understand me. My therapist is pratcially paid to listen to me its not like they give a shit.

I am tired of feeling nothing. No one gives a fuck. I hurt others and they hurt me. I can't do anything. I'm stuck in this loophole.
