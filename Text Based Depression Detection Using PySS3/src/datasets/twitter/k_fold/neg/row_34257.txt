I just feel like I can never be in a position of success because of my past.Iâ€™ve been in a ton of fights. 

Iâ€™ve burned a ton of bridges. 

Iâ€™m a hypocrite. 

Iâ€™ve treated people ways they shouldnâ€™t be treated. 

Iâ€™m guilty for all of it. But I know thereâ€™s people in my past that when I get to be successful, the truth will come out. I feel absolutely horrible for everything Iâ€™ve done. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m a good person. Iâ€™ve been to therapy and I feel better temporarily but then once I run into one of those people who hate me for whatever reason, whether it be for standing up for someone else in a good way or getting messy drunk and throwing a punch. One part of me knows for a fact that no matter what, Iâ€™ll never be able to escape it with how connected the world is. Iâ€™ll could be on top of the world and then someone will bring up something I did when I was 19. 

No matter what, thereâ€™s someone out there whoâ€™s praying on my downfall and has the tools to do it. 

So whatâ€™s the point in even trying these days?
