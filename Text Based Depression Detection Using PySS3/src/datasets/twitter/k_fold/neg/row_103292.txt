I can't bring myself to hurt myself yetSometimes I'll drag the tip of a knife around my body, leaving a red line that goes away in a couple hours, but never breaking skin. At the supermarket I'll browse the liquor isle and calculate the cheapest way I could keep myself effectively unconscious for a week straight but end up not buying any. I'll sit with a brick in one hand, tapping the outstretched fingers of the other, wondering how many I could break with one quick strike.  
  
I crave the release of following through. It feels to me like the only thing that can give me any amount of relief. The part of me that stops the other seems to be getting less dominant by the day. I don't know what I'm going to end up like if I ever start down that road.
