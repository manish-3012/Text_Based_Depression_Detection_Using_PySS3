I need helpHello everyone, I have been a long time lurker and decided to finally write a post. 

I know thereâ€™s something wrong with me, however I donâ€™t know what it is. Ever since I can remember I have a really hard time being happy, Iâ€™m always in a bad mood on the verge of tears. I have been through a lot in life, my mom abandoned me when I was very small and recently tried to come back into my life saying she found God and needed my forgiveness, mind you Iâ€™m 30â€™years old. I have a son who is my life and world, his father was never involved. I met someone in a different country and moved to said country to be with this someone, to fill that void. He is a father to my son and loves him unconditionally... my fathers biological son was abusive and put me in the hospital several times. I just feel I can never quite get over my mom and my sons father, I feel like they killed me and somehow I am still alive. I went to therapy a while back and I was diagnosed as severely depressed and prescribed clonozepam and Wellbutrin. My now husband is aware of my pain and past, I told him about feeling depressed and he is very antiquated .. he says Iâ€™m depressed because I want to be. We are in constant fights, I cry everyday and one day he just said if I wanted to be ok with him I had to stop taking medicine so he threw my meds away.. that was 4 months ago... I stopped cold turkey. 

I try to be happy, I really do.. but thereâ€™s always something on my mind and I find myself feeling angry and extremely sad.. I try to hide behind a smile..
I constantly google symptoms and obviously I cannot diagnose myself, but I feel I am anti social, depressed, anxious, suicidal and Bi polar.. I just feel like the only reason to live is my son.. my husband is not supportive and expects me to be happy all the time, I try so hard but I just canâ€™t! I get along fine with his family, but being in a different country makes me go crazy! Theyâ€™re so different from me.. I thrive career wise and have goals in mind, but I just feel useless...  my son is a happy boy and I feel that if I divorce he will suffer tremendously since this is the only
Family he knows.. I feel like I want a divorce but I just cannot are my son suffer .. help.. I drink wine constantly and take benadryls at night to end my thoughts.. I never have a good nights sleep, I canâ€™t remember the last time I slept without having nightmares or weird dreams.. why am I like this
