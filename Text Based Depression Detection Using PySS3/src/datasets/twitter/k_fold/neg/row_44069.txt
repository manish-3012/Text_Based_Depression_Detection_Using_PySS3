I feel like its all been a lie..I just want to get my thoughts out. I don't know who to go to. I don't need reply or care really.. I'm 18 I just graduated high school and I've seemed to have always lived with depression. Everyone always said it will get better. Life gets better, and in a way they weren't wrong. My urge and need to die has lessened. Though I really wish it hadn't. My life has completely gone to shit. I'm living paycheck to paycheck trying to finance moving in with my girlfriend after she gets home from basic training for the army. I've never gone to bed hungry until recently. I've never limited myself to one meal a day because I can't afford it. I lay at home when I'm not working waiting for my motivation to come home because she's the only thing that makes me feel good for anything greater than a fleeting moment. I'm so disappointed in myself for not attending college yet, and I don't know if I ever will. Though I know I won't find life meaning without pursuing science. It's my only career interest. I'm looking forward to an empty life knowing there's only one option.. I know I could end all the problems and seemingly endless suffering right now, but I'm too scared. I'm only hoping I reach a breaking point and it gets the better of me. I don't want to watch myself get any worse, but there's really nothing I want to do I want to pursue a career in something I love but then I realize.. I don't love any of it anymore. I'm so hollow. I've become a man but my soul never grew with me. I'm basing everything I enjoy by the fact I used to. Please let tonight be my last, or give me the strength to make it so..
