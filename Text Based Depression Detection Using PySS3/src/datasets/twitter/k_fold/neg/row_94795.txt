What can you do if your friend attempts suicide?It was right at the end of summer, I had got a train back from a festival with him the day before and he was on some mega comedown. Next evening I get a call from his mum saying he is in intensive care having taken 96 codeine and drank a whole litre of vodka. By some miracle he is physically okay but he is a wreck and being his ex (broke up last yr tho) he has kinda latched on to me. I cant dissociate myself because I want him to be okay and I really want to help him however I can but I just can't without wrecking my own health.
