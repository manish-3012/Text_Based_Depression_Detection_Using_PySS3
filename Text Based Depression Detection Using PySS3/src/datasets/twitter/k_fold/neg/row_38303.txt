Have you ever been past the point of suicide?This is what I feel right now. It has nothing to do with mood swings or depression. I actually feel very good mentally as far as clarity goes. 

I'm just finding that I'm not surviving in this world. I'm very poor, my dad has Alzheimer's, my best friend has passed away, and I'm so deeply in debt paying for my education. I don't feel like there's anything left for me in the world and I can't escape the downward spiral. It's more painful than what I've felt during depression. It physically hurts me and I've stopped listening to others. It's the feeling of true failure. I've tried telling others that we're all in this thing together and we have to help one another. The response I get is what am I supposed to do? People don't know how to help one another?

I get it. There's no hope out there. We're all out there on our own and some of us make it and some of us don't despite all the sacrifice, effort, and never give up attitudes. I wouldn't quit either. I just know now that its not realistic for me and I'm only going through the motions. 

I feel like I'm in a world that's worse than what could possibly come after death. That hurts me to know that, but it's also relieving. 

I'm not suicidal. I'm just dead inside and trying to pass the time until some fortunate end. At least I got to live for a very short time in my existence and I'm cherishing those memories. 

The reason why I wouldn't do it is because if I did then some other person with the same feelings would end up a little more alone. I can't do that to anyone. I'm past the point of suicide. It's easier to say fuck it and sit here withering away staring at the wall. I'm that far gone and I'm here rambling for no reason. Dead in my mid 30s, but still breathing.
