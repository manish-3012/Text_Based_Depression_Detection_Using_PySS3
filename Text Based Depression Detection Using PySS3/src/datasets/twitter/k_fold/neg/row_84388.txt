I lost my dog on new yearâ€™s dayIâ€™ve been diagnosed with depression and she saved me so many times. Iâ€™ve been broken for awhile now but I stuck around for her and got help because I couldnâ€™t abandon her like that. She deserved the best care I could give her.

She was my proof of real love and goodness in this world, and sheâ€™s gone now. I was lucky to have loved her and been loved by her. She was taken by cancer, and we did our best to make her feel loved and comfortable until the end. Her last breath keeps playing over and over in my head.

I miss everything about her... I miss hugging her and feeling her fur on my face, the face she makes when she begs for treats, the way she always knows when Iâ€™m sad and lonely and need her love... I miss her so much.

Iâ€™m just waiting for her urn now. She was everything to me and I feel that Iâ€™ve done all I could in this life. I havenâ€™t accomplished much but Iâ€™m ok with that because I experienced love and pain this deep, and Iâ€™m ready to go. Thank you for letting me get this off my chest.
