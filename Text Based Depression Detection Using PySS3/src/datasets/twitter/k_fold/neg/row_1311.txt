I want to dieIâ€™m 19 and my partner is 29 he has an 8 year old daughter that I care for. 
He keeps bringing cocaine into our home not matter what I do to try and stop him. He sleeps all day and barely speaks until his friend comes or he  gets coke.
He makes me feel like Iâ€™m controlling for this. But he gets upset if I go out or see family (so I donâ€™t). Or he gets mad if work takes up too much of my time (he doesnâ€™t work).
I feel so bad about myself and I have lost all autonomy and I want to die.
Iâ€™ve had suicidal tendencies and have been on medication for as long as I can remember but never like this. 
I feel like thereâ€™s something wrong with me
