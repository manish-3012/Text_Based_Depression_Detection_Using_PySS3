so, this is adulthood ...i am 20 years old, still live with my parents, have a job but cannot afford to move out yet and i am a university student also (so i do not have the time for full-time employment and i study locally, so i do not see the need for accommodation) and have a best friend and a few other friends. i am very lucky to have all of these things in my life.

however, since leaving school; i am struggling to process more and more emotions of mine now and understand them. i was bullied all through school by mainly students and sometimes staff, i have had people betray my trust several or times, and i have lost several close family within months to years apart between each death, and now having the time to process it is making me very numb or sad and i very rarely feel genuinely happy.

i am very reserved if not in shy in-person depending on the mood i am in and the company and introverted at the happiest of times, but i feel so disconnected from the few people i love and care about.

suicidal thoughts plague my dreams and thoughts on the daily and chronically daydream on the daily and go to "my happy place" and know if i were to die tomorrow or soon; i would not care in the slightest.

i also want to stop drinking alcohol and caffeinated drinks for good too, i do not think they are helping my mental state; i live for the few i love and care for. i just want a reason to live for myself but i cannot think of anything and i am gradually losing interest in everything i enjoy. i even have erratic mood swings, i will be quiet then next hyper, and then low and or suicidal.

whoever takes the patience to read this and give any advice, many thanks; i hope you are okay and you are getting any help if you need it.
