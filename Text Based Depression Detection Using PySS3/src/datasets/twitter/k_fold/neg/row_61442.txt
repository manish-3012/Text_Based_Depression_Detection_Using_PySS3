Dignitas in SwitzerlandI have been reading about a group called Dignitas in Switzerland. They provide assisted-suicide via drugs that the "member" (you have to become a member) administers themselves. Anyone have any insight on Americans travelling there for this purpose? Apparently they have helped many British and German citizens pass peacefully.
