I canâ€™t clear my head.I made a new Reddit account so in case anyone I know sees this cannot act on it 


I am extremely heart broken. I have depression. And my suicide thoughts before my heart break weâ€™re insane. Now they are worse. I want to leave and not bother anyone anymore. I donâ€™t even want to say goodbye because Iâ€™m scared theyâ€™d call the police. I just had to ask someone if I tried would the police actually show up at my door, apparently they would. Followed by the â€œare you ok?â€ Question to which I lie and say â€œyeah it was just a silly questionâ€ then I wonder how Iâ€™d do it. Iâ€™ve tried several times in the last 3 months with sleeping pills but I just make myself sick and feel like a failure. I really think drowning would and is my easiest option. I live very close to a river and bridges. Iâ€™m so tempted to write a goodbye note to my family and loved ones and just do it. Iâ€™m just scared of failing. I want to die.
