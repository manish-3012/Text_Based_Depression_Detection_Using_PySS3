anyone have actual advice on what to do? I feel more like I'm GOING to do it than I ever have before and fear that I may not be here next weekIt's not even that I fully want to, I just feel trapped and I don't know what to do. On paper I'm doing better than  I have for like the past 3 or 4 years so it's not like this is in response to my position in life, but I feel so awful and like I just can't handle living. I want to do something to stop myself but I don't even know where to start, I live on my own (with a roommate) and I don't want my family to know what's going on, I'm pretty sure as far as they know I'm also doing really we but I just can't maintain the guise if happiness anymore. When I got home from class today I almost just brought my dinner straight up to the roof and jumped after eating but I was able to hold back but I really am not sure I can keep doing that for the next few days. I'm scared and feel like I don't have any options even though I know there are some but I don't even know what they are. I've been severely depressed since middle school and now I'm 20 but I've never been able to actually do anything about it, I really want a therapist but I have such terrible anxiety and trust issues that I can't bring myself to actually get one. Please I really need help and advice I don't know how to handle this.
