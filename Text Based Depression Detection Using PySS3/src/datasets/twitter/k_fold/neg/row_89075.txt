Iâ€™ve wanted to die since I was 8, why donâ€™t I just do it already.I donâ€™t understand it, Iâ€™ve got an ok life, Iâ€™ve got everything I need, but I just feel so fucking empty. Iâ€™ve been trying so fucking hard to be happy, but itâ€™s all just bullshit, no matter what I do I always come back to this. Thereâ€™s just no fucking point. WHY CANT I JUST BE FUCKING HAPPY? I should definitely just end it.
