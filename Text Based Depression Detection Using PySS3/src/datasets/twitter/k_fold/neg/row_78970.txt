I'm not worth it, I'm truly not.I'm not worth the air I breathe. I hate who I am, I hate who I've become, I hate the person I see in the mirror. I've become such an empty lifeless shell. I leech the happiness out of everything. I've ruined my life through apathy and laziness, walked through this depressing worthless life filled with this and that because woe is me. I can't stand myself anymore. I used to think I wanted to get better but I don't think I do anymore. I think I just wanted to finally give up. I've ruined every relationship and friendship I have ever had, even my own mother despises me. She regrets me. I'm jobless, with no transportation besides a bike in 100+ degree weather. Stuck in a home filled with conflict and negativity, but that's my fault. I'm the reason for the conflict, because I've become nothing but a piece of shit. 

I'm selfish and I can't even do that right. I don't deserve help, I don't want to be a victim because I'm not one. I did this to myself, and I've known this day was coming for a long long time now. I don't want to hurt anyone else but simply by existing I hurt them more. The least I can do is make it end. My birthday is coming up and maybe that's significant. Maybe its time to finally close that door. I don't even know why I'm here. I'm sorry but the world is truly better without me.
