Can anyone help me understand what the clarity feels like when youâ€™ve snapped?Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m there. You just kinda, mentally raise your arms

Feeling your spirit lift high into the air

Watching the world below you

Seeing other houses and cars. Little precious people bumbling about 

You see the smiles they see

You feel that spirit flood your senses, as it flows through you

Never staying 

You start to see distant countries come into view

Their differences look like swirls of exotic colors

No longer unique

You notice the worldâ€™s animals all skittering about in the shadows, rustling the worldâ€™s foliage

The perpetual hunt

You lift higher through the atmosphere mist

The cold floating dew zooms by on its way to Hawaii

Like it always does

Then you hear the screams 

The dog whistle frequency voices mortals miss

You can see clearly that humans are chaotic neutral

Happiness can only be bought with suffering
