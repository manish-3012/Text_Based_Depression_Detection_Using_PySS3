Too scared of death, too much in despair to live.I cannot believe I'll be a better person. I'm mostly useless to the people around me, and more importantly, I'm useless to myself. No one asks me for help about things that actually matter. I realize how needy this is. I wish I could stop feeling this way. Actually, I wish I could stop feeling at all. I don't care about being happy anymore. I know that's going to be impossible. I'd at least like to not bother the friends that do care about me anymore. I wish I could suffer alone in silence, at the very least... But I am too whiny.... Ugh, I'm pathetic. Nothing's going to change. I'll always remain a loser. Why do I even bother?

I know I'm going to fuck up every exam I take. I wish I could find the courage to take my own life....
