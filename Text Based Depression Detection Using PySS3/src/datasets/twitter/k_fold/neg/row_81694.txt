So painfully alone i want to die.Nobody is probably going to read this but I need to vent.

I have nobody and I never have. I have false friends but nobody to talk to, nobody to do anything with, my free counseling is finished so I don't even have a professional to talk to. There's nothing to do and forever to do it in. I just want a way out that works, I tried overdosing on paracetamol but failed like I do everything else so just wasted everyone's time. I feel so guilty for wanting to die but it's not like I have anyone who would care.

People always say to be who you are and that other people don't matter but I don't know who I am. I need other people to work that out but nobody wants to be with me. I have no friends, no relationships and my family are distant or abusive. I'm too ugly to make new friends because people just look down at me immediately, I'm a living joke.

I want to make a helium bag but just know I'd mess it up and survive like a vegetable. I want out. I hate me more than everyone else hates me. In fact I'd rather they all hated me but instead it's just indifference which is worst of all as I might as well be invisible or never have existed at all. I can bruise myself but I can never manage any actual damage.

People always say things will get better too. They haven't so far and there's no signs they ever will, I lack a personality and I like an appearance so there's no reason for anyone to actually speak to me. I just don't want to be alone or I don't want to be here.
