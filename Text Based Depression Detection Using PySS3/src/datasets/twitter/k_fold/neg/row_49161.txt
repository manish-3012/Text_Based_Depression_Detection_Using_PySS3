I can't do this anymoreI can't fucking do this anymore. I've been depressed since I could remember and I want to end it I can't do it. My childhood was shit and I'm still fucked up over it, I'm married but I can't provide for my husband when I'm like this-- he deserves better. Im a lazy shit head and no matter how hard I try im back to wanting to end it all. Maybe that's what I should have done all along. I was going to drink myself into oblivion tomorrow and take the entirety of the pain killers I have. I was never worth it, my family knows it, my husband knows I'm broken beyond repair. I just want this pain to end, these thoughts to be silence. Permanent silence.
