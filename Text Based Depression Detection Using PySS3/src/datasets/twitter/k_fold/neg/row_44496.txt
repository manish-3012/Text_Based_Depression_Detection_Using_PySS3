i want to kill myself obvious twi've tried to kill myself before, both in childhood and as an adult (I'm now in mid 20s).

i recently have been having some trouble with my partner of 8 yrs, went inpatient, they discharged me 48 hrs later still suicidal, i slept in shelter for a few days, got sick from stress, went back home. (this was all last week) partner's been fine i guess we're ok idek. got a job, first day was today, puked before shift, was sick bc of stress all shift but kept my shit together. went home, felt acutely suicidal still, then got text on phone that my only friend doesn't want to be friends with me anymore bc of the stress i've put her through by being so mentally ill rn.

really want to off myself right now. i feel like a huge fucking burden. i've never been able to hold a job so i tried to apply for disability earlier this yr. they denied, i appealed, then got my appeal paperwork a whopping 1 day before the deadline just the other day so that's fucked i guess. i don't even have the energy to call them to argue about it. i want to fucking die.

in the hospital just last week they used my past legal name (i'm transgender) and my past legal gender (it's all legally changed and has been for years, i'd been inpatient there before which is how they got my old info via my social sec #) repeatedly so ofc I filed a complaint. got it back in writing today that they never used my old name or gender and that i didn't meet with 1 of the people i know i met 2x. i've never had any issues with delusions or psychosis so unless i'm randomly tripping balls they're full of shit.

but i feel like i can't just traipse back to the ER like hey i want to fucking kill myself again because i was just in the hospital and obviously why the fuck would anyone believe me and i'm just being dramatic i guess. idk. shit's invalidating and fucked.
