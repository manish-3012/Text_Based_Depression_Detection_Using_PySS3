Iâ€™m only 18 but I think Iâ€™m done alreadyI feel like I have no choice. The adult world seems so impossible and scary to be a part of. Iâ€™m not like anyone I know. My family is oblivious to how Iâ€™ve been feeling since I was in middle school. I feel lost and like I have too many responsibilities that I have no idea how to handle. That I never even had a childhood.

I just ask myself what is the point of even trying to fix everything, if Iâ€™m only 18 and my body aches because of the stress I feel everyday. Too scared to drive, get a job, and even make friends. Feels like Iâ€™m too late. I have so many ambitions but Iâ€™ll let someone else dream them up, obviously I wasnâ€™t supposed to be the one to go at them.

I donâ€™t know what else to say, I donâ€™t know who to reach out to. Iâ€™m just scared that I might actually carry this out for real soon. I used to feel so confident that I wasnâ€™t like people that resorted to suicide. I want to just close my eyes and be in a different life. I know there are wonderful experiences out there. But they are out of my reach. 

At the end of the day I can finally find out wtf is on the other side. Whether or not ghosts are real and if it was all a dream or something. Scary af. No hate. Just cutting to the chase in a way.
