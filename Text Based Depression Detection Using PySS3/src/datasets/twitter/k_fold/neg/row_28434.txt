Alcoholic, need to find a new place to live, lost love of my life, mother in the hospital, lost all my savings, hate the world, can't hold on for much longer.  I have a four page rant about hating life and everything bothering me, but I feel if I ever post it here, then I'll be on my way out.  
Ironic, my "new" job gave me the idea of CO poisoning to end it.  
Can't fight the feelings of hate, despair and loneliness all at the same time any longer.  
I'm giving myself until next weekend.  
Edit: The only regret I'll have after, is abandoning my dogs.  Well, my ex's dogs, but she doesn't treat them right.  They won't understand why I've gone and haven't come back, and that tears at me.  
Edit: well, bye.
