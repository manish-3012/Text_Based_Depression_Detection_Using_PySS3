I'm tiered of fightingI'm tiered of waking up!!! I feel as if I'm fighting the weight of the world every day. Not well enough to work but apparently not sick enough not to, according to the denied disability. I'm always in pain. I have degenerative disc disease. Had a disk in my neck replaced and although it helped my migraines tremendously I still have a list of other alignments to work against. My lower back was untethered when I was younger due to tethered spinal cord syndrome. That hurts all the time. I've seen pain management doctors because the surgeon Says it would be more dangerous to go in there. I've been taking lyrica for some time now. and it helps but not enough for me to work. I could do something today that I will not be able to do tomorrow. I'm not lazy. I don't enjoy lying around like a lumb on a log. When will the light shine through. how can i be ok with this life. it's miserable. I'm miserable. i don't want to live this life.
