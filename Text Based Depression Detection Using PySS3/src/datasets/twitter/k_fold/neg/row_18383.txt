Needing someone to talk to.I want someone to talk to. Iâ€™m extremely lonely, and I am ready to surrender my dog at a local shelter here in san francisco. Then Idk how to deal with these negative emotions anymore. I cannot handle it anymore. I donâ€™t know what else to do. I feel closer to actually hurting myself.
