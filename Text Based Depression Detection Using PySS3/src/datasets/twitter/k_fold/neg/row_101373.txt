Please help meI've been hurting so much for what feels like an eternity. I've never been this bad before. I just cut myself for the first time in my 24-year life. It hurts and I can't stop trembling.  Everything that gave me comfort doesn't even work as a momentary distraction anymore. I listened to Muse earlier and I thought I was having fun singing to myself and then I just started to cry and grabbed a box cutter. My eyes hurt so much because they've just been closed because I've been lying in bed so much recently. I just told everything to my best friend on Facebook but she's asleep and I don't want to wake her up, and the thought of her reading everything I wrote makes me feel so guilty and like I'm going to vomit. It just makes me want to hurt myself more. My mind won't leave me alone. Please someone tell me this will stop.
