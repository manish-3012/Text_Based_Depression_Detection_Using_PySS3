Hopeful is an impossibility.I feel like thereâ€™s nowhere in my life that I can find hope anymore. Iâ€™m 21(f) and have no idea what I want to do with my life. Covid is rampant and given the way my fellow countrymen behave, it wonâ€™t go away for a very long time. Iâ€™m terrible in school, wasted two whole years on a major that I failed out of, and have a trashed gpa and student debt to show for it. I try hard at the community college back home but with everything online Iâ€™ve gotten even worse at comprehending and keeping up with classes. The only decent thing in my professional life that  I have going for me is my customer service job, which is going to be a dead-end for me soon enough. With all my bills and tuition, the money I make isnâ€™t enough, but I canâ€™t afford to take more hours because of school. At the same time
I canâ€™t cut down on school because then Iâ€™ll take forever to finish and finally get my degree. Everything is a catch 22, with no real solution in sight. 
Everytime I go online I see the police brutality and systemic prejudices against people of color and I feel so powerless to make any legitimate change or impact in the movement. People donâ€™t wear masks outside because of their â€œrightsâ€ and donâ€™t care about anyone else. 
Iâ€™ve got beef with my father for some of the poor ways heâ€™s treated me and he makes no effort to keep me in his life. My mother whom I live with is probably gonna get married to a guy Iâ€™ve never met soon and may move out of the country. 
Iâ€™m just so overwhelmed by everything and I feel like Iâ€™m drowning in my responsibilities, and canâ€™t find hope in any aspect of my life right now.
