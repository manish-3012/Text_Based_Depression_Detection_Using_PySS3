Hopefully Iâ€™ll get it right this timeSince I attempted to take my life on my birthday Iâ€™ve been so hollow and hopeless that Iâ€™ve been experimenting with alcohol combined with different types of doses of pills from my moms medicine drawer to finally keep me from ever waking up.  Tonight I drank a 6 pack of beer took about 4 temazepam and 6 tramadol. Wish me luck
