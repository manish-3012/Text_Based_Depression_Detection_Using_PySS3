I am buying a shotgun Friday and finally doing itThe longer I wait the more damage Iâ€™ll do. I have a 7 month old (biologically mine, but her father got mad because I went through his phone and found out he cheated, but either way Iâ€™m toxic and canâ€™t go on like this) he has a very good custody lawyer and I canâ€™t even afford one. He told me I will lose custody (due to depression of course) and only be able has supervised custody (he brings her and letâ€™s me see her a few minutes) but he recently told me that heâ€™s moving to New Jersey so I wonâ€™t even be able to see her. This is my reason for giving up. If I go away now, she wonâ€™t remember me and no harm will be done.

Everyone hates me and I have no friends, why do you think Iâ€™m posting on Reddit. This is a very loud cry for help that people will hear and choose to ignore. That is also why Iâ€™m finally killing myself.

The people I thought were friends turned out to be two faced. I mentioned one negative thing someone has done, (a girl kept calling herself ugly right after everyone told her she wasnâ€™t, I said that she was just wanting attention) everyone hates me now.

Iâ€™m going to fucking blow my brains out. And literally no one will miss me. I know after they find out I died theyâ€™ll say â€œyeah I knew she had a mental illness, she shouldnâ€™t have had a babyâ€ while sitting next to the guy that left her when she was 13 weeks pregnant, then came back just to cheat on her again. Heâ€™s a saint. Iâ€™m toxic. But the sooner Iâ€™m gone the less damage that will be done.

Hey troll me while youâ€™re at it
