I can't afford to get help because I have health insurance.I pay 600 a month for my health insurance, and it doesn't kick in until after I've spent over 6,000 dollars. I really need help bad but I can't financially afford it :(

My last trip to the ER cost me $1500 dollars and all I did was sit around on a psyche ward for 6 hours waiting to be seen.
