I have bipolar disorder and can't afford my medication. Being driven to insanity and thoughts of suicide from racing thoughts, anxiety, ect.I don't know how to describe how I feel. I can hardly hold a job due to my illness. I get such bad social anxiety that working a 9-5 seems almost impossible, but i'm trying. It makes it hard to connect with people. I used to be a very social person and was very outgoing until this mental illness took over. I can cycle between depression to a manic state all within a day. I think about suicide at least 1-2 times a day at the least. This has been going on for weeks. My mind is a mess and I don't know how to seek help or treatment. I have no insurance and can't afford to pay for a doctor visit. I feel fucked. I never used to be like this. I'm even starting to have a hard time connecting with some some of my best friends whom I've known for years. I'm fucking losing it.
