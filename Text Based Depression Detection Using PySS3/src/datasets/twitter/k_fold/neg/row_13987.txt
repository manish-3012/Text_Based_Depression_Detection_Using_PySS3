More of the same...suicidal...depressionI am in my early 20s and I really wish I could just go into my garage and turn the car on. I feel like such a drain on my family. I still live at home because I can't find a job. I tried to go to college a couple years ago, but I ended up failing out and just don't feel like wasting more money and time because I'm beginning to see I'm not smart enough to go to college for anything useful (the classes weren't hard but I just couldn't keep up). As much as I've looked for any shitty job I can get, I know the pay will be horrible, and I'm unlikely to get out of poverty. The thing is, I've seen how my parents are forced to live. They work way more than full time just to get by. They hate their jobs and it seems like the only thing they live for is go to to work. If that's what's in my future, I don't even want to be here for it. Another thing: I've always wanted to be a mother, but I refuse to bring a child into a situation where they're just as unlikely as I am to have a fulfilling life. I sort of resent my parents for having me when they knew they had no money. Don't get me wrong, I am very thankful they're worked like they have to provide enough for me to eat at least, but I see how overworked they are and they never have any time for family life. I don't want that life. I want children so badly, but I'd never be able to afford to give them a good life. As I said, I'm having such a hard time even getting a crappy minimum wage job, and I feel so guilty because I'm an adult and my parents still have to support me. Hell, even if I got a job at McDonalds, I wouldn't even earn enough for rent.

I do plan on killing myself someday, but my family has already lost so many loved family members, I can't do it to them, even though they'd really be better off if I never existed.
