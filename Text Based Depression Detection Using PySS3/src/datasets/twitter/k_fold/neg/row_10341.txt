iâ€™m so tired of being meiâ€™m so exhausted just dealing with myself, iâ€™ve never met anyone so stupid and useless and clueless and just all around annoying i canâ€™t stand who i am. i try so fucking hard to be normal, to not be like this but nothing helps. in the end iâ€™m a fucking piece of shit. my only solace is life is that if all else fails i can just kill myself, which is starting to sound more and more appealing.
