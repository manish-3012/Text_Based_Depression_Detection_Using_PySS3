I know how he felt nowMy husband died by suicide in June. Everyone tells me not to blame myself but I always will.
I feel like the walls are closing in on me now - raising the kids alone, bills, work is too stressful. Just about everything is crashing down on me.
I thought about jumping from out 13th floor terrace just now.
