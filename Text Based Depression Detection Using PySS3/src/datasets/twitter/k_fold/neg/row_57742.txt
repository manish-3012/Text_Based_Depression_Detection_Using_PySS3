no longer scared of suicidei attempted suicide twice last week and got really close to succeeding my first time, thinking i was absolutely dead until i woke up

im kind of disturbed by the fact of how peaceful it was and how comfortable i felt even after i woke up. after i came to i was kinda just like "oh ok w/e" and put my stuff away

nobody else knows, im not really sure what to do

i havent tried since or wanted to try as much but its still bothering me how easy i know it is now
