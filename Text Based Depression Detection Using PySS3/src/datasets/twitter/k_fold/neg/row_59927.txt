Passive Ideation17M, been feeling empty for quite some time. Can't seem to find motivation to do any of my schoolwork, which has put me in a hole. Parents keep screaming at me.

Today hurt because I was extremely hardworking (I felt) as a member of my school's math team this year and today we had our banquet and I did not get a single recognition. My coach said she needed more than the 3 awards allotted to us by conference to reward everyone who worked hard. But I think she's bullshitting. If I had earned it, if I had deserved it, why didn't I get it? I'd rather be told I didn't deserve it than be lied to and spared.

I also feel guilty because I run my school's drill team and due to a laundry list of factors (many out of my reach), we are doing terrible. I feel like I am letting down the rich legacy of the school and many of my friends who thought I would guide us to victory. I've planned all I can, but my wings are clipped. Something isn't clicking, and I feel responsible.

Despite all my hard work and hours put into both, I cannot seem to get any acknowledgement or the enjoyment I used to from them. I used to do them for me, now I do them so I don't get shit on by teachers, colleges, and friends.

I feel meaningless, so many if my goals feel unattainable, my job is killing me but I need to bring home money for my family. I don't want to kill myself because I've made myself too essential, but shaking hands with death sounds like a pleasant date now (another thing I have wanted but not had).

I guess I just needed to put this somewhere, I hope all of you are holding up alright. I'm a long time lurker, and many many things on here have inspired me to continue on. 

Bless all of you for your compassion and sacrifice, perseverance and understanding.
