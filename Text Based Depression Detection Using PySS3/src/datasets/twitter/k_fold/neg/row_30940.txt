I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.This post is probably going to be long so Iâ€™m sorry.
I am 15 and I have always hated my life. When I was younger my birth mother was extremely neglectful. She would have sex with alot of guys for money and that was just a normal part of my world. Later on she would start beating me and not allowing me to eat and eventually I was forced to do the same things with those men. I was taken out of the home years later and since then Iâ€™ve been in several different foster homes. Most of them would have me removed from their home because â€œthey didnâ€™t deal with cuttersâ€. After being moved so many times and self harming so many times I was moved to a facility where I finally got help and I felt like I mattered to someone. Once I left there I got put into another foster home (where I am currently) and I can say I truly love it here. They are so kind to me always and I love them so much. Shortly after moving in I met a friend online and we talked everyday and he just became my best friend. He always helped me when I felt sad or alone and he never asked for anything in return. But about a month ago he said we could no longer talk because Iâ€™m a minor and so he left me just like so many other people in my life. I just feel really hurt and Iâ€™m not sure what to do with my life anymore.
