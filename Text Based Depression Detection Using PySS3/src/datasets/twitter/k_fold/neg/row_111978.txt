Had a failed attempt, people are assholes.I've posted here before about how I'd be killing myself soon, and had a pretty traumatizing failed attempt since then. When I posted originally, a person contacted me trying to get my hopes up and everything. Tried to tell him the situation, that nothing could really be fixed. At first he was sympathetic. Every couple days he'd send another message asking how I was, and I'd just say I feel the same (nothing in my life is getting better, I have no motivation to try to better it because it's so hopeless, and I feel like I'd rather just not be around anymore). I had the failed attempt not long ago, and then today, he said how me thinking nothing is getting better is "just an illusion," in which I responded that nothing is getting better, and I'd still prefer to not be alive. Then he got very shitty, saying how I was just a waste of his time and taking his time away from his family (even though he really didn't spend much time messaging me). I explained how I was just at the end of my rope and preferred finality through death, and that him saying something like that was cunty, and he got really defensive. Just felt weird to get guilt tripped by some random just because I'm miserable and accepting of death. I still feel hopeless about everything because my circumstance is terrible, and it's weird how somebody knowing that could put me down and treat me like I was just a waste their time.
