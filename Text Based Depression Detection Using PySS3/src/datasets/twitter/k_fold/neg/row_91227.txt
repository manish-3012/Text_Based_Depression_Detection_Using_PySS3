My thoughtsSo I have a girlfriend who i love more than anything in the world i wouldn't give her up for anything but once a thought came into my head and now its popped up  again . I used to like this other girl way before but i couldn't have and when i first got my girlfriend i thought about that girl i used to like and the thought popped into my head that what if she made me happier and i should've went out with her instead and I'm not sure if the thought of regret came into my head but soon after i realised what i was thinking  and i instantly thought what the f*ck am i thinking. I love this  girl.though to pieces . I feel  bad about it because those thoughts aren't mine and the ones i don't agree with , my depression and anxiety dont help me atm with this now not sure if they influenced that thought then tbh. I feel guilty although they arent my thoughts I just want to be happy with my girlfriend.
