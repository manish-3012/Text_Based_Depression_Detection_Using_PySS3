Canâ€™t take the voices in my head anymore. I want to end it all.Iâ€™ve been having a lot of mental trouble lately. Whether Iâ€™m at work or just with my roommates, the voices tell me to say bad things... very bad, awful, illegal things that could put me in prison. I donâ€™t want to say them nor would I ever act on the thoughts EVER, but when I push the horrible thoughts away (I repeatedly tell myself â€œNoâ€ over and over again to try to get it off my mind), my mind pushes me to want to say them out loud. It feels almost compulsive. Itâ€™s especially bad at work. I donâ€™t want to go into details (too graphic and disturbing) but every time I interact with a customer, the voices start to tell me bad thoughts, and every time I tell myself no it pushes me to want to say it out loud. It brings me extreme discomfort and after the interaction I start to worry whether Iâ€™ve said it out loud or not and start to panic internally whether I did say it out loud and they will end up telling my managers what I said and call the cops and arrest me. Even when Iâ€™m with my roommates in silence, Iâ€™m still tempted to say things that would make them literally want to kill me or get me arrested. I canâ€™t take this anymore. My mind is turning against me and I donâ€™t mean anything that comes to mind and would never act on it, but Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll say the intrusive thoughts out loud and would ruin my life forever. Iâ€™m sick of this, itâ€™s an every day occurrence and itâ€™s driving me insane. I feel like the only way for it to stop is to off myself or be alone for the rest of my life with no interaction. Iâ€™m just sick of this shit, I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me.
