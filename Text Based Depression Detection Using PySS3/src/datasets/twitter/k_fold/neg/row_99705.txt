Reddit isnâ€™t helpingI created this reddit to feel understood by people who always suffer with major depression/ mental illness and suicidal thoughts. But I come on here and alll I see is sadness and people ready to give up. It ruins even my â€œnormalâ€ moments, which are already so fleeting. My heart goes out to everyone. I just donâ€™t know if itâ€™s healthy for me to come here and always see this stuff. Maybe itâ€™s unhealthy for all of us. Idk.

But if I leave reddit Iâ€™ll feel completely alone again. I donâ€™t fucking know whatâ€™s gonna help me. If anything.

But I really do want to be happy...
