I'm tired. I'm exhausted. I can't keep pretending anymore.So here I am. Drunk again, the incessant nawing thoughts of suicide screaming at me telling me how worthless I am and that I should just end it.

It's been like this for over 10 long years. I can't keep smiling anymore. I can't keep joking and pretending everything is ok anymore.

I'm exhausted and this probably will be the end of the line for me.

I'm sorry to all those I hurt. I'm sorry. I won't burden you any longer.

Goodbye...
