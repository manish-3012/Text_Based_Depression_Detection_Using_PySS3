How do you deal with feelings of racial inferiority?I'm a short Asian guy and when I see all these 6 foot tall blond, blue-eyed greek gods walking around on my college campus I feel like we're not even the same species. Like, how am I supposed to compete with them? Why would anyone choose the company of an ugly Asian goblin like me over theirs?

Honestly, I feel just completely worthless. Most other guys make fun of Asians like me because we're small and weak. Most girls think we're disgusting and ignore or actively avoid us. I think if all Asian guys just suddenly died one day barely anybody would actually care.
