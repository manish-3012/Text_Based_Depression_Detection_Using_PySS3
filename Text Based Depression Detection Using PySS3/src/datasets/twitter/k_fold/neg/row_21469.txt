Life and Death are too much of a hassleI've been in bed in the dark for the past two days. This is life leading to death. Oh well.

Not like I matter in the small or grand scheme of things.

What's another dead guy beside a funeral and a week of mourning. I'll be forgotten about soon enough, lost to the cruel current of apathy and time.

My only regret is no one ever came to say goodbye. I just faded from their lives. Coworkers, friends, family.

It's been years and not a soul reached out.

No texts, calls, messages, emails, letters, cards. Just me.

Alone.
