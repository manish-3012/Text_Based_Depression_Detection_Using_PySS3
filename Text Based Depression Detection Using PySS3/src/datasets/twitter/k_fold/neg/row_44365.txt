Sometimes I wish I wasn't so different than everyone else.Sure, I'm interested in politics and talk about it here and there on Reddit, but in actuality, I'm nothing but lonely, sad and depressed.

I've gone through enough in life as it is, and I've made tons of mistakes on my own. No matter how I hard I try, I will never have a normal, ordinary existence and society will always continue to reject me for me being me. 

I just wish life wasn't this difficult. Seriously. If life was more accommodating to people like me, perhaps I wouldn't be living like this.

Sometimes I just wish I wasn't ever born as a human being. Being a human is difficult and tough as it is.
