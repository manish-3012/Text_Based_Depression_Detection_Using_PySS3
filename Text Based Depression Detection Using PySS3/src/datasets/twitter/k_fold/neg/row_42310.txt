i cant do this for much longeri just want to put this down so its on record i guess one day when i go through with it. my life has been winding down from the moment i was born - ive done nothing but made the lives of everyone around me harder. my parents, friends, boyfriend, etc.
dont tell me im wrong; you dont know me.

recently i think about how i cant do this anymore with increasing frequency. ive been in pain for so long and nothing is going to make it better enough for me to be able continue for any substantial amount of time. ive been sick since forever and its killing me - its *been* killing me. i wanted to die in january of 2018 and i was hospitalized. it was one of the worst experiences ive ever had. ive been to so many counselors/therapists/whatever else over the years and it hasnt helped. ive taken a few medications only to quit them cold-turkey. no one can help me. i started dating someone wonderful and all ive done is bring down his quality of life, i make him frustrated and upset and he cant help me either. i end up hurting and cutting myself alone so i can keep going and i dont know what for anymore. i really dont. 

theres more to it all, more than i could fit into a post or share with strangers on the internet, but i just wanted someone to know a bit about how i was feeling. maybe in the future someone who knew me would look back on this for insight. im alone tonight and i cut myself again and i have to wake up early tomorrow and i hope that when i fall asleep eventually, i never have to wake up again.
