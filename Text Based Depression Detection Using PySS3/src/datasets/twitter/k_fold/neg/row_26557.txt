I have written my suicide note last nightHey. I finally wrote my suicide note last night and I have a plan to commit suicide today but I am scared. I know for a fact that I want to kill myself but I am so afraid of failing my attempt and I don't know what to do. I've tried everything before counselling, anti depressants and stuff but nothing has worked for me. It's gotten to the point where I can't sleep anymore due to suicidal thoughts but now that I'm actually prepared to do it I'm so scared. I feel so weak and pathetic and I just can't stop crying. I don't know what to do.
