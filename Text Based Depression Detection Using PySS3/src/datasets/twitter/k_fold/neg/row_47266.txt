My life is slowly crumblingMost things I've ever done were wrong. I always end up repeating the same mistakes, over and over again, to the point that right now I'm very lonely.

I fear abandonment so much that I closed my heart, so that I couldn't befriend someone and then experience that friendship dying up if something went wrong.

Most of the time I'm just a background friend, a classmate, an acquaintance and so on. 

I've seen inside of me, and what I saw freaked me out... Deep inside, I'm insecure, nervous, anxious, inmature, annoying, condescending, envious, depressing and overall toxic.

I have drifted away so much that I don't know how to start fixing my life. I wanted to talk to a psychologist about everything, because I'm tired.

I don't want to end up alone, I don't want to die lonely, forgotten and unloved, I want to stop feeling suicidal thoughts every year, I want to be truly happy again...
