HopelessI will hopefully succeed in my attempt. I am tired of the emotional anguish. I don't feel like repeating myself...go look at my most recent postings over in bpd subreddit. 
My meds clearly don't work. Been on a new dose almost 4 weeks..they say it takes 4 to 6 weeks to notice anything. Only thing i have noticed is im tired of this bullshit. I don't want to med hop or try a new med just to not have it work. It would be months before i could see my primary doctor or even a psych doctor to get something new and i CANNOT wait that long feeling like this.

Im going to refill my xanax. Get a bottle of wine. A trash bag and a zip tie...all those will hopefully do the trick. Drive to a secluded place...i made the mistake of bringing my phone last time i attempted. I texted goodbye and they called me by than i was dissociating from emotions from being too overwhelming

I fucked up my life anyways. Just wish i could transfer my remaining years to someone who could use them. 

My one glimmer of hope is that therapy on Wednesday will go awesome and i won't lose my best friend..  But i am such a fuck up. I ruined everything with my best friend and i can't take it anymore.
