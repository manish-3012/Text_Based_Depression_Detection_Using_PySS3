I can't take school or life anymoreI really want to kill myself.  I am tired of having to live life with a family who hates me, but I know will miss me if I leave.  Them and a boyfriend who loves me are the only reasons I'm staying.  I am sick of failing everything in a major that's too hard for me, but I like it and I don't know what else to go into.  I just don't want to live life anymore, I was googling ways to kill yourself, and I think CO sounds the best way.  I don't have many friends-if I didnt have a boyfriend who has a lot of friends I wouldn't do anything in life...

I can't get through finals.  My last one is today...who knows maybe after it I'll be ok, but right now I have seriously thought about jumping in front of a bus on my walk to my dorm and doing a bunch of other things.  I couldn't stop crying when my boyfriend left bc I knew it might be the last time we are together ever.

TL;DR: Pressures of school is too great
