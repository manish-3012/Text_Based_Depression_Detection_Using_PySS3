Going to kill myself tomorrow at 12:00 PMI told myself I wouldn't do it until the end of the year. I only ended up feeling worse. Now here I am. I'm going to kill myself tomorrow (Sunday, January 1st) at 12 PM. I guess I'm posting here as a last effort so see some reason to not do it.

EDIT: Adding what I posted down there to the OP so everyone sees it...

Thanks for all the replies, it means a lot. I talked to a few people here and I'm not going to kill myself tomorrow... again, thanks &lt;3 Happy new year, everyone!

12:30 PM my time. Thanks again everyone.
