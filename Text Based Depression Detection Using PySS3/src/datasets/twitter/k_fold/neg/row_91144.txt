I promised. (Drafts)Iâ€™m finally living reasons to stay for myself. I found a good mix of medication after 12 yrs. I have the right to self love, self care, and good things. I am safe now. 

Saved in my drafts from winter:

â€œI promised my son I wouldnâ€™t kill myself after a few parents [committed suicide] died. â€œWhy canâ€™t you stay here for yourself?â€ Iâ€™m staying here for him. I canâ€™t even pretend to have an answer anymore. I donâ€™t say anything, which is what the Drs do to me.â€

I almost left. Sigh.
