I'm going to do it, it's just a matter of when at this point.I'm trying. I swear. I don't deserve to take any attention off those in dire need, but honest to God I just had a moment where it felt like I let go of everything. I've faced moments where I had an internal war waging against my will to live or die, it's usually at my breaking point. At the last second I reach out for help. I hate it, but it's happened twice. Twice when it got so bad that either I got help or "gave up". Tonight was different.

Instead of the turmoil and desperation spanning from weeks to months, tonight it took seconds. Minutes at most. I felt like I didn't have breathe anymore, my heart felt so light- I just didn't care anymore. I don't know what triggered it but the second "my thoughts" swooped in to weigh me down, it was like in that same instant my heart TRULY said fuck it. I'd probably be dead or dying if I had anything nearby. 

It's not the first time it's happened, and I doubt it'll be the last. With these feelings and my typical suicidal ideation, it's gonna fucking break me. I'll be a statistic, and no one will remember me in a few years. My family will heal, but besides that I'm no one doing nothing important. There's just something seriously broken with me, medicine doesn't help. I can't feel loved around loved ones, always feel lonely in a crowd. I'm just here for the ride and bracing for the crash. I'm ashamed, but this is how I feel.

I'm safe for tonight as far as I can tell. I'm sorry
