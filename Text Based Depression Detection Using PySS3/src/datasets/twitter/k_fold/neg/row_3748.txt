Whatâ€™s going on? (Please help)Iâ€™m seventeen and Iâ€™ve been having a tough time lately hereâ€™s why...
My girlfriend only loves me for sex, I work at a chicken place, Iâ€™m a failed photographer, my parents like my brothers more, my friends donâ€™t want to hang out as much, School is okay but itâ€™s gotten into the same boring routine, Iâ€™ve failed the people I know and I think Iâ€™ve pushed the good ones away. I really donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this but I feel like I need to be proactive so I donâ€™t end up doing anything in the future. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do for college and I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m interested in anymore. I feel cut off from the world. I have some anger issues but usually just end up punching my legs or places on my body I can hide it. I need help.
