I don't like feeling like this. I've been depressed for years. It comes and goes. Some days are better than others. I have an excellent SO who is my only anchor in this world. I don't have religion (nor want it). I don't have kids (nor want them). I have family, but I'm not close (nor care to be). I mean, they are nice and loving. But their beliefs make my head hurt sometimes (my mother believes in miracles and that the Virgin Mary communicates to her through dreams. My family only encourages this.)

Life just seems like a big pointless hassle. I'm broke. I have a job. I have lots of bills. I don't have a lot of friends. I mean I know plenty of people but I'm not good at making friends. Because I prefer to stay at home. I'm very much an introvert. Being around people too much just wears me out. The two things I enjoy in life: being around my boyfriend and playing video games. That's it. But, honestly if that's all I've got to look forward to, what's the point? 

I didn't know if I ought to post here because I am not planning on killing myself or anything. But, I would honestly rather not be living. I think I would probably fail if I tried to kill myself and that would just be even more hassle. Dealing with more people. So, I don't entertain the idea of trying. But I lie in bed and I think, I just wish I were done. I wish it was all over.

I don't like feeling like this. Nothing that anyone has said, oh you're beautiful, you're wonderful, you're intelligent, you're awesome. Nothing actually makes me feel better. Because who cares if you're beautiful and wonderful. In the end, nothing matters. Nothing changes. I'm beautiful and wonderful and sad and broke and alone and I can't do a damn thing about it.
