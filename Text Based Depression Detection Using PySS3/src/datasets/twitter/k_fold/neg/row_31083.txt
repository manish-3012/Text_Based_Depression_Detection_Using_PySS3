Im so so close.I was another minute away friday night. I wouldnt call it an attempt but was damn close. I just cant do it. Im so weak it's insane. Theres 1 thing holding me back and when I come to terms with it Im gone. All I see, think, hear is death.

Ive lived my life so apathetic. Its coming back to bite me. I grew up rich. But with a manipulative father and complaicent mother. Ive been physically assaulted by my sister twice. I never went to college. I told my (now ex) girlfriend of 5 years how fucking shit I was feeling and she thought that she should leave me because of it. 

After work tonight Im going to see how it all plans out. See how much it hurts. I wish there was an off switch that made me not wake up tomorrowm. But no. I have to painfully OD or put a bullet in me to reach a better place.
