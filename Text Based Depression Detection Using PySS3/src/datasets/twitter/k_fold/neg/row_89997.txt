How do you know how serious you are?I started thinking of suicide back in high school (~10 years ago) but it was more of me trying to run away from my problems. I didn't have a solid plan ("oh, I suppose I'll just [REDACTED] or whatever"). I was sad most of the time, I would cry in my room. But that was it--I wanted to die but I didn't take myself seriously, I didn't harm myself.


When I got to college I did more research. Pills won't work, cutting won't work. I figured [REDACTED] was the most accessible to me but I was scared someone else might die if I did it. So I stuck it out.


I suppose I should say at this point no one believes I'm suicidal. I posted an angry note on facebook one time and my mom was more worried about her image than my well-being so fuck that. I told her I wanted to see a shrink but she just brushed me off.

Anyway, that was a few years ago. I still want to kill myself--this time I'm thinking of [REDACTED] I'm still working out loose ends. I feel like this is it but how do you really know? I feel numb. Idk.
