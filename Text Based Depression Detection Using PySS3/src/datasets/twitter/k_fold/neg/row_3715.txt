To Everyone in SuicideWatch, can we fix these numbers a little? (I realize mine wasn't frontpage either at the time)http://i.imgur.com/Neblk.jpg_x000D_

If we have more people checking /r/Depression also, we might be able to stop the OP from even going to /r/SuicideWatch, but instead be there in the beginning, that way the more they can talk and get help the less likely they ever consider Suicide. Thanks, let's go help some people.
