I hope it's cancerBeen a smoker for over a decade. For the past few month I've noticed some inconvenience in my throat, well this reddit isnt about medicine so I'll just say I've noticed early signs, have looked it up and it matches. But maybe im just being hypochondriac. I should just have it checked, but i simply can't right now. Im just out of a huge failure that is gonna reshape my entire life for the worst, im about to loose the margin of independance that i somewhat had, going back to living under my mother's roof. I am financially broke and have been for a while, It's a matter of days until the bank just freezes my account and ban me. I couldnt take a bus to get to a doctor and I'm in a foreign country, far from family. I've been walking down that road for a long time, I've been depressed for almost as long as I've been smoking, i think I'm some kind of bipolar shit.

So now here I am, staring at the wall as shit's going down on me and not doing anything, just waiting for the crash. The only thing I'm currently capable of making plans for is hanging myself but im fucking scared of doing it.

So if I end up checking my throat, i hope it's cancer and i won't treat it, cause that would be a passive way out, and my family wouldnt have to deal with an active suicide.
