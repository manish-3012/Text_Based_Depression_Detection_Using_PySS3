What was the reasonPeople ruined my life, taken everything away from me, and keep doing it, wont let me die. All I wanted was to work, help people. And people just drain me dry. All I wanted was life. Ten years of destroying my existence. And all I wanted was life. All I wanted was what everyone else has. I wanted to create a place for people to better themselves. And what do I get in return people who pretend to be my friend. People who drain me of everything and I donâ€™t mean money but that too. They drain the nature meaning and love and all of it. What was the reason. Why did you people ruin my life. I couldâ€™ve at least had a decent life if not actually have achieved my goals of helping others. What was the reason. Or maybe there is no reason besides they didnâ€™t like me. Maybe my life was ruined because I wasnâ€™t cool enough. I never have anything. I donâ€™t care about the money. I care about people and that most significantly has been taken from me.  I couldâ€™ve had some sort of decent life. I never hurt anyone I never did anything really wrong. Iâ€™ve just been a victim pretty much. Ten years of gaslighting three years of psychological torture one year of unrelenting mental anguish from others. And Iâ€™m left with nothing no chance of any meaning in my life. And every time I try to end it people stop me. Please just give me that thing that costs nothing or let me end it.
