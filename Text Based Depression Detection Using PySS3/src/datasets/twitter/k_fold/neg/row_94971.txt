Mixed bagI don't know what to feel at this point.  I'm disappointed because my business hasn't picked up at all.  I'm tired because I am working full-time, starting my business, and working another job.  I'm angry because despite all of these efforts my wife and I are still struggling financially.  I despise my job but I can't leave as both my kid and I won't have insurance and I have no clue what to do with my life if I were to venture off.  I'm ashamed because at this point I don't even want to hold my son.  I feel like a monster because of it.  The only thing I've done is called my doc.  Other than that I just want to be gone.  Dead to the world before I hurt my wife and son so much more because my mind can't just be right.
