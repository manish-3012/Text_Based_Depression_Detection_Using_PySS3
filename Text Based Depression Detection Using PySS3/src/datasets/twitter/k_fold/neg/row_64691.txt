why is life so fkn shitwhy is life so shit, the question i ask myself every day when I'm thinking about my sister that passed away and my grandad dying with cancer not only that how shit my family is and how much i hate them always making fun of me due to my health and my dream job in photography saying how much better life would be without me. why can't i just swap with my grandad and fkn die already i hate myself i want to kill myself but when ever i get to it i think about the only person that makes me happy and she is going through this as well so if i kill myself i'm scared she will do the exact same thing and i don't want that for her she is the only thing holding me back.
