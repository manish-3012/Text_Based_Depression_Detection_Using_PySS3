kill memy parents didn't want kids. my mom specifically told my dad she didn't want a child, but he knocked her up anyway. they got married (even after he cheated) and had me a couple years later, then another kid later on.

my mom is always talking about how she wants to leave my dad, but doesn't wanna leave us. she couldn't earn enough to care for all of us. she always wishes she never banged my dad 

my dad is completely oblivious, and just thinks mom is always upset for some reason. he only really cares about looking like he carries everyone (though he doesn't completely carry us, he is the main source of income for our house.), playing his game, and working. mom complains about that too.

at this point, the only thing I have going for me is school (I've somehow got a 4.0), but even that is slowly draining away from me.

I'm also experiencing alot of flashbacks lately (ptsd) and since my anxiety level is higher, its kind of making my ocd flare up.

I've got way too much shit going on in my head

I want it to stop
