Stopping my diabetes medsI am tired of being pushed around by everyone. I am ceasing all my medications. I am going to print and sign a DNR. I am not treating my liver, diabetes, mental health, blood pressure, cholesterol. I am refusing any oral medications. Any further investigations. I am 31 and ready to check the fuck out.

I am done trying to get better. I don't want to suffer like this anymore.
