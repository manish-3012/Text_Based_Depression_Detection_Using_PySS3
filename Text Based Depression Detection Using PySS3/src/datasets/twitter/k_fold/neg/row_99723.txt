I don't know any moreI'm done. There is nothing. There is only sadness. I tried doing the whole "Do everything you want because the alternative is death anyway" thing, and got nothing from it. For the first time in my life, I had the courage to ask a girl to go to the ball with me. Several actually. But apparently I'm as ugly on the outside as inside, because I'm zero for seven. 
An hour ago, I took a large amount of pills. I didn't take enough last time, so this time it was something like a hundred. I don't think I'll survive. I hope not anyway. 
I don't need a paragraph on how I'm beautiful and not a failure because I have been assured enough times that I'm useless that I can no longer believe that. 
I'm a little bit scared, but my options as I saw them were die, or be sad for years and then die. 
I'm done. Bye.
