Please someone help me.I am a 17m and I'm on the verge of ending it all. This is not a joke or a post for karma i don't even know if I'm on the good subreddit. I just want to end it all, all the suffering all the pain all the stress i can't hold it back anymore. I can't talk about this with my parents or brother i don't know what to do all i feel is self hatred all I do is wrong and bad i just want to end it. The only thing i think about is just never waking up again i wanted something to do that for me but neither my friends nor my girlfriend can't help. I have a lot of personal problems and it just seems like the best way out of things instead of getting fucked up on drugs or alcohol again. I can't stand it anymore.
