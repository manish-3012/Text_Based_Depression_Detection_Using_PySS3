I canâ€™t do it anymoreEveryone I love has built their own lives without me. I canâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™m failing my classes, Iâ€™m to lazy for my own good, my mother thinks Iâ€™m a fat bitch, the one person I loved the most has nothing for me. Iâ€™m unstable. I canâ€™t keep living like this. I canâ€™t do it anymore.
