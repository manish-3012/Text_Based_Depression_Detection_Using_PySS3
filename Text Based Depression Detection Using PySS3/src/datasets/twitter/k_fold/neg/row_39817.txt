Options?I posted here a couple of days ago, amongst the hundreds of other posts that get ignored, explaining my situation and how I have a very solid plan of exit. Trust me, its solid and I intend to follow it through.

Tonight...during my almost nightly episode of self-harmificationess I definitely caught the top of something carrying blood. One end of the blade had been dulled so I span it round and it was sharper than expected. Bled a lot, nothing too alarming, but a lot of blood. Anyone else know that moment of "oops"? 

I'm now sat here with my prescriptions (am I allowed to name them?), but I dont have access to the rest that I have stored up as they are at my flat, and for my own "safety" I am currently staying elsewhere. I know the amount I have here isn't enough for me to go...yet I am still so tempted to wash them down, which could potentially fuck up my plan...almost certainly as I will probably get admitted again.

Not sure why I am writing this? Almost like a diary entry than anything else. Who knows, who cares. Lets see how the rest of this night goes.
