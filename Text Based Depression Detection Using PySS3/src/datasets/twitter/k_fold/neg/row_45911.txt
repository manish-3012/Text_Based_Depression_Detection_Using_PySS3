you know you cant do anything when you cant even kill yourself properly.i really dont understand whats keeping me alive. i cant do anything rightâ€” i cant even fucking kill myself properly. ive tried so many times. it breaks my heart every time i wake up after a failed attempt. 

i jUST got out of the hospital recently too.. but this time, i dont have the motivation to even try killing myself. i cant tell if its because im afraid of messing it up and ending up going through the hospital again, because i just dont want to go through the effort of doing it. 

i thought id just hang myself. but that takes effort to tie the rope and im a weak bitch.
i thought id jump in front of a train or car or off a high place but that means i need to drive out there.
id overdose but i dont have any pills left so id end up having to buy some.

and im probably gonna fucking fail my attempt again anyways.
