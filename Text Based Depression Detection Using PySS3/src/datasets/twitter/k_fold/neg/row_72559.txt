Someone on Omegle told me they attempted suicideThis happened about 20 minutes ago and I'm really concerned.

I connected with someone telling me they needed help and said they took about 20 vitamin d or c pills but couldn't remember which. I told them repeatedly to get help. They said they were 13 and didn't want to tell their mom or call anyone. I urged and begged them to do so for a few minutes, and after consistently saying no, then they said they would get help. I asked how they planned to do so and said that they were texting a friend. I said thank you, then asked if they only telling me what I wanted to hear and if they were still there about 6 times after getting no response. I asked them just to say anything back and then they disconnected.

What do you all think? Is there anything I can do? Like, could it be tracked possibly? IDK what to do or think, I'm just really concerned. They could possibly have been messing with me or maybe actually did contact help just to disconnect. But I feel helpless and guilty
