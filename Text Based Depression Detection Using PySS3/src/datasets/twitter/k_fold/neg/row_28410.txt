It's been a long time, and a lot of treatment, but it's not doing anything. I still want to die**There's a TL;DR if you get bored.**

Wow I haven't been on SW in so long, it feels weird to be here, let alone posting. Hope everyone is doing well, or at least gets better somehow.

So I went to an RTC (residential treatment center) when I was 14, and now I'm 17. I got out in Aug 2013, but went back in Nov 2013, then I left in Jan this year. Lots of things have changed, but my suicidal ideation is still there. The thoughts come up at least once a day. Sometimes they're like "hey kill yourself!" I'm like "no thanks."

I'd rather not talk about the other times, I don't want to trigger readers.

I don't really have friends anymore. I try to reach out sometimes, but it the friendships either just kind of die off. My best friends back in Cali don't really talk to me anymore. They all just graduated, and I guess they're just busy with summer. I moved up here to go to the RTC, and my dad ended up moving up for me (he's a good guy deep down), so I live here now.

So I feel lonely. To say the least. Numb? That's a good word too. Bored, etc.

Please believe me when I say I try not to wallow in my own shit. I try to call friends I care about, and I try to want to call other friends I don't know too well. But they usually don't pick up, or we just don't really make plans. I get sick of video games, and playing guitar and piano, and walking or playing with the dogs (but I still love my dogs). I don't want to do anything, but I want to want to do something, you know? I don't know if that makes sense. I basically just sleep all day. I have summer session classes at a community college I'm going to, and that's fun. The friends I've made there also don't really want to hang out. I don't know them well enough, or they're all a lot older than me.

I get tired a lot. In the daytime. Like I said, I feel numb. Breakfast is nice, but I usually just go to sleep while dad runs errands. He tries to talk to me, but I don't want to and we just fight in most conversations.

There's that too. The anger, usually existing only at night while I'm in my bed. It finally started to surface while I was in treatment, and never really went away. Worse now maybe. My psychiatrist described it to me really well:

I have all this anger, rage, hatred. It's just inside me. It's not about anything or anyone. I mean it get's pointed at everything and everyone, but it's not about them. It's just there.

Every night, I think about the things that people have done to me. I never really knew what being bullied or picked on was. Only recently did I realize that most of my childhood consisted of being bullied and picked on. Family punching bag. Weird kid that classmates and friends picked on. I never even thought about myself that much. It was always about how they would react to me, or how I could hurt them, or how I could make them pity me and stop (which happened),

But they all changed. Well most of them. They're good people now, and they've done everything necessary that they can to make amends, and support me, and help and do good. I've tried to forgive them, but deep down, I can't. I hate all of them so much. It's not right to hate them now, but I still do.

I don't know if this even makes any sense. Maybe I'm just rambling. Maybe I'm just venting. I feel like this is all useless, but I just want to get it out. I know I'm wrong when I say I need to die. But I don't care, it's just too much. I'll hopefully find a less painful way within a few days.

Okay so I'll just stop now.

**TL;DR:** I'm lonely and sad in the daytime, and angry and hateful at night. It hurts a lot. I know that it will probably get better, and I'll look back and be glad I survived. But I don't care about the truth. I just want to stop hurting.
