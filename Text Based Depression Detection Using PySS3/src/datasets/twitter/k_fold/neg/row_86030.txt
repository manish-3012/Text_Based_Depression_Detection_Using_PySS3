Im getting closer to the endIm 23 and ever since i left my all my friends behind when i was 15 to move to another state cause of my parents it went downhill. I was outgoing, active u could name it all. After the move i became alone, silent, developed a speech impediment and lost all confidence, Sucks i know. 

Come high school and i felt even more alone even tho i had friends, But not real friends, just people i talked 2 cause they were in most of my classes. Junior year comes and this is where everything hit me. I started to become less and less involved with everything, lost interest in pretty most of the hobbies i enjoyed. Fast forward when i graduated and the start of my depression came.

No friends, no motivation to do anything, unemployed due to anxiety and much more. I hated myself, hell i hated life at this point. Im now 23 working a shit hole of a job doing overnight freight 1-2 days a week, spend all day in my room only going out to go to the gym. I hate myself so much knowing what i used to be, and knowing no matter what i do i cant get myself to do anything. Nothing brings me joy anymore. 

I hate my family, they blame me for every fucking issue they have going on. Dad doesnt believe in mental illness and my mom only things about herself, Brother and sister dont give a shit. I tried asking for help but all my mom cared about was her image knowing if someone knew her son wanted to kill himself she would look bad, life sucks ay

Im a failure, no one to talk to about this, im literally living not even alive tbh, im just waking up everyday knowing its gonna be an autopilot day, same shit. To be honest with anyone who even cares to read all this, Im only alive right now cause of the fear of knowing what it would do to my family even tho i hate them.

im so close to just ending it, thoughts recently have been so fucked up its literally eating my alive. Sorry for venting, just needed a place to let out some thoughts going on.
