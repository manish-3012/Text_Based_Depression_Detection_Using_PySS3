im an inch away from killing myself.i have the pills ready. all i have to do is get something to drink. i have nothing stopping me. my cat will be taken care of. my stuff will be given away. i have nothing keeping me here. my boyfriend broke up with me. i have nowhere to go. my dad is dead. my mom hates me. my brothers dont care. if i died no one would miss me. i have no reason to still be alive. i have nothing anymore. i have no job, no friends, no family left, no money, no car. i have nothing. nothing. just sorrow. i just need one more kick and ill do it. please just tell me to do it. please. i dont want to do this anymore. it hurts so much.
