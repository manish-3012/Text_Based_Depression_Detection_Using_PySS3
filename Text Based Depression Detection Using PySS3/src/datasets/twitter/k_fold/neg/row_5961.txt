I put a knife to my throat today without even realizing what I was doingI donâ€™t even know what I was planning to do
I wasnâ€™t even thinking, my body was just doing. 
I slammed my head against the walls and then just started crying and then my body just started moving on itâ€™s own. 
By the time I pressed down the sting snapped me out of it and I decided to call a friend and listen to them talk about some random shit. 

Truthfully I donâ€™t even know if I wanted to do it or not. 
I just know that in that moment I wanted to do something. 

I know all the bullshit about how I just want out of the bad situation and that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but there is literally no bad situation. No fucking problem. NONE. I am perfectly fine. I donâ€™t even want to fucking die half the time, Im too fucking scared. 

My issue is that Iâ€™m so god damn impulsive that I think I might do it without even meaning to. I donâ€™t want my family finding me like that. I know I wouldnâ€™t even leave a note because it would just be an impulse. Fuck.
