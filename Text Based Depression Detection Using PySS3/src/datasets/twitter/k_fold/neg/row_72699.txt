A close family member committed suicideI just found out a few days ago.   I miss him.  I wish I could have helped him.  I wonder what happened?  I wish I could curiously ask him, â€œWhy did you do thatâ€?  

He was a lot like me: a loner.  I remember for years wanting to die but being too afraid to kill myself.  Like him I spent time in the psych ward.   My suicidal feelings went away through self acceptance and finding a reason to live.  This took years though, like well over a decade.  I realize every story doesnâ€™t have a happy ending.  I hope heâ€™s finally at peace now.
