No Job, No Home, No Money, No Love ... What DO I Have to Live For?I lost my job in late January after the company's last client dropped us.  I broke my ankle the very next day at roller-skating lessons with my girlfriend and her daughter.  Three weeks later, my girlfriend threw me out of our house and stole half of my savings.  Two days after that--the very day before I had to have surgery because my ankle hadn't healed at all in those three weeks--my *dad* threw me out of *his* house because I told him I'd had enough of him calling me an idiot for ever dating my ex.  I slept on a cot in my mom's house for six weeks while I recovered from ankle surgery, during which time I had to turn down job offers in another city because I couldn't stand, walk, or drive.  

As soon as my ankle healed, I moved to that other city because the job market for my industry is stronger there than my hometown.  I can't afford an apartment, so I'm staying with friends and doing what I can to not wear out my welcome (cleaning, cooking, taking care of their cats' litter boxes, etc.).  I can't afford to keep my cats either; they've been at my asshole dad's house this whole time, and I really hope he dies soon so I can get some inheritance and at least pay off my student debt (assuming he hasn't written me out of the will yet).  

I've been in this city for over a month, and I have nothing to show for it.  The jobs I had to turn down are gone, and I'm legally disqualified from a lot of other ones because of the work I did at my last job (which I took so I could stay in my hometown with my ex--back when she wasn't my ex, of course).  

So there you have it, /SW/.  I've been out of work for 4 months, my girlfriend threw me out, my *dad* threw me out and has my cats, I have no money, and I'm sleeping on a couch.  What, exactly, do I have to live for?
