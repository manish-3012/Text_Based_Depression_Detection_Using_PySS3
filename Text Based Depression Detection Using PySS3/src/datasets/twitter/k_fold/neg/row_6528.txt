Suicide  
I want to kill myself because I am aware of my problems (ASD, learning disabilities, deficits in social skills, depression) and cannot find a solution to them, probably because there are no solutions. At least not any solutions to my learning disability. I know you guys won't respond because you don't respond to any of my posts, but I am just putting this out there.
