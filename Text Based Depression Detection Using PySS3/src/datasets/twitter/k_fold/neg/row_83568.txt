Can I go now?I worthless I donâ€™t know why I even stay on this planet.  I have a plan.  I want to go through with it, but Iâ€™m hesitant.  I donâ€™t know why.  The world is stupid nothing good comes and Iâ€™m done.  I have the means to kill my self but I canâ€™t.  Nothing is worth living for, Iâ€™m sorry
