I am relapsing.My partner and I have split up, and it is because I am relapsing into my eating disorder. I haven't eaten a proper meal in about three weeks, and I am consumed with desire to self-harm again. 
I have been trying so hard for so long, I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so sick of being sick.
