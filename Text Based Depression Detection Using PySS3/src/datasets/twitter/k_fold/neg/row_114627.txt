I am loved by the people around me, my friends and family support me, but I crave peace that I can't seem to find anywhere but when I am asleepI am one of the luckiest people alive. I was born to a loving family, financially secure, many friends, I went to a good college, etc. 

I know how lucky I am. But this dread in my heart and this chaos in my mind, no matter how much I tell myself that it's unwarranted, keeps building and building. I just want to be at peace.

I want to be dead. I don't want to hurt anyone else, but I just want to cease to exist.
