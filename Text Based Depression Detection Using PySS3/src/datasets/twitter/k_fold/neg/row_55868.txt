It's really hard being alone all the timeBirthday is on the 21st this month. I'll be 26. Just feels like the years are going by being lonley. If I could have a cuddle buddy that would be great but it's probably not gonna happen. I just don't want to be alone anymore. You'd think for my birthday I could maybe have someone cuddle up next to me and watch a movie or something but I'll probably just end up being alone. I don't know it's just sad always feeling alone. Really sad.
