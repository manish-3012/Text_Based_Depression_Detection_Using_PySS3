I probably should kill myselfPeople would be happy if I killed myself. I know this for a fact. People have straight up told me that I should kill myself, and I agree with them. I've stayed alive for a long time because I don't want to hurt the people who care about me. I feel obligated to exist for them, hence my username. But maybe I do need to die, maybe it would be justified, maybe my loved ones would understand eventually. I'm so tired.
