Being alive makes me feel weird...I don't know how to explain it, but it's definitely not a good feeling. Its just weird and I want it to go away. I've been feeling like this is all just a dream and that I'm going to wake up soon, but I haven't. 
I've had people try to help me before but it did nothing for me. I just want to go away and disappear. I'm lazy and I've stopped caring about my education. Partly because I feel like it's a dream, but partly because I know I'm going to end up killing myself anyway. 
I don't really know what I'm expecting to get out of this...
