Is searching -nearly everyday- for pills to kill myself ok?I donâ€™t consider myself suicidal, yet my behaviors say so.
I think about killing myself everyday and imagine different scenarios of how Iâ€™m gonna do it, also I search for pills and ways to do it, and I keep on asking my friend, who tried to kill herslef before, about their names but she doesnâ€™t tell me.
So, I donâ€™t know what do, and I canâ€™t trust these thoughts.
