Depressed - I need some support and I feel angryI feel enraged and angry. This is beyond lifeâ€™s usual unfairness. I hope this doesnâ€™t sound weird but - I talked with a GWA user today. Turns off theyâ€™re in a pretty serious relationship. With a user they posted audio of themselves having sex with. She doesnâ€™t have vaginismus and can have sex effortlessly - of fucking course, right? And rationally I know I shouldnâ€™t care. I know I shouldnâ€™t give a fuck. I know I shouldnâ€™t be affected/upset by something that doesnâ€™t affect me at all in real life. But I feel saddened and jealous and enraged. Why should I endure this while everybody else just . . . has it so easy? What made it even worse is the user said that they were taking it so slow/werenâ€™t official yet . . . which made me think . . . why have you had sex then? Like if itâ€™s not official, why have sex? I guess I just feel like sex to everybody else is so much fun and so casual - like people just do it for giggles even when they know the relationship theyâ€™re in isnâ€™t serious/official yet. Itâ€™s like: WHY IS EVERYTHING SO EASY FOR YOU AND SO FUCKING HARD FOR ME? It hurts when your body wonâ€™t cooperate with you and youâ€™re waging an exhausting, never-ending war with your own body and your own pussy. I feel angry at the user, the user heâ€™s with, the world, and life.

Iâ€™m almost starting to wonder if vaginismus is an evolutionary mutation. I feel like it makes me less/unlovable. How do others have it so easy? Is vaginal penetration supposed to be pleasurable? For me, I cycle between painful, uncomfortable, or feeling nothing. When I had a swab done by a doctor I felt stabbing bad pain but then absolutely nothing (I didnâ€™t even feel that it was in me). Is penetration supposed to be like this - canâ€™t feel it (nothing) or pain? I just feel so frigid. I have so much less to offer than other women.

The userâ€™s ignoring me now. Wondering if I should just delete the app. Ugh. Iâ€™m enraged at people and life and the world.
