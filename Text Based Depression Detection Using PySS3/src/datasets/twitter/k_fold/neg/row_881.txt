Nothing left to loseCurrently 5 years graduated BA with honors and still working a shit minimum wage paying job. I hate the situation I am in. I can't afford to live on my own, everyone I encounter is a complete piece of shit with their judgmental attitudes in this overly excessive affluent town I am surrounded by in my neighborhood which happens to be excluded from the city, despite living less than a mile away from the municipal building. What I am getting at is that this is America, I can buy a gun no problem whatsoever. I want to end my life. So why should I not take out those who have wronged me in the process? Nobody bats an eye over bloodshed of American lives over oil, so what's the difference? Help me understand why I shouldn't follow in the steps of our great government leaders.
