Marking Xs on the CalendarI have the plan. I have the letters.

I have the scars and the rawest of burns.

I have the sleepless nights and the numbness.

I have the panic attacks and the racing thoughts.

I have everything ready, and I've never felt more calm.

It's a ways out now, I need to get everything all prepared.

Just hanging on a little bit longer, and then I can find peace.
