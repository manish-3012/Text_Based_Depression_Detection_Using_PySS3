Iâ€™ve officially lost the will to live.Three weeks ago my fiancÃ© left me out of the blue. I thought we had an amazing relationship and I built my entire life and future around him. We never fought, we were compatible on every level. We had the same goals for the future. I thought to myself every single day that I was so lucky to have found him. I truly thought it was fate. 

I love him so much, and now he says he doesnâ€™t love me. 

I donâ€™t have any friends. I donâ€™t have any siblings. I hate myself and I hate being alone. 

Every single day since he left has gotten worse. I havenâ€™t showered or eaten in days. I lay on the couch crying all day until I finally sleep from exhaustion. Every single time I fall asleep I dream that he comes back to me. Every single time I wake up I remember heâ€™s gone. 

I just want to die. I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore I cannot bear this pain. I hate myself for not having the courage to end my life. I know that I will live a miserable existence until I finally die. That day will be the only happy day of my life.
