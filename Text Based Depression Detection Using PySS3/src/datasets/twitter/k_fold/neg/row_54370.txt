MessNo matter what I do, life reminds me of how pointless I am. I fucked myself over. God, this is exhausting. My pain is becoming unbearable. The shell that I am in is cracking. I feel like breaking down. I feel there is no escape. Things are looking darker by the day. These stupid decisions keep continuing and I hate myself each day for it. There isnâ€™t much happiness in my life nowadays. The days of wishing I was happy and normal are too many. I donâ€™t know why I continue to allow myself to live this long. I just want to feel good. Just want to feel anything aside from this pain. Eating is the only time where I am satisfied and it only last so long. There isnâ€™t anything here that makes me want to move forward. I have been lonely for all my life but now, being 20, I am really feeling the pain of isolation. I regret it all. Donâ€™t know why I exist if Iâ€™m just going to Hell if I decide to find the one thing people seem to fall into, which is love. I want to used because at least I I would useful at something.
