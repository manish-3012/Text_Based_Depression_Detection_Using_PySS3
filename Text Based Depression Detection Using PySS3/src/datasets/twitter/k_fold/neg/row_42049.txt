I'm sitting here with my suicide method in my hands, trying to decide if I should get it over with now.So many things happened today that helped give me that push i needed to do this. It's a fairly quick death if i can do it. I'm so tired.

They'll be okay without me. Just trying to do it now. So hard to work up the nerve. And have to decide if i try now with only part of my method or later with all. higher chance of success and death if i wait. but i want to go.

i just want to get this over with.
