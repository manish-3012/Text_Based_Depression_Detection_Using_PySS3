I came this close to death.Yesterday was a terrible day, I wanted to die so bad. Everyone was against me, I had no one on my side. I felt as if I was getting blamed for feeling depressed or something. Like it was an option; something to just get over. That night I decided I wanted to kill myself. I popped open a bottle of sleeping pills, took around 30 and hoped for the worse. I knew it would kick in eventually. During that time, I tied these really thick shoe laces around my neck really hard. I couldn't breathe and my face was going to explode, I knew my natural instinct would kick in and force me to remove it, but I tied it hard. Over that, I found this medical/arm wrap which I tied even harder on my neck, to the point of no breathing. Slowly I could begin seeing myself knock out. I was blacking out, and I knew if I had let myself go, that I would have died cause I wouldn't have been able to breath. At that point, I came that close to dying, I felt as if I had no time left to remove the shit I wrapped around my neck. I felt as if I had just skipped death. I don't know why I'm writing this here but that was the closest I had gotten to death.
