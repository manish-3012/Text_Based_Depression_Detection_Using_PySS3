I don't want to be back here but I am.I got off my old suicide and depression stage a few months ago. Recently i have been doing good, from getting into coding to reigniting my passion for learning Japanese, and life is amazing right now. But everyday, no matter how good a day it was, I think to myself "I wish I just had died". And its a thought that is completely unwanted by me and I don't know why I keep thinking this. I keep briefing over my old knowledge on LD50's of certain drugs almost getting myself ready for the new "inevitable" fate im making for myself. Im trying to write this in third person because that's how it feels. Most likely some of my feelings have been amplified by my new prescription to adderral. and I really wish that weren't the case because now I really do give a fuck about thing. Well kinda IG because I sitll want to die. Its become so polarizing all of this and I don't know what is happening to me. I really don't want to do this all over again. I just want to give up again, But then Ill think how great everything is going a few seconds later. This is me just throwing myself onto a poorly edited reddit post in hopes maybe someone can give me a clue as to why I keep switching mindsets like that, maybe acute Bi-polar, Or maybe im just becoming human again idk.
