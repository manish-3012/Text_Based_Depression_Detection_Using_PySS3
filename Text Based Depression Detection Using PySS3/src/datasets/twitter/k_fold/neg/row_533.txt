My parents berated me for an hour because I accidentally fell asleep for a few hours after schoolAll I can think about is killing myself and this is just the nail in my piece of shit coffin

I've never been told how much of an inconvenience I am 
I'm useless I don't know shit 
Im a fuck up and just an issue and inconvenience to my entire family 
I'm going to overdose on my trazadone prescription 
They are 50 mg pills and I have a pretty decent amount. I also have alcohol which is very deadly with high doses 
Goodbye 
Fuck you
