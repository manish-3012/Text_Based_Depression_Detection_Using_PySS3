Iâ€™ve donâ€™t think Iâ€™m strong enough to fight the depressionIâ€™ve been fighting this for a long time now. Iâ€™m tired of fighting. I just want to give up. I want desperately for someone to come along and say â€˜hey, you put up one hell of a fight but you lost, you are going to give up and thatâ€™s ok. We are impressed youâ€™ve made it this far at all. Good job, now rest. Give in. You deserve it.â€™ Sometimes Iâ€™ll get a spike of â€˜I can fight this, FUCK DEPRESSIONâ€™ but the feeling comes back in a wave harder than before cause I know exactly how it will feel when I get up. It will just keep beating me down each time. At some point, I think Iâ€™ll happily stay down.
