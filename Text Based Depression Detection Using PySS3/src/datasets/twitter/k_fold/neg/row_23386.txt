I will definetely commit suicide in a few yearsHi
Iâ€™d like to share issues of my life with you and I hope there is anybody in this world who can relate. I think that my mental health is getting worse. I canâ€™t even talk to people (except family and close friends) without sweating, stuttering and weird body language and after that I can see them staring at me and wondering if Im ok. Even without any contact Ive noticed people staring at me every fucking time ( Only young people tho). When Im walking on the street I notice one guy of the group looking at me and I can count to 3 and the whole group of people is looking at me. This makes me wondering if they know something about me that I donâ€™t. What are they hiding from me? My greatest fear of my life is being judged by people. I hear my name everywhere in any strangers conversations I can see them laughing at me and its driving me insane. And its getting worse every day. Today I saw a tv show where a guy with some issues was pointing a gun on hostage, there was a police negotiator telling him he can help him and he can understand. The guy said I dont think so and killed himself. I can see myself in this situation in a few years when no one understands me. Im consdering suicide now so I dont have to suffer anymore.
