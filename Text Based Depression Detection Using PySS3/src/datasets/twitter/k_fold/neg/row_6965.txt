There is no reason to live, everyone hates meI have no life, nothing to live for. I have no friends, a shitty family who hates me, and im hated by everyone I meet, talk to, or see. I try to have an actual conversation on any form of media, im treated like shit, i try to cut myself off of the internet, im treated by an abusive mother and manipulatve and pyshcopathic brother. Its an endless cycle of depression, and yet, i have no reason to feel like this. Im not worth it enough. Ill give everything I have to charity, and I hope my body is fucking donated to science, maybe ill be useful.
