Should i write a note?i know i will be causing pain for those i leave behind but i want to go and i want to protect them.  
how do i say i don't want any of them to blame themselves?

how do i say i just couldn't like like this anymore?

how do i say i know i have it good but i just want to die?

or should i just not say anything?   


should i do personal notes or just one big note?

I guess i have some time. i don't plan to kill myself until next year. even tho i'd like to right now. i don't want to ruin any plans that have been made.
