I feel like a failureSome background, I have three siblings, two older, one younger. The older two are both very high achievers who both went to ivy league colleges and are now in good jobs. My younger brother is already very smart for his age and shows every sign of following in the footsteps of my other two siblings.

I'm in my last year of high school, and up until about a year and a half ago, I was getting great grades and was a good athlete, on track to play my sport in college. The past year/two years though I've started fucking up in school. I stopped getting good grades and stagnated in my sport and now didn't get into any of the colleges my parents expected me to.  Every time I talk to them they speak to me like I'm the failure of the family and I've fucked up now beyond repair. Maybe I'm not saying this right but I feel like a waste and a failure and if I just kill myself, I won't be a problem for them. My family will all be sad at first, but they'll get over it eventually and it'd be a lot of stress and difficulty off their mind. Plus they could spend all the time on my little brother and focusing on making sure he succeeds. I just don't see the point of keeping on like this.
