Honestly my life is too confusing and overwhelming for meMy grades are slipping, nobody knows me or cares to know me, the one guy I like is mad at me.
I live in a pretty competitive part of Korea and Korea in itself pushes academics a lot and my parents are saying they're disappointed in me and shit.
I used to struggle a lot with depression and insomnia a year ago, but I've been in a pretty happy mood the last few months; I have bipolar disorder, but the feeling is a bit different, not a strong feeling of hate towards my life but like a dull giving up feeling (??? Idk doesn't make sense to me either) I have no idea what I'm supposed to do lol. Everyone in class probably hates me, one guy I trust is mad at me, parents are disappointed.
