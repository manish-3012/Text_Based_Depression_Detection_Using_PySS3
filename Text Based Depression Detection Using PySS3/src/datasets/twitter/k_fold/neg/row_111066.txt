got dumped. realizing I'm going to be alone forever. don't know if it's worth it anymoreI got dumped last Sunday night by somebody who told me that they loved me and wanted to be with me forever. he says he still loves me but can't handle a relationship right now but this doesn't feel like love. I feel betrayed and fucking pathetic. I was doing so much better with him and now I feel like my whole world has come crashing down around me. I feel worthless. I feel unlovable. I feel like I'm never going to be good enough for anyone. and I don't know if I can keep living like this any more.
