I did it..I asked my dad why he was an ass to the dogs. Here's what happened: I asked him why he did what he did to the dogs and he acted like he didn't know anything.  Then he was all, "Oh I wasn't doing anything to Ava, she was just stressed."  He then said it was fun to mess with Spanky but that day he made me mad and I lost my temper." He claimed he didn't mean to do it, but I know he did. After all, he did wish the dogs dead.  He said he was sorry and if he could go back in time he would never do it again. Good. There you go Ava and Spanky. Now you have some sort of closure and an apology from your killer. Now I'll be able to die peacefully.
