I'm still hereI donâ€™t know why, but I'm still here. I posted on this sub last week, preparing for my departure. I still have all my preps kept safe in my room, but I haven't used it yet. 

I still am afraid of the future and see no point in my life. Yet here I am, still waiting for the right current to tide me over. No one in real life knows about this except for two therapists I've had a few sessions with and stopped seeing, I've only told it to you here. Other redditors here who's suicidal, at what point are you? How are you feeling?

I guess I've always felt alone, but at this time as I stare at death's door I want to talk with fellow people at the same point in life. How are you?
