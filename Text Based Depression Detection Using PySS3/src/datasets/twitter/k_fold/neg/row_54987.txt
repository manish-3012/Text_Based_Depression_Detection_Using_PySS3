Maybe I should just cut my lossesMy first thoughts of suicide came a long time ago either in middle or high school. Since then, it has kind of come and gone, but for about the past year, Iâ€™ve been pretty consistently suicidal. I want to do it, but whatâ€™s been keeping me has been my family. I love them so dearly and they love me too. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s right to hurt others for any reason, so I feel I shouldnâ€™t do it for them. Iâ€™ve dealt with depression, anxiety, insomnia and several other issues for years. As if that werenâ€™t enough, now Iâ€™m suffering from some serious hemorrhoids (for those who donâ€™t know what that is, basically it feels like my asshole is on fire, and anything like sitting, walking, coughing, etc. makes it worse) and nothing has really provided me any long term relief yet. This probably sounds really stupid, but basically, Iâ€™ve been in emotional/psychological pain for a long time, and now I have some pretty excruciating physical pain that may be gone in a few days, or last for months. I saw one person talk about dealing with them for over 2 years. Surgery is expensive, and might not relieve the pain very quickly since itâ€™ll leave scar tissue and shit. Even if I could afford it, I couldnâ€™t afford the 2 week recovery time with classes, work, research and more. Iâ€™ve used a couple different things so far, but thereâ€™s just no telling how long Iâ€™m going to have to deal with this. 

This year was supposed to be better. I had good intentions and plans, but then some shit went awry. Now it doesnâ€™t look any better than my last few years. As soon as anything starts to look better, shit gets worse. It feels like a cruel joke. I donâ€™t want to hurt anybody, but Iâ€™m so tired of living this way. Iâ€™ve given up hope. I just want to end it. Why shouldnâ€™t I?
