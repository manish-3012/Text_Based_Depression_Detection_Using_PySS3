My life is pointless and I can't feel pleasure anymore, what's the fucking point of living like this.I am 17 and I can't feel pleasure and nothing is interesting anymore, the things that I used to loved now is uninteresting and 
I just feel empty while doing them, video games stimulates my brain but I don't feel happy even after winning a match or achieving that rank, I don't feel happiness when I buy something new, plus I am getting dumber and dumber and it's hard to concentrate and sometimes it's impossible and everything even reading is overwhelming for me now. I don't know man, having clinical depression sucks, and I stopped getting treatment and I am planning on seeing another doctor but this lockdown happened and in my country at the moment all of the clinics and psychiatrists are not available now, and I can't even go and see a doctor online cause I have no credit card. I feel trap and hopeless and I am tired of fighting. I cant even feel love and cant even socialize because of my social anxiety, I am sick of being alone too, I think someday I'm gonna end my life, or sooner.
