If he leaves me, I lose everything.I will have to quit school. Move back in with my parents who do nothing but cut me down. Stop seeing friends regularly. Stop volunteering. Lose everything. Start from scratch. 

Lose him. I love him so much and â€“ I know the answer is always â€œyou *will* find love again!â€ â€“ but I wonâ€™t. Not this time. You donâ€™t understand how much I love him. 

My whole life is over if he leaves me tonight. The grief aside, my life will logistically be over and Iâ€™ll have to go back to spending all of my time at home alone because I canâ€™t drive and canâ€™t afford to move out of my parents house in the middle of nowhere to somewhere with public transit. I will have to either drop out of school or wake up at 3am every single day and walk an hour in the snow to catch an early bus into the city. And no more of my sweet best friend at home to make the struggle feel worth it. It feels like a truck is sitting on my chest and I canâ€™t focus, canâ€™t study, canâ€™t rest, canâ€™t stop shaking.
