Why shouldnt I overdose tonight.I'm basically the scum of the earth. I have bipolar disorder and while I was in a grandiose state for a few months I cheated on my boyfriend of 2 years twice. I started leveling out and I saw the mess that I made of my life and I tried to kill myself on December 14th 2016. My boyfriend has forgiven me but I'm constantly enamored with guilt. I've made strides towards normal life but I hate it. I hate working 9 hours a day in a grocery store. I don't want to go back to college and work my whole life. I don't find much pleasure in anything, and I'm uninterested in things I used to love. My boyfriend is my only light, but we got into an argument and now he won't speak to me. I just don't want to deal with life anymore, even if it makes my family sad when I'm gone. I'm not going to exist so it won't matter.
