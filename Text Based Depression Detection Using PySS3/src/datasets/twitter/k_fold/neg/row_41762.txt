I don't know where to start.What's been felt, what's been said, what's been heard, and everything in between has all been.. expressed? 

Every age group has suffered it, gone through with it, been revolved with it. 

It comes and goes. Sometimes its heavy and sometimes it's just a whisper.

The method, the outcome, the hurt. Ours and theirs.

Imagined or written. Dreamt or attempted.

I fear it, but I long it at times. 

So many different personal experiences of why we want to and yet we hold on for whatever drive keeps us going. No matter how feeble or strong it may be. 

It's fatigue. I'm exhausted. I just want the cycle to end. Will I succumb to it eventually?

When I get moments of clarity I can't even connect with that pained version of myself. How could I even think of doing such a thing?

Often times, it's the reverse: "Was I ever happy?"

You forget what real joy is and I find myself finding something synthetic.

This will do. A nice little distraction. Eventually, if I lie to myself long enough I might actually make myself not feel pain. 

Who gets it? You have everything you need, right? A home, health, funds, security. "Why?" They ask. 
"What caused it", "think positive" "someone has it worse.."

So more isolation. No one to talk to. 

I don't look sad. I smile to you and make jokes. I complement and wave. All good. 

It won't get me today, not tomorrow, and to hell with those damn hotlines. 

But I fear for my future children. 

I'm just tired.
