The calmness that comes with being actively suicidalHas anyone ever felt that when they have accepted the fact that they were going to die by suicide that a sense of calmness and peace washed over them? When I was passively suicidal I was really upset and was crying all the time. But things got worse and I feel like I couldnâ€™t cope at all, and my passive thoughts turned active. However, what was most surprising was that I didnâ€™t at all feel agitated or upset or was crying all the time. I accepted my fate and itâ€™s been kinda weirdly peaceful and serene?
