Life feels empty.Hi. 
I've been struggling with the idea of suicide since high school. Its always felt like a fight to keep my head above water. Before I would just recommit to school or work and now I'm arguably doing the best I've ever done in my life, but I still feel hollow inside. Now I'm just running out of things to busy myself with. I don't have an escape anymore and whenever I'm alone my mind feels like its swarmed to do either this or that, and things feel as if they're steadily becoming more and more trivial. 

I don't really have anyone that I feel comfortable talking to this about. My friends and coworkers know that I'm gloomy, but if i ever told any of them about my thoughts and the frequency of them, I would just lose the connection. I don't think it would matter, anyway. I'm never really at the top of anyone's mind, and I don't think they would even know I've passed for a while. 

I've tried calling the hotline, but it didn't really help. I've written on this board a year or two ago and I remember it making me feel a little better just to type it out. I figured I might as well try everything one last time before I decide to do anything. 

Thanks

M
