Weekâ€™s worth of work in less than three hourshome school crap. the plan was two weeks of this subject. had a week to do this but the way i am, it always ends up like this. i hate this, myself, and everything else. barely hanging on a thread with this program, theyâ€™re getting sick of who i am. was it over before it all began? the temptation invades my mind every chance it has. itâ€™s painful to live like this, and my mind reminds me every day that it doesnâ€™t have to. i donâ€™t know why, this is all just so hard.
