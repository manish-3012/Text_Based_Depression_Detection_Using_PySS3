The only reason I keep going on is because I'm waiting for my friends to give up on meAll the reasons I had to live are gone. I used to try to help everyone, but I'm completely burned out. I used to want to do something good for humanity, but now I'm too tired to care. I wanted to make it into NASA, but not even a lifelong dream appeals to me anymore. I wanted to find someone who would be there for me, but now I only have one more person that's getting dragged down with me. 

Everything I've ever aspired to be isn't possible anymore. Even something as simple as being worth the effort is long since gone; at this point I'm only wasting time and energy. 

I'm in this situation mainly because I tried to help when there wasn't anything I could do, and I don't want any of my friends to have the same fate. How do I get them to let me go?
