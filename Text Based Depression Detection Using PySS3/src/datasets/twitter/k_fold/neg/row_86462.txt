I know I'll be dead when I get the method downI've just been so obsessed with death and suicide lately. I really, really, really want to die. I'm just at that point where all my options look like complete shit and it seems pointless to keep trying. A few days ago I got really drunk and tried to drown myself with weights in the bathtub, there just wasn't enough water and I couldn't get enough weight to keep me down. Didn't drown, just ended up puking a lot instead. For some reason your body really wants to live when your mind really wants to die, leaving you in this limbo of life and death where you end up spending week after week as a mindless zombie dreaming of death. I used to be really angry and sad all the time, now I'm just focused on dying. Something has changed for me. I know eventually I'll figure it out and finally die, and that's both scary and satisfying.
