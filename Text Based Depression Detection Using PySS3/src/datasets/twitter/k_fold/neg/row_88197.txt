I feel so cold and sad. I can't focus on anything. Can't study.My girlfriend has really bad depression, worse than mine. Only thing that helps her is her cat. Suddenly today, her parents said they're giving away the cat on Tuesday. He was suicidal before the cat years ago and she's leaning towards it again now that's he's on his way out due to "cultural reasons".

I don't know what to do. I put aside all my books the past 3 hours and can't focus. I think I took a shower but I don't recall. I have job interviews and midterms coming up. Why. Why can't I catch a fucking break in my life ...

I can't fall behind school but I've laid in bed for hours looking at a blank screen. I put my head up and try but I get that depressing feel and put it down. Help me please ...
