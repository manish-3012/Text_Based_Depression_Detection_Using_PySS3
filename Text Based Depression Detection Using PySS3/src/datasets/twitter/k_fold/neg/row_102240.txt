Giving upI don't want it to get better I don't want to move on I want my friend back I don't want to keep losing people I fucking make everyone around me miserable and unhappy no matter how hard I try I always end up being selfish I can't help myself and I can't stop myself I can't keep doing this cycle I only become more and more miserable I really don't want to live like this nothing works out and nothing is forever it's all a lie
