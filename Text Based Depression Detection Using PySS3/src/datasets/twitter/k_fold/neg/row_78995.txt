Does this show any signs of suicide?I am heading off to college after this year and I am a little worried about my little brother.  He is a year younger than me and when I leave he will be left alone with my Mother who works a ton.  So essentially he will have plenty of alone time.  I found this in his notebook a few days ago, and was wondering if I should be worried. I know poems don't always mean something, but I would still like some feedback on if I should be worried about something.  Here is what I found: 


Sometimes..
When I look up at the stars..
I don't think I see what everyone else does

I see my life..
Slowly spinning away..
Unraveling into a billion different stories..
Like those stars

And when I see those bright shining stars..
They shine red..
Each star sending a shock of pain down my spine..
Spindling hatred into my veins

I hope for one to burn out..
To provide relief..
But they will keep on shining..
And so will I..
Because I deserve to suffer

And like I said, I really don't want to make a big deal out of nothing.  Everyone here seems pretty wise so I feel I can take each opinion here very seriously.  Thanks everyone.
