Never knew the day would come and write here.Hi. I just saw this while I was searching for things to not do when you feel like ending everything. For some reason, I feel like I'm not alone here. Weird, but it feels like that.

I can't grasp my train of thoughts but I've been wanting to end everything. People, especially enablers and toxic ones, makes me want to escape everything.

I attempted twice, I don't even remember it happening but I feel it again. I have a loving girlfriend and I'm scared of leaving her behind.

But I really am tired. I keep writing right now without even explaining what happened. A lot did but it piled up and I can't hold it anymore.
