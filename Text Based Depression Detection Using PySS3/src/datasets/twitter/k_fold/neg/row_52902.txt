Nothing makes me truly happy anymoreMy constant moods are either depressed as all hell, lonely, tired, angry, or mildly content but never fully happy. I can get happy, but not nearly as much as I used to, and usually for no longer than a few hours. I donâ€™t go to school anymore because reasons, I rarely meet up with friends, and Iâ€™ll never meet my internet friends. I canâ€™t do this!
