Leaning towards the end...Hey 23 here. For the past week, I've done nothing productive, ZERO. Sleeping and repeating, that's all. Well, as a matter of fact I feel like doing nothing. Whenever I try to do something, idk something is hold me back and take me back to the same starting point. I've been smoking cigarettes and gazing on the ceiling fan. Pain is holding me back. Overdose is also an option. K don't know what I'm doing, even little things seem to trigger me. Fuckk
