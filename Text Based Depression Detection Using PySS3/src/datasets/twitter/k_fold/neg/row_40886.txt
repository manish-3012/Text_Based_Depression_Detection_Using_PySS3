16 and hopelessIm 16 in 11th grade and i feel like i have nowhere to go in life. I take 2 AP courses both of which I suck so bad at. Even my regular classes are tough to me. I feel like im just a dumb retard sometimes that i cant even understand basic math or even what the teacher is telling me. no matter how hard i study i always get simple mistakes and even looking at the people who fool around in class they always get higher grades. even my friends who always complain that theyre gonna "fail" and that they did so "bad" in the end get 90 or high 80s and then theres me with the 70s and 60s. Even at home my parents hate each other its just constant argueing and im not allowed any privacy. I barely have any friends because its hard for me to socialize and talk to people. Im scared for my SAT cause i suck so much at math and now i feel like i dont even deserve to go to college. all my cousins and aunts and uncles do so well in their education and they achieve so much and even my brother is the complete opposite of me. Hes so intelligent, naturally intelligent, and he has a lot of friends. Its like i was born the black sheep. I have a dream job but that job is hard to get because its in the medical field and highly competitive so now im even questioning whats the point of living my life anymore what is even my purpose. im not smart, cant socialize, i really dont have anything i can say that im proud of. I feel like im ruining my life.
