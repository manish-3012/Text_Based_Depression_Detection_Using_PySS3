I feel like I'm out of options.I've dealt with depression for a few years now. I have been previously suicidal for no real reason but have mostly been past those feelings. When something gets really bad I sometimes launch into that immediate "I'm better of dead" line of thinking but I can pull myself out of it.

I am supposed to graduate from college next May, after five years. It looks now like I've somehow miscalculated some important hours and it will be almost impossible to do that. I'm already in more debt that I'll ever be able to pay off, and my financial aid package is steadily declining. I can't afford a sixth year. Beyond that, this past year has been absolutely horrendous for me and I was clinging to the light at the end of the tunnel. So, emotionally I can't afford a sixth year, either.

I can't fathom quitting now, being in all this debt and not even having a stupid bachelor's degree to show for it. I will never be able to pay this debt back even WITH a mid level job. forget trying to even survive on whatever minimum wage job I find with only a high school degree. I feel like such a failure. I feel like there's no pulling myself out of this. I've dug myself into a hole with absolutely no way out. I very much feel like i should just kill myself because I can't imagine having to survive the life I've set myself up to have.

I've never felt so out of options in my entire life.
