Can't Feel AnymoreFears and premonitions closing in. About to collapse. The silence is so loud, blaring into my eardrums yanking me into vertigo. Spinning further and further into that spiral of fear as the world inverts. Black on white, white on black the checkered world blurs into a mosaic. Pressure builds on my temples as I slow down.  Dangling on the edge of the roof my enveloping gaze builds on the horizon. An empty embrace of quiet chaos. A moment of ethereal calm.  Nothingness.  The silence.  The instant the world returns. Quiet. Silence. Eternity. Nothingness. The wind picks up and pushes me out of the binding grip of somnolence. For once, I feel happy. My old self isn't there. Now I'm free. And I feel an irresistible pull, too. Maybe it's the pain of being alive. Maybe it's the emptiness. Maybe I'm just feeling this must be the right time to say goodbye. I don't know. It just does. And now I'm in the air. The wings are off. And that's when I realize I can't fly, that I can't do that thing I was going to do. I can't leave. I'm trapped. And I'm dying.
