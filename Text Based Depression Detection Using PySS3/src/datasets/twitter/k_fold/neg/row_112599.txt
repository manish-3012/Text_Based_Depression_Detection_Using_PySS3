Soon I willI had enough of this shit. The bullying at school is just going to far. People are doing school plays based on me. People are making fun of me infront of my fucking parents, people are pushing me and shit around. I cannot take this constant stress at school, I have almost no friends. No one fucking likes me. I have been bullied every single fucking grade of my life and I swear to God I cannot take this shit anymore. My parents won't let me get online or private school.


Don't send your fucking stupid ass "I feel the same way" shit that will make absolutely no difference, it's like telling a suicidal person to "just feel better". And if you think I'm gonna wait until highschool ends think again
