so... where should I go online to just... not be alone?At the moment, suicide doesn't seems like a viable option. And really, I feel too old to even be feeling this way... but it's sort of always been there, and it never leaves, not really. And the night is young, and the bottle is not yet empty.  

But I can't keep sitting here alone. It leads to - well I won't post specifics. I don't want to put that in anyone's head. Just places I have no business being.

So, where do you go online to not be alone? DO you have a place?
There used to be a chat room I visited, and I rarely typed anything, but it was just nice to feel like there were people here with me, you know? But they closed the room, and I'm unsure how to find anything else like that.
