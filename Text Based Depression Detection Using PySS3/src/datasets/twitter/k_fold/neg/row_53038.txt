My reasoningFinances having to take care of my kids cost me my career now I'm in a vicious cycle of borrowing money to barely feed my kids. 

Friendships noone actively pays attention to me. I'm never invited anywhere I literally have to just show up and insert myself.

Love life. I have none. I attract women but they get rid of me quick. Longest relationship is 1 month 5days. They all just want to be my friend and that's it.

Family iam the wierd black sheep. None of my family trys to hang out and often am not invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas stuff.

I'm so lonely but to broke to actually do stuff to meet people. Probably be evicted soon, Car is on its last leg, I'm easily a born loser.
