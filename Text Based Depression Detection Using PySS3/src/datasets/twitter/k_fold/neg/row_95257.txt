I constantly think about dyingHey there, i donâ€™t know who will see this or even care, but thereâ€™s a reason for why I feel this way. I was raised in a broken household so I grew up not trusting anybody. In school I was antisocial and had rarely any friends. My father was a raging alcohol who would always verbally and physically abuse me. My mother is probably has undiagnosed bi-polar disorder. It was all good tho because the one person in the world that I felt like she truly loved me was my grandmother. When she passed away when I was 9, everything changed. I was left alone in this world by myself. I had to grow a thick skin to survive my upbringing. In high school, I met this girl and I trusted her immensely. We became close and I trust her with my life. Iâ€™ve told her about what Iâ€™ve gone through and she still canâ€™t believe I walk around with a smile on my face. I did something to protect her and she believes I betrayed her and now wonâ€™t acknowledge I exist. I feel like Iâ€™ve been betrayed and abandoned. Now the thought of me dying is a comforting dying. Why canâ€™t I be normal? I lost a very good friend to suicide and it crushed me. Then the drama around his death was just killing me. Then just last week a friend of mine, his best friend hanged himself. I had to rush to his house because he had slit his wrist. While I was trying to clean his wounds and called 911 I began crying. I feel like this world only wants me to experience pain. I donâ€™t want to live in this world. The smile I put on is getting harder and harder to fake. I want to tell someone how I feel but I find it hard to trust. The anonymity of this is why I decided to post this here. Why do I feel this way?
