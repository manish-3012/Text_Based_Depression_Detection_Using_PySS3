I donâ€™t want to live anymore in this world2020:

- lost my job
- my study has stopped since March 
- I could not play football (soccer) with my friends since March
- I cannot find a new job

I donâ€™t have any motivation anymore and I am done living in this world of pure shit and this stupid plandemic. I had everything but I lost it all and I tried to repair the damage, but itâ€™s lockdown after lockdown. There is no way out and I am sickened, tired and I am done living in this world. Under the new dictatorship in the western world. I want my old life back, but I realized that it will never happen. This is just a plan. 

I would never consider getting children in this world. It is gonna get so hard for them. I donâ€™t want them to grow up in this new dictatorship and lockdown. 

And I am considering ending my life. I am wasting it all away. No job, no money, no study, no sport. I am done.
