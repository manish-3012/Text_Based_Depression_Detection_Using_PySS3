I can't wait any longer4 Years ago. I attempted suicide by hanging, it failed. I did it Because I'm a failure. because I have been endlessly harassed and bullied for being so fucking worthless to society ever since the days of junior high. In the end, I was motivated purely by my hatred for the twisted irritating people in my life who aspired for me to do this, People who BEGGED me to kill myself. (Almost my entire grade in school) Because then I started thinking "This is what they want.... If I do this they win"

So I stayed. And i told nobody what I was thinking. and I tried fighting. It went........ ok for a while. I figured if I pushed myself to the limit in school I can get a good enough education to escape this horrific place I live in. Thats all I wanted. To be free from this hell hole of a town in Canada. But the problem is that I literally am worthless and stupid. I studied non stop and obtained perfect attendance across all my years of high school. And it meant NOTHING. i barely passed most classes and all the teachers say I'm a lost cause at this point. I'm at the last year of high school and just failed the math course and I am once again being berated by every single student and teacher. How fucking pathetic of me. These last 4 years have been a  waste of my time. I should have done it long ago. I see now that it's not that they all win. Its that they were right. I'd rather be dead than to spend the rest of my life in this horrific town anyways. The only thing stopping me right now is that i don't know how I'm gonna do it.
