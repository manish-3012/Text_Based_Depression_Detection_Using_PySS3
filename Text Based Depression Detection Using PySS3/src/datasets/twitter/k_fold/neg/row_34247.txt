I can't do this anymoreI can't hold on much longer. It's all just too much. Im so lonely, Every one ditches me, even at events that we all use to go to. And I need you at this moment. At least you have your kids. I have no one. But if I say that, I'm selfish. This is the kind of shit that makes me want to take my own life. Because no matter what I do, or what I say, I'm the one that's wrong, according to everyone. It's too fucking much sometimes. But it feels like no one understands that. And what's even dumber is that I know that's not true. I know this shit has happened before, but I feel like I'm the only one in this entire damn world that feels this way. And I've done this for over the last year. I can't do this anymore. I just can't. I want help, but if I ask for it I feel like I'm hurting everyone else. I feel like I'm such an inconvenience to anyone that says they want to help because I know they have their own problems, but yet somehow I'm more of an inconvenience if I don't say something. I just want everything to be okay...
