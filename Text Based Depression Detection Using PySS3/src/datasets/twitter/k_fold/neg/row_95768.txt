Stay At Home MomI've always had depression, from the times when I was little living in poverty with my single father who was a raging alcoholic, to my freshman year of college. Always. I had my daughter in hope that it would give me meaning, purpose to force me to continue living (I know extremely selfish). Today, I find myself writing goodbye letters, to my daughter and fiance. She is two, so I take comfort in her not remembering me (I know, fucked up). I'm to the point in this world where I cant take care of myself anymore and signing up for disability. No friends. No family. No job. No desire to go on, we all die, why not embrace it early? I used to cling to the idea that things would get better. They dont, life is just one painful thing after another. Theres no point in trying to succeed we all just die on the wheel of life. I'm out guys.
