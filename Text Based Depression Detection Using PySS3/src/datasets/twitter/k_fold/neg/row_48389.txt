Being human is the worstThe most vile, aggressive and destructive species on the planet is us.

We are a cancer of this world.

Why couldn't I be a  bird, a wolf, or a bacteria.

There's no rent, bills, social media, phones, nothing... Just you and the land of the planet. Natural and how it should be.

We've created a world within a world.... We focus on garbage and shit as a way of life, and ignore the beauty of the land we live on, and often destroy it to further consume the shit we have created.

Fuck being human. The worst thing to be. Not a blessing, a fucking curse.

We should all just die. Here's hoping to further COVID strains that don't get affected by vaccines, and hope to us slowly being wiped out. Cheers. Cunts. Me included. Fuck me. Fuck you. Fuck everyone. Die.
