Anyone have experience with cardiac problems caused by starvation? Worried about breathing this past week.This past week my breathing was not good (limited capacity, shorter breaths). The past several months Iâ€™ve eaten very little due to anxiety/depression, but now Iâ€™m worried that itâ€™s causing cardiac issues. Cardiac failure is the major cause of death from starvation. How much weight would you have to lose to be worried about this?

I was almost involuntarily hospitalized a month ago, so if I told my psych itâ€™s likely l could be involuntarily hospitalized (donâ€™t want this at all).
