My friend is suicidal, and I have had thoughts too.Hello, I'm looking for advice about me talking to my friend.
Me and my friend ( I'll call her x) text every day for hours, about everything. X is in quarantine, so we can't see each other in person. Yesterday, we got on the subject of suicide. I was ranting about how there is no purpose to live, and it's not worth it, etc. a few hours later, X texts me and says she almost killed herself.
Now I'm really worried that I was the one that caused it by ranting. Did I cause it? Should I steer away from those topics? Should I try to stay only on positive topics? I really don't t want this to happen again, and she's in quarantine for another week. She doesn't have someone to talk to at home. What can I do to support her?
