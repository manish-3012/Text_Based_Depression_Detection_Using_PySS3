I don't want to die. I really want a better life, but I don't think it's possible and I'm tired of being miserable.I had so many dreams, hopes, friends, ambitions. But everything's fucked now. I've been waiting to die for the last 4 years.   

I don't have what it takes to function like a successful person. This world isn't for me. I'm not supposed to be here.   

Only reason I haven't killed myself is because I'm the only person my Mom has. And it hurts that I have no success to show in my life. Like everything shes done for me has been a waste. I wish I had a sibling so I could kill myself without her having to be alone.  

When she's gone I don't think I'll have any reason to still live. It sucks cause she chose not to abort me cause she thought I had a purpose.  

I know it's gonna suck after that bullet gets lodged in my brain and I'm wishing I didn't do it. And I don't know if death will take me to a better place or not.
