3rd times the charm i guess, mabye i`ll have the guts to end it tonightwell here again for the 3rd time in only a few days apart form every post, normally id make alts for each post, but at this point i dont care if people see how truly low i am. 

its been a very long rode these last 5 years of my life, i thought i was doing better i really did, but sombody can only fight for so long, and im so tierd of fighting to keep myself alive and im so tierd, my heart is heavy at what i have to do, i regret all the pain i will cause, but i dont see any other way out, ive been here more times then i can count. 

i will never be me, not truly, nature saw to that, its a cruel thing what i am, to feel and associate with something im not even close to being, the pain of not being it, if i ever had a choise i would never feel this pain from it, but it never was my choise this pain of not being the woman i feel i am inside that burden came to me, i no longer know how or what i am, all i know is that im defective, thats how i see myself at least.

i`ll be sad to see it all gone, and i wish i had the strength to stay, but i no longer do, thats the complete truth


i was never cut out for living, takes to much effort for me to even live, my parents had at least one child that wasent a complete fuck up, at least my older brother didnt fail.

goodbye everyone, thank you to everyone that tried to convince me to stay in my previous posts, and im sorry to those how i let down on this day, know that i appreciate your effort  even if it was wasted on me 


goodbye
