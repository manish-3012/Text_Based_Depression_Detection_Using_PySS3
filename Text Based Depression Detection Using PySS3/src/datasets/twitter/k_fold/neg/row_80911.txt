I have $1.93 in my accountI just got paid a week ago and now that money is already gone. I get $1,880 a month for school (Iâ€™m a grad student) and I already used most of that money for rent, car payments, credit card bills, car registration, a parking permit, groceries, and plane ticket for my friendâ€™s wedding. I started crying look over all of my expenses wondering how it was possible to spend all of that money. I called my bank crying because Iâ€™ve been trying to pay a non-sufficient fund fee of $25 for the past month and every time I authorize payment it doesnâ€™t go through until days later when I (apparently) have no money left in my account. Who knows how much I owe now.

Honestly school is so stressful and demanding that it doesnâ€™t feel worth it anymore. But I canâ€™t quit because Iâ€™m already in so much debt and I canâ€™t get a part-time job thatâ€™ll cover rent. I have no idea what to do. I think this was a sign that I just wasnâ€™t meant to live in this life. I donâ€™t have any friends, I no longer have an s.o., even my family doesnâ€™t care about me. 

I never thought Iâ€™d make it this far. Guess I was right.
