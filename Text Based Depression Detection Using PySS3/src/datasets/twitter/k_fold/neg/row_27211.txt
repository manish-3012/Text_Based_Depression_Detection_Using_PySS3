I don't really know what to do anymore...So I'm in college and I lost my Dad in January two weeks into the quarter,  and I made it through that quarter but I just fell apart this one.  My academic record hasn't been perfect and I just found out I failed almost every class and I'm probably going to be kicked out of school.  It's the last damn straw for me I just can't do it anymore.  I haven't done anything with my life so far and all indications are that I never fucking will.  My whole family are brilliant multi-degree geniuses and I can't pass a 100 level physics course.  I just want to stop feeling so fucking low all the time, I haven't stopped hurting for almost two years now and I want it to end.

Blegh, sorry for the self pitying word vomit I just needed to say it.
