I'm not going to live to morningIt's 2:30 am as I'm currently writing this and I plan on not being alive before the sun rises. I'm 20 years old and I feel like my life is over before it even started. I graduated college and don't have a job. I'm not good at anything, I'm lucky to be even mediocre if I try. Why bother trying to achieve anything in life when there's a thousand other people who are going to be better than me no matter what? There's no point. I'm done. I'm going to go wait for a train to run me over and end my life.
