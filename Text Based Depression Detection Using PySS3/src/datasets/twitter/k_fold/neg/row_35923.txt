I'm really lost right now, I just need direction.Please, someone talk to me?

Edit.

Really, there's nothing that I can do about this. I am really sorry, and have been tempted to just tell you all that it's going to be alright, but I don't want to lie to all of you. I think I've managed to break myself. I'm sorry.

I really think what you do is a wonderful thing. You are the kind of people this world should be filled with. I'm so sorry.
