Thoughts Have Taken over my LifeIn December I started cutting myself again after almost 3 years of not self harming. I began with simple cuts that have already disappeared. In January, I began taking a bit more serious approach to self-harm and began cutting deeply. Currently my wrist is a mess and the scars are too deep to go away. I cannot come to terms with dealing with it and now permanent thoughts have entered my head. 

I think about the end of summer and killing myself in the morning, afternoon, night, and even when I sleep. When I sleep I dream about people continuously stabbing me but I can't die, I also dream about killing myself but I just can't die. Is this my mind telling me not to kill myself in real life? My nightmares have gotten to the point where I sweat profoundly every night and can't stop it. 

Lately, when I wake up all that is in my head is killing myself early. I can't stop thinking about it. I know that cutting my wrists have a seriously low chance of actually killing me so I've dealt with that and addressed a different way. However now that everything is in place my mind can't wrap my head around it and just wants to finish it earlier than the end of summer. I'm afraid I'll give in and be gone already. 

Any help of disregarding these thoughts is appreciative. I'm currently not on any medication and am alone for over 12 hours a day and have 1 friend now. The only thing I care about before leaving is making sure not to leave any messes behind. 

I should also add the last time I was in a hospital I was forced to stay in a confined room for 16 hours with no possessions except for my pants and shirt, as during the stay i shoved my glasses down my throat and made a double noose with my shoe-laces. I never think, or tell anyone about that and refuse to go to any hospitals fearing that will remind me or I'll be locked up again.
