I have sensory issues. Is it worth living?I have Sensory Processing Disorder which means a lot of the information that comes in through my senses is processed incorrectly. I'm incredibly sensitive to noises and touch in particular. My body is constantly in a state of high stress, and that leads to muscle aches, acne, infections etc. I've tried seeing psychologists, they aren't trained to help with SPD so they end up making things worse. There are no adult occupational therapists in my area. There is no cure, and there's not likely to be one for a while, SPD isn't yet formally recognised as a disorder.

Is it worth staying alive? I've got pretty solid plans to either hang myself or poison myself with CO. The sensory issues are just too much, it feels like I'm constantly inside the washing machine of life, whether it be in my bed, in the shower, at work, in a car, out in nature, at the shops etc etc. My sensory issues just don't settle down.
