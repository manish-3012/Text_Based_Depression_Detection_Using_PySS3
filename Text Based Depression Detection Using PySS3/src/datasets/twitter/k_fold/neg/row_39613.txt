I am so sick of being aloneI have had depression off and on for most of my life. Recently it has gotten really bad since my husband and I have realized we need to get divorced. He is blaming all our problems on my mental health issues but is ignoring the fact the he has mental health issues too. I am in therapy but he refuses to do it. If he were willing to go to therapy then maybe we could have a better relationship.

Sorry I am kinda ranting. The point is I feel horribly alone and want to hurt myself. I don't have family or friends that I can talk to. I have bad social anxiety so I don't really know how to make friends. I am worried I am going to be alone for the rest of my life. What are some ways to feel less isolated? I am in therapy but other than that I don't know what to do.
