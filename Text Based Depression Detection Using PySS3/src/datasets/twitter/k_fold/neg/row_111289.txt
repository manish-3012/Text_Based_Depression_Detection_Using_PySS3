Just need someone to talk to.......I'm almost 7 pregnant for the third time bc of failed birth control. I love my kids, but if I hadn't had them I would have left their father almost 5 years ago. He's a drug addict and alcoholic as well as extremely verbally and mentally abusive. He has been physicslly abusive in the past. I started taking an SSRI about a month ago and it helps a little but not much. I was working until December when I had to quit bc childcare would outweigh a paycheck I would bring in. So now I'm back to not working and him having all the control again. I'm well aware that I'm stupid for staying with someone who is so abusive and narcissistic but I WILL NOT share my kids. They don't care when he's not there bc he's really never been there. He's always ditched us to go get fucked up and has gone so far as to put me in a position to have him involuntarily held and detoxed. I don't know if it's just the situation, or the pregnancy, or both, but I'm so depressed and constantly anxious I wish I could just disappear. 
     I've tried to tell him and he just tells me to "get the fuck over it" and tells me I need to "stop being a crazy bitch" . To be honest if I didn't have my kids I would just kill myself. But I can't leave them. Especially with him. So now me, my almost 4 year old, and my recent,y turned 2 year old all sleep in their room and I'm trying to get it ready to have a newborn too. I'm pretty sure I'll have to sleep on the couch with the baby and just go in their room before he gets up for work in the morning so I don't have to deal with him.
     About a year ago I was made aware I have rapid cycling bipolar disorder as well as an almost paralyzing case of anxiety. It makes everything I do seem impossible and I have no way to change anything. I just got yelled at and told to just go away bc I am upset he does nothing but go to work, drink, eat, and pass out and typically piss himself. Which is why I share a bedroom with 2 toddlers while he sleeps in the master on a king size bed. He told me if I say anything else about having to roll the 3 trash cans out every week he's going to lose his shit and said he wishes he had a woman who made his day better but he just comes home to me. 
       I don't know what to believe and what not to anymore. But maybe everything he says is true and I'm just being fucking stupid. I don't know anymore. I'm just rambling at this point. I'm sorry.
