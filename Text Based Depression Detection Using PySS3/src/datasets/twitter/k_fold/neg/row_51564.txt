I pulled the trigger.10 days ago I found out that the love of my life had been cheating on me. We've been together for nearly 10 years and he blames me for it. I lost it, I  kicked him out. I publicly posted to facebook a goodbye, I stole one of his guns and I stood in the bathtub with the shower curtain drawn (to cut down on the mess), I put the barrel in my mouth and pulled the trigger. Nothing. I double checked it was loaded. I don't know how I fucked it up. My brain wasn't thinking straight so I loaded the gun and the dog in my car and started to drive to my parents place. For some reason I felt I had to leave my dog with them before taking off to figure out how to fix the issue I had with the gun. When I arrived, they wouldn't let me leave. I should have known better. They held me there until the police arrived. I was arrested under the mental health act and taken to the hospital. I still don't know how I talked my way out of the hospital.  I guess I'm a good liar, makes sense since I have so many years of experience pretending to be okay. I'm home now with my boyfriend, we're pretending to be okay until we can get into counseling.  I don't think I will make it that long. I'm upset that the guns aren't in the house anymore, it means this is going to be a lot more painful than I had planned. I practiced strangling myself with my bathrobe belt attached to the bathroom doorknob last night. I almost passed out before I got it loose again which, would have been fine honestly. I'm planning on completing the act today/tonight.  It's the last day/night my BF and I have together before he's on the road again, I would like to try to have a good day with him before I leave for good. Writing it out helps solidify it, I think. I don't cry when I think of it, I feel peaceful almost. I'm fucked up, have been for a very long time. People will get over this fairly quickly. I'm sorry for the immediate pain this may cause my family but, they'll all be okay in the end.
