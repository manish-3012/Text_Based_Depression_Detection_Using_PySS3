Everyday is physical pain.I have a chronic pain condition. That I keep hidden. Because no one understands it. No one gets what itâ€™s like to live every single day in terrible pain. All day. Thereâ€™s not a single memory I have where I wasnâ€™t in some amount of physical pain.

And then doctors try to say itâ€™s a symptom of depression. Wouldnâ€™t it make more sense that Iâ€™m depressed because Iâ€™m constantly on physical pain - not the other way around?

The only reason I keep going is to enjoy nature. It used to be nature and my friends. But my friends, well...one is being a giant asshole, ones not speaking to me...the others I keep at an armâ€™s length...

I just needed my best friend to tell me he was sorry I donâ€™t feel well today. Itâ€™s the worst pain Iâ€™ve ever been in in my life. I feel so horrible, I thought maybe itâ€™s meningitis. I have a fever and a headache and my whole body feels like itâ€™s burning from my bones to my skin. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m full of crushed glass. Like gout, but everywhere. I woke up and I cried and I begged for god to kill me. And his response was, â€œIf I get sick again, Iâ€™m gonna be so fucking pissed.â€

All I needed was care.

No one really cares.

Why do I continue to live in agony to spare these peopleâ€™s feelings? And nature is dying. Why do I continue to live to watch the thing I love most die?

Because Iâ€™m a coward. And I want to die painlessly and quickly. And I donâ€™t know how.

Please. It doesnâ€™t seem fair that I have to live. I live everyday in horrible pain. Please, god. Please just let me die.
