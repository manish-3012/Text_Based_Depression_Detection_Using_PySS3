A close friend of mine just admitted he is feeling suicidalLike the title reads..
I am no stranger to depression and have experience the suicides of two people that were close to me in my life. I am absolutely terrified for my friend and although I am honored he is confiding in me, I desperately donâ€™t want to say the wrong thing or give the wrong advice.. 
can somebody please help me. I know I canâ€™t save anyone but I hate to see people that I love suffering like this.
