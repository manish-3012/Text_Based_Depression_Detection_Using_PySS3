My Last Fucking StrawIâ€™m done. And donâ€™t convince me out of it. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m tired of living. Iâ€™ve reached my final point. I have things to live for, I know I do, donâ€™t tell me the same shit everyone says. I know I do but it doesnâ€™t matter. Nothing matters anymore. As soon as I get the chance itâ€™s over. After years of getting treated like shit, whether indirectly or not, by people, and getting ignored by my classmates, feeling invisible when I walk into school, feeling so ugly, worrying about things that wonâ€™t get me anywhere. 

Iâ€™m done. I hope you all can know who I am, if I do it tonight. Thank you for all this subreddit has done for me; Iâ€™ve met acquaintances off of here, Iâ€™ve had people show me kindness and attention. Thank you.
