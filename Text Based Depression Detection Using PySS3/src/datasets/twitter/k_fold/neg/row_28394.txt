My friend threatened to kill herself last night.. Did I do the right thing?She had been texting me for a while talking about wanted to commit suicide, I was trying to talk her out of it but then she sent me a text saying "I'm sorry it needs to be done, I'm going to do it." Then she didn't text me back at all. So I got the authorities involved by calling 911. 

   They took her to the emergency room and determined she had not taken any pills but she had cut herself. So they released her a couple hours later. Surprisingly she isn't mad at me. I'm glad she isn't because one of our other friends told me I did the wrong thing and probably ruined her life. But my friend who threatened suicide said she wasn't mad I called 911 because it showed her that I actually cared. 

   Tl;Dr: called 911 on friend who threatened suicide, get yelled at by another idiot friend who said I shouldn't have done that and probably ruined her life. Friend is okay and not mad or upset with me.
