I'm scared...So I've recently rebounded from my depression which dominated me through insomnia, suicidal thoughts, attempts at cutting, self hate and a destruction of my own self-esteem. I wanted to walk to my dad's closet to get his pistol but he locked his door that day. Suddenly I made it out one night at 4 AM and I had 2 weeks of bliss and happiness like never before after about 4 months of depression (the whole year was depressing, but those 4 months people would say "What's up?" and all I'd say is "Shit"). Its a cycle that I keep going through, and I thought I had stopped, except it started coming back today. I don't want to go back there. I want it to stop before I want to be depressed again. Please, please help...
