I accidentally killed my petI didnâ€™t mean to. I am very careful because of my paranoia but having 7 cats can get too much. I ran over one of my pets when I was heading to work. I did my usual careful backing up but I accidentally killed the clumsy one that never pays attention to things. I canâ€™t stop breaking down and since I have OCD I have crazy meltdowns. My sister had to hold my hands cause I kept trying to stab myself with a fork and knife for cooking. I have really bad episodes and havenâ€™t had this in almost two years. Right now my eyes are puffy, my hands are hurting from attempted stab marks and my hair hurts cause I tried to pull it off. Iâ€™m afraid that I might just shoot myself. I hate letting my cat down.
