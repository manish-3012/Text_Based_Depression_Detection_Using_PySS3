My birthdayI feel like Iâ€™m worthless. I spend Christmas Day alone. My friends forgot my birthday. My family are toxic. And I just canâ€™t keep being nice to people and having them treat me like this. Itâ€™s destroying me. Iâ€™ve tried being alone and changing how I treat people and I donâ€™t want any of the options available. 

I havenâ€™t felt this low in a few months but Iâ€™ve started making plans and working out who Iâ€™ll give my dog to so she can have a life that isnâ€™t around me where Iâ€™m crying constantly. I just canâ€™t see any light or happiness and Iâ€™m done trying. Iâ€™m so low. I feel like Iâ€™m not enough for anyone no matter what I do and I canâ€™t handle any more people letting me down.
