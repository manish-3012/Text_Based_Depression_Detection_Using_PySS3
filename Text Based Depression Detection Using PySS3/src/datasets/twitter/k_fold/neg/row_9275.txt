BrokenIt really sucks and hurts when you realize no matter what your going to be broken. Everyday for the rest of my life Iâ€™m going to be a problem. I shouldnâ€™t be here..I never should have been here Iâ€™m never going to be fixed im just going to continue braking until I reach the point braking itâ€™s possible and it already hurts I already thought it couldnâ€™t be worse and it just keeps getting worse everyday I wanna die..so bad...I think about it so much...how mapping everyone could be then how much less stress that would be for everyone around me if I just disappeared....
