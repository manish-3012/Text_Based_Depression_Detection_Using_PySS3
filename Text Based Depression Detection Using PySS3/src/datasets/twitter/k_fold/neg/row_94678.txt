Ive just lost all my money gambling, ive been fired from my job for a drug addiction and ive alienated everyone in my life, why should i not drag a knife across my neck?Ive been suicidal before but got over it due to my life being a lot more positive, but now ive got nothing left, i cant even afford a loaf of bread and ive run out of people to borrow money off, im done with this world
