Attempted in January, got a job last week, my relationship with everyone is ruined and today my bf of one year has left me againWell, here I am again.
I'm such a loser! And a shitty excuse for a human being. I fooled myself into thinking I could get better and be a functional adult but the truth is I'm not. I am a piece of crap. Everyone hates me. 
I have very strong anxiety and sometimes the feeling is so overwhelming I can't breath and my heart is racing and everything turns dark. 
After the attempt I tried to make everything better. But I failed and I can't help but feel that everyone must be better off without me. 
I finally got a job, a company right next to the one I was mobbed last time I was working. My now ex boyfriend doesn't understand my anxiety of going so close to those people but I have to work cos it's that or starve. My kid's family hates me and have stated clearly that they could have taken away my kid when I was at the hospital but they didn't. I have no child support, I live with my mother and she is a hopeless narcissist. Every day is a torture. Everyday I hope I have the courage to jump infront of the train. Nobody would miss me! They all have stated how fucked up i am and nobody needs me. I was doing well, but that was an illusion, everything was a lie. I'm such a loser. I really regret the poison didn't work completely last time. I guess later I will cut my arms and tomorrow I will stand infront of the station to build up the courage to jump and kill my sorry self. Im shit. Sorry you had to read that. Everyone struggles so much here. But you know what? You are freaking amazing and I send a hug to each and every one of you. I'm just giving up. But somehow the thought of death makes me feel relaxed. Like finally I am sure I am a piece of shit and deserve to die and rot.
I don't deserve anything. Thank you for reading.
Sorry again.
