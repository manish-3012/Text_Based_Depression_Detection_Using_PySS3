ThoughtsSometimes it feels like I have "terminal depression". I've felt this way since I was in elementary school. There's so much trauma that I am paralyzed by. I feel permanently marked by it. People can tell I'm fading away, I think. I don't know how to stop it. I suspect I have undiagnosed neurological issues or a neurodiversity. I've tried to go to doctors about it but my problems will always be attributed to my depression. I have trouble doing everything, even speaking. I find myself slurring my words and being unable to orient myself throughout the day. Everyone around me thinks I'm just lazy. I've been a disorganized cluster fuck from the beginning and people get tired of it. 

I don't foresee my quality of life getting any better. I put in so much effort into not even being enough, I can't imagine ever being able to support myself enough to get out of my environment on my own. It is so embarrassing relying on others and not being able to explain WHY I can't seem to function. I just want to stop being a burden to others.
