Do you guys believe in an afterlife?Personally, Iâ€™m going to commit suicide with the notion that eternal nothingness awaits. But itâ€™s always fun to romanticize a conscious existence after death. 

So Iâ€™ve been watching DMT videos and basically itâ€™s a chemical that exists inside most living things. Itâ€™s stuff thatâ€™s released when you dream, and it also prominently occurs right before death in cases. 

Itâ€™s called the spirit molecule because once you smoke it your conscious mind gets transported to this alternate dimension where a bunch of crazy, colorful shit goes on forever. Along with bizarre entities, patterns, feelings of immense love, fear, ascension, etc. 

Anyways, existence becomes a never ending spiral of amazing (psychotic?) eternity.  


Do you guys believe in any sort of afterlife  theory? Do you guys even want there to be more after this?
