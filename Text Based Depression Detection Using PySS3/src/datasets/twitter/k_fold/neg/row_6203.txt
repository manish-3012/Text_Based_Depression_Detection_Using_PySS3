I really want to kill myself.I don't plan on doing so. I've already decided to live with the misery. But I want to do it so badly. No matter what I do or what happens to me, I can't shake my feelings of inadequacy. I constantly feel like I'm not good enough, for anything. Not for friends. Not for a boyfriend. Not for my dreams. I hate feeling this way and I don't know if I will be able to spend my life repressing my feelings or at some point it will be too much and I'll end up doing it anyway. I don't know what to do.
