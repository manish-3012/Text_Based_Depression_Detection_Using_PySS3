Found out that my friends think I deserved my rape and discuss it with each otherI'm getting so fucking sick of this. So, so sick of continuously trying to claw my way out of the guilt and self blame and self loathing. So sick of trying so fucking hard to find belief and support from the people who claim to love me most. I feel so betrayed. It doesn't feel like anyone is ever going to actually be on my side. I don't even want to think about what everyone is saying about my PTSD. 

I want to die almost every day from the PTSD alone. Sometimes I want to die because I can't stand living in this skin anymore with the memories. Sometimes I want to die because of how humiliated I feel about it all. Sometimes I want to die because I don't believe that there will be anything left unscathed even if I do finish treatment. 

This just pushes me over the edge. I can't live like this anymore.
