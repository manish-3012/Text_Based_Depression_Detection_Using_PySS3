I failed...what can I say i'm a failure i have no family no friends no support system at all. I don't even have a job, and i'm 34 no one wants to hire a jobless old ugly fat sausage fingeres. I can't see a doctor. I can't have friends I can't even have a family. No one wants to date me and the men who do want to fuck me see me as a sex toy. Why should I live? I live with my father I don't even have a bedroom just a couch and I don't even own anything. Nothing is mine all i have is a cat. I really just want to end it all. 
I can't do anything right i can't keep friends I can't go anywhere with out my dad giving me gas money. I can't even talk to him because he is clueless. I have very little clothing just one pair of jeans and three shirts and soon to be down to one. my birthday came and went and no one cared. not a card nothing. 
I try to talk to my dad about my problems and try to confide in him he tells me to go talk to a therapist. 
my grandmother died my mom didn't even bother to tell me so I couldn't show up. I have nothing no one to even live for. None of my dreams came true. I went to college and all I did was waste 12 years at a community college for a half assed diploma in general studies that won't get me anywhere that no one was happy to know I got. Seriusly It hasn't got me a job and it never will.
