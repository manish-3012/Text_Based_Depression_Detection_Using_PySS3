Iâ€™ve been raped and I canâ€™t take it anymoreI was violently raped when I had just turned 18 by a boy I thought I loved. Iâ€™m coming up to my 20th birthday and I canâ€™t fucking think right now. Iâ€™m depressed, I can barely understand why it happened. What did I do? I was on a couch in jeans and a T-shirt. 
I still remember what was on the television, the fact that his parents were down stairs, the fact that it was raining and he had to drive me home after it. And how he said he would kill himself if I left him so I fucking stayed for like 3 more months where he treated me like his fucking object that he could do whatever he wanted to. Grab my boobs? He did that whenever he wanted. Shove his hands down my pants? I was nothing more than an object. Force me to have oral sex by shoving my head down? Yeah. He was stronger than me. I didnâ€™t want to have sex, I wanted to fucking wait and everything but I felt used man. 

I am tired of the memories. Iâ€™m tired of everything. I was with a man after him, and all he did was use me for sex. He told me he loved me then would complain if I didnâ€™t feel like having sex, or threatened to fuck his ex which he did like 3 times while we were together. He didnâ€™t rape me but I felt constantly anxious and wondering it anything was worth it anymore. 

And now Iâ€™m here. Iâ€™m numb except for nightmares and I cry all the time. Itâ€™s not okay rn

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing here. I have a dead end job, and I just want to end it

Iâ€™m sorry for this needed to tell someone.
