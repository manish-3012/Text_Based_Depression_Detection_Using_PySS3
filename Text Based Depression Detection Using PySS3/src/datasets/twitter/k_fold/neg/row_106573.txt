"Your life matters" but it feels like nobody wants to deal with you.I live in the UK. I've had 6 weeks of paid, useless therapy,  I've been on antidepressants for over a month. Today I asked to be referred to a psychiatrist and it seems like the doctor over the phone just dismissed it and told me to refer to the crisis team when I'm feeling suicidal urges. Every waking moment that I'm not distracted, I think about killing myself, and apparently that's not enough to get a goddamn mental health evaluation, at the very least.

When I've referred to the crisis team in the past, they're quick to blame everything on my drug use, which is one of the few things keeping me going and I'm making the effort to cut down on. They won't even consider counselling for you if you drink often. Regardless of that, they still love passing you around, Even if I managed to get counselling, I'd have to wait until I'm back at university, since I'm only temporarily registered at my home residence. Pretty much boils down to "not our problem."

Everyone talks to you in the most nonchalant tone of voice, I'm aware it's for a reason, but it just adds to sense that you're nothing but a nuisance. All my gran has to say in response to this is "too many people in the world, there aren't enough psychiatrists." I've got a noose tied in my bedroom, I can make one less person, if that's the problem. I'm doing what everyone says I should do, so if I have to keep jumping through loops just to get paid attention to, then stop saying my life matters when I'm clearly just another number.
