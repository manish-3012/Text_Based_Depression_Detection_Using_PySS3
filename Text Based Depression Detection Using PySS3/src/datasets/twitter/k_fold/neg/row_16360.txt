IdkIâ€™m not new here or to this feeling, itâ€™s just my first time posting in a while. I donâ€™t know what to say really, other than Iâ€™m sure my birthday will be the day. Weâ€™re in February and my birthday is the First of next month. Yes, maybe to some it may seem abrupt, but Iâ€™ve made more dates to do it than Iâ€™ve gone on with women. I didnâ€™t exactly have a good childhood, I was beat, tortured, passed off, told and shown things as a kid you probably shouldnâ€™t hear or see. So maybe I see things a little different. Regardless of the past Iâ€™ve tried to be the best person I can. I try to be optimistic but idk if being a Pisces, an INFJ or being disabled just brings me back to certain emotions or events of trauma. Since I was 19 Ive had a seizure disorder that often detours me away from doing â€œregularâ€ things. Iâ€™m an attractive guy, but I donâ€™t get the love or even connectivity of talking to people cause I donâ€™t have friends. Even if I did Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™d feel comfortable to talk to them about this. Iâ€™ve been single for over a year and after my last breakup my mom has been mean and unwilling to help me emotionally or mentally and has berated me for leaving the relationship. I had been dating this woman since I started having my seizures so about 4 or so years. Women problems have always been a thing for me. I guess I donâ€™t pick well. Iâ€™m just not gonna deal with the disrespect and ill mannered ness of someone who doesnâ€™t truly appreciate me, especially if Iâ€™m willing to give them everything I can. Iâ€™m a super loving, caring, intelligent, genuine and respectful guy, and still I donâ€™t care about myself. Iâ€™m 25, going to turn 26 and none of this is new to me unfortunately. Whether is be attempts, to extended stays at the â€œwardâ€.  I know this isnâ€™t worded very well but I guess Iâ€™d just tell someone so before I did it. I donâ€™t see a point in doin this anymore. I donâ€™t feel human or even needed. I donâ€™t make a difference in the big picture so it is what it is. Sorry for rambling and if you read this I appreciate you.
