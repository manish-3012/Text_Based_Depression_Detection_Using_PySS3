My vision of the future is bleakI hate when people talk to me about the future, about what my plans may be. I donâ€™t want to think about the future, I decided I would give myself until graduation to decide on whether life was really worth it or not and now, Iâ€™m a senior. My mood has only gotten worse, itâ€™s my fault tbh, I never tried hard enough to do better, to be better. My vision of any possible future is bleak, on a personal and global scale. I donâ€™t want to be here. Thereâ€™s nothing here for me. Iâ€™m never going to achieve anything noteworthy, and society is tearing at the seams.
