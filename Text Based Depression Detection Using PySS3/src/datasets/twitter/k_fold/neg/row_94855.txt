Extremely worried about my friendBackstory: About a year ago my friend was in a very bad relationship in which he got the girl pregnant but she ended up losing the kid at birth. They have since broken up but my friend still sleeps with her occasionally, she isn't a nice person and I believe isn't doing much for his mental health. 

The issue is he is still very much grieving heavily for this lost child, he goes to work every week and then when the weekend comes he will obliterate himself with drugs and usually message me or my other friends telling us he doesn't want to live anymore. He also told me he cut his wrists recently in one of these states. 

I don't know what to do because when the week comes he goes back into his shell and acts like nothing is wrong even though he is obviously hurting really bad inside. I've considered telling his parents because they don't know, but I fear he will fall out with me for going behind his back. I told him to make a doctor's appointment with a GP and they can consult him to therapy or whatever, and then when I asked him if he'd done that he said he had but I think he's lying because he didn't tell me how it went or anything.

Any advice would be appreciated.

PS I am in the UK if that changes anything.
