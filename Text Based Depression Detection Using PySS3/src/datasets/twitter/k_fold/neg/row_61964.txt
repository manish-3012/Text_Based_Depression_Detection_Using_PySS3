Itâ€™s to humble my familyI want to kill myself. Hard to admit, but I donâ€™t really have a reason. I am christian, my parents are well off, and Iâ€™m smart. My grades have been slipping lately and my motivation is tanked. I can get into a good college, but I donâ€™t have the motivation. My parents hate me and pamper and love my older brother. When people say that the youngest is pampered, thatâ€™s absolute bullshit. They always compare horrible people to me and talk about how they donâ€™t want my brother to become like me, even though heâ€™s older. He gets away with everything, and they give him everything. My brother works at starbucks and makes money with no expenses. Heâ€™s been paying for food sometimes, and buying stuff for my dad. Keep in mind, Iâ€™m not even old enough to work since Iâ€™m 15. My dad says â€œsee heâ€™s buying me this stuff but youâ€™re so selfishâ€ like what I donâ€™t even make money? And my whole life has been my parents loving my brother and hating me. I hate it. Iâ€™m done. I would do it JUST for my parents.
