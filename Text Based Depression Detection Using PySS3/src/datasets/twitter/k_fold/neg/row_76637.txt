I don't think staying is the best option.Not sure what to do at this point. There's been a fantasy about leaving for weeks, just want to get out. I want my life to stop. Nothing seems bright for more than a few hours and then it all crashes again. Something fucks up. Statistically failure in life is pretty high. Need to get out. 

There are daydreams of walking in front of a car or something. Last weekend, was on top of a tall building overlooking a river. Today I kept crossing the road blindly. Earlier climbed a tree and jumped out of it. There's just hope that all of the minor things done somehow end up with a major result. Pretty afraid to drive because there's a high chance the car will end up off the road in a tree

It's impossible to talk to anyone, there's nobody to tell. It's hard to  say "I" in conversation. Hating myself, the urge to leave this hell

pretry much afraid to ask anyone for help and it just upsets my friends if ever mentioned so I not anymore

It seems like like they don't exactly give any shits anyway so

The number of people that will be affected can be counted on one hand

Earlier grabbed a large amount of pills, maybe that would suffice

Leaving seems to be the best option

Sorry if rules were violated or anyone was upset or something venting was just necessary and maybe a cry for help
