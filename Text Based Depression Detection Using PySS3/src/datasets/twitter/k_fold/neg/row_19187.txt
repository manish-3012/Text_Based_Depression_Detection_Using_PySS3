My bf broke up with me, I'm doing poorly in school, half of my family hates me, and I have no friends. Whats the point in living.I just can't find anything to live for anymore. 

I have so many physical conditions I'm in pain almost every other day.

Schools eh. I have no ambitions anymore. My gpa is average at best. 

I enjoy nothing. No games, no youtube, no movies. I stare at the screen but it's just pure emptiness.

I have no job. I got fired from my last one because fuck if I know. I haven't found one since after applying everywhere around me.

I fucked up with my bf like I do every relationship I have. He said he wanted a break but I know. I told him I wanted him to be happy but I wanna beg him to stay. I feel so pathetic. I screamed and cried after he blocked me.

My mom is so tired all the time and I don't want to bother her with how I am constantly. I'm such a downer 24/7. I'd just bring her down.

I lost all my friends because my shitty personality and I can't see them without working. 

My dad and his side all hate me and don't talk to me anymore. My mom was adopted so I don't have anyone much on her side. My grandpa is old and could die any day. My grandma who I loved so much died of cancer when I was in elementary school. I hate my cousin and my aunt. I have no one.

Please god I just want to sleep forever. I can't drink away anything cause I'm 19. I have my sleeping pills for my insomnia. I'm such a coward I can't even kill myself and maybe it's just all for attention anyway. The only reason I'm living is for my mom and my cat. I think he'd miss me.

The saddest part is I feel like no one would show up for my funeral.

This is why I'm not religious or believe in jesus. If he has a plan for all of us then he has abandoned me. 

I just want something to live for.
