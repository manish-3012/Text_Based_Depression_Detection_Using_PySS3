Free 24/7 Crisis HotlineHi Everyone, I just wanted to post a potential resource for anyone who wants to talk to someone right now. Sometimes people who post on Reddit might be slow to respond or you might not get a comment right away. But if you feel like you need to talk to someone right now - right this minute - then be aware there is a free National Crisis Hotline that can be reached at 1(800)273-8255. You can call to talk to someone, chat or they have an area called Safe Space where you can relax and decompress. This is also a great resource for people who might not have access to full mental health services.
