I don't want to die but I also don't want to liveI don't want to die because I still want to do so many things like read classic books or buy a turntable and listen to records. So far that's what I want to do. It's very simple and quite materialistic. Also, i know that this will only bring me temporary "happiness ." But so far that's what I want to do before I decide to finally off myself. This for now is enough for me to stay. 

The suicidal thought comes when I think about how I am such a nuisance to the people around me. I think about how i don't deserve to be here, i don't deserve love, how i'll always be alone, how nothing will come of me, how i will always live life like this, how i bring other people down with my misery and negativity, how i'm such a fucking selfish person who hurts everyone around me, how i destroy everything i touch (quite literally), or how i'm such a disappointment and always will be. I could go on and on about why I shouldn't stay here. The reasons to leave is beating my reasons to stay. It's overwhelming and getting a bit too much. 

I want to stay but I feel like I shouldn't. It's like I've been invited to all my friends/family's house and I overstayed my welcome.


I'm sorry for this post.
