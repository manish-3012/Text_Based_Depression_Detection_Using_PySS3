Why am I suddenly suicidal?I've been battling with major depression most of my life, including self harm.  Other than dealing with normal life crap, I've been doing pretty well for the past 9 years.

I have been on Paxil on and off (in between pregnancies) but went off this Spring because my fiance and I want to conceive next year.  However lately things have been difficult for me, dealing with a lot of RL stress (school, finances, unemployment) so my doctor put my on wellbutrin to give me some energy.  I took it for a couple weeks but started to have a reaction to it (face/tongue numbness, really bad insomnia, not to mention the crazy sensation of bugs crawling all over me).  

For the past week I've been having suicidal thoughts and been sleeping non-stop.  I don't remember ever feeling this bad, even when the father of my children abandoned us.  I was stressed but other than taking ativan for a couple weeks I dealt with it pretty well on my own.  So I just don't know what could be causing this, maybe wellbutrin withdrawl?  I only took it for 2 weeks so I didn't think it would be an issue and it's been two weeks since my last dose.

I have an appointment with my doctor on Friday to discuss my treatment.  But I'm just trying to make sense of what I'm going through.
