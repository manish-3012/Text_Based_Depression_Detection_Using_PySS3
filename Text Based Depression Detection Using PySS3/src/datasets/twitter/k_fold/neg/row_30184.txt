Too AfraidI so desperately want to die. Iâ€™ve wanted to die since I was 11, and Iâ€™ll be 20 in a month. My mental illnesses have taken everything from me. I have depression and borderline personality disorder, but my doctors have told me with my history and my familyâ€™s mental health history, I have an extremely high chance of my depression turning into bipolar disorder at some point, but itâ€™s too early to tell. I used to be smart and do well in school, but my disorders have made me lack motivation and care, why should I study hard if Iâ€™m going to end up killing myself soon? Yet I havenâ€™t done it. I had to drop out of college because my grades were dropping into Fâ€™s, a combo from hating my major (computer science) and my depression growing worse. I canâ€™t hold relationships because I always end up splitting on them, and pushing them away to the point where I cheat or dump them even though I know I love them. I barely have any friends, and I hate the current life I have. I live at home and work a minimum wage job, I want to go back to school and get my degree in Psychology, but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m smart enough to go back. My mom makes me feel shitty, always saying how Iâ€™m a lazy fatass, Iâ€™m stupid, Iâ€™m a burden, Iâ€™m an adult and need to move out without realizing how high rent is and I cannot afford it. I hate my life. But anytime I put a noose around my neck, have a lot of pills in my hand, a blade on my wrists, I canâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t fucking do it. Itâ€™s pathetic and I hate it. I want to be dead so desperately, but I always pussy out of doing it because Iâ€™m scared of what comes after death. I just pray one day I can gather the courage to carry out with the act, because itâ€™s gotten to a point where I canâ€™t continue with my life, everything is painful. Iâ€™ve tried so many different antidepressants and therapies and everything has been making it worse. I canâ€™t do it anymore.
