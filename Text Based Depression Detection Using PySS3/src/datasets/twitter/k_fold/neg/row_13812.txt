All of the joy is goneThere is nothing in my life that brings me joy 
There is nothing I can do to make me feel anything 
Everything I once loved gives me absolutely no pleasure anymore and my life has been a swirling spiral into this empty pit of existence
IIâ€™ve never had a genuine human connection with anyone and have always felt like everything I ever did was in the wrong. The therapists say to go out and do things I  enjoy and little by little add more things to that list but itâ€™s hard when not a god damn thing makes me want to do any of it. The only thing that brings me a tickle of joy is the thought of ending it so I donâ€™t have to deal anymore. I just want it all to end. This whole existence is pointless. We trick ourselves into giving this bullshit life meaning but I know itâ€™s not real. None of this means anything, weâ€™re all going to eventually die anyway. Whatâ€™s the point
