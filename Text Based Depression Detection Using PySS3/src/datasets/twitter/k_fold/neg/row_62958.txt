I feel depressed.Hi. I have been diagnosed with clinical depression. I was actually getting better in the past few weeks, but then I met up with my high school friends and things went south. Not with my friends but my mood. They are all at stages of life more advanced than I am and it only reminds me that I am a failure. They have startups. They have fulfilling relationships and sex lives. They have debate careers. All things I strive for. I can't even do college properly so now I'm going to graduate late without all my friends. I feel like a failure.

I hate how other people remind me of my shortcomings. They don't do it on purpose, I just get jealous of them. How come they can do it but I can't? It makes me feel worthless. I want something for my own, my own achievement, but all my endeavours end up nowhere. It's frustrating and it makes me not try anymore.
