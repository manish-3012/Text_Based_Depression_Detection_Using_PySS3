How scary is life?I flunked some exams and can't go along with my friends to uni. My GPA doesn't meet their minimum. So, are there any alternatives? My academic and financial life is ruined. My parents already hate me for this.

I have a bad habit of repeating myself. So even if I talk less, people say I talk too much, so there goes my social life down the drain. People say I'm weird.
Since I'm the weakest with no facial hair at all, I'm the least manly. With or without facial hair, I'm ugly. I'll never get a girlfriend.

My family is pretty poor. They're kinda dependant on me to make money but I can't find a job. The stress is killing me. Mom is sick. Dad doesn't have a job. Can't do therapy due to debt and financial strains. I have to find a job quick and make some money. 

So, how would life be for a poor, weak, miserable, ugly and stupid little fellow? I'm thinking it won't be good.

I'm tired of suffering. I want to end this. Day by day, I'm becoming worse and more toxic.  I've been so stressed! I'd rather suicide than starve.

Tldr: I don't want to suicide, but life seems frightening.
