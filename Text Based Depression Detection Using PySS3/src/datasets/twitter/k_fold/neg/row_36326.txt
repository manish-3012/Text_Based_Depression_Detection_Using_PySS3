Every(fucking)dayTraped in a rooms like reapeting days just nothing else than repeatment . Crying everynight just for understandment. Classmates and friends around joking about my illnesses . Started ciggarettes to help to lower the anger because of the jokes . People can take me serious even when I am dead serious.
Just
Same
Shit
Everyday
I hope I can killmyself.
