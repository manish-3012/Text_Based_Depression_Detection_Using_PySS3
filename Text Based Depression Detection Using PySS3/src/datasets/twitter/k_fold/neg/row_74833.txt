Please, listenFor a while I've felt awful. My family and friends are all so, so, so loving and supportive and I don't want to hurt any of them, but right now I don't see any other option.

I no longer enjoy anything I used to, and each and every day feels like an absolute waste. I'm scared of leaving the house, but I'm scared of wasting away in my room. I cry all the time, and when I stop, I just feel empty again.

I go out with friends, and it feels like I'm just going through the motions, laughing at inside jokes and whatnot. I miss the days where happiness was effortless, and when I felt alive. 

Now, I'm scared to do anything, but scared to remain inactive. I was institutionalized in an absolutely awful mental hospital last month, which left me with some awful trauma. I don't want to remember the time I had there, but sometimes that's all I can think about. I've tried so many things, and went up on my meds recently, but I'm scared. I'm scared that the future will be bleak and empty as it is now.

Please, help me.
