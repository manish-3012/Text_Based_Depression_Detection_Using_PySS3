Another suicide stole my chance and I can't push through anymore
I was going to kill myself, I had it all worked out. I lived with a family with four small children back then so as soon as I moved out I was going to kill myself. It was the only thing that kept me going all those years. I'd hit rock bottom before moving in with the family but there were four small children and they didn't need to be a part of that, not even slightly. So you know, you truck on, you do what you got to do. I used to get up at 4.30am to go to work and in those dark hours walking past houses to get the first bus so that I could earn enough money to pay rent, my solace was knowing that I was going to kill myself. 

My aunt killed herself. It is still tearing the family to pieces. My father and my uncle have been through therapy. The resonance of her death is staggering. 

I live in my own place now and because of my aunt I haven't killed myself. That's the only reason. My last conversation with her was her telling me what a wretched person I was and how the world would be better without the like of me in it. I was a pall bearer at her funeral. I lowered her coffin into the ground and I wished dearly that it was the other way around. 

I'm about to lose the house that I only rented as a place to kill myself. Yet times change in little ways; my job is amazing, I love my job, I wish I wasn't separated from it for six weeks, it gives me focus and purpose and reason. I like it here, the local butcher knows me by name and my neighbours are nice. 

I don't want to be alive, I haven't wanted to be alive for years and I keep thinking that if I'd died when I was sleeping in the back of a van that everything would've been better for everyone I know but now that there's another suicide hanging over the family like a dark cloud I feel cheated out of my chance. 

I don't want to be alive but I don't know how to fuck off quietly.
