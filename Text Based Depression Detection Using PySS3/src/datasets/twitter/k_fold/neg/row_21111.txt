Just need a place to share my storyAs the title says I just need some place to vent it out.

First thing first; this whole pandemic sucks. My family's company is doing terribly with all the lawsuits coming on (internal error) and we could end up homeless without anything left to own.

Then my long time gf of 4+ years said that she needed a break and said that the romance is dead then she told me she kinda fell for some guy she talks to (we're working ln it to find out what our problems are hopefully) but its kinda hard imagining the future without someone I spent 4+ years living together.

And to top it off my dad suddenly went to the ER due to some blood clogging inside his brain (idk what but his family has a history of brain tumor so I'm scared shitless).

It all happens in less than 2 months and it felt like life keeps on throwing one thing after another at me and here I am ending up on hospital hoping to receive some good news that may or may not happens. My suicidal thoughts are already showing for the past few days and I know its getting worse. I don't know what to do or who to talk to. Ending it all may not seems like a bad choice for now because I'm just tired and scared of it all and honestly life kinda just not worth it anymore to keep on pushing through.

Sorry for the bad formatting I'm on my phone and just need a quick vent. Thank you if you're spending time to read my vent
