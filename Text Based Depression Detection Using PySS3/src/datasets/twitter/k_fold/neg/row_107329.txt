"He hit me and threatened to kill me."That was the text I received from my mother last year a couple of weeks before her birthday. Unfortunately, this wasn't something out of the ordinary for me and my family. I had been used to watching and hearing about my father hurting my mother, but I had never heard or witnessed him threaten to kill her. I was away from home at college going into my last year of undergrad at the time I had received the text and called my younger sister, who was at home with my parents, to ask about what was going on. She confirmed that my dad had begun abusing my mom once again.

I was able to go home within the next couple of months during break, which was when I confronted my dad for the first time about his treatment towards the family. The conversation didn't go well. It ended with him essentially telling me, "Since you think you can be so independent and don't agree with how I run this household, don't you dare come back after you graduate."

I returned to uni following the break feeling depressed and anxious. I was struggling to grapple with the fear and possibility of having nowhere to return or being homeless after graduating if I was unable to land a job. Even more so, I was depressed about losing my family. 

At the same time, I had recently begun a romantic relationship with my best friend in secret. He had essentially become my home during this difficult time. It was the first time the both of us fell into a relationship where we had genuinely, deeply fallen in love with the other person. And he had quickly become what felt like my everything when I felt like I had begun losing so much. However, a few months into the relationship we began getting into arguments and fights over the pettiest issues. I was feeling overwhelmed with stress about applying for jobs, dealing with family, my mental illnesses, and having to date in secret and had unfairly begun to take things out on him. I said and did terrible things to hurt and burden him which I've regretted every day. Consequently, he became desensitized and cold towards me. And rightfully so.

Things took another turning point for me when I eventually found out a friend of mine at uni had committed suicide and then my grandfather back home also committed suicide the day afterwards. At this point, I felt like a very unstable Jenga puzzle. I became so lost in grief and pain that I began losing motivation to take care of myself. I began losing weight rapidly from a lack of eating. I began skipping classes and was in danger of not graduating. I would stay in my room for days at a time only to come out to eat a meal a day. My relationship with my best friend was only getting worse as well.

The only thing that had kept me up at the time was the fact that I had actually been given an offer for my dream job at the university following graduation after a grueling 6 month process. However, I broke a first time when my best friend had broken up with me a couple of weeks after I graduated. I couldn't even blame him for it, but the pain was unbearable. I began feeling incredibly suicidal. I was having panic attacks every day and was crying myself for hours before going to sleep at night for an entire week. Thus, I decided that I needed to go back home. I called my parents and told them everything I had been dealing with. We made up and they immediately wanted me to come back home.

The day I left, I asked my best friend if I could say good-bye before I went. He let me see him and, in tears, began asking me why I had to leave. He said he had only wanted to break up but not necessarily lose me forever. I was so hurt and confused in that moment. Just the week before he broke up with me, he had been ignoring me and avoiding me as much as he possibly could. I just told him that I couldn't be there anymore and that I wasn't sure if I would come back. As I left, he asked me, "Please, please come back."

The week I was home, things between my parents hadn't gotten any better. Eventually, another fight broke out between my parents. I had tried to defend my mom and stop my dad when he hit me and broke my phone to keep me from contacting anyone. I found a way to tell my best friend what happened and he told me to come back and stay with him. Thus, at the end of the week, I left home to move in with him and live with him for the next month.

The next month was rocky. I was still having intense suicidal thoughts and tendencies which my best friend had to deal with. However, we had decided to get back together to give things another try since we were still so in love with each other. He genuinely did want things to work out between the both of us, and we tried our hardest to do so. For a little while, things were actually looking up. The both of us began feeling optimistic about the future of our relationship. That was until we got into one final argument that led him breaking up with me for good.

I had essentially done something to break his trust completely and scared him by pulling out a knife in wanting to hurt myself during the argument. Eventually, he called the cops on me. I told the cops I was feeling suicidal so they took me to a nearby hospital. At the hospital, they discovered I was dangerously anemic due to how drastically my health was deteriorating. I was immediately transferred to another hospital in the morning where I underwent some blood transfusions and eventually put in a psychiatric hold. At that point, I decided I needed to leave for home for good. I felt like I was in no capacity whatsoever to fulfill my dream job as much as I wanted to and was no longer stable to live on my own.

Before leaving for home for good, I foolishly made another effort to see my best friend one more time before heading out. I don't know why. I guess I felt like at that point I had nothing to lose and was wanting anything to see him one last time to gain some closure and to try and end things on a good note. Again, things didn't end well. We ended up in a slightly physical altercation that ended up having him call the cops on me again. The cops came to separate us and fortunately just let me go home.

The next couple months were dreadful. He blocked me on everything. I hadn't worked through the grief of losing my friend and my grandfather and then on top of that was facing the loss of my best friend. Things took another turning point when I got into a car accident two weeks ago that almost took my life. Thankfully, the most I got out of it was a broken foot. As a result, however, I've been confined to the house in isolation. I no longer had the support system I had back at the uni and felt lonelier than ever.

Then last week, I had a friend from high school I hadn't connected with in a while offer to come and visit me at home and bring me some food. I accepted and let him over. I was finally grateful to have a friend nearby I could possibly rely on for support. We were in my room just hanging out. I was venting to him about everything I'd been through when he began caressing my back. I felt uncomfortable but I didn't say anything. Then he began trying to kiss me. I told him to stop, but he wouldn't. He continued to kiss me and trying to touch my body while I kept crying for him to stop. Eventually, he had me pinned on my back. I asked him what he was doing and why, and he responded with, "I'm just trying to help you feel better." He then proceeded to rape me.

I don't know how to cope with all of this loss and pain anymore. Every night this past week I've been having nightmares about being raped and my best friend leaving me. I can't stop thinking about my friend's and grandfather's suicides. I've been trying to do everything to keep myself supported. I've been taking medication, talking to my therapist, keeping in touch with friends from uni, spending time with family, and calling the suicide hotline every night. And to no avail, it feels.

I feel like I've been treading through heavy water for so long without any sight of land. It feels like for every step forward I try to take, something happens that brings me ten steps back. I hate feeling sorry for myself, and I have no one else to blame for everything that's happened but me. I feel just a moment away from doing myself in. Just to make this pain and trauma end.

The stupid thing? All I can think about right now is how I would do anything to hear from my best friend again. To know if he still cares at all or thinks about me. To know if he could ever forgive me and if we could be friends again. But I doubt any of that's possible considering what I did to him and how he has school and work to focus on now. Besides, from what I hear from mutual friends, he seems to avoid talking about me as much as possible. It kills me inside to feel like he's trying to erase me from his life for good. In a fucked up way, I'm convinced he'll be happier if I'm gone so he wouldn't have to deal with me in his life anymore. After all, it was one of the last things he told me, along with saying if he had known how our relationship would have turned out he would never have chosen to be with me.

What would have been our one year anniversary is coming up on Thanksgiving. I plan on killing myself then if I find I am no longer able to cope with or deal with all of this loss and pain.

To those of you who took the time to read through my story, thank you. I wish you all the best of health, love, and joy. I sincerely hope none of you will ever have to go through such pain in your lives.
