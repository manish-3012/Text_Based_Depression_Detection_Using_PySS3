Is it any hormones or am I just always going to be this way?Iâ€™m 31 years old. I have to children I love so much. A kind hardworking husband. Some good family members. I have PTSD from past childhood trauma that recently crept up on me. Iâ€™ve had anxiety and anger issues for many years but itâ€™s at a whole other level now where I canâ€™t even live with myself at the end of the day. I have tired anti depressants, and EMDR therapy. I canâ€™t go on like this anymore. I am filled with rage and I feel like my children deserve better. I can only be the mom and wife I want to be some of the time. I try working out, eating healthy,  taking vitamins and supplements, blah blah blah. I stopped faking birth control couple months ago in hopes it would help balance my hormones, but it hasnâ€™t helped. Iâ€™ve had my hormones tested and nothing really abnormal came about. Iâ€™m at a loss. I donâ€™t know who to talk to anymore, or if there even is any one who can help me. I just want to be happy. I want to be free. I donâ€™t know why I feel so anxious, full of fear, isolated, alone, and angry. I hate myself and I feel so worthless. I am bawling hysterically while trying to write this because I canâ€™t believe the words I am typing right now. I just want to take all the pills I can find and fall asleep forever. But Iâ€™m so scared to traumatize my children. I donâ€™t want to put them through that pain but I also feel like if I continue to be their mom it will be worse than recovering from losing their mom to suicide.
