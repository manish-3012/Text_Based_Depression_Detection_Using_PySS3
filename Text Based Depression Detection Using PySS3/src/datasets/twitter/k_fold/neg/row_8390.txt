SoonI think about killing myself every single day. Itâ€™s just always a sinking feeling in the back of my mind and deep in my chest. Every time something happens I just think automatically, this wonâ€™t matter in a month. Everythingâ€™s just numb itâ€™s like Iâ€™m in a movie. I know that people wouldnâ€™t care. I donâ€™t have many friends and Iâ€™ve moved out of home. Nothing feels worth it anymore. Even when I feel somewhat normal it always comes back. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it to Christmas.
