I'm useless and I wish I could commit suicide without my mom doing the same afterYep. My mom and dad were discussing my mental health after I turned off my phone and cut myself off from everyone and he told me she said that. I mean, my my parents and my siblings are all depressed to some degree, so I don't even doubt that.

But like, I dropped out of college, I'm gonna lose my job, I run away from stressful stimuli like my life depends on it, which is ironically ruining my life and bringing more stressful stimuli. I'm fucking stuck here and it killed my soul years ago.

Personality-wise, I'm not meant to exist in this world. I hate doing anything, I'm a lazy piece of shit, I hate people in general, I'm not a very pleasant person to be around, I'm rather selfish. Why should I fucking bother? Maybe there used to be light at the end of the tunnel but it feels like I just kept smoking cigarettes next to a pile of dynamite.
