It has never been this bad before. Please helpI never felt so worthles. 

I started highschool mont ago and its already destroying me. I alredy started to get bullied by one guy in my class. He's caling be ugly and I done nothing bad him. He just ruins my day by simly walking up to me saying Im disgusting and should die. I wouldn't care so much, but he is better than me in every aspect. He's popular, tall, better at school. And there is me, unattractive, not really outgoing and even if Im trying really hard my grades are just bad.  Im a disappointment to my parents I bet they are just tiered of me. 
I've never think about suicide before untill now. I just dont know what to do. My parents go with the tipical: 
"Oh he properly envies you or something" but I dont believe in this because as I said there is nothing for him to envie me. I feel so pathetic and worthels.

Please help
