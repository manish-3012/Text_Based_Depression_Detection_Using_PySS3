I was recently hospitalized in a mental hospital after putting a gun to my head and backing out the last second. A few things I learned while I was in there... (X-post from /r/bipolarreddit)I have Bipolar II, and lately my depression has taken over completely. Even my manic states were depressive. I've alienated, pushed away, and was overbearing to everyone I knew, and as a result I have really no one left.

After two years of nothing but absolute hell, the girl that I thought was going to be my savior turned out to be the most heartless, cruelest person I ever met when she told me that she was fucking at least 3 other guys. She had me convinced that my bipolar disorder was causing me to be paranoid over her 'hanging out with her guy friends'. I felt used, cheated, lied to, and betrayed. It was the last straw.

That night I was sitting in my car when I put my 9mm pistol to my head. I was going through my life, all the good times, and the bad. I was trying to remember everyone and everything one last time. I put the gun to my head and right before I pulled the trigger I envisioned my mother's reaction to my suicide. I couldn't do that to her, or my father.

I immediately drove to the nearest mental hospital with nothing more than the clothes on my back. I told them that I was certain I wouldn't live through the night if they didn't help me. I was 'incarcerated' there for 6 days.

While the time spent between group therapy meetings and speaking with the psychiatrist was the most extreme and excruciating boredom I'd ever experienced, those meetings and talks helped a lot.

Basically my life was like a game of Jenga. My life was like a new tower- organized, sturdy, and complete. But one by one, pieces of my life were taken away, lost, or pushed away. Eventually it came down to that one critical piece supporting everything else, and when it was removed, everything came crashing down.

I learned that my mistake was basing my happiness and emotional well-being on whether others accepted or supported me. I tried to force others to like and accept me, and when it didn't happen I couldn't handle the pain of that loss. 

I know now that I must first **become the person that I want to be.** This isn't an issue of not "accepting myself", because the person I was nearly killed me. I had to make a change if I was going to survive and keep the relationships that I create. I'm setting realistic goals for my recovery, and giving everything I got to achieving them. I'm getting the right help for my disease and continuing my treatment even when I get the results I am hoping for.

I am going to finally lose the weight that has made me so insecure.

I am going to eat healthy.

I am going to go to therapy.

I am going to take my medication.

I am going to learn how to cope with being disappointed, hurt, and abandoned. These things WILL happen again. That's life. I just can't let it break me down.

I am going find a way to let go of the past, and making myself wiser and smarter in the process.

**I am, for the first time in years (if ever), going to be truly happy.**

Going back to the Jenga analogy, I am now rebuilding that tower. Only this time I'm building it stronger and smarter, so no one person or event can ever bring it all down again.

**I will beat this, my life depends on it.**
