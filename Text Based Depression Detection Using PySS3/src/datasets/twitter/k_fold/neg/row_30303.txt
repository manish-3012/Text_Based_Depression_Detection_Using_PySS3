Help.The girl I love is sleeping next to me. She's here for a job interview. I found out through a mutual friend, who happens to be the guy she used to fuck, that she thinks I'm fucking pathetic. I don't know what to do with myself. The idea of starting over again tired me the fuck out. She's known for months that she doesn't want to be with me but she let me think I had a chance because she was scared of how I'd react. I've literally changed my entire life for this girl with the understanding that we'd be together. 

I don't know what to do now. I'm so tired. The idea of starting again with someone new is just fucking exhausting. The idea of continuing to live with no one in my life who actually gives a fuck about me is just so depressing that I dunno if I can take it. 

Why would she do this? Why wouldn't she just talk to me?

The answer seems obvious to me. She just doesn't care. I thought she did but she doesn't. She's just using this to get closer to the guy she used to sleep with. I'm a tool. Like I've been for everyone else in my life. Someone who makes things easier for other people but not someone to respect. Not someone to love.
