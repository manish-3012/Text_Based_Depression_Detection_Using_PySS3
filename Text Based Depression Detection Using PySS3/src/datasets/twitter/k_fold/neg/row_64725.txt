URGENT: Help for a friendHello. I currently find myself in a situation I don't know how to handle it to its fullest.  Five days ago I have met a lovely girl online who appears nice and to be a caring person. She has confessed that she loves me and so I accepted it hoping to get to know each other better as time passes. Yesterday I have texted her to wish her a wonderful day, and night but I did not receive any response from her, I shook it off. Today she has messaged me the following "Iâ€™m sorry my love, Iâ€™m just trash, I fail everything, I donâ€™t want you to be with a piece of shit like me. Stay happy and healthy, I love you. This is the end for me." At that point, I knew she was going to try to take her life and I began discouraging her to not do it. She would continue to insist that she is useless, worthless, and a thing. I denied those facts and tried to comfort her but to no avail. I have repeated several times that she could trust me and tell me what caused her to think this way. Now the part that scares me is that she didn't want to share. I insisted she did so I could help but once I got to her she told me she can't tell me through text. Those were her last words and now I worried as something isn't right and someone or something is causing her harm. I began asking what the problem might be and through my guesses she hasn't denied it had to do something with family. I am worried about her and wish her safety but I don't know what I can do at this point. If anyone can help please let me know. Thank you all in advance.
