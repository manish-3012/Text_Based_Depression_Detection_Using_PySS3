I do not want to be on this mortal coil anymoreI hate the direction my life has taken. I hate the fact that I fell in love and I hate that I fell in love entirely with this person. I hate myself for being vulnerable and being open. I feel like the last couple of months were a waste of my time and I cannot get that time back. I canâ€™t get back the money I spent on him. I donâ€™t ever want to be in this situation again, but at the same time, I got so used to sleeping with him. Coexisting together, I thought we were happy. I put aside my feelings and I prioritized him. 
I donâ€™t want to be alone, but at the same time I donâ€™t want to open my heart again like that. He was my first everything. Iâ€™m too old to start all this again. 
I just want to disappear. I thought about jumping off a bridge on my way home. Or stopping on the train tracks by work. Or jumping off of a ledge at work. 
The only thing stopping me is my lack of money. I canâ€™t leave that debt and burden on my parents. 
I feel like a failure, I just want to die peacefully quietly. I donâ€™t want anymore attention, I just donâ€™t want this life anymore. I didnâ€™t ask for any of this. 
Iâ€™m under so much stress, Iâ€™m breaking down. I canâ€™t work like this, I can barely breathe. I take two breaths and I canâ€™t stop the tears. I donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t know 
Iâ€™m exhausted but I donâ€™t want to sleep. 
I canâ€™t stop crying. I hate myself
