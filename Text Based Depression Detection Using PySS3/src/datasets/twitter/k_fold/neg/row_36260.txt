I need some serious helpHey guys, long story short. I'm looking for any free  alternatives for therapy or medication. I'm in the processes of filling out a form to take care of some bills from my mental hospital, but in the meantime i'm going down a deep rabbit hole that I know is going to take years to get out of, and the sooner I get some help the better. So thanks in advance for any help.
