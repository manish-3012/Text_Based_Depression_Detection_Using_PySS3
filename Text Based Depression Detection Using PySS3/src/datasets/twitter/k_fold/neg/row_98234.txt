I'm exhaustedI've tried to write full my story a million times, but there's too many details I'd have to share to get the point across and it doesn't matter. The past is the past.

All I'll say is that I tried to express years ago that I physically didn't feel right. While some issues did turn up, I was told the rest was all in my head. I knew that running to the hospital was putting a stress on finances so I stopped. I stumbled upon the fact one day that I could manipulate my symptoms with supplements, so for years I researched and tried to fix this thing. I carried on even though it felt like some new thing would pop up over time. I lost faith in doctors, so I kept it all to myself for years. When I broke the last time and contemplated ending it all, I went on the internet and was talked into coming clean and getting help. Doctors still couldn't find anything and it was like deja vu all over again. 

I can't cope. The one thing I can say is hold on to is I have a decent job and am responsible for myself but I can't go back. I feel awful. 
I can't sleep for long, my lower spine burns sometimes, my speech is sometimes impaired, I'm dizzy often, my mind is foggy, my heart is pounding and feels like it's in a vice, my memory recall sucks, my body clicks and clacks, my legs are heavy, I seem to randomly drop shit, my urine is foamy, I have visual snow, my sense of smell is poor, for the longest time I experienced anhedonia after having experienced bi-polar II-like symptoms; now I experience the mood swings again, my feet drag sometimes, I walk funny, my hips are really clicky, I've looked extra sick lately, there's a constant ringing in my ears. I feel like something is attacking my body!

Suicidal ideation comes and goes now. At one point I was certain I was over it but these last few weeks have been rough. I keep trying to choose life, but I felt so bad on Thursday and Friday that I physically couldn't go to work. The last two or three weeks were unbearable, but I made it. I think my ability to hide my symptoms was slowly slipping and that really pushed me over the edge. 
I stopped taking most of the supplements because I think my kidneys have had it. 
I've only had maybe one full meal in the last 3 days. I've been in a hotel room trying to find peace of mind. The sleep has been nice, the quiet has been nice, but it's w reminder that I can't get up and enjoy where I'm at. 

Some of this is definitely my fault. I fucked around with supplements in hopes of finding a fix. Sometimes I was successful, sometimes I created another problem. I was desperate.

Nobody would ever believe some of the shit I went through as I pretended that everything was okay. I'm really tired now. My body just won't allow me to carry on. 

I went from questioning the existence of God, to knowing God's not there, to bargaining with the universe, to knowing God's not there, to questioning God. It doesn't matter. 

I had so much to express, so much to do. But I'm just not life to the fullest and I've been tricking myself into thinking I was. I can't just sit around for .

I just can't do this. I've had to put up with this for almost 17 years. Adapting to each change and building a persona that would allow me to hide my bad days. Adapting when I had bad days. 

I'm fucking exhausted and I can't do this. Trying to fight this thing would just more time that I wasn't letting my life. And even if I made that's I'd have other personal hurdles that have robbed me if certain experiences.

I felt so bad I could barely get out of bed Thursday and Friday, but I took a few supplements that I knew could get my blood pressure down and when they actually kicked in, I packed my bags and left thinking I'd be gone by now. 

But here. the fuck. I still. am.

I hate to leave my Mom alone in this world. My friends and other family will ultimately be fine, but she will lose it. But I just can't do this anymore. My body feels as though it's had enough. I thought about 8 years ago that I felt like death, this is a whole new level that I didn't know it was possible.

I took a one way ticket from home and now to turn back around would just be unbearable.

I fucking hate this! I tried to get help years ago. My body wouldn't be in this state if someone listened!

I've tolerated this for too long. I feel like my heart is going to collapse and I'm not even worried about anything. I almost feel nothing. 

I just want to go back to elements. I've made it through a lot of great experiences, but this is just too much. I can't do this crap again.
