so few people care about other people and it makes me so upsetI feel so depressed thinking about how many people are in a simillar situation as my friend but have no one to talk to. Im so horribly sad when I think about people that have killed themselves... its like seeing my best friend die. because I know they ARE my best friend. they are humans going through tough times just like my best friend. I help my best friend the most that I can and I wish other people would do the same for everyone else on this sub. Im just sad because I know everyone thats died from suicide could have been a friend. I wish people had friends. it really really breaks my heart and its retarded that I cry over strangers but thats how it is. so many people have taken their ownlives because of trauma and numbness and the reason i posted this here is because I want people (who can help) to help people in New. So many people die in the new feed. Im hysterical I know but maybe somoene can decipher my cry-typing
