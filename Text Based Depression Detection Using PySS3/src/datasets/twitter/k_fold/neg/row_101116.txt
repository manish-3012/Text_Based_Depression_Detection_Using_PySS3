I really wish to dieI am a 14 year old teenager, a person who is just beginning his life, but I want to die. It may sound ridiculous, but I wish it. My chest hurts, that feeling hurts, I can't help crying most of the time. Every time I look at a building, I think over and over if escaping upwards would be the best thing, throwing myself away and coming back to nothing. I have embarrassed my parents, disappointed everyone, and disappointed myself, every day. I hate everything about me: my physique, my personality, my lack of independence, my lack of security, everything. If I could die, I would choose to do so now. Academically I'm not the best either, every day I have two exams and it's stressful, I feel irresponsible, I feel insecure because they are oral exams, I hate it because my voice is insignificant, I break down, I weaken. I wish I could run away, to any place where I don't feel like that, I want to die, I want to die.
