2020; the worst yearthis is the worst year of my life, everything from february to this day has been going downhill. first the â€žWWIIIâ€ that didnt happen , then the whole coronavirus and now quarantine. my crush has been ignoring me since my birthday this year and nobody cares about me. noone asks how i am or how im doing and even if they do (im blaming my stupid ass on this) i just tell them its kinda ok while im trying not to cry while talking to them.

I just need to see the positives of this year please tell me them
