Anyone else feel this too?I am so unbelievably apathetic towards everything in life. I care about other people but when it comes to taking care of myself or trying to improve myself I just could care less. When I lived on my own I lived in filth cause I couldnâ€™t be bothered to do anything in my free time but sleep. All I want to do is sleep or get fucked up. I want to have a connection with someone and feel like maybe my life matters to someone but I know it doesnâ€™t and it never will. Just pure apathy towards myself and my life so whatâ€™s the point
