I will die 1 of 3 ways. suicide, war or naturally.And I am contempt with the idea of how it will all end. No one needs to know, because no one should, even though they may care. It's not my place as a young man to express this stuff, because it's not how I should act. 

This inner peace is haunting, yet calming. I will live with these thoughts forever, and if I end my life; I end my life. 

Whatever happens, happens. And that's ok.
