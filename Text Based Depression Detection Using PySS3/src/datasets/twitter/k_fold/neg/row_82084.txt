Feel like going to the hospital again, but I felt like a bother thereI feel like going to the hospital again.  I was just there earlier this week.  I have active suicidal ideations with a plan.

However I felt like too much of a bother to be there.  I was rated as "lowest acuity" and always placed at the back of the line when it came to meeting with the doctors.  They placed me on some new medication - Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Abilify, and a statin drug to reduce my high cholesterol.

I feel like if I go back, there's nothing they can do except hold me for another 72 hours, and spit me right back out.  I can't really say that will help.

I'm supposed to go back to work on Monday, but I don't feel like I'm going to be able to make it.  I don't know what else I should do.
