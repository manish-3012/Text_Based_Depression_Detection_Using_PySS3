Only thing I can't decide is the methodPosted before and I decided not to kill myself before. I thought things would get better. They didn't. I've decided I've totally had enough. Nobody will give a fuck that I'm dead anyway. Well, my parents might be upset, I suppose, but they'll get over it eventually. Given long enough, my friends (ha) and family will likely as not forget I even existed, as they should.

So, yeah, done. Just had to get this off my chest. Like the title says, the only thing I'm wavering on is the method.
