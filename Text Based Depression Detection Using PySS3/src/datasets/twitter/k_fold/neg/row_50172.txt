Finally figured out a planIf my life doesn't get any better, or if i feel the same way I feel now, in the spring, I'll kill myself. I'll get my 45, go out into the woods, shoot myself, and let myself be eaten by animals. I'll make sure it's on a nice day. Ya know, warm enough to not wear a jacket. Birds chirping. Green leaves on the trees. Spring and summer are my favorite times of the year. I think it'd be nice to die then. I think this plan poetic in a way. If I let myself be eaten by animals, then I'll actually have a use. And whoever finds what's left of me won't be scared for life.
