i just can't pretend anymorei don;t want to keep having fake interactions with people i don't care about anymore, and the people i do care about don't care about me.  i would lay my life down to see these people smile, but not a single person is even willing to ask me about my day.  i'm going through an existential crisis, and while i'm always willing to give people help with their bullshit relationship problems not a damn person has so much as asked me "how's it going" I just can't pretend that their stupid "why won't he talk to me" drama is more important than the fact that i honestly have know idea on what to do with my life and i'm sick of waiting for one person, just one, to ask me "what's wrong" I give myself entirely to these people but they don't give a rat's ass about me. i don't know if this is selfish, but it seems to me that everyone around me is all take and no give and they could care less about how i feel as long as they get what they want from me. I just want to end it, what should i do?
