Does it ever get better?It just feels like itâ€™s always getting worse. So many times today alone, Iâ€™ve thought â€œat least it canâ€™t get worse than thisâ€ then before I know it something else happens and it gets worse. Iâ€™ve been trying. I did research on all my dbt and cbt skills to remind myself. Iâ€™ve implemented plans to use them. I am trying. And yet itâ€™s not getting better. I know Iâ€™m lucky to have so many things I have in my life so I feel guilty saying all this but I just donâ€™t want to keep going.
