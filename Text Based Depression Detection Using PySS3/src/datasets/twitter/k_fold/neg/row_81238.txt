How do you get away from someone that you love but makes you unhappy and miserable?So I have this best friend I am in love with since almost three years now. She knows about it but she does not feel the same. I keep trying to convince myself that I am fine with that, that I can be happy if she is too. I don't want to get away from her because she is going trough a really bad time and I want to help her to get better. But being around her really makes me feel bad, because deep down I feel like she does not care at all about me. We are supposed to be best friends, I am always there when she needs someone to talk with and that kind of things.
The thing is that I am also dealing with some shit and suicidal thoughts myself and she just won't listen to me when I'm in having a bad time or need someone to listen to me. I don't think that is how friendship is supposed to work. And I can't leave because I fucking love her so much and I want her to be happy and get over her situation, but it is really making me worse. I know it's toxic, but she's the only person I trust and if I lose her then i'll be alone and that scares me so bad. 
I feel like the situation is out of my control and the suicidal thoughts are getting worse and worse. 
How do i go away?
