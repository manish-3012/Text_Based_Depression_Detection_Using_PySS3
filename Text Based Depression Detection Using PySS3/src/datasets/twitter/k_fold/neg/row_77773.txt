Whatâ€™s the point?Whatâ€™s the point anymore?


You live on for years and years, waiting for life to get better. Every time something good happens for you, itâ€™s ripped away.


Youâ€™re left alone.


I canâ€™t tell you how many times Iâ€™ve expected for my life to get better for it to only get worse. Iâ€™m at the point now where I donâ€™t even feel like I can talk to anyone.


Thereâ€™s no one I can trust. No one I can talk to.


I just donâ€™t see the point of waiting so long for it to get better, years. You try and you try your hardest to not even be happy but to be stable and all that happens is you lose your mind even more than you thought imaginable.


Does anybody really care about anybody?
