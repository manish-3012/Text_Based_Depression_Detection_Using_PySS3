Why should I talk to someone? And who?Let's assume I had friends that would care about my situation.

Right now I'm on an knife's edge about whether to commit or not commit suicide.

If I do decide to commit suicide, then it wouldn't make sense to talk to anyone. If I decide not to commit suicide, then there's no point in talking to anyone about it.

I'm a guy that just looks for straight answers and solutions. How would talking to someone about my issues for an hour or so help me?

And on top of that, I don't want to burden friends with my issues. Assuming that they'd care about it.
