I feel like i killed my kid. I dont know how to live with myself.About 10 years ago i lost my first child. I have never been able to cope with the loss. I feel i want to not exist. At one point i convinced myself i could create time tavle to go back and save them. I even went to college to learn about that. It isnt possible. I droped out of college. I dropped out of life. I dont see the light anymore
