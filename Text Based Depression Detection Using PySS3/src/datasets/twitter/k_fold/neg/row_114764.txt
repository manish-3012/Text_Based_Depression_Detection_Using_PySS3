Thoughts on suicide pacts?I understand itâ€™s not the most popular method, but I am TRYING to make plans with someone and Iâ€™m afraid this is gonna go bad like my previous time. Whenever I try to reach out to someone Iâ€™m ignored, doesnâ€™t matter what itâ€™s about. It can be suicide/depression related or something else. I really genuinely feel like the universe doesnâ€™t want me here. I keep regretting not ending my life when I was 12. I hate living everyday and feeling like life is a chore. Iâ€™m so bored.
