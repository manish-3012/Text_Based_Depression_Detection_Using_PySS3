I plan to kill myself on my 21st birthdayIf a miracle doesn't happen, if things don't change by my 21st birthday, I'm going to end it all. 

I'm 20 years old and adulthood is not what I thought it would be. By now, I thought I'd be independent and free, I thought I would be far away from the miserable town I spent most of my life trapped in and I believed that I would actually have friends. 

I've had suicidal thoughts since age 12 and nearly attempted at 15, but never went through with it because I fell for the whole "it'll get better" bullshit and strongly believed that that "things will improve once I become an adult." I was wrong, since things are worse than they've ever been. I still live with my parents, I'm failing college and I have no friends or any social life. At this it rate, it seems that I'm destined for loneliness and to rot away in this forgotten shithole.

It's starting to seem clear to me that I will never belong in this world,  that the only cure for my loneliness may be a fucking noose.  

However, I'm giving myself until I turn 21 in six months. I don't know why but I just want to hope that things will improve, that someone will magically pop into my life and pull me out of this hole.
