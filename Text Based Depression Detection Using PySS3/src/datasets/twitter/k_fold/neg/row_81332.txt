The following things help me to survive and have some sense of wellbeing when I'm feeling suicidalNight-time walks: I don't know why I like them so much, but I do. Probably because there are fewer people and cars around. It's more peaceful. But I also walk really fast at times to get some good exercise, which is very important.

Meditation: When my mind is going hyperactive, sometimes repeating a mantra is help.

Gaming: Getting lost in virtual worlds. Currently playing Skyrim and GTA5.

Creating: Creating anything. Right now it's geometric drawings. Drawing and colouring is very relaxing, and you end up with something beautiful in the end that others can enjoy.

And last, but definitely not least:

Medications: Benzodiazepines, opiates, Lyrica, phenibut, CBD flower, etc. Going to be experimenting more with microdosing LSD and mushrooms. LSD improves brain connectivity and serotonin levels, both of which are shown to be abnormal in the brains of people with anxiety, depression, etc.

Drug use isn't always a bad thing. You can be dependent, but they can at the same time improve your life a lot. Without medication, I'm a mess.

Oh, and talking to strangers on reddit ;)
