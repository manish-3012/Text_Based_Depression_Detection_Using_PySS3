I hate myself so muchIâ€™m in my room crying once again to the point Iâ€™m hyperventilating somewhat and shaking. Iâ€™m so upset about my weight gain that Iâ€™ve been crying about it for a day now. I also keep getting yelled and sworn at my sister so that doesnâ€™t help. I wish I wasnâ€™t like this. I wish I wasnâ€™t mentally ill, I wish I wasnâ€™t physically unhealthy, I wish I could lose weight, I wish I could have the strength to get through losing weight. I donâ€™t wanna end up 300lbs but I donâ€™t wanna be miserable either by not eating my snacks. My parents arenâ€™t even encouraging they just say everything negative. I feel like Iâ€™m losing control again and all I wanna do right now is cry and hurt myself.
