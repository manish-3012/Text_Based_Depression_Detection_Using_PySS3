It hit me.I've been thinking this a lot lately. Does it really get better? My mother recently passed away. My own Father doesn't recognize me as a son. I've been suicidal ever since. Just this morning my Dog ( The only thing that keeps me holding and my only mother's memento.) Died of being hit by a car. I fucking wish this all ends. Does it really get better. I'm sitting here in the corner with a rope and I'm thinking. Is life really worth living? Everything life can take has been taken away from me.
