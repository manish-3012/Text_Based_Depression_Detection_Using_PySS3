Thoughts are getting worse and worseI can usually suppresses the thoughts so they don't bother me as much. The last two days have been too hard. I'm on edge right now, and it's all cause I am alone. And soon, I will be alone more, and longer. I have no fuckin clue what to do. No mess work and therapists are turning into greedy assholes. The only worth I am is the taxes I pay...
