No. I can't take this anymore.I am in so much pain right now caused by so many different things I can't even write them all out it will take too much energy.

I've never felt this horrible before. Horrible is an understatement. These past few days have been the worst ever and it's all my fault. I've ruined everything, I'm sure I have.

I've always thought "there's no way this can get any worse" and then it does. Oh my god it hurts so much. I can't eat, I can't drink. I'm so tired but my mind won't let me sleep. My heart feels like it's going to collapse. I actually feel it hurting, tensing up, whatever. It feels like it's just malfunctioning, rotting, spewing out tar. I feel like I can't move but I'm restless at the same time.

I'm doing everything I can to distract myself but NOTHING WORKS. TV, reddit, nothing. I can barely focus. Nothing helps. 

I can't take a whole lifetime of this. No. I can't. I'm literally laying here rolling back and forth saying things like "oh my god" "make it stop" "I can't take this". I read yesterday that usually when people slit their wrists to commit suicide they usually just go to the hospital, get stitches and go right back home. I can't do that. It has to work. There has to be no chance of survival. I keep racking my brain for ways I can do it.

I don't know why I'm posting here. Nobody can help me. I know that. In fact some of you may just read this and think "shit, thank god I'm not her" and you'd be right. Be so fucking thankful you're not me. There's no hope. This will never get better. It needs to end.
