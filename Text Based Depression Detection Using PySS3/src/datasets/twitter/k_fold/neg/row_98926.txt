Tonight is the nightAfter several failed attempts I finally figured out how to end my life. Know that I know this is really it, I am terrified. Im so scared about whats after death. Im agnostic and a philosophical buddhist but my luck theres a hell and thats straight where Iâ€™m going. It has to be better than this horrific life though. I just wanted someone to know. Please pray that I find peace after this. Please. I am too tired.
