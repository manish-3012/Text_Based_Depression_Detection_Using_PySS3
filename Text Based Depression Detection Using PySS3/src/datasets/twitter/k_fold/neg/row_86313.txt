Guy whom i considered my best friend told me to go kill myself if i had the gutsI've been suicidal for around two years now. Used to self harm daily at a time.
So yesterday, two of my friends accused me of being selfish- that only my problems meant everything to me and I didn't care about others. The guy who I thought to be my best friend told me I had a very low EQ. Maybe what they're saying is true. Maybe I do whine around a lot and I'm a boring sad person who trivialises other people's problems. But deep down I just try to help everyone. I try to care for others more than me.
Anyway, I told them that the reason all this happens is because I'm severely depressed(I'm on medication) and suicidal and that I used to cut myself. So my best friend just told me that I've been whining about that for a long time. He told me to go ahead and kill myself. He told me I didn't have the guts. He also said not to do it at his home because he would be in trouble then. 
I don't know what to do. Should I attempt it?
