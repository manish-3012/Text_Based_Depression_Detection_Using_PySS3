I've been hallucinating for over a week...I've been seeing my wife that passed over 6 months ago. It finally made me able to here her. I asked here what I should do. She said well, what would you tell me if things were reversed. I told her what I always would tell her, I would want you to do what you want to do, I want you to do what would make you happy. So said ok, isn't that what I've always told you to do too? She said I only wanted you to be happy. You should do what will make you happiest. I said but the only time in my life that I was truly happy was when I was with you and that's gone. The only way for me to be happy is to be with you. She asked is that what you want? I said I think so. She said well then finish what you need to and come to me, I'll be waiting for you, I love you. I said ok I love you to, see you soon. And I haven't seen her in a little while. I have a few loose ends to tie up which will take a few months and then I'm going to go to her. I haven't felt this peaceful in a while. It feels kinda good.
