Got accused of data theftA woman who came to our minimart a month ago wanted us to help her print some stuff from her What's App and Hotmail/Gmail accounts, which I did.

Then, I logged out of her accounts and What's App Web as I always do...

She called a few minutes ago, pretty much saying that I stole her data or browsed through her What's App messages, she called my mom's phone, and even when I sent her a voice message and picture evidence that I didn't do it, I bet she didn't bother to listen, saying that it was my mom backing me up...

Told my family that if this doesn't prove that I'm hated just by existing, I don't know what will. I helped her print some stuff, and now she's saying that I'm a hacker and/or bad person...
