I Regret Not Killing Myself 3 Years AgoI wish I had summoned the strength of will to kill myself like I had planned. Instead, I wimped out and told my family. They convinced me to drop out of school and move back home. 3 years later, Iâ€™m still living under their roof and no better off than I was then.

When I first contemplated suicide 14 years ago, I never could have imagined loathing myself more, and now I am but a shell of the person I hated then!

Even if I did not hate myself with every fiber of my being, I would still face the problem of being completely apathetic about life beyond my suffering. Objectively, I know I have many aspects of my life to be thankful for, but thatâ€™s just the thing about enjoyment or appreciation - theyâ€™re not objective. 

I really could not give less of a shit about the goals that used to motivate me. I have no dreams or desires beyond escape. To muster even a small twinge of positive feeling from my old hobbies, I have to be buzzed going on drunk. All fiction is old hat. Sex sounds like a tedious waste of time. Even food is starting to lose its appeal. All of my previous ideals have faded into a mere remembrance of preference. I canâ€™t even get angry about anything anymore - just sad. 

And that sadness is only a sadness I can feel for myself and others likewise staring down the barrel. Other  people relate to me about genuinely terrible, painful problems theyâ€™re facing, and all I can muster is fake sympathy and a shrug. WTF is that? I canâ€™t even feel a common humanity with people anymore? 

I think this is it. I have reached the point where I have lost so much of myself that I might as well be dead already. I donâ€™t want to stick around to witness this slow, inexorable slide into emptiness. This is not a life worth living. I just wish I could convince my family of this before I pull the trigger. They donâ€™t deserve the pain Iâ€™ll be leaving behind.
