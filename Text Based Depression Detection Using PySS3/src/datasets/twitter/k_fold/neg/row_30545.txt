I know I cant, but the fear is subsiding.This is my first time actually posting something serious. I'm keeping this as a throwaway. I really don't know what I'm doing. It's been about 13 years, and I've never directly asked for help. Self reliance, and mostly "not bothering others" was more my thing. When the depression started in high school, I figured it's teen stuff and will go away. Now I'm 27 and it's spiraling down into its worst. I'll try to keep this as short as possible since it had the potential into turning into a huge rant.
 My mom was always the thing to keep me alive. I'm an only child, and  she is widowed. I failed at succeeding at life many times. I'm almost 30, can't work until further notice, no college, no solid plans. I'm just another loser. Since my bf isn't in any a better boat I'm left to be the main breadwinner. I have no self esteem, or self confidence. I'm so tired. I'm told I have potential with my mind, but I don't have the energy or the motivation. I hate myself. I hate how I fucked up my life to bring myself to this point. And as of recently the fear is receding, and the thoughts of my moms pain fade. I'm going to struggle to make ends meet my entire life. I don't feel close to any people I know. I tend to hold feelings of resentment for the general public. Avoiding sobriety are the only things that have kept me here. Sleep is my only relief, which is hard to get to and hard to keep. I read a thread on here about near death experiences, and most posters said they were peaceful. This has been a thought of comfort. I can't talk to anybody I know about this, and phone calls with strangers are an anxiety overload. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.
