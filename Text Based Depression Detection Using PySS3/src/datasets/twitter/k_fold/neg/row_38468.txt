I'm just so tired.I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a long time now, and I'm so tired. I went to college, away from my abusive family, and it didn't get better. I got myself into therapy, and that didn't help. The meds haven't helped either. My friends, while they care and do try very hard, can't do anything to alleviate my suffering. I'm trying, really, I am. I am just so tired of trying. It feels so useless, and for what? To save myself? I don't think it's worth the effort. I just want to sleep.
