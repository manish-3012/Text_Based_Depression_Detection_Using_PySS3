I live my life as a shut in and don't know how to break this cycle.I suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts to the point where I sleep for 10 hours and sit around the house for the rest. My self esteem is very low and I do not think I am good enough for anything. I have been doing this for a few years now - basically the time I got out of high school. 

I realize there are some good things to live for but I do not know where to start.
