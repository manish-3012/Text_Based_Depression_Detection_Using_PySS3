may be homeless soon unless i find a jobim 19 years old and in my 2nd semester of community college, My mother will kick me out soon if I don't find a job, I make sure to apply at 5 places a day at least but I am struggling and show her each place i applied at, I have had 4 interviews who all declined me and last summer had temporary summer hire at walmart for 4 months. I have no back up plan, no friends or family I could turn to, I really dont know what to do when she kicks me out because it is happening soon. Each day she comes home from work and is very upset with me and all i can do is cry, i am trying my hardest to find a job but i cannot... what should i do?
