AgainAgain people aren't reading what I'm saying. Again people are putting words into my mouth and making me feel worse than I did before. I really cant take this anymore. 

Since I've been out of hospital I've made plans and nearly killed myself almost every day and all I know right now is that this person is probably right.  I don't have a right to complain at all because I'm not starving to death. I have schizo-affective Bipolar and Pure O OCD, but if I can't even acknowledge that its better to have those things than to starve then why have I accepted any help at all. I'm a terrible person, a terrible fucking person and I'm not going to try anymore. I barely try to stay alive anyway and people who are starving are fighting for their lives. 

I don't deserve to live and I never did. 

Thank you to everyone here who supported me over the past year. I hope this is the last time I post here.
