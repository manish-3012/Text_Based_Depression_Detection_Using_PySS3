Why shouldn't I kill myself?Here's a run down off my situation.

I just moved back to Christchurch, New Zealand after ten years in Australia. I'm 23. I am staying with a distant relative on the presumption that I will get a job and move out soon. I have a job at a bar to help me get by until I get a real job. I don't get along with my family but they're helping me financially, too. I don't know anyone. I used to have friends but lost them all. I went to a good school and am plagued by thoughts of what my life could have been. I didn't finish my degree. I want to go back to uni but nothing I'm interested in will end up paying well (philosophy, politics, music engineering, fine art). I'm miserable all the time. I used to smoke weed all the time but have stopped now. I have nothing. I have no one. The only prospect I have is some office job I might get. I've had similar jobs before. They're not fulfilling. My family and I don't really get along. I'm just at a loss and I don't know what to do. Any help will be greatly appreciated. I'm on the verge of doing something drastic like killing myself or robbing somewhere and living relatively well for a while before killing myself or something. I want to do well and succeed. I want to live a normal life so I can exceed that and be exceptional. Please help. P.S. I am capable of writing very well but I threw caution to the wind with this post because I'm a bit manic right now. Also, articulating things well is actually emotionally exhausting so I decided to get everything out in a non-linear stream of consciousness for pragmatic reasons. Please help. Thanks
