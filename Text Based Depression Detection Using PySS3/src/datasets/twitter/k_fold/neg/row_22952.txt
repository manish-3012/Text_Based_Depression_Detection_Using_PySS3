Sort of oscillating around hopelessI've had major depressive disorder for close to 15 years. 

I feel sad, I don't desire going out, or being around people, but my life experience points to this being the solution. I don't enjoy myself.

I have seen psychatrists and therapists, I've been on more medication than I care to think about. 

I'm tired and I'd rather die than watch my life steadily point itself in all directions that make me unhappy, unfulfilled, simply tired of being alive. 

Sometimes it really feels like I am obligated to live. I want things to be better, but I've fallen into the same metaphorical hole over and over, and I'm tired of my culture placing the responsibility of all my sadness, squarely on me. I don't want to lie about being happy, just because nothing works, and everyone around me is tired of trying.

I at times, wish there existed a sympathetic God that would relieve this suffering, this unbearable pain. I've been trying, every day, to persist, but the exhaustion of this life, sometimes I think hell would be reincarnation, heaven would be the absence of consciousness.
