I have a planIn the daytime I can handle my thoughts and compartmentalize, but at night is a different story.
Iâ€™m sure this sounds cliche but itâ€™s true: I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m anyoneâ€™s favourite or super necessary to anyoneâ€™s life (I love my family, love my boyfriend, but Iâ€™m such a burden and they would truly all be better off without me).
Iâ€™m mediocre at everything I do. Iâ€™m very fun at parties, loud and energetic, but when you get to know me Iâ€™m socially awkward and have a big mouth, so end up in fights with people close to me.
I feel I have no real or justifiable reason to feel this way. My life is objectively okay. 
I have a very good plan for ending it and Iâ€™m really just done. I know itâ€™s selfish. I know it will hurt people. My therapist has been over all the reasons Iâ€™m being irrational. But it feels right, to not be here anymore. 
Has anyone been here?? Just fucking weeping in bed at night and unable to sleep?? Iâ€™m not keen go do it but I honestly donâ€™t see anything other than this. 
If anyone has advice please please comment
