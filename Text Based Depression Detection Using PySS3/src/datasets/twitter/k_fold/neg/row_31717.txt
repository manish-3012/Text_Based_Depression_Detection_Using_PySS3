Haven't posted in a couple of months. I hope what I have to say helps someone.I've taken to spirituality to ease my pain, I don't know if it's for everyone but it certainly has helped me. These are the books/authors that probably saved my life.

The infinity of the universe and the meaninglessness of life and it's hardships were my main reason to considering ending this journey. Now I know that I don't really know anything, and yet the universe has become aware of itself through my own mind, however damaged it may seem.

I will hold on forever, until the choice is between killing myself or killing another human being. The other day my girlfriend and I were talking, and she said this in the 3rd person to me "I hope he doesn't die, because that would suck and would not stop sucking".

All I could do was laugh. Going to be a hard winter having to bike everywhere because of my DUI, but i'm still sober and I have someone to call my beloved right now. The song "I want to hold your hand" by the Beatles makes so much more sense now.

I know others have it far worse than I do. I love you all, please hold on, a new earth is just around the corner, but only if you hold on.
