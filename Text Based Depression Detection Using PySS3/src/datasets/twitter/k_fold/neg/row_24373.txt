I feel tired.I'm 17 and I don't know what to do. I'm afraid of posting here since none of my suicidal thoughts are very extreme, however I have attempted it once in 6th grade. I have anxiety, high functioning autism, depression, and ADD. I got a job recently at a restaurant, and despite it being only 15 hours a week, on top of me not doing any sort of school, it is very stressful. I have gone through many different medications and none have helped much, as I still have many suicidal thoughts. I am unable to do anything fulfilling as it puts an extreme strain on me to the point of physical pain, likely due to my disorders. I am unable to play games with my friends as it is too mentally difficult to do for me. I am often very bored, however am unable to do anything, due to what I mentioned above. I've called hotlines, however my parents scold me for it, saying they aren't professionals and I should say everything to them instead. My parents are extremely work oriented and are disgusted by the thought of me trying to take life slow and easy. I have felt like this for 17 years and it hasn't gotten any better. I'm sick of life and how fast it all is and how everything has some sort of obligation. I will always have to live by working even slightly, whether I like it or not. I want to be completely free to do as I please. Sorry for rambling, I needed to vent.
