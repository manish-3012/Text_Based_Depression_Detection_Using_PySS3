I'm disgusted with myself and I'm doneI'm done. I'm going to find a way to suffocate myself to death. I cannot do this anymore. I cannot breathe anymore. I cannot look at myself anymore and see a person. 

My partner is divorcing me for being an emotionally trampling person and who doesn't listen. I'm too paranoid. I ask too much and pry into privacy. 

I cant do this anymore. 

Im a disgusting creature and I can't do this anymore. I dont deserve anything but pain. I'm too damaged to love anyone else. 

I dont want to fight anymore. I can't do it snymore. I can't love myself at all. I don't deserve it.
