I've lost everythingIm really struggling. I have lost everything in my life.

I have lost my girlfriend of 4 years. She's left me because i was in a bad mood all the time, she begged me to go counselling but i ignored her. I did finally build up to go to the counsellor but it was to late, she wants nothing to do with me anymore.

We own a house together, she surprised me with papers tonight infront of her friend to sign. Its to transfer all the house to her.

I have no were to move to. No family. I have a cat and she hates him. i cant move into a share house with him. I cant afford a share house. My entire job has been re organised and we are all down $400 a fortnight. Thats my mortgage payment.

I have also been placed on depression tablets daily. Been on them for two weeks.

I have had 3 panic attacks in last few weeks.

I have no friends i can talk to.

I have no one.
