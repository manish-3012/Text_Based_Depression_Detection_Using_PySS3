Thoughts from a "survivor"I attempted suicide on New Year's Day, 2020. 2019 was not kind to me at all, and I was not willing to spend another year in misery. The previous night was spent with the last few folks I truly care about, and when I left,  I held my best friend extra tight knowing it would be the last time. I fully intended to die that day, and to be honest, I should have... but a small oversight in my planning caused my attempt to fail. 

What are my thoughts since then? More of the same, except worse. I've never felt so hopeless, useless, or isolated in my life, only now with an extra sprinkling of guilt. I keep to myself because in the past, when I've reached out the other person either used the information I told them against me, or just stopped interacting with me. Can't say I blame them. I've tried talk therapy and medication over the last 13 years to no avail. This second chance at life has just turned out to be a second chance to be even more miserable. I'm tired. I'm so tired of fighting.
