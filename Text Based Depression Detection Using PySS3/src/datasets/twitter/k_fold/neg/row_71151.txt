Out of hope.I've spent a good chunk of my last year changing who I am, bettering myself, doing everything I thought would help and here I still am, hopeless and unhappy.

First it needs to be stated, I have no intention in killing myself, I'm to afraid of the afterlife to make any sort of hasty decision to end my life, with that being said, if I was guaranteed there was no hell, or heaven, I would have ended my life over a year ago, I am no ashamed of this, some people are just meant to live and others aren't.

I went through my whole last year changing everything about myself, from my lifestyle to my attitude, I went from being a lazy fat slob who was an asshole to everyone, to a slim, muscular guy who is open to people and yet I'm still not happy.

What I've come to the conclusion of, the only thing left for me to do is sleep the rest of my life away, just give up and sleep when I can, I still plan on working out daily, and going to work, but as soon as I'm home, I'm just going to sleep, on the weekends, I'm going to sleep them away too, I honestly believe I am totally done with life and that I no longer wish to be here.

As I stated above though, I won't kill myself, I'm just to afraid to do that, however I am going to disappear and be alone from this point forward.

Why am I telling reddit this? 

I wanted to get this off my chest to a bunch of random people without judgement, I would rather avoid going to any of my friends and family as they wouldn't understand, so to avoid any hard feelings or stuff like that I'm coming to reddit, where I can say how I feel and not a single person on here knows me.
