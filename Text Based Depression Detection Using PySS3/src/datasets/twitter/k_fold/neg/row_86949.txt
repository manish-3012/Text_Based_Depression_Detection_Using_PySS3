Posted this a few places nowSorry, I guess this is my third time posting. I've been trying to talk to family members for help too, I hope you don't mind if i post again.

Everything that makes me happy isn't anymore and I'm hoping it's my med change, I stay awake until 4 am every night and contemplate suicide. I don't sleep. During the days I try to convince people to hang out with me or look for change to save up for video games or cigs. I hate my life and I think suicide is the best option at this point. Some of my friends I tell and nobody has told me it isn't a valid option in my situation. I just wish I had someone to talk to, I go on Reddit and pm people to play games with me but nobody ever responds. I'm very lonely
