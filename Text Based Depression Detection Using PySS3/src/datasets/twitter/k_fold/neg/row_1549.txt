I just want to say good bye. I went to my last job interview this week. I found out that someone else got the job I applied for today. I'm done with this game. I'm done with a life of no advancement, and I'm done with being homeless. I'm tired of people's attitude towards me. I'm sick of living on the streets for 7 years now. I'm sick of all the time and effort I put into trying to learn something new only to have no one give me a chance. I'm sick of not being able to get things done that I need to get done. I'm sick of the health problems that I can't afford to get fixed. I'm sick of the very low amount of money I get from the government that doesn't even allow me to afford a room at a cheap motel. I'm tired of waking up and getting rained on. I'm tired of needing to rely on someone else to get something very basic done. I'm sick of coming to these job centers and libraries looking for jobs online just find the same things posted over and over again. 

I'm killing myself because I have no viable future in this world. Even if things did get better it wouldn't stay better. I'm already past the point of making enough money to retire on. I'll just end back up in this boat but in worst shape because my body will be in worse shape. 

I have no loved ones to call and no friends. I just want to leave this here so someone somewhere will know I'm leaving. 

Good bye.
