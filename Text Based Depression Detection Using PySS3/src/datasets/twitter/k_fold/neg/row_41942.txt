An escape, an exit, a solemn choiceIt is a Labyrinth, from which one cannot escape. There are walls everywhere, no place to go, I am trapped. I look to the left there is an opening but I stumble, and fall missing my chance. But do I fall? A deep plunge and no more is felt, where am I now? I am in too deep there is no light, is there any more hope? Do I stop? Do I go? Is this the end of the road? I feel my life has come to a halt while I am in this abyss, but do I dig to the sides or try to come back out? Or do I wait for time to do itâ€™s job and forget me like an old movie, burying me deep in the sands of life and death. Do I pass and only live on in memory or do I push forth and try to see if there is hope for me? The questions continue to be asked but still the only thing keeping me is the guilt, the guilt, creeping in like a shadow it consumes the labyrinth that is my mind, holding me back from committing what some would call a crime. I do not think I can go on, when will this all end, is there a moment when I will realize I have it all wrong or am I destined to face hell for the rest of time. The only escape seems to be to wait, but do I wait and decide my own fate or do I fight and not pass alone? The path is unclear and there is no desire to wait, Give up and I hold no drive to continue, is it a way out or in? Is it a loss or gain? What is there to be done in this battle of the labyrinth for an escape, an exit, a solemn crippling choice.
