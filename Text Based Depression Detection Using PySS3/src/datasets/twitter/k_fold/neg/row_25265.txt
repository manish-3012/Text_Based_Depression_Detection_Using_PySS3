The EndAfter 4 years of battling suicidal thoughts and self harm, I feel like my strength has been exhausted. My feelings spiralled again and I've been stuck in this cycle of self harm and suicidal thoughts while trying to stay sane and focus because my finals start tomorrow. I've never told anyone â€” my friends or family â€” about how I'm feeling because, long story short, it never ends well. I'm planning to do it today because at this point I am honestly so, so tired and all I want is to be okay. I know I'm being weak because every time I'm that close to committing suicide I used to be able to pull myself back, but at this point I'm giving up becuase things don't look like they'll ever get better.
