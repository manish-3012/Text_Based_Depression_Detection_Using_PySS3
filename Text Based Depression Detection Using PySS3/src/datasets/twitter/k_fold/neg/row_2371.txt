How have people dealt with being left?My fiancÃ© told me yesterday she's leaving me, she's my true love and soul mate and when she was collecting her things I begged her not to go but she said she couldn't stay things aren't the same anymore. I just wanted to get a knife and stick it through my heart because it's easier than going through this pain for a lifetime. But I didn't. I don't know why? But just wanted to know how people deal/dealt with loosing who they truly thought they'd be with for life?
