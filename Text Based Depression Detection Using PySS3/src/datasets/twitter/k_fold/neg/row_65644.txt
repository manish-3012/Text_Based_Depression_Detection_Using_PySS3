Anyone else already feel dead in this existence?No friends, no gf, live in a shit area of poverty (can't even get a job and move out of this place) 

I've missed out on my youth and it kills me so much knowing that, I open up Snapchat and see all the people having such a better life in the area I want to live in.

Everyday I feel lifeless and have no control on anything, I just want to enjoy the fruits of life have a decent set of friends and an SO is that too much to ask. Instead I'm just rotting away here.

I want to live in london, that's all I've  ever wanted I love it there, the culture, the people I am meant to be there.

Next year I will build up some money hopefully move there and be happy but it's probably too late cause of my age, some things can't be mended.
