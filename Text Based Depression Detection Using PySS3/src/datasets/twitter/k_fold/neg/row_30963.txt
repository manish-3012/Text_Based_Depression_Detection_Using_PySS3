I'm about to do it.I was never diagnosed with depression but i know i have it, i get sad a lot and most of the times there is no reason why i get sad, i get bullied a lot in school, and my friends used me to play my games, and my family doesn't seem to care or notice me at all.

My mom is always on Facebook talking to her friends or something, my brother always physically and emotionally abused me when i was young, my sister always said mean stuff to me when i was little.

One time my mom took marijuana and was raped, this was probably the worst moment of my life, my mom is well today but she doesn't seem to care that i have depression, she just says "It'll get better", and obviously that doesn't work.

And my brother is always having sex with her girlfriend when ever i'm home alone, it makes me feel worthless, also, my mom and dad are divorced.

I pray every now and then and when i do, it doesn't work, and i always think why God is treating me like this..maybe because he doesn't exist? That's a good reason.

If anyone is reading this, please help me, i can't live like this anymore.
