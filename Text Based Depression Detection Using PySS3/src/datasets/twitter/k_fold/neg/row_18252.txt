Fuck everything up with every oneI just destroyed a potentially awesome friendship. I ruin everything.
Can't find new work. Can't do anything right. Just a burden on everyone and after losing her + hurting her...why should I bother trying anymore?
I'm a grown ass man that can't seem to control anger or paranoia about people betraying me/using me. Why am I so weird?
I really just want to stop being a useless piece of shit. Feels like suicide is my best bet. I have no one but family...
