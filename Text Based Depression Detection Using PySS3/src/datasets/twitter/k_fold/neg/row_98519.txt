i want to end my life but something is stopping meis it my own cowardice, i just want nothing more but to die. I considered jumping in front of my train this morning, then i prayed the bus would jump the curb and hit me, i cried upon reaching school because i was still alive. I can't stand being alive but i don't know why i didn't just step in front of that train, nothing would've been able to stop me, i would've died on impact pretty much. i can't see any reason for living, the world that used to be so beautiful is so bleak to me now, no matter how hard i look, i can't see anything.

considering it, i might just do it tomorrow, no more worries, just peace.
