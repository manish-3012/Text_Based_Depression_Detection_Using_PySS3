Im gonna do it finallyI guess I'm just posting this for the catharsis, kinda like a diary. I'm tired of having no one and nothing. For the past 5 years I've struggled with being homeless, alcohol, getting stabbed, depression and no one ever helped me with shit. I kept going cause I thought things would get better but they didnt and never will. So Im cleaning up my house this week, buying a gun on friday and going to this nice big forest and blowing my brains out cause im sick of this shit.
