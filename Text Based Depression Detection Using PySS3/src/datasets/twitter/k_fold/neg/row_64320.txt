What is your reaction to the movie "The Discovery"?There's a movie on Netflix called *The Discovery* which entertains the idea of a world where the existence of an afterlife has been scientifically proven, causing millions of people to commit suicide. I'd like to know, from suicidal or depressed people who have seen it, what effect did it have on you/what is your opinion?
