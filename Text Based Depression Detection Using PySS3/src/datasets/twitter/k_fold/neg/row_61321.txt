going to hang myself tonighttried reaching out here and nothing came of it.  no where else to turn. i got desperate and ate food out of someones trash last night...threw it up because i felt more ashamed and worthless than i ever have. and why not i ate fucking garbage. thought i could try begging for something but whats the point. im just going to be in the same situation. i wish i could talk to someone and have a normal conversation.  but i guess this is it.
