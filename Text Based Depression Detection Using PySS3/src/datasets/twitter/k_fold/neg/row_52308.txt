Just tired of being botheredBeing bothered constantly by people who want something from me (taxes, bills, colleagues) is awful. I'm sick of it. I hate it.

I don't have the means to kill myself, and I don't have the energy to get the means, but I still wish I was fucking dead.

I'm not sure when life is ever going to mean something.
