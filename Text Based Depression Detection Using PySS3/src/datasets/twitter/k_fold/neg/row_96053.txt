I just want it to endThe constant stress. The constant feelings of feeling like Iâ€™m annoying or clingy or everyone hates me. The constant hate for myself. I canâ€™t take it anymore. I recently met a guy who I thought I hit it off with but it turns out heâ€™s not as into me as I was into him and itâ€™s just crushing me. I know itâ€™s because Iâ€™m not that pretty or skinny but I really thought he liked me. I hate living like this, this constant state where I know people donâ€™t want to be around me. It would be better for everyone if I just wasnâ€™t here, itâ€™s not like anyone would notice. Iâ€™m not good at anything, Iâ€™m not smart and Iâ€™m definitely not a head turner. If I were to be gone one day, no one would notice and I feel like it would be better in the end. I just want it all to end I canâ€™t keep living like this.
