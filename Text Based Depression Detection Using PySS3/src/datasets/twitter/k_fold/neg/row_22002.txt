Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m doingI donâ€™t have anyone to reach out too, or I think maybe I feel like, my very few close friends think Iâ€™m stronger than I am, and I donâ€™t want anyone know about what Iâ€™m going through. So I feel like Iâ€™m a very enclosed box, suffocating. I have two kids and a husband, who I love dearly, which makes me feel even more guilty about having these thoughts and feelings. Iâ€™m really really struggling. I used to drink on occasion for fun, and now, every time, I spiral into a deep depression and canâ€™t stop crying. I canâ€™t and wouldnâ€™t leave my kids and my husband, so these feelings are unbearable and I donâ€™t know what to do. I literally canâ€™t breathe, I rarely sleep, no one listens, I canâ€™t afford a therapist, I feel like Iâ€™m just dying. I donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s gotten really bad as of late. I gained weight, I canâ€™t seem to stick to a routine, people tell me I can talk to them when Iâ€™m reality I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m told Iâ€™m not making any sense, that itâ€™s a â€œpoor meâ€ mentality. I only talk about it when asked yet even then it feels like a trap. Iâ€™m stuck and lost in my own head. I just really need someone to please help me.
