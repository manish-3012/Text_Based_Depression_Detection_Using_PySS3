I'm lost &amp; I give up.I recently turned 18 so I'm now legally an adult but I never had the chance to live a normal childhood, Being chronically ill from the start I lived my starting years up until I was 4 Inside the hospital without my parents company for the majority. I can't remember much of my childhood being delightful as I was never taught the basics things like social skills or the basic understandings of emotion &amp; empathy. And as I got older I struggled with extreme social anxiety, aviodent personality disorder, self harm as well as anorexia and I'm still struggling on with it all now. I've begged time and time again to get help for this and each time I've been shot down. I'm now on my final year of college still without a single friend or clue to the world. I'm tired of spending my days constantly isolated left to my own devices, I don't want to live this miserable life I've got nothing to my name, nothing to lose.
