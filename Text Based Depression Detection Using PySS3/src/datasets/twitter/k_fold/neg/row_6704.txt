I'm in a perpetual cycle of planning for the future and wanting to die as soon as possibleWhy do I do this? I know I'm most likely going to kill myself before summer even starts. Why am I planning for the future? Any plan I think of will just be redundant in the end. It's all so pointless. What's wrong with me? Why can't I just be 100% suicidal or 100% normal? I hate this tug of war between wanting to die and wanting to see the future. Can't a truck run me over already? Reverse and run me over again just to make sure there's no second chances.
