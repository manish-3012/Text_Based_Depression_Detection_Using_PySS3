I'm scared of myselfI've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a few years. Last year I would think about how I would get away with suicide, but the death of someone I knew through suicide deterred me from actually doing anything. This year my thoughts are getting worse, suicide has been on my mind almost everyday this past month. I've told a friend about it, but I don't think he knows how to deal with it. Especially since to my friends and family think I'm the cheery girl who is always laughing about something. But it hurts to try to put up that mask, even more when I try to act that way in front of the friend that I mentioned. I've been ignoring him for the past few weeks becuase I'm scared that he'll be dissapointed that I'm not better, that I'm not happier. When I confessed to him he was so surprised to learn about my thoughts.  He has noticed my change in behavior, but he hasn't done much except get another friend to check up on me. At this point my mind is too confused to make out what I should do. I've been irregular with my emotions and actions lately, sometimes I slip into the mindset that I should just kill myself becuase no one will care, and that scares me. I really want someone to talk.
