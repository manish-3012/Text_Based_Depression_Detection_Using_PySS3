If I announce to my therapist that I want to suicide, will the therapist try to have me involuntarily committed to the hospital?The thing is, just how much useful is a therapist after such a revelation? I am starting to think that suicide is the final secret. You either keep it with you till you actually suicide, or you tell the doctor you want to do it, and he makes sure that you can't do it. How can you be sure that the doctor won't sneak out on you when you wouldn't expect it? I want to be able to share this secret of mine but, the doctor is his own person with his own agenda.
