Exhausted  Im sure most people here can relate when I say it gets extremely exhausting feeling this way. Especially when you constantly feel the want and need to just be gone, but you cant go through with it. 
  Iâ€™m living for my parents wellbeing and my cat, and because Iâ€™m afraid of being in pain before I die or burdening someone with the trauma of finding/losing me. Some people will say they understand me, but they donâ€™t and a lot of times donâ€™t try to. Im just tired of feeling this way and feeling so stuck, tired of being judged. Iâ€™m starting therapy soon so who knows, maybe things will change and Iâ€™ll start living for myself for once. If not, Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ll stick around too long. I wish you all the best, thanks for reading my vent if you have : )
