Iâ€™m so scaredThe person I love, I feel like weâ€™re drifting apart and she wonâ€™t talk. I opened up so much and she barely reacted. I apologized for thing I didnâ€™t feel I needed to apologize for but I felt like maybe they were getting to her. I apologized if I was over reacting because of my depression. I said I Love you. She said nothing. She didnâ€™t look at me. She just claimed sheâ€™s just tired and had a bad work day. But itâ€™s been like this for weeks. Iâ€™m just so scared. I think so many suicidal thoughts, Iâ€™ve picked up the razor again and I donâ€™t even feel that pain. I want it to stop, I want us to go back to normal. I want to die.
