Somewhat recently diagnosed with OCPD, but after/during this most recent family vacation my will to live has dwindled to nothing.Currently on 30 mg mirtazapine, how do people cope..?

I can't imagine it being much easier to stay alive than it would be to just die. But I don't want the sole reason for me to keep on living to be that it's too big a hassle to off myself.
