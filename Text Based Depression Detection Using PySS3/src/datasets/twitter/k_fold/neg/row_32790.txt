What's the point of an empty life?I just feel so empty.  There's nothing to life, there's no enjoyment, there's no goal, there's no point.  

I have no girlfriend, girls are uninterested and probably repulsed by me.  

I have no friends, I can't make friends and the few people that do choose to hang out with me soon leave because they lose interest.  

I have a college degree that hasn't gotten me shit.  I'm working jobs that only require a high school degree.  5 years of college and loans to work a damn job I could have out of high school.  Great. 

I hate the city I live in, nothing ever happens, and yet at the same time I'm scared to leave.  I tried once and ended up coming back because things didn't work out and I was miserable.  At least here I guess I can be miserable within a few miles of my parents who are the only people who give a fuck about me. 

I just feel so empty.  I don't want to be here anymore.  There's no point in this struggle called life, especially seeing people enjoy their lives, or at least being able to experience joy.  My life is always just bleak and empty.
