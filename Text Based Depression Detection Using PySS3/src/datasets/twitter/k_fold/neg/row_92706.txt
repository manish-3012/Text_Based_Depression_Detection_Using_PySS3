I've lost my motivation to keep goingI've lost all my friends and I'm having a lot of issues with school. I have nobody to go to other than my parents and because of that, I always feel really lonely. I'm not confident in how I look at all and the thought of people looking at me and thinking about how weird I look is incredibly stressful and just makes me not want to go out at all.

I have had back pain for months cause of a surgery and my depression makes me never want to exercise or even get up out of bed. I'm in pain every day, physically and emotionally, and I don't know how much longer I can take of it. I've dealt with my depression for a couple of years now but it's starting to break me.

I know I should just stop complaining and be grateful for what I have, but it's so hard. I feel like I have nobody to talk to anymore and I'm always in so much pain that I never want to get up and do anything. School stresses me out so much it drives me insane. I don't know what to do about it, or about anything.

I know this sounds stupid I just don't know where else to go, I'm sorry. My parents are really the only thing that has kept me from killing myself. I want to live for them but it's really hard to keep going, and yes, they do know I'm depressed.

I haven't used reddit much, sorry if i screwed this up somehow.
