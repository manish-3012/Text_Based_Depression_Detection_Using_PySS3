I tried committing suicideI'm 15, good grades, never did drugs or alcohol, I have a brother, I do sports and gaming . I'm studying to be a lawyer and therapist. I think I can make a difference to people that need someone to talk to. My dad passed away when I was 5, my mom had to work full time. So she left us with my aunts and uncles. My uncles took care of me when I first got there until I was 12. He had to move away, I miss him. Then my aunts took over. It wasn't bad until now. I started high school and began career choices. My aunts are beginning to get tired of me, they make fun of everything I do wrong and tell m they will send me away to a boarding school with my brother. I was suicidal and when I mentioned it to them, they said they wouldn't take to anyone. They would just do it without a question. I've tried talking to myself, telling myself that everything gets better soon. When I'm done with high school and college, I'll take me and my brother away from them and start over. But that's over a few more years, I can't wait that long. This morning they made fun of me in front of my cousins and that really did lower my self esteem. I held a knife to my throat but I couldn't cut, I couldn't leave my brother with these people.
