meh...I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s helping or hurting knowing some people are just a miserable as me. Iâ€™m at a point where Iâ€™ve just lost hope of ever being happy with myself. Thereâ€™s no point. I told myself if I lost weight Iâ€™d be happier but Iâ€™m not. I pushed the reason for my depression onto aspects of my life but even after changing them I still feel just as bad if not worse. 
I canâ€™t look at someone without thinking how they are better than me. Iâ€™m not good at anything, Iâ€™m not smart, I donâ€™t have a good personality, and Iâ€™m definitely not gonna get carried by my looks. Iâ€™m just constantly letting everyone down around me. They could all do better than me they deserve better. Iâ€™m just to selfish to let them go, eventually theyâ€™ll just leave everyone does. It doesnâ€™t really bother me anymore, if I was them Iâ€™d leave too. 
Iâ€™m so confused on what I want to do. I donâ€™t see a future for myself and I can barely do anything without having a mental breakdown. Iâ€™m making everyone around me miserable too. I just want it to stop, I just wanna be okay. 
I miss being a kid and not having to worry about anything. I just wanna go outside and play for hours and make up stories with friends and just be happy. But no matter what I do Iâ€™m not. I just wanna feel something other than whatever Iâ€™m feeling now. 
I donâ€™t wanna die but everyday it feel more and more like the only option. Life is just meaningless. There are occasional things that are good but after awhile I always ruin it. Iâ€™m a useless member of society and Iâ€™m just taking up space. I should just kill myself. If I wasnâ€™t such a coward I would have by now. My life isnâ€™t even bad I should be grateful. But Iâ€™m so fucking selfish I canâ€™t even be happy. 
Is there even a point? Wake up work and then die? And for what? I donâ€™t want kids. I donâ€™t even know if I want to get married. Whatâ€™s the point?
