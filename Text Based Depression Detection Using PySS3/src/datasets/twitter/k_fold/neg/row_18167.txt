My 16 year old friend that is a girl just asked me if I would be affected if she wasn't around. Might be jumping the gun but she's not the happiest person so what can I do to help her?I don't see her in person that much but flirt with her through text. I do tell her I lover her (not too literally but don't get hung up on this). I do like her but have made on advances to dating her and she's given me mixed signals so I just let it slide. Anyways, she is asking me how I would feel with her gone and I told her I wouldn't have anyone like her to talk to. I told her I loved her even if I don't know what that means exactly but I do care about her very much. So what can I really say or do to let her know if she was gone that things would not be the same, even with someone who she barely gets to see anyways.
