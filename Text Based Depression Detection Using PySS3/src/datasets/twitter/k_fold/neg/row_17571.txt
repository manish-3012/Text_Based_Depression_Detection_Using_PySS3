Just in case.I wanted to leave this here. Just 8n case I actually go through with it. I am so, sad. I'm losing my kids. It hurts so much. Their mom is taking them across the country and I have two choices,  either let them go and fly up to them once a month or only see and hear from them for six months out of the year. I cant explain how much of a broken person I am. I'm still young and my body is broken because of my military service.  I have to take pills every day of my life just to stay safe because of a head injury.  I have no family anywhere near me and only a handful of friends. It's not a pity party. I have given everything I can to my kids. I want them to be better than me. I can drop about 70,000 in their moms account and know that they at least have something.  I dont want anything or anyone to talk me out of it. I just wanted to vent into the oblivion that is this place. I have my bottle of whiskey, my sleeping pills, and found the knife I used the last time.  The kids just went to their moms. No one will know anything is wrong for at most a week. Fuck. I'm crying like a bitch because I'm so close and I will just miss my kids.
