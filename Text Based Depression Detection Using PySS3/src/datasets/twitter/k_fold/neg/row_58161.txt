My life is already completely over. I have nothing left to lose. I'm completely alone.I've been sleeping on the streets on and off. I lost my only source of income. I was accused of doing something I didn't do, but nothing changed when I was able to prove it. I have no one to help me. I don't really have friends or family, no parents that will help me. If I did, I would be staying with them instead of that shitty motel or outside. I've lost everything I own now from having to leave behind most of my stuff in the motel when I couldn't pay. 

Honestly, what's the point in continuing if this is going to be my life? I feel like no matter what I do, I'm just going to stay at rock bottom. Or sink further. This isn't living. I'm pretty much already dead.
