Bored of lifeFeels like I have nothing to lose from committing suicide. Every day is the same routine and everything is so gray. Haven't actually spoken to anyone in 5 years other than the occasional hi and bye. I have no real friends. I care about my family but not really.  Most of the day is spent staring into the abyss. Have tried hanging myself multiple times. Currently contemplating about taking 5 tabs of benadryl, downing a bottle of vodka, and cutting myself in a hot shower. 

This desire to kill myself has been coming in waves throughout the years and I think i've reached my plateau.
