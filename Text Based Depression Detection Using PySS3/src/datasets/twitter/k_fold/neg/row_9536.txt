Need some advice on what to watch forI hope this is the right place to post this, if not, please let me know of a better subreddit.

My girlfriend, whom I love more than I can describe, is bipolar. This means that, statistically, she is 10 to 20 times more likely to attempt suicide than the average person. Every so often this little fact creeps into my mind and breaks my heart. Before she was diagnosed (and before I knew her), she had attempted once, a story I don't know the details to other than the *big* scar on her wrist, and she just recently hit a depressive phase where she didn't get out of bed for two weeks. She's told me that during that time, she had made all the preparations necessary, including what dress she would be wearing, and what music would be playing. (This is breaking my heart just to write this.)

Now, all I know about the method she was going to use was that is was supposed to be clean and painless. I made her promise that she would get rid of everything when I started dating her, and according to her, she has. However, I don't know whether she could (or would) acquire more and attempt again. I know what to look for in her moods and actions, but I need to be able to keep an eye out for the physical means. 

If it's best not to have a thread full of "easy and painless" methods, then you can PM me. Also, if the mods want any verification that this isn't just for my own use, please feel free to PM me as well.

Thanks Reddit.



**[EDIT]** The meds she takes for her disorder *are* strong enough to kill her. The doctors know this however, and limit her to prescription sizes smaller than that.
