I may be done.Been trying to be positive and hopeful these last few weeks but things weren't going my way. I kept on fucking up on things in my life and I don't think I can do anything to make it better anymore. I've lost the one and only person that keeps me from going insane and frankly.. I'm just standing outside, near the train tacks in front of my apartment just waiting.. waiting for something, maybe that one "push" to just end it all. I've always been optimistic but I don't know anymore.
