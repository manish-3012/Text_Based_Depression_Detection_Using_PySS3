god i wish i was dead, why can't i die?this feeling never ends does it? after so long of fighting it i just don't want to anymore, the war of attrition, and stalemate has gone on long enough, i'm done i'm ready to cave in again. I feel the walls of my dugouts slowly turning into squishy mud and sliding down the walls and pooling around my feet. I'm clutching my gun as if it will somehow save me... but I also know that it can't, only my own two feet can do that. But I don't know where to go, or what to do anymore. I've tried therapy, and the weapons they gave me have little effect on the enemy. They only help me hold my ground and not give up my trench, but it's slowly eroding away.  

I've tried medications, but they do more harm than good, instead of my walls slowly melting, they turn more into a spasm of anxiety, and doom, with a mix of paranoia for some of them. Dieting helps, it keeps my walls from staying as puddles at my feet, it becomes solid enough to stand on, the walls still melt, but it's better to have a floor and no walls than no walls and a puddle. Exercise helps, but the rewards of it never outlast the enemy's fire. It comes too fast. Friends help me dig out my hole again and again, but it always needs digging and they get tired of it faster than i do... Family care, they try too, then give up because it's useless. 

for fucks sake I wish I was dead, I want this war over one way or another. I'm fucking sick of it! help me please. help me end the war.
