I don't want to anymoreI really can't anymore, I just can't take the pain and suffering. I was trying up until now to live but I can't do this anymore.
From the very beginning I never felt truly happy just meh.
I never had any dreams, never wanted to do anything if it wasn't necessary. I finished school and started working but I never liked both of them. It's not something I want to do it's just something I have to do because society tells me I have to. I suffered from depression since I was like 7 but nobody cared, I didn't. It was just how I was, always tired and unmotivated. 
I just don't see the point in living, nothing gives me joy or happiness, I only suffer while continuing to live this life I was given. I always planned to kill myself eventually and I think it's time. I have nothing left, I saw everything I could and I know how my life will continue if I do end up living.
The only thing left for me is to find a way out, I don't care if its painful it just needs to be quick and 100% kill me.
I don't want to be a vegetable, I just want to die.
