I am finally gonna do it.For context, I have Borderline Personality Disorder, so my emotional highs are extremely high and my emotional lows are stupidly low. 

Me and gf break up, was gonna marry her after 4 years of relationship, its my fault, the last month before we break up I send her on a vacation to California to her family so I can get my stuff straight and be the person I wanted to be for her. I got my ged, car, good job lined up for me and her, lost 30 lbs., cleaned the house up, sold the video games, and starved to save money to get her a promise ring. 

Come the time she's supposed to come back we argue and she decides to stay and breaks up with me, then later says she regretted the breakup but is staying because she's already told everyone she's living there now, and bc I currently had no job, the living situation, and she misses her family and wanted to see them since its been 4 years. I am super messed up over this, I lose a further 10lbs in days, I quit the job opportunity, I start drinking and smoking. I feel very hurt but deep down my previous actions from before caused this at least mostly. Then On October 1st I stop talking to her for a month. Come my birthday, October 29th, she wishes me happy birthday after a month of no contact. I get sick and throw up constantly from it. 

So days later after my birthday, I find out my best friend, who I have told about this constantly everyday, about my night terrors of her, of my constant weight loss over her, my anxiety to where I vomit, the nose bleeds, and how I am still madly in love with her, how guilty I am and how suicidal I am over it, gets into a relationship with her just one month after we broke up.  

A 4 year relationship, gone after a month. He says he didn't mean for it, he was trying to help her emotionally, and caught feelings for her. The pure disregard for my mental health, anything I say or have told him, the pure lack of discipline, the hurt and betrayal I feel. It is insane. I lost my best friend, and my rock to tell my problems to.  

His mom says it's messed, suicide hotline person says its messed up, all our friends say its messed up, his family say its messed up, everyone I have told says its messed up. He claimed he didn't know it was wrong.

So I give him the ultimatum, me or her. Ive known my friend for ten years. Hes only known her for two and been with her for a month max. I then see on her email, that she booked a flight back to my state. For a guy who has no job, lives with his mom, plays games more than me. The same reasons she said she didn't come back. 

I feel hurt, betrayed, damaged on all sides. My friend chose a girl, and a relationship built off of a shoulder to cry on, over me, a person until days ago he considered his brother. 

She had family in Cali. I have nothing besides my friend and his family. Now I dont even have that. I genuinely want to die.  I can't do it another night. I have nothing, nobody to talk to, nobody to go to. I am tired and worn down. 

I am tired of the night terrors, I am tired of the lack of sleep, I am tired of throwing up every day from anxiety, I am tired of the insane mood swings, I am tired of the fear and suffering. God help me, everything is going wrong for me. 

I have tried to commit suicide days ago by drinking bottles of cough syrup, and now I am likely to shoot myself.

So I am at a crossroads, do nothing to them and hopefully my friend learns a lesson, be extremely malicious and they get what they fucking deserve, or just ignore it all and kill myself. The suicide is likely for the other options as well.
