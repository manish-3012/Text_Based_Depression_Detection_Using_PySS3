told by someone I love to â€œjust jump off a bridge alreadyâ€When I thought I was getting better. 

I long ago stopped vocalizing my desire to die, but people donâ€™t forget. I deserve to have it used against me. 

Iâ€™ve done nothing good with my life, maybe I never will. 

I stopped wanting to die, and then I get told by someone I love, â€œI wish you would just jump off a bridge already.â€

â€œI wish it was possible to poof you out of existence.â€
