Does a suicidal person realize?Iâ€™ve been super depressed for about 2 months now. Iâ€™ve had years of depression before this too. I recently started telling my wife we are going to sell some things. Some of these things mean a lot to me. For instance, Iâ€™ve been a gun collector, I told her we should sell those, and my car. I didnâ€™t really think much about it then, but now, Iâ€™ve spent most evenings from home working on odd jobs, I feel like there is stuff to get done.

I am a retired veteran for medical reasons. 2 deployments that were hell. I have been through many suicide awareness classes so I am seeing these signs. I know I have suicidal thoughts, but I have never really made a plan. 

So my question is, are these subconscious thoughts? Am I unknowingly planning my demise?
