I tried to kill myselfI tried to cut my arms so deep that I'll bleed to death but instead I was rescued ten minutes before I died of blood loss but as much as greatful I am for being alive I'm still alone and just an option in everyone's life instead of a priority even my mom was just shocked for a while but she acts like it never happened and I see nothing has changed and my father keeps pointing fingers instead of telling me that it's alright  or telling me we'll travel or getting me a thing I like and my friends are kind of avoiding me but they always did that before I did it but I didn't do it for attention but even if I did don't I deserve attention 
I feel like nobody cares like it ended the same way it always ends me alone in my room for two whole days no one checking on my everyone acting like it never happened and my phone only gets notifications when the power is low 
Like can it get more lonley , I feel so disconnected from everything and don't find much joy in anything or feel the urge to do something like all I've ever wanted for a year or more is someone who hugs me and tells it's going to be fine and I did well 
Am I asking for two much , like I always stand by my friends in their time of need but why do I always get that "no one asked for your help you were just being extra nice " answer when I expect someone to be there for me 
I just remember that yesterday I regretted it all and now I don't see a reason why I mustn't try to kill myself again , like I see nothing's changed
