I feel like I have no right to be suicidal, but that just makes me even more suicidalIâ€™ve had too many privileges for me to be suicidal. I come from a family that accepts me (for the most part), that loves me, and for most of my life hasnâ€™t had to worry about financial insecurity. Iâ€™m at college and my parents took out the loans for me because they didnâ€™t want me to have the debt for all my life. But they were also able to afford the tuition for the first three years even though it isnâ€™t a cheap school. I donâ€™t feel like I deserve that. Why did they do so much for me? Why do they still do so much for me? I love them and am grateful but I feel like I will never be deserving of that. 

I havenâ€™t had a super hard life (itâ€™s had itâ€™s downs but everyoneâ€™s life has its downs) and I feel like because Iâ€™ve lived a privileged life Iâ€™m automatically a bad person and thereâ€™s no way to fix it. Pretty much the only way for me to make things right would be to die. I already hate myself and basically implode on myself from anxiety on literally any topic at all and have never seen myself having a future... it scares me because I donâ€™t want to hurt those I love but I literally see no other way. 

I donâ€™t deserve to live when other people have it worse but do more with less. I havenâ€™t had to work hard enough for what I have and the resources should be spent on someone who deserves it more, not me. But god, Iâ€™m scared...
