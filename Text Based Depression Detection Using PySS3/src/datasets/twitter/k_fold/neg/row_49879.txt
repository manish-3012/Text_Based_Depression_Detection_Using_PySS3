Hey there.If this is going against the rules, I apologize in advance. Hear me out before you delete this though.   


I've said and done some horrible things and it has been haunting me ever since I did them. I regret it every waking hour and it's been until this week now that it's hit me full force with what the ramifications are.   


I know people will say it's cowardice... but I'm not seeing a better alternative and it would be better for the parties involved if I did what I did.   


Before you ask, I have said that I'm sorry but saying sorry doesn't quite cut it anymore. This isn't something I can say "sorry" and forget about, no matter how much booze I'll consume. This is pure, agonizing guilt I'm feeling and every gut feeling I have is telling me that this is the right choice but I don't have the strength to do it.

**TL;DR:** *My guilt is driving me to suicide and there's nothing I can do except hope that if there is a God, it'll hear my prayers and realize - in tandem with my apologies to who I've wronged - my guilt and forgive me.*
