Intrusive thoughtsI have been getting better with my depression and anxiety and i know i donâ€™t want to die but i keep having thoughts about killing myself. like i am no longer inviting those thoughts in my head, but they still appear? does anyone else deal with this? itâ€™s so hard because i feel like i want to live but my brain is still telling me how i should die and itâ€™s effecting me getting better. it feels like i will never get better if i keep having these thoughts. seems like theyâ€™ve been there for a decade but iâ€™m just now acknowledging them
