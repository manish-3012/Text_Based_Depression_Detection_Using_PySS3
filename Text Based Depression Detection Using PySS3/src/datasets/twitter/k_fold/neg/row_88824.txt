I need to dieI donâ€™t know how else to put it. Honestly Iâ€™m not going to kill myself because I donâ€™t think I can, but I want to be dead so bad. Iâ€™ve wanted to be dead for so long itâ€™s overwhelming. Thereâ€™s nothing you can do about it. I beg god to kill me most nights and I really mean it. Itâ€™s so hard to be alive. I have no reason to live. No one ever chooses me. Im a leftover. Iâ€™m just a rounding error.  I donâ€™t belong anymore. I donâ€™t have a career and donâ€™t think I ever will. I fail at everything.  And I donâ€™t care. Iâ€™d be fine with it. If it could just end. If I could just not have to sit here all awake, because I canâ€™t sleep (because nothing is easy for me) i canâ€™t do anything. I just suffer silently, alone, for 33 years. And it never ends. Every phase. Every new path. Everything I try ends the same. Alone. Left out. So close to what I want I can taste it but not allowed to have it. I *hate* life. Iâ€™ve hated being alive since I was in third grade. And it just wonâ€™t end. Friends get sick and die miserable painful deaths of cancer in front of me who want to live so badly. But not me. Iâ€™m still just here. Begging for death. Itâ€™s not the drama of some kid saying oh god I hate my life. I *hate hate haaate* being alive. It enrages me. I donâ€™t know what else to do. Therapy doesnâ€™t help. Pills barely help.  What do I do?  How can I just die?
