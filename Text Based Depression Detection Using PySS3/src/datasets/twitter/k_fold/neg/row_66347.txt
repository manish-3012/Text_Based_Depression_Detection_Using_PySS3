Genital/Body Dysphoria? Possible Gender Dysphoria???I really hate my genitals itâ€™s caused nothing but extreme mental illness in me.

Iâ€™ve never talked about this to anyone, not even online. Itâ€™s so embarrassing and I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself because I just canâ€™t anymore. 

First, letâ€™s describe this situation. I really hate my genitals, I think about self mutilation a lot. I get excited thinking about cutting it off, probably because it trigger me and makes me super depressed, suicidal, and almost physically ill looking at it. I genuinely want to remove it with, or without medical help, I donâ€™t care anymore. The physical pain would be nothing compared to what itâ€™s done to my mental health which has fucked almost all aspects of me. The only positive I can see in all of this is that I have gender dysphoria (I think) still trying to figure it out. Which means I could just transition to a trans women and hopefully feel better about myself. It could also just be extreme body dysphoria iâ€™m not to sure. Either way I canâ€™t be a real man nor a real women so it puts me in a shit spot. 

We will start with flaccid. My flaccid dick size is the same size I was born, it never grew in girth nor length. Itâ€™s about 2 1/2 inches in length, girth is about the size of two thumbs pushed together. Also, my penis is crooked and weirdly damaged. The urethra opening is crooked so when I pee it goes way to one side. It has some kind of weird hard bump on the tip on one side as well. Itâ€™s not cancer since Iâ€™ve had it forever and it probably would of killed me by now since Iâ€™ve never got anything checked by a doctor. 

Not only that but my balls are extremely saggy, like itâ€™s extremely bad. There is so much access skin. I can pull it all the way to my asshole and touch it if I wanted to, or all the way up just almost touching the belly button (like an inch away). Also I might have webbed penis (I think). That means some of the scrotum skin is hooked onto the actual penis to high.  

Erect Iâ€™m like 5 inches, not bad, itâ€™s workable sure. Girth is non existent, so Iâ€™m basically a stick, how fun. My balls still fucking look so fucked. I also have slight penis pain in the one side erect or not it is there. It doesnâ€™t hurt and cause extreme pain, but I can feel it. Itâ€™s weird. 

My dick isnâ€™t sensitive anymore, probably because I jerked it too much and too hard with no lube since I was a young horny teen who had nobody. And it distracts me from using drugs, alcohol, self harm. Anyways, I canâ€™t enjoy that feeling of pleasure anymore. I donâ€™t remember when it stopped feeling good, but now Iâ€™m not sensitive. There is only one spot in my entire dick that feels pleasure itâ€™s weird. Iâ€™ve tried taking breaks, I tried going slow and loose, trying to bring some sensation back, but nothing has worked. 

After all those flaws I also am a one pump chump. I canâ€™t control it at all, I have tried, I just canâ€™t last long. If I ever had sex it would be over after a minute. 

In conclusion, I am so fucked. It has ruined my life and I donâ€™t think anything is worth living for. It breaks my heart knowing Iâ€™ll never be a man. Iâ€™ll never be able to satisfy a woman sexually. I have too many flaws down there for her to be fulfilled. Iâ€™m sure she wouldnâ€™t want someone who can only lick her pussy. Wtf would she need me for if I canâ€™t do anything else. This shit on top of other issues has me questioning everything, it has shattered me into a thousand pieces and there is nothing I physically can do to fix it other then chop the shit off and move on, or accept that my most important body part to me is disgusting.
