just drove around the area now im herejust going to write my thoughts here cause i dont know where else to go. everyday i feel excluded i dont know why im feeling like this.. survived cancer in 2011 now i wish i hadnt and just shouldve died. just went for a drive past all my close friends house wishing they can just come outside and give me a hug.
contemplating on cutting.. but isnt that just for attention. why am i so needy
