Havent slept in 30 hours, starting new job in 5 hours. Cant sleep, having worst night in a long time. HelpHi, I am 22. Thought I had been making progress, apparently not. I have had diarrhea 4 times in the last hour, i am always on the verge of vomitting. I start a new job tomorrow and need to wake up in 4.5hours but i cant sleep, already havent slept for 30 hours. The suicidal thoughts are very serious tonight and i am safe tonight because people are here but holy shit im considering it. I dont know what to do. I feel 100% hopeless. I cant even handle tonight!!!! How the fuck can i last until average age of 82. 

I am going to let down my job tomorrow. Fuck i just hurry up and do it already. I am going to have a lot of time alone with my shotgun, in the woods. I shpuld just do it and be over with, i cant take this and theres no solution and i dont want any fucking drugs
