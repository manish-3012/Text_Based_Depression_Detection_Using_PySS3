My Story.I was around 12 years old when I was old enough to realize that my father was an alcoholic, workaholic, and a drug abuser (coke). The fights between me and my dad got worse, he would get drunker every night, and the screaming between my parents never stopped. This is around the time that I started to cut myself. I didn't want to die, but I felt like I was to blame for my father's actions and that I needed to be punished. Around the time I was 15, my dad not only mentally abused me but he started to physically abuse me. He gave me a lovely shiner and a popped blood vessel in my eye. He then dragged me by my hair into my room and proceeded to suffocate me. Eventually he stopped and left, but the damage was done. My mom took me away from him, but with her minimum wage job, life really sucked. There were weeks at a time with no food in our fridge. Our gas and electric shut off numerous times. This point in my life, I really wanted to die. I would stay home from school and look through my mom's room, looking for any medication that would kill me. I almost resorted to injecting myself with her insulin (she's a diabetic). Months later, I attempted to cut my throat, to no avail. It really makes me sad knowing that I was so low in my life that I would do such a thing. To me, life was just so bad back then that I thought killing myself was the only way out. But it's not. I'm here to tell you that life gets better. It may seem like it won't now, but it will. And I want all of you to know that I'm here for you. If you need someone to talk to, no matter what time. I'm here and I want you here with me. I survived this and you will to. I may not know you, but I love you. 

tl;dr I know what you all are going through and I'm here for you. Please, let me help.
