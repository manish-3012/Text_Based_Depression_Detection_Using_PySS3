I feel like I'm drowning.Throat tight, shaking, hard to breathe

The amount of heartbreak is unbearable. I've dealt with so much and I don't know how much longer I can deal with this. It honestly feels like a vicious cycle of depression and pain that has no end in sight.
I thought for sure the last time would be the last but..
Nothing seems to help.
I keep trying to fight and better myself but something or someone else always drags me down at my highest.
I'm losing faith.

My days are numbered and it's only a matter of time before my time runs out and I no longer have the strength or the will to fight.. 

Why does it have to be like this?
