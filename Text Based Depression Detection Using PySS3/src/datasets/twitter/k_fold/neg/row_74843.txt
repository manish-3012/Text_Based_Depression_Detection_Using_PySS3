I'm so fucking uselessMy wife is in danger of failing medical school, which is partly due to my anger issues creating another level of problems for her to get through in order to just focus on studying. 

I'm fucking garbage. Everyone I've met would've been better off without ever meeting me. No matter how much I try to improve myself I can never undo the damage I've done. I'm just too cowardly to finish the job.
