I've been writing a suicide note and I don't know why.I've been suicidally depressed for many years.  And I've caught myself writing the note a few times.  

Here I am trying to construct apologies and say goodbye.  I don't plan on suicide.  No plans made.  But I find myself saying goodbye to the people I love.  It is a strange duality.  And I don't know what it means.
