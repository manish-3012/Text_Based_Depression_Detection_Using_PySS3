I canâ€™t live like thisI feel so useless. I canâ€™t do anything right. Iâ€™m shy, antisocial and a loner. Iâ€™ve been depressed for several years now and itâ€™s just getting worse and worse. 

I want to kill myself so badly, but I canâ€™t bring myself to do it; not because I care about my life, but because it will devastate my parents. All other people that know/knew me will eventually recover from my suicide and continue with their lives as normal, but not my parents. 

Iâ€™m an only child. They dedicated their lives to me, they are paying for me to study what and where I wanted. They will never recover from my sucide and their lives will be over.

But I canâ€™t live like this anymore. Every single day I wake up and regret waking up, regret that I didnâ€™t magically die in my sleep. I try not to show how I feel, and I think Iâ€™m doing a good job - no one suspects that Iâ€™m suicidal. 

I have the means to do it right now. If I do it right, it will work. If it doesnâ€™t, I can try again. But the thought of doing this to my parents, completely shattering their lives is making it very difficult. 

I donâ€™t know what to do.
