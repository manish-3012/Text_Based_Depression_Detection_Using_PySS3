What is the point?Really though. What the fuck is the point of living, for me, anyway. Work some dead end job to pay off my $70k debt I racked up to get a degree that Iâ€™m not even using in the slightest. Probably for at least 20 years with my juvenile spending habits. Whatâ€™s the fucking point of meeting another woman who Iâ€™ll either grow to dislike or struggle to trust, or who will grow to dislike me and my depression and disposition of life. Whatâ€™s the fucking point when she could just get a fucking cat who could make her happier, a new guy who is happier, more well hung, has some direction, fucking anything. And what if I luck out? What if I luck out and meet someone special? Then what. We get married and have kids and are happy for a while until my depression and obsession and comparing kick back in again when she makes more money than I do and I probably still have no direction in my life? Then what? Sitting at home drunk with my kids telling me theyâ€™re going out while Iâ€™m sitting at home listening to Miles Davis alone because my Wife is out with her friends at some swanky wine bar because sheâ€™s sick of being around sad olâ€™ me. Feels like Iâ€™ll never get the drive to truly ensconce myself in Ableton, literature, music, film. I just lack the motivation, drive, and frankly get more dopamine from getting Ultra Kills in a Dota 2 match. I donâ€™t even know where the fuck to meet people. Thereâ€™s just so many fucking hoops. If I get lucky and meet someone new, what are the chances I just get sick of them or they get sick of me? Or I canâ€™t trust them because I have fucking trust issues from being dumped, manipulated, beaten down, flaked out on, ghosted, and in nothing but toxic and abusive relationships and friendships that have scarred me more and more and more and more. I just donâ€™t get it. I donâ€™t get what the point is. I donâ€™t get how things are supposed to get better. Yeah, I should just MAKE them better. Like that is just a fucking cinch. I donâ€™t even have the drive to fully learn software I paid $500 bucks for, how could I possibly get the drive to just magically change my life and love myself. I feel fucking doomed. Iâ€™ve worked at 1 job for 1 month in the past 7 months. I quit because I had a suicidal breakdown after I looked at my exâ€™s social media. Yay me. I want to die. I want to slit my fucking throat in front of everyone who has ever wronged me. I want to be explode into a million bloody chunks and watch them feel fucking BAD for me. Yes, that sounds so selfish Iâ€™m sure. I donâ€™t care. I have every right to be upset. The people I do care about, my family, theyâ€™re the ones whoâ€™d suffer. But all those other fucking pieces of shit, theyâ€™d cry for a few days and move on with their life, carrying with them the notion that they were better off without me, and that none of my suicide was ever their fault, that they did nothing wrong, and IIIIIIIII was the asshole for blowing my brains out, theyâ€™re just strong people for handling it. Ha, more like ignoring it. I donâ€™t see myself alive by age 30, and I think about suicide everyday. Iâ€™ve had attempts in the past, been in an institution. Itâ€™s all so fucked. The way this country handles mental illness is absolutely pathetic. You have to sign a fucking agreement with your therapist that you wonâ€™t hurt yourself. Ha. Ha. Ha. Then of course the cops get involved if you do. â€œWe canâ€™t have ya out there hurtinâ€™ yourself bud! Gonna have to take ya to the mental hospital so you can do group therapy and play dominos with schizos and people more manic than Gary Busey on PCP for a minimum of 72 hours. Oh and by the way hereâ€™s this bill youâ€™ll never be able to pay! Hope you feel better now :) See you soon!â€ Fuck this monotonous fucking world. And fuck me. I hope I get hit by a fucking car every time I take a walk outside. Someone just kill me. If you donâ€™t, Iâ€™ll do it myself. Eventually. 

P.S. 

Fuck medication. Maybe it's all some fucking conspiracy anyway. I've been on so many and it's all just bullshit. I've seen so many therapists, hypnotherapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors. And frankly, I'm fucking sick of it. Not only sick of the act itself, but so fucking sick of talking about the same shit again, and again, and again, and again. It's just like a fucking emotional fuckin' treadmill. I'm trying to do all the right fucking things, exercise, distracting myself, being with family, trying to spend time with "friends", making music here and there, but it just never feels like enough. I never feel like I'm fucking enough. Like I'm DOING enough.
