iâ€™m going to do it.i posted a few days ago. 

anyway, looks like my qns on manual hotel door lock is unnecessary after all. of course iâ€™d prefer to die in a hotel room. 
called the suicide hotline 2 days ago. thanks gary for buying me an extra day. 
yesterday was difficult. even tho i had a referral letter addressed to the a&amp;e, i couldnâ€™t bring myself to do a consult. 
the thoughts that â€œthey donâ€™t really care about u at all. your life donâ€™t matter. this is really the best way out. whatâ€™s after this? (if u survive) and we have been down this road, by imagining all the possible scenarios and the actions to take. this is really the best way out. youâ€™ve no future. they canâ€™t help you. your situation isnâ€™t one that can be improved by antidepressant, it just canâ€™t.â€ are loud. so i told the dr i changed my mind about a consult before they figured out what iâ€™m there for, and walked the fuck out of the a&amp;e. 

i been planning this all night. 
and by this morning, everythingâ€™s going by plan so far. 
i collected my prescription and made sure itâ€™s a lethal dose. iâ€™ve figured out where iâ€™m going to do. i even brought my comfort plushie out with me so i have something to hold onto in my last moments because i think thatâ€™ll be a great source of comfort. 

i got everything now. ate my last meal. 
am waiting in line to get my drink so i have something to swallow those pills with. thank god theyâ€™re small. 

i wish someoneâ€™s here to read me a story while i lose consciousness. i just want to hear a voice. but thatâ€™s okay, i got spotify and my comfort plushie. 
and i picked the most remote spot so i wonâ€™t be found until itâ€™s way too late (my room isnâ€™t a great option because apparently iâ€™m okay with potentially traumatising everyone but family. also iâ€™m not close with family so i donâ€™t want them to be touching my body) and in about 30 mins to an hour, i should be unconscious and then... goodnight world. 

i brought some xanax out too, to help make it faster to sleep and ease any discomfort. 

thereâ€™s not much else, really. not inconsolable. in fact, i feel rather calm and okay. more than okay. 
dont have anyone i want to talk to. iâ€™m not even thinking about that. not leaving a note or sending any messages (who do i even send it to? i donâ€™t have anyone. no friends, just acquaintances.) that might potentially arose any suspicion. i canâ€™t risk anything foiling my plans. 

iâ€™ve also made sure my phone canâ€™t be unlocked unless iâ€™m looking directly at it so no one will ever find this account or anything else. 

okay now. bye.
