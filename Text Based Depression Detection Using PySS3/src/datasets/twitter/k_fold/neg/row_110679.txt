Getting what I deserveI've been romantically involved with a married woman.  After the first few months we claimed we would marry each other if the circumstance presented itself.  But now.. after 5.5 years, I have seen her being very close with a third man.  A "friend".  She claims that she has told him over and over that she doesn't want to be involved with him in that way.  But her actions have read otherwise.  Do I deserve her honesty?  Absolutely not, for she hasn't been honest to her own husband about us.  Or any of her/my family.  We've been through so much, but I feel I cannot recover.  I've thought of many different ways to end myself, wishing for a lethal car accident.  I've been praying for the Good Lord to bring me home.  I don't deserve life here, I don't deserve the truth.  My removal from this place would help her to focus on her own marriage, and she can have all the male "friends" she wants in life without me to hold her back.  I'm ready for the next life.
