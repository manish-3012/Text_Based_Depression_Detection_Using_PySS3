I'm expendable.For a stranger, I'm easily replaceable by anyone. That's obvious.  
For the guy on Match I've been talking to online for a week, I'm easily replaceable.

For my online friends, I'm easily replaceable.

For my only friend in real life, I definitely know I'm easily replaceable. He didn't talk to me for years when he found out I had depression. It's only because I act like I got better that he even talks to me.

For my extended family, I'm easily replaceable. They barely even know me. Most of them think I'm a dirty sinner anyway so why would they give a shit if I just disappeared?

For my immediate family, I'm not replaceable, but they would get over my death. I'm sure they would. They're resilient. And it would be a whole load off of their minds. They wouldn't have to worry about me wasting their money anymore, wasting opportunities they are nice enough to give me anymore, starving in the street anymore.

All I do is waste resources. I'm a festering wound on someone's leg that they need to get cut off. If I just stop existing, society will be better off without me.
