Miss the childhood feeling, and want the past back. (Strange depression) i'm ready to kill myself soon...I'm not interested in adulthood happiness... just the childhood happiness. And i want it back. And everything is worse now, and getting pointless. 

I last felt the childhood feeling when i was 13. Now i'm 15. And i've been like this since i was 14. So i had 1 whole year of strange, confusion, boredom, etc. Until i became heavily depressed.

What should i do? My only possible solution left is to try psychedelics. I hope they'll make me turn my back on the past, and the childhood feeling obsession, and i could enjoy life again. But that isin't guaranteed. 

I miss playing games on the computer with my cousins in the past. It was soo amazing. There older now and the feeling is dead. 

I plan on taking 1,000 datura seeds on September 20, 2018. Hopefully that'll kill me. Age 15. Body weight 160.
Immune system: strong.   I trained myself to be tuff when i was a kid... now i regret training myself, to resist poison better.

Any other guaranteed not too painless deaths, of consuming something?
