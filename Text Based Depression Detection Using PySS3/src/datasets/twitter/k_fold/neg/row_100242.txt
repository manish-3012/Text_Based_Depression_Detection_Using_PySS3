I survived my last period of suicidal ideation, but I got worse, and lost everything, my partner, and I'm losing myself now...I thought my last post in here would 100% be the last post I ever make anywhere but it looks like I'm back, and alot worse than I was previously and I might just give up. At least, try to anyway. 
Just to recap, for those who have seen me in here, I currently suffer from BPD (borderline personality disorder) clinical depression, and GAD (generalised anxiety disorder) and im in a constant battle with my mind every single day of my life. I'm at war, and im tired. I'm severely wounded by my thoughts and my poor life choices that I believe I may just be losing myself. Recently, I don't know what led me to believing I could, but I decided to self medicate and push everyone that gave a fuck about me away because I thought I could get better on my own. 
I lost the love of my life a second time because I pushed him too hard and made him believe he was better off not dealing with my "constant bullshit every day" and told him (even though I feared every single day that he was with me that he was going to abandon me) that he would be better off being with someone that wouldn't be this much work and wouldn't hurt him and exhaust him mentally and cause him constant anxiety. I lied to him constantly, I told him I would get better, and I wouldn't hurt him. I told him he could trust me. That being the biggest lie of them all. I didn't know how the fuck he could trust me given I can't even trust myself. 
He split with me around the end of last year because I got drunk and tried to commit suicide on his front lawn, resulting in police tackling and cuffing me on the ground right in front of him. He is traumatised, and has been ever since but tried to put it behind him, so much that he decided to come back into my life around July this year, we made promises to each other saying we would both look after each other and get the help we need so we could have a future and never look back. Unfortunately, I didn't try hard enough in the 6 month period that we stopped communicating, my heart was filled with pain after he left and I abused alcohol for months on end to cope, which only made me more unwell, both mentally and physically, and I was almost kicked out of home a second time. He didnt like reminding me of the reasons why he left, but I caused him so much pain through substance abuse, all the threats and attempts of suicide, the verbal abuse, he was left with trauma, and his only solution was to cut me out despite trying so hard to care for me and make sure I was doing the right things to get better... -

The love that I felt/still feel for this person is beyond anything I've ever felt in my life, and the connection we have feels unreal, but there is so much unresolved trauma and unresolved conflict in between us that it prevents us from being together normally. We used to have everything a normal couple would. Never had any issues with our love lives, went out and did things together, would go out for drives, everything. But my self loathing and inability to control my negative thoughts intruded on everything and it became problematic real quick - ;

I'm also an abusive alcoholic, and I didn't want to accept the first part. Never in my life have I wanted to cause harm to anybody, physically or mentally. Unfortunately, under the influence, I become a completely different person. I become a monster, and my partner told me this himself. This wasn't the person he fell in love with originally, but over the time we were together I was drunk more often than I really should have been, and he was sensitive. He was and is still currently suffering from his own trauma and mental health problems and whilst drunk, I would verbally cuss him out. I would call him names. I'd get violent towards him and it breaks my own fucking heart that I have to out myself this way but I could never keep myself under control. I could never stop fucking drinking. I still struggle, instead of seeking proper help when I feel sad and my brain is eating away at me I drink to put it all at a stop, but it always comes with consequences. I lose money. I lose time I could be spending doing other, more productive things. I lose friends. I lose everything. 
Right now I'm laying here past 3am typing this sober, surrounded by empty bottles and cans and a messy room I have no motivation to clean, filled with rage and sadness, heartbreak and every other negative emotion ever and all I can think about is suicide whilst suffering from alcohol withdrawals. I hate that I didn't try hard enough for my now ex partner, I hate that I didn't seek rehabilitation for my drinking problem and thought I could "cut down" on my own, I hate that I rejected medication for my anxiety and BPD. I lost control. I thought I could do it all alone and pushed everyone away despite fear of abandonment and rejection. I became reckless and started making poorer and poorer decisions, I went back to doing recreational drugs (light/party) over and over just to feel alive, in the middle of arguments with my ex, I would believe he didn't give a fuck about me when in reality he was trying to prove a point through ghosting me and that was that he genuinely cared and wanted me to pick myself the fuck up and start looking after myself, and so I'd be petty and check every dating app I'm signed up on despite never actually having the heart to hook up with anyone else, to "get back at him" and that was never going to fix shit or do anything, really.
This paragraph could turn into a novel. So you know. I'll keep it short from here, and say that I now have no idea what direction I should go in. 
I know I need professional help, but that takes patience and I have close to none now. 
I'm losing hope, Im heartbroken, I don't know how to tell my ex that I still love him and I'll get better. 
I can't stop drinking in fear of severe withdrawals, I fear that starting meds for my BPD won't actually help and I'd be wasting money.
My ex blocked me on everything 2 days ago, and I attempted to jump off a bridge only to be halted by the authorities. I tried to slit my wrists and bleed out a week before that, I stopped myself again. I tied myself a noose and wanted to drop hang myself, didn't happen.
I'm a mess. 
I want to die, I'm not scared of what comes next, but I fear ill mess up and leave myself damaged for the rest of my life with no hope of euthanasia, I know I said I pushed everyone away, but I know people would still give a shit if they found out I killed myself. It would break my family, making them think they could have done something to stop me. 
But all I've ever been on everyone is a broken, mentally unwell burden, a weight on everyone's chest. 
I don't fucking know what to do. I want to say "someone fucking help me" but at the same time, my brain thinks "no, you aren't worthy of help, you don't deserve it, you'll just hurt everyone again".
This is a battle I don't want to fight anymore. 
I lost the love of my life, everything and everyone I cared about, and now myself. Again.
Im not doing this a second time. 
I have failed everyone and I'm tired of hiding behind a fake smile everyday. All I do to cope now is just sit in front of a TV that's never turned off, blankly, playing Xbox online with people who enjoy teaming up with me, and just staying in bed, away from the outside world, my housemates who I fear ill hurt with my negativity,etc. I'm starting to hate leaving the house because I feel I'm not stable enough to see anyone or do anything, and I just can't do it anymore. 
This isn't a life I want to live and having so many issues branching out into other ones I don't even know where to fucking start. 
I don't currently have a suicide plan, or any tools on me because the paramedics removed them after their last visit, but what I do know is, is that im not strong enough anymore and I will come up with something in the next couple of days. I've never been so tired and broken in my life and just knowing I've hurt the people I care about and love with my problems and not being able to take those things back?? 
Im finished.. im out.
