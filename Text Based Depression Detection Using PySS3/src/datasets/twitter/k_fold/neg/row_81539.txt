What happens after a suicide attempt?I have some questions is anyone is willing to share some insight.

In the case of a failed suicide attempt

1. Will they admit you against your will? Does it depend on the severity of the attempt?
2. If you are admitted, will they make you tell people against your will? For instance any family, your school, etc.?
3. Will any bills be covered by insurance?

In the case of a successful suicide attempt

1. Will any bills be covered by insurance?
2. What happens if you were attending college? Would my parents need to notify them that I'm dead and need to refund all the financial aid I received in the past?
3. What should I do to prevent the most possible emotional damage is done to the people around me?

Thank you.
