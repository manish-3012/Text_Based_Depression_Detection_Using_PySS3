Existential Failure?So I've been working for this company, been with this guy, and pursued graduate education for five years, and I'm just not convinced it makes sense to continue with any of it. I work full time and pursue a doctoral degree part-time; my SO works nearly full time and pursues a bachelor's degree full-time. When I'm at work, I wish the ground would swallow me up; I work with kids with autism and despite support via training I am saturated with sadness for their families and frustration with the progress I can effect. When I'm at home, I simultaneously loathe the mess and wish I had any energy to clean it up, or money to hire someone to do it for me. I am a terrible girlfriend. I live with my SO, but we have sex once a month max. It's an effort for me - he's hot and I love him, but it's just that I don't want sex, in general, with anyone. I feel like I have hit a wall and have kept slamming my head against it for the past 6 months or more. 

If there were a button I could push and end things, I would, no questions asked. I know family and SO would be deeply saddended but I feel like it would be the right thing to do. I've done research and options are not available, too expensive, too risky, or too ballsy. Reddit, what do you tell yourselves in times like these to lift yourselves out of, or make peace with, this shitty place? Do you even? "Just keep swimming" = just not cutting it.
