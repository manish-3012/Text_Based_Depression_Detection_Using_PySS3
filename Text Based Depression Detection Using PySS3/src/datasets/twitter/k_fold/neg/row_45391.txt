Is it possible to get yourself out of depression without medication?I've been really depressed the past few months. It's really hard for me to say it. Is it possible to *force* myself out of it? 

I've been neglecting to clean my room, do laundry, eat properly, and even take showers normally. Now it's ruining my relationship. If I just force myself to do these things, will I eventually get better? I don't want to talk to my parents about it, I don't think they'd understand. So medication isn't an option right now.
