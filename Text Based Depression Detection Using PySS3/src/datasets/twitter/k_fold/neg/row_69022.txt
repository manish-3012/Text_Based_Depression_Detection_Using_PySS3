Why should I live?My wife has cheated on me 3 times. I stick around because she has threatened to take the kids back to her home country where I will never see them again if we break up. So I am in a situation where I hate my wife, my life and most of all I hate ME. The tension in the household is growing and the kids are starting to hate me as they see me being the problem because I am the one withdrawing. I am obviously completely unloveable, undesireable and just generally a horrible person. Why should I not do the world a favour and remove my disgusting personage from this planet?
