I want to end the painHello... I'm feeling really bad today and I felt I need to talk to people who might understand me.
I have depression and anxiety and I am doing therapy but still my parents don't understand, they think I am just lazy and this is just a "phase"... they see it has an excuse.. Nobody really seems to understand. Im feeling constantly numb, I can't feel hapiness.. There is no reason to be however I just see negative thoughts, I have no will to live and I feel like I don't belong in this world.. Seeing other people happy or with someone makes me sad and angry at the same time.. During the night it's when it get's worse.. My head starts overthinking like hell and I start to think about everything, my past, my present and my future. I realize that I have no friends or almost anyone that actually legit cares about me. I've been single all my life because no one ever loved me. I know I am ugly and all but I'm just not enough for anyone.. Talking, being with people makes me feel alone and I decided to isolate myself from everything but still I feel lonely and sad. I have no motivation or dreams, I feel completly empty all the time and it sucks. My presence in this world or right here on reddit is making me feel annoying to other people. Music and sleep seems like the only solution to temporary remove the pain I feel... I spent almost all day in bed and I have to wake up to my shit ass job and pretend I'm happy and smile.. just to come home and start crying about my miserable existence..
