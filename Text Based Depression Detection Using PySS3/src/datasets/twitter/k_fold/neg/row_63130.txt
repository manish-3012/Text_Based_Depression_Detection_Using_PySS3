The patterns are still repetitive and I'm not getting any betterEven with all the help and special paths I've had paved, I feel as if I'm taking everything for granted again. I can't sleep consistently, I can't eat what's been prepared, I don't have the motivation to start any of my school work, and all I ever seem to do is self indulge. I could always jump off the bridge over the highway at times like this. No one's going to care, no one's going to worry if they don't know I've left. I hate my existence.  I hate being alive. I hate never feeling whole. I hate the constant feeling of loneliness. I hate never knowing who to open up to. I don't want to bother. Why should I bother at all?
