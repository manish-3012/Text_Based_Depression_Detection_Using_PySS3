Im dead insideI was kicked of of my work. Was workless for a month and than finally found a new job that is a bit far away. So I bought me a new car with my last money I got at all.

I worked 2 days in the new company and the work was lit. And my coworkers was very gentle to me as well.

Yesterday I had a car accident. My new car is total damaged and I lost my job for that I bought the car.

So I spend all money I got left. I'm hurt and workless 
And in the very end my girlfriend left me. In that time I could need her at most

I lost everything I had. It's not worth to live any longer
