Iâ€™m an ICU nurse and covid is taking its toll on me and taking away my will to liveI spend my whole shift trying to chase off death as my patient circles the drain... only to clock in the next day and see an empty room where my patient was. 

So many lives taken so prematurely. So many crying family members. So much hard work that ends up being futile in the end. One minute Iâ€™m braiding their hair so they look nice before FaceTiming their family. The next minute Iâ€™m zipping them up into a body bag. 

Then I drive home and see people hanging out in parks without masks. Watch these videos of grown adults throwing temper tantrums in grocery stores because they canâ€™t keep fabric over their face for a few hours. I wear an n95 all day, my face bleeds when I take it off 

But I get it, my life doesnâ€™t matter 

I feel like nobodyâ€™s life really matters actually....death just comes out of the blue and then youâ€™re gone, whatâ€™s the point? 

I havenâ€™t seen my friends or family in months. Iâ€™m too afraid of exposing them. Thought maybe Iâ€™d be able to do something for my summer birthday, but now itâ€™s starting to ramp up again 

My partner just left me, months ahead of our wedding. My entire future and my life and all my plans, just gone. Love of my life, person I thought was my soulmate, person I thought would coparent my children....gone. 

Oh yeah and 4 months ago I got diagnosed with a chronic illness and my own health is shit now too. 

And my father, the only true support person Iâ€™ve ever had, is showing early signs of dementia, which Iâ€™m pretty sure is my literal worst nightmare 

I cry every single night and pray I donâ€™t wake up, but I always do 

I guess Iâ€™m not actively suicidal I donâ€™t have a plan or anything and Iâ€™d feel too guilty to do that to my father but man, all I can think about is dying, I just want a release
