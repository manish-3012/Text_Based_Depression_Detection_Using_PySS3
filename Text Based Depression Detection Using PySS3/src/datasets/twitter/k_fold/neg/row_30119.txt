What to do now?So, I've been struggling for the last three month to make sense of my life. I made a bad decision and then, I took a few steps to try to do something better. I got unemployment insurance in August and then, I was supposed to go back to university. Then, I freaked out and I ended up cancelling it. Since that time, I tried to find a new job as a graphic designer, because that's what I did for a living in the past. I couldn't find anything decent and I also saw a career counselor in the meantime. I finally made the choice to go to a small college to get  a degree in nursing which should begin in January. The only problem, is that right now, I feel like a lazy ass, I'm relying on my unemployment insurance while I'm looking for something better than a job in a restaurant, with lower wages than what I get in unemployment insurance. I lost the social network I had when I was working full time in graphic design and I have a hard time figuring out how to get a better social life. I don't think it's healthy to constantly stay at home like I did for the last few weeks. I'm even considering going back to work as a volonteer at a suicide hotline, like I did last year. Maybe it would help me get out of my slumber and meet people so I'd have a richer social life.
