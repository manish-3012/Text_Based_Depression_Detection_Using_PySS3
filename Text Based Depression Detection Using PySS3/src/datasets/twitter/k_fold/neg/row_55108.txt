Suicide feels like an inevitablity.I cant ever picture myself doing anything else but dying either by suicide, or by illness/disease.

My entire existance is as a dependant. I wont drive, even though i know i can. It gives me such severe anxiety to even consider that i havent driven since i got my drivers license two years ago. I get driven to work, and wherever i need to, though i try and ask sparingly, and try to provide a sufficent payment for this.

I feel constantly torn up about my social anxiety. I want friends, i want more friends. I see all these people, aside from current times, partying, hanging out, or just having fun, and i feel like time for friendships like that is passing me by. I feel like iâ€™m Rapunzel trapped in a tower of my own making.

Iâ€™m obese, but i cant hardly resist continuing to eat. Iâ€™ve been diabetic, but iâ€™ve given up on taking my medication, it doesnt help. No medicine does. I just eat and eat and eat, drink and drink and drink (no alcohol), and feel shitty for myself.

I find my skills beginning to fall. I cant play games like i used to, i cant draw as well anymore, nor write. I feel so frustrated losing or doing bad that i just slap myself or punch myself as punishment.

My life has been watching the people i love get older and sicker and not being able to convince them to take on better habits. I know though that all of it is for a self centered purpose of remaining dependant.

I know that when my father is gone, i will be too. I cant dig myself out of this hole that iâ€™ve dug, and giving up is all that i can do. I dont deserve such kind people in my life, and if i had the courage, iâ€™d go leap off the bridge nearby myself.

There isnt very much light anymore for me, it feels like each day is just slogging on, and i just want to end it all and move on to hopefully somplace better. Iâ€™ve lost this game, cant restart it, and i dont want to.
