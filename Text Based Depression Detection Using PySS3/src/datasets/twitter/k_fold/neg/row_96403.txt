Rock Bottom.  Again.After battling depression throughout high school and my freshman year of college I finally owned up and talked to my doctor.  I started taking medication during the second semester of my freshman year.  I had written my suicide note out and was ready to end my life.  

I was convinced to talk to my doctor and that's when I started taking the meds.  Now, three years later, I have hit rock bottom again.  I don't know what to do.  

I realize that I have LITERALLY everything going for me, there isn't much in my life that is going wrong.  But at the same time none of it seems worth it to me.  When two or three good things happen it seems that four or five bad things happen one after another.  It is completely disheartening.  Especially for someone who has just gotten back on their feet after a hard battle with depression.  

I can't seem to find a way out of it.  I go to work, love my job.  See my friends.  Love my friends.  But when I stop and think, I just don't see the point in all of it.  There's billions of people out there, the world won't miss me much.  

Even the smallest of things can set me back almost a month's worth of work against my depression.  

Maybe I'm just tired, but I've been feeling this way much too often lately.  It is starting to feel like it was three years ago and I have feel like I have once again hit the bottom.

Will I be on Reddit tonight much after this?  I don't know.  But, we'll see.
