What Have You Done to Not Kill Yourself Today?I've been on this subreddit for months under a lot of different accounts. I've been the one helping others sometimes, sometimes I'm getting help. This sub's seen a few posts from me directly before or after a suicide attempt and ones during and after hospitalization. It's a great form of support during those times when no one in real life seems to understand or know what you're going through or what you're feeling.

That said, this subreddit is missing something. I understand that the "it gets better" ideology is patronizing, but those at the end of their rope will gravitate towards a place like this where they can be heard and they need something to inspire them to take steps to live another day. I think we need a pinned thread, possibly a daily one, where people can acknowledge and be celebrated for the things they do to keep themselves alive each day. Something like the fatlogic sub having daily health achievement threads.

I hope the mods will agree and if you do, comment something you've done that's helped you shake off your suicidal mindset, even momentarily.
