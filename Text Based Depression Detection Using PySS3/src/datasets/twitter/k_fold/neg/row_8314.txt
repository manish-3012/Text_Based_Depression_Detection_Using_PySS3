Suicide hurts but staying alive will hurt much more.I'll take the memories with me.
I'll also take the sadness that never went away.
I'll take those moments that I thought would last forever.
I was never supposed to be born anyway. I was born a mistake.
In this very same moment when the angel of death is waiting for me to take me by my hand and set me free, I have to recognize that suicide will hurt but staying alive will hurt much more.
Mistakes need to be corrected and the only way to correct the mistake of being born is dying.
