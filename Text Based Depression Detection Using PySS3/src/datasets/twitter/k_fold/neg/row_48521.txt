I think I'm near the endI am at the end of my teenage years (19F) and I have never been in a relationship. Not one person male or female has ever shown interest in me or cared about me more than just a friend. I am not worthy of anyones time or interest. I am not enough. I have been severely depressed for 5 years. I've also been on medication and been to therapy for years. I have managed to put on a front for my family that I am okay and doing better. I cannot waste any more or their time and resources trying to get better because it's a lost cause, I'll never be better. I decided a long time ago that my life would end in suicide probably when I was around 30 or before then if something else worsened and I was still alone. I knew when I was 15 i was going to end up alone. I am not interesting enough, or special enough, or skinny enough, or pretty enough, to be worth someone's time. And sure enough, 5 years later I'm still alone. The pain is so bad I don't know how much longer I can take it. Everyone says to just be patient and that people find love at all different times throughout life. But I've been in this deep pain and hurt for so long already I can't keep waiting around hoping it'll get better.
