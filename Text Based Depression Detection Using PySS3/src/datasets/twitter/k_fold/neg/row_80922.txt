Today is a bad dayI made a post a month or so ago about my fiance who committed suicide, and how much I miss him.   


Yesterday, I heard part of a song I've been actively trying to avoid, as it reminds me so much of him. I ended up feeling majorly depressed and spent most of the night lay there.  


I had a dream about him last night. One of those dreams that feels so real. I felt like I could wake up and message him and he would respond. But he won't.

Today, I just feel so low, and down. It doesn't help that the 2 year anniversary is coming up.
