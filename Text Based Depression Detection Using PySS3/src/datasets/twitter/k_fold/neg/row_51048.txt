I hope others can relate to my poem, even though this isn't that greatWrenching my mind in torment

Voices sinking their teeth in

Like a volcano once dormant

A thousand thoughts burst me open

&amp;#x200B;

Once angels from above

demons crawl in my brain

Feeding on fear and love

They inflict endless pain

&amp;#x200B;

Calling me back for more

A prisoner to my own venom

With a thousand thoughts blocking the door

No positivity can gain momentum

&amp;#x200B;

Silence now engulfs the room

Nothing filling it but guilt and hate

My thousand thoughts still loom

Nothing left but to question my fate
