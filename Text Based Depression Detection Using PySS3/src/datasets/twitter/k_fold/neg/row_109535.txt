Thinking of giving up.The past little while has been incredibly hard, and I don't know if I'm willing to keep trying. I'm in the worst place I've been in, in a very long time. I want to reach out to my friends, but I just don't know what that would accomplish. I want to tell the girl that left, everything she did, and the worth she left me with. That also wouldn't help with anything. I don't want to be just someone that my friends have to keep an eye on. I feel like I'm just delaying the inevitable. I don't want to go to the hospital and explain what's going on, I don't want to be medicated as a crutch for the things in my life, or explain why I've been gone for days to my employer. The only thing I know, is I don't want my friends and family to grieve, but that's not realistic. I just don't know what to do, I don't want to try, I don't want to acknowledge my feelings to my friends and family about the severity of my mental health. I'm writing this more for myself than anything, but going at the end of the day today seems easy enough to handle. Just act normal, and see all the people I can before tonight.
