someone please help me,,,,anyone else feel like the clock is ticking until they kill themselves? any moment now im going to do it. i cant jump off my balcony because its not high enough for me to die. overdosing on pills wont kill me. i cant stab myself because naturally humans would have a hard time actually stabbing themselves to death. regardless our knives are too dull for me to do that. im 18 so i cant buy a gun. i feel like theres no option on how to kill myself. i feel like i am going to be stuck feeling this way forever. i just want to end it all. anytime i open up about what im going through nobody can give me advice on how to make it better. there is actually nothing i can do. i have come to terms with it and accepted that. im here to ask if i can meet up with someone from the bay area and if they can sell me a gun. i dont care about the price. just tell me the amount and we can meet up.
