What's the point of living with depression?As things in my life continue to progress, I continue to be miserable and depressed nearly all the time. The only time I'm happy is when I'm hiking, exploring a garden, or looking at some other visual art. Life itself fucking sucks, though, in every respect.

I don't know. I've seen most of the things I've wanted to see, done most of the things I've wanted to do. What's left? What's keeping me here, other than a sense of moral responsibility?
