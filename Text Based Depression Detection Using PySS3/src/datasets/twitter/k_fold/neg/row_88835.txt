I don't know how to stop fucking things upI've been depressed for a long time. In high school I had no friends due to my extreme social anxiety. I shut everyone out and hardly ever talked. By the time I graduated last October, I was really tired of life. I met a guy on tinder, and after a few weeks of knowing him I decided to do a dumb ass thing and run with him.

On day two of the road trip I rolled my car on a gravel road. We were both uninjured but the car was totalled. Instead of going home, I decided to buy us both a plane ticket to a city we wanted to visit on the other side of the country. We stayed for a month and used up all of my savings before we finally had to come home. I fell in love with this guy - how calm he was through everything that happened, how he always made me feel better and put a smile on my face. 

Since we've gotten back, things have just gotten worse and worse for me. I smashed the screen of my laptop and can't afford a new one. I started smoking weed more and more. I housesat for a family friend, who I managed to piss off my letting my boyfriend's friends be too loud late at night so the neighbours complained. I fucked up and lost my $15000 university scholarship by enrolling in the wrong units, forcing me to drop out. I barely see my parents because I can't face them. I can't find work and my boyfriend is unemployed too. I can't tell if it's good for me to be with him or if I'm just to scared to be alone again.

Everything is just too overwhelming. I want to get away from it all. I've tried taking it one step at a time but I can't find a job and that's the one thing I really need. I'm so tired of trying but still managing to make so many mistakes.
