Myself..I love the piece when I hear to the song "IT'S THE RIGHT TIME". I'll probably end my life while listening to it it I'll be like films it mades me so happy to think about it I just can't stop thinking of this.

I found a way to end it will be slow and so peaceful in the dark at 3/4 am while listening to the song and with a bottle of water behind taking all the sleep pills and thinking about good things like how much I wanted to be loved by someone in my life that wasn't fake for the first time and that people respect me and don't just always insult me because it's fun to do so...

I really like the idea of after I'll be dead ill be able to see like a ghost what the people on earth will do, find, invent or what type of creatures they will see and maybe fight i can see the images of them fighting in the space agasint who knows type of creatures.

What I wanted from this life it's just to be happy and have some friends but is so hard to do find them I don't know why I see others that have a good life with some bad things and that's it what I ask if for that but I guess the god that dosent even exist dosent care about me or just us in general in reality no one does even if they say they want us with them and that they care...

I would explore the universe with a bunch of friends maybe like Rick and morty that shit its fun ahah
