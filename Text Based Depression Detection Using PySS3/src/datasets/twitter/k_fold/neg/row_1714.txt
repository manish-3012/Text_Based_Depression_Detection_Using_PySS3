I don't want to die, but I want to stop living.I don't know what I'm feeling, but I'm tired of being alive, I just wish I could fall asleep and never wake up. I don't think I'll do anything, but I just wish I could be done with it all. I hate waking up every morning and realizing that everything that was good was just a dream, and I don't think I'll ever reach it.
