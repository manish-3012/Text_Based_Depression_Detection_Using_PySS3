I find it hard to open up to people so I just put things hereRight now it feels like my life is going absolutely nowhere, that I'm stuck being a failure for the rest of my life.

I can't even bring myself to try anymore. It's like all the motivation that I used to have is gone. It's literally taking the same amount of motivation for me to just get through my day as much as it used to take to do things like get back in shape.

I mean, could life even get better after this? I've just graduated from college and those are supposed to be the "best years" of your life but they were no different than any other point in my life. Yet it only seems to get worse afterwards. I feel like I don't have any more potential as a human being, that the only direction I can possibly move is downwards at this point. I mean, everybody who has ever become great at anything started at a young age right? So what's the point in even trying at this moment? It's too late. It's over, and the closest thing I have to a reset button is an off switch.

For the first time in my life I truly have nobody to turn to. I've never been so alone in my life and there are no more avenues left to fix that.   Everybody I know is becoming successful in their own lives and I'm just...here, not doing anything really significant with my life.

I can't open up to my parents who I still live with by the way. They literally get angry when I try to open up to them emotionally so I just don't. They'd really prefer a son that didn't feel anything and just stayed stoic and did his job. I tried to be that son and I failed. Now I can't bring myself to do anything. The worst part is that I know that they wish I was more like their friends' kids, and maybe they're right. Maybe I should be less like me, or maybe I should just not exist. But who do I turn to if not the two people who are always supposed to be there?

And my friends, well, peers I guess. I only have like three I can really talk to and they're busy with things all the time. So it's just me really. Me and this post. 

I always felt that if I did end it, there wouldn't be that many people at the funeral. Maybe some family, but then in the end after a year, nobody's life would really change. I'm already a ghost. I just have to finish it.
