Please help me.I can't take life anymore. I've been incredibly depressed for seven years, and suicidal for the last year. I've seriously made plans to kill myself a few times over the last couple of months. I want to check myself into a mental hospital now, but I'm making myself wait to be done with this semester. I've worked too damn hard to make it to the end of this degree to throw it away because I couldn't hold on for six more weeks. I know this doesn't make sense, I want to be dead, but I don't want to mess up in school. If I'm dead then it doesn't matter, but as long as I'm not dead then it does. And if I check into a mental hospital then I won't be dead, and I'll feel like an idiot for fucking up school. I think being in the middle of the semester is the only thing keeping me going right now. I just want to finish it.

I'm in so much pain, literally. I have fibromyalgia and whole bunch of other fun diseases to deal with. I can't rationalize staying alive anymore. It's such a waste to suffer through life like this. There's no hope for my condition, it's only getting worse and worse. The worst part is, my doctors have given up on me, and my family is sick of me. I have no real friends. My mom is the biggest bitch in the world, still insisting that I can make myself better through a bunch of fucking hippy bullshit, and yells at me when I wont take homeopathics. She brings so much stress into my life which just causes more physical pain. She is without a doubt emotionally abusive, and has always been this way. I wish I had reported her when I was still a minor. I keep trying to convince my dad to leave her. She's horrible to everyone, including him, but he's too weak. I'm stuck in this situation. I'm barely managing to get through school, and I know I won't be able to work in my condition, so I can't move out.

Fuck I want to be dead.
