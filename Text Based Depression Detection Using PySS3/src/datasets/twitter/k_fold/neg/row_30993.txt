whats the point of living if I desperately wanna go into a profession requiring high iq and memory eventhough I lack bothI have always wanted to be a cardiovascularsurgeon and I am currently in high school preparing for my premed examination... I am from INDIA and 1.8 million people take the examination NEET...I earlier used to score pretty good in my coaching examinations but as the syllabus is increasing I have started forgetting alot and in the test having lot of syllabus my scores are terrible..I already knew that I had a low iq, terrible recalling ability, no talents at all but recently I gave a short term memory test in which i scored 3 median being 6..surgeons require a very good working memory, high iq and excellent recall..if i am finding it tough to remember this little info, whats gonna happen when i enter medical college...I am gonna have such a tough time which I cant even imagine...everyone around me seems to be so so much more intelligent than me and are capable of learning a  particular info at 10 times the speed I can...moreover I am sick of humanity, humans are terrible creatures and, the state it utterly deplorable..I never find peoeple who agree with me on stuff like politics(I am a centrist and india is filled with crazy extremists)..my opinions on religion(since I am an atheist) are pretty different...also the pollution in India is very pathetic and its becoming a gaschamber....climate change is gonna show disastrous repercussions in recent future so theres no use of studying if its gonna go in vain...HUMANITY WAS A MISTAKE and theres no purpose of life..also I AM A NIHILIST
