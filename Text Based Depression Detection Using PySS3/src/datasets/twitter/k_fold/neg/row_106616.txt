The more time passes, the more I feel my suicide is inevitable.How do I say this in a mature way? Iâ€™m starting to develop a temptation to commit suicide the more life passes. 

Iâ€™m not sure anymore man. It all feels like life will never progress with me. Iâ€™m a 21 y/o Junior in University. Iâ€™m diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome, so Iâ€™ve lived my full life with major issues that wonâ€™t go away.

Iâ€™ve been struggling both academically and professionally for months now. I have very few defined â€œfriendsâ€, and the relationships I do have are struggling HARD. 

What hurt me the most was the feeling that I have nothing to bring to the table. Iâ€™ve lived most of my life as a shut-in, so anytime I have a conversation with people, it feels as if I have nothing to say â€” and I donâ€™t. Iâ€™ve gotten so desperate that Iâ€™ve copied other peopleâ€™s interests, so I could better â€œfit inâ€.

At this point, my self-worth has gotten so low that maybe it would be better in the grand scheme if I just ended it off. I honestly, truly believe that nobody (aside from my parents) would care if I left this world. I never left an impression anyways.
