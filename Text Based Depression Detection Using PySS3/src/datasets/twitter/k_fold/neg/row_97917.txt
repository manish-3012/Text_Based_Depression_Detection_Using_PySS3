I m a failure. I fail at everything and anything.Everything I try I fail in. Name it and I have failed so many times at it. Cooking? Shit where do I even start. Yesterday I tried baking a pizza with the cardboard still on.

Driving: oh wait Iâ€™m 20 and I donâ€™t drive. Iâ€™ve gotten my permit twice but I havenâ€™t been able to fix my car because I donâ€™t know how. 

Chess? I canâ€™t even beat the easy computer consistently.

Ordering food? Yup Iâ€™m that idiot friend you have that forgot the pepperonis on the pizza he ordered that one time.

Videogames: all of them. I rarely win at any game. Even in single player games I somehow am able to just fail all the time. I spend so many hours on videogames and I even practice on aim trainer yet, Iâ€™m completely horrible at any multiplayer game.

Cleaning my room: I canâ€™t be consistent.

Sex: oh you bet Iâ€™ve failed at that a lot of times. Shit I canâ€™t even do some positions.

Working out: â€œoh yea Iâ€™ll do it tomorrow.â€

Writing papers for school: takes me about 7 hours to write a 4 page paper. Fuck me.

Reading a book: trust me I guarantee you read faster than me. I timed myself yesterday and it took me an hour to read 15 pages. Shows you how truly fast I am.

Controlling my anger: I punched my wall the other day because of some dude calling me a bitch on Battlefield 4. Ironically, he was right.

Writing this post: I canâ€™t even remember what the point of this post was.



Look, Iâ€™m just depressed as hell. I donâ€™t want to kill myself. But sometimes my mind brings me to a dark place. Whenever I fail at one thing, I do try to shrug it off and let it go. But I fail consistently across many things that are so small in my life that it makes me feel stupid. My friends always call me stupid and they know Iâ€™m not smart. I donâ€™t even like myself at all. 

How can someone have hope in their life, when they donâ€™t believe in themselves?
