Life is meaningless and no matter what I end up suicidal. All I'm doing is prolonging the inevitableThere is no real happiness. It took me way too long to realise, I feel. I've been severely depressed since I was 11. I've been refused meds tons and told I'll receive therapy many times despite my never hearing anything else of it. I have more mental issues than I have friends and the effort it takes to simply live no longer feels worth it.

Happiness is fleeting. Whether there's a guy/girl I'm talking to, it always goes to shit quickly. They never care. Why would they? I can't even love mysekf. I'm somewhat attractive, I'm pretty good at coding, I love gaming and my taste in music/books/movies is rather varied. Nerdy guys seem to like that especially (yeah I'm another nerdy girl haha aren't I so different and not like literally every other girl out there but uglier!). I still can't find anyone who actually gives a shit about me. Probably because of my mental issues. I'm autistic and have anxiety which sometimes gives me panic attacks and makes me overwhelmed. I've gotten better with social interaction but it still takes me a bit. And this depression, it plagues me. It brings me down and I'm sure it brings others down too. Doesn't matter if I'm somewhat interesting or my face is occasionally nice to look at, people don't stay. I only have a couple of friends who only ever seem to talk about themselves. Anything I say about myself they manage to turn about them. It always seems like I'm the only one putting in effort but obviously I'm not great or people would actually like me. There's only so much I can enjoy my own company before I start feeling lonely.

There is no happiness. I keep saying it. No matter what I do I always end up here, wanting to die. I'm going to kill myself one day. We all have to die, and I want it to be on my terms. Besides, how long can one put up with feeling so inexplicably empty and numb before they realise life just isn't worth it? We are all born to die. Some are fortunate to enjoy their limited time here, but we're all gonna end up in the same place. When the earth is swallowed by the sun none of this is ever going to matter. We're all going to die so why not let it be tonight? Or tomorrow night? I'm useless and unwanted and sick of myself. Constantly living in my head is the worst. Intrusive thoughts, insecuriries, anxieties, intermittent dissociation/depersonalisation, what is the fucking point of it all

I don't know what the point of this is. To have an outlet I guess? There was a usenet group called ash a while ago (93-02 I think) which was pro choice, and I think their general rule was to at least try make it to 23. I keep telling myself that I will do so. Five years to go. I don't know if I'll make it that far. To be honest, I no longer care if I do. I'm tired. I'm done.
