Finally managed to talk to my Mom about how I feelAfter a lot of thinking (mostly negative) I've finally managed to tell my Mom how I feel. I told her about my worries and about how I feel suicidal and have thought about doing it a few weeks ago. I told her to tell my bro and Dad when she can. I think I've made a good first step to get help.

(I have another post explaining in detail as to why I have depression)
