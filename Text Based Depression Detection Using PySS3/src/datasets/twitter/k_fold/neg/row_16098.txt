Give it a month or sonot much else to it, I'm home over the easter holidays, may or so i'll go back to uni where i've got 3 boxes of paracetamol (24g) waiting for me, I just can't. I, I just can't anymore, sick of putting a fake mask on and pretending everything is fine, i just want nothing. Not I don't want anything, I want nothing, to close my eyes and never to reopen then. Just nothingness.
