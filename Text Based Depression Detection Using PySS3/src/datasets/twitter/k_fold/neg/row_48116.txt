I'm just not happyHi there!

Lemme start by saying there's no risk to my life tonight, just tonight. But overall, I don't have a reason to live. I'm an intelligent man who's always been told he's smart and sensitive. But you know what? I just don't see the value of going on. I fear the pain of death, but I don't want to see the next morning. I'm just... Done. I'm out of reasons to live on. What's going to happen? I'll make more money? I'll make more debt? Then I'll die. Why not just die before that? I feel so empty. My friends... My wife who loves to tell me how imperfect I am... This is the best it's going to get. Why wait till I wither and die? Maybe tonight's sunset should be my last memory. Maybe this world isn't for everyone. What's a good way to sleep and never wake up? Help a coward out? Please?
