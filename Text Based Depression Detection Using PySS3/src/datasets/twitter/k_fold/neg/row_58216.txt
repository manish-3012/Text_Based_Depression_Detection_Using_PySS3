I fucking hate my life.Just spent hours crying (still doing it). I know the least painful way to go but I donâ€™t have the resources I need, so Iâ€™m being forced to do it the hard way. It fucking sucks. This is always going to be my life. I am never going to be freed from this shit, medications, therapy, nothing will ever fucking work. Iâ€™ve been thinking to suffer for 3 minutes just so that I never have to think of anything again. Iâ€™m sure wherever I end up in the fucking afterlife, I will be annoyed with myself for not doing it sooner.
