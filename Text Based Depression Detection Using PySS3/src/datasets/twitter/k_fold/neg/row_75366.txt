I have decided to do it.The hardest and slowest part is to write a suicide note. I have been writing it for the past 3 hours and i have not yet finished it yet. I want to say so much but yet cannot bring to put into words. It is so frustrating. I am only doing this because my family would want a couple of answers as to why i did it and irresponsibly left all responsibilities to them. I believe not leaving behind such a document would be the worst thing to do.



The harder part is deciding who gets to read it. I am addressing it to my immediate family. I DO NOT want anyone else to even touch it. But i guess it is out of my control.



I hate myself.
