I think its finally timeToday after work i will finally be going to by the shotgun that will be placed in my mouth. My depressuon and complete negstive attitude towards lufe hss pushed away every single person that i have ever cared about. I have absolutely no life goals or ambitions at 39 years old. I have been doing nothing but biding my time and i just cant anymore. My world is gone and its never coming back. This is the first time ive been excited for something in so long
