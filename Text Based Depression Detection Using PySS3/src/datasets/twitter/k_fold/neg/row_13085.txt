Everyone unloads their problems onto meAnd expects me to keep quiet about mine.

I'm just gonna get this off my chest;

I got abused by the foster care system, I have PTSD and anxiety issues, I go mute a lot and can't hold a conversation, I don't have real friends, I'm a college drop out, I'm a loser, never had a boyfriend, can't drive, working really hard to pay rent and bills in a HCOL area, shut in unless at work, orphan with no family, I cry every single day and night, stressed out, therapy doesn't work, declining health at 21, everyone I meet is nice to my face but badmouths me behind my back.

I know this isn't how a person is supposed to live... I miss my real mom and dad. They tried to encourage my weird self to be friendly with the world, but ever since they died, I died too. No one wants to deal with me anymore, I should've been an adult by now- but no one in the foster care system taught me anything! They just collected checks while I rotted away.

I'm fucking miserable, I'm so tired and done trying. I want to end it all, but then people are gonna be talking about me like they actually gave a fuck.
