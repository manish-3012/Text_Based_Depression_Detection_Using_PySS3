Why is the world so cruel?I just don't understand why I was born in this shit hole life in this shit hole world. I wish it was just all over..... I never have anyone to talk to and help me cope with all of my issues. You would not believe what my father did to my shampoo bottle... Now it's all over my hair and I can't get it out. I want my suffering to end.
