Contemplating suicide because of my severe anxiety/hypochondriaI'm an idiot. I've been off my meds, and it has fucked me over in the worst way ever.

Let me list off a list of the things I was convinced I was dying of over the past month:

Rabies

Worried about going to sleep thinking I would go into a diabetic coma (I don't have diabetes, but I'm badly overweight)

Appendicitis

and now that I'm having nipple pain (I have gynecomastia), I'm convinced I have male breast cancer

I'm crying my eyes out right now because I've essentially spent this entire month thinking I'm going to die. I'm afraid to sleep, afraid to eat, I just want to feel better. I've dealt with bad anxiety for almost a decade now and I've had enough.

I turn 20 in less than a month, and I'm transferring to a new college next month, but in afraid I'm not going to see any of that because I can't keep living like this.

I'm afraid to die, yet I want to die. I'm having a war within myself and I just feel scared. I want to be better.
