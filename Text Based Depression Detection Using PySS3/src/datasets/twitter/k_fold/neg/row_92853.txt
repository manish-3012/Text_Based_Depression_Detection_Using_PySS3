In two weeks, it all depends.Obviously a throwaway. In approx. 2 weeks, I'm scheduled to appear in court to see whether a judge will revoke my license for a month. Too many tickets. If I lose my license, I lose my job. Public transportation isn't an option, I work in the middle of nowhere and east a bit. My parents have decided to split up out of the blue, and its created a rift between my whole family. My grandmother is bipolar/manic depressive and I grew up my whole life not knowing this until a non-smoking aid completely fucked up her meds to control it. Last year I lost my best friend and have been severely depressed. Most recent of my problems, I was in a car accident and can't afford to deal with it because I'm in debt and I don't have full insurance on my vehicle. 

Thoughts? Questions? Am I justified or am I being a pussy? 

P.s. I've decided my weapon of choice to be self immolation. For the unfamiliar, its when you light yourself on fire and burn to death. Notice the username. 

Thanks for reading.
