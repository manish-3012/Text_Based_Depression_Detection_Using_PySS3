I just cut myself for the first time in over a year. I want to keep going, but I feel disgusted.This just happened. Iâ€™m panicking, and donâ€™t quite know who to go to or what to do rn, I wanna keep cutting but I know I shouldnâ€™t so I guess Iâ€™m writing this instead. I am in therapy and I have a good S/O thatâ€™s very loving and supportive but I donâ€™t wanna tell them. He would be so disappointed in me, but I donâ€™t know how to hide it from him or if I should (I cut on my thighs). I feel so disgusting and ashamed, but I want to keep doing it. I forgot how much of a relief I got from hurting myself, itâ€™s honestly comforting but that makes me feel so messed up. Why do I find comfort in threatening my life? I donâ€™t even wanna die but I do wanna kill myself. But fuck, that doesnâ€™t even make sense. I wanna be alive and see where my future will head but I have the most overwhelming feeling to end my life. Iâ€™ve been doing really well the past year without any kind of self harm, and Iâ€™m so mad at myself for breaking that promise I made to myself and my boyfriend. I just feel like Iâ€™m spiraling and I donâ€™t know what to do, I donâ€™t want to tell my S/O I harmed myself and I donâ€™t wanna tell my therapist either (Iâ€™m afraid to be admitted). I just donâ€™t know
