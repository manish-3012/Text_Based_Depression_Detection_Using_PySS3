This abusive relationship is killing meHoly fuck this is so long. I'm sorry. 
I need to get these feelings out and tell somebody how I feel. 

I've been trapped in this abusive relationship for so long now. You torture me for the mistakes I've made in the past. I've blamed myself and allowed you to blame me for our fights. You justify the mean things you say and do to me by saying "it's your fault because you did X Y or Z". I'm done. You lied to me tonight. You were supposed to come over. I canceled my plans for you to help you with your homework and watch that stupid fucking movie for your class. You were supposed to be here at nine and you didn't return my texts or call for hours. By the time I got in touch with you, you were fucked up and it was almost 11. You apologized and said you're getting one more drink and then coming. FUCK YOU. You  are a mean fucking person. You put me down so low. We are supposed to go to Austin but I'm so scared to go with you because last time we went, you escalated a fight to a point of no return and kicked me out of your sister's apartment and when things cooled down the next day (I had no where to fucking go when I left) you told me to go home and find a way back to dallas. Fuck you. Fuck your sister. Fuck your friends. I hope you relapse you selfish cunt. I hope your employers find out about your controlled substance charges and you never get the job you're going to school for. I hope you don't finish school. I hope you never move out of your dads house. I hope you make more mistakes and get in trouble again and the people you babysit for find out you've been to jail multiple times. I hope you go back to your meth selling ex and get stuck in that trap. 

You bring so much pain in my life. So much darkness. You have pushed me to the point of having manic attacks like when I was a child. You've brought out dark characteristics that I haven't seen in so long.  You've fucked up my lip permanently by hitting me in the mouth. You've cracked my teeth. You've broken my window on my car. You've hurt my feelings. Live never thought I would say I'm in a relationship like this or that I'm abused or I get hit but fuck, you've made me not feel like a man. You've made me feel so small and embarrassed to be who I am. I hate myself. I want to end my life. I've said it so many times to myself after we fight, "just fucking do it". I've been too scared. I'm not going to do it now but I swear to god that when I find the opportunity I'm doing it. I'm driving my car off a bridge or shooting myself if I find a gun at work or hanging myself or overdosing when my grandma gets more meds. I don't care about the pain, I just want it to end and at this point it needs to happen.
