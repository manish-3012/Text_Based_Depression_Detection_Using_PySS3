Attached to my WantsI am not a drone, I am a human being. I want a life too. I want a living wage, I want a house, I want a girlfriend. Seriously we're slaves. Promised if we work wage slave jobs for about 5 - 10 years we get a slightly better job with a slightly better wage so we can live a life somewhat. A lot of people push through and make it, some do not. The people that do make it to live a life are miserable anyways, just slightly less.
