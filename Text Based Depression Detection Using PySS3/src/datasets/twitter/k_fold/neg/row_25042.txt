I need someone. Forgive my post history.I recently received a DUI, which I am certainly guilty of. I have caused my family enough pain. I've been considering suicide for awhile now, but always thought better. This time I'm truly considering it as an option. I'm hoping it will relieve my parents of financial responsibility, since I can't find a job. Trying to leave tonight.
