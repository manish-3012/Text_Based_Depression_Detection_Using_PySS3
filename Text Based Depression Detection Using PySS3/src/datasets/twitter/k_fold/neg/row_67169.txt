Someone please talk to me before I die.Please someone keep me company for a little bit, I can't hold on anymore. I feel left behind and betrayed by everyone I've ever known and I feel all alone. I'm going to start drinking all the whiskey and smoke all the weed I got while listening to music and just look back at my whole life one last time. I don't want to be talked out of it, I just want some company for once before I leave quietly tonight.
