I'm losing it againI'm using a throwaway because I don't feel comfortable enough to use my main account. Sorry if this is hard to read, I just have a hard time putting things together and have a hard time articulating things.
I'm suicidal. I'm planning on killing myself before the next school year starts, but after my birthday [In April]. I think I can feel another psychotic break coming on, but I'd rather die than go back to a mental hospital for the third time. And, honestly, I don't think I can bounce back from my first time in one. I've had to drop a class and I might have to drop another just so I don't end up in summer school. I used to be good in school, you know? An AP class, mostly honors. I used to be good.
I don't have a future. My mental illness makes it hard for me to care for myself, let alone do anything work-related. I've never had a job before, and I have no idea how I'm going to be able to hold one down. My psychosis makes me want to do really bad things, and I'm scared I'm going to Tommy DeVito someone if I don't kill myself. Everyone at school always has some negative shit to say to or about me. I'm so tired of it. I'm so tired of living. I really hope my next life will be better than this one.
