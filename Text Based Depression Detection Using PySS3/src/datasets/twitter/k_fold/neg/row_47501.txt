Well I chickened our yesterdayGun loaded and Iâ€™m talking hand cannon even if I had a foul shot I would have turned my head into a canoe but I texted some friends I had made at a music festival this summer I didnâ€™t have anyone else I could turn to. I get so close every time so close to ending the pain and itâ€™s like that last little grain of fight in the back of my head stops me, itâ€™s exhausting now my nerves are shot anxious how do I hold down a job and pay the mortgage, pay off my debts find another SO Iâ€™m just so tired of having to deal with people. I wish I could just have a job where I donâ€™t have to interact with people and boss who is not trying to drive me into an early grave, living with chronic pain is hell on earth a lake of fire sounds like a day at the beach, pass me the sunscreen please.
