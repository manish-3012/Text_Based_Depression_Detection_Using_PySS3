I tried stopping a stranger from suicide.Obligatory this happened about a month ago and sorry for formatting but I'm on mobile.

I'm on a support group app called Wisdo and one of the groups I'm in is about trying to cope with depression, 

Well one day there was a guy, let's call him Steve. Steve just posted one word in the thread, "Goodbye" and I was super scared and worried so I sent him a bunch of messages trying to see what was wrong, 

I tried passing it off as a playful joke to get him to open up but i got increasingly worried as he wasent responding so I sent a bunch of more serious messages trying to tell him that this isnt the solution.

He finally responded but he was so fatalist that I was worried and must have sent him over a dozen messages telling him that people loved him and he would find others to love and that it was too permanent a solution.

He told me he doesn't see a way out and he deleted his account. I was maybe one of a dozen people who messaged him but my question is, 

did I do enough? I feel like I could have done more and I feel like I failed Steve in a time he needed people most. Could I have done more? And if so what? I don't want the next person I come across to go down this path.

Not sure if this is the right subreddit, if not just tell me.
