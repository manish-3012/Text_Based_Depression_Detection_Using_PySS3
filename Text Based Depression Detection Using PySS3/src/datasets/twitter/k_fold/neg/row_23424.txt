I donâ€™t really want to die but I donâ€™t want to live eitherIâ€™m a 17 year old girl, and Iâ€™ve been through enough for one lifetime. I have no desire to go through more. As the patterns in my life have shown, it will only get worse for me as it has steadily for the last 6 years. I would tell you everything Iâ€™ve been through, but itâ€™s just too much. To get the gist: dad was alcoholic/drug addict, killed himself when I was 14, mom married step-dad who sexually abused me and physically abused my mom. Thatâ€™s the just main shit.

Iâ€™m done. I see no reason why I should keep going. I never got to be a teen because of this. Never got to go out with my friends, never got to go on dates with boys, never got to enjoy life. Iâ€™ll never enjoy life. Iâ€™m done.

Goodbye, thanks for reading.
