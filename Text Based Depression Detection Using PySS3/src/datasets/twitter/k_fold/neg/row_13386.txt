Tomorrow I clean my officeThey know. I'm an awful employee. My laziness and dishelved hair is a recurrent theme. Five years of being a black hole is long enough. Ive been nothing but sick, apathetic and non-human. I've robbed them all for long enough. My hours of sloppy work days will be over soon. 


Tomorrow I will clean up my office. I'll recycle some dozen diet soda bottles from the desk drawers. I'll tuck away the paperwork that was never filed. I'll dust the bookshelves and organize books that were never touched. 


One step closer. I know this needs to be done.
