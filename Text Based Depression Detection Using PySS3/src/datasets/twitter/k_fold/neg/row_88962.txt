Bullshit PostMy life is the "Dream Life" and I like to complain about it. Now forget that.

If you could have drawn a roadmap of how every single thing that could make my life livible would fail or be taken away besides my living situation, the misery of what my life is is difficult (How the fuck?). I am also the proud recipient of the "misunderstood" award. Every single positive instinct of my own has either been repressed, dismantled, or strung out against me for pilliaging.

Yes it is physical. Yes it is psychological. I would have rather been dead many years ago than to be propped up by the rancid chopsticks of Mom and Dad. I would very much like it that anyone else had this life and opportunity. Better for you to hack it on our own. For me it's fucked. Not for you.



I want death. You will only piss me off.
