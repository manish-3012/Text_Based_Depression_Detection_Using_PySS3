I've tried to kill myself 3 times.This last time I tried to kill myself was seriously almost laughable. I had two hundred dollars to my name at the time so I got myself a "last supper." Bought some weed from my best friend, hit up everyone who mattered to say "bye" or whatever. I then bought a pack of razors, a box of wine, some rope, and a couple boxes of benydril for good measure as I didnt have any access to anything stronger and rented a room by the water.

I got wine drunk thinking that would make it easier to slice my wrists open. Turns out that shit is a lot harder than it looks on TV so that was a bust but I was bleeding very slowly. I got impatient so I figured what the hell, looked up how to tie the rope into a noose and tried to hang myself from the damn ceiling fan. Turns out it couldnt hold my fat ass up so I ended up falling to the bed with the whole ass fan on top of me. 

Defeated, I choked down the benydril and went o sleep. Its about 5 am at this point and I fall asleep and wake up in a hospital bed with my mother screaming bloody murder in my face. 

Turns out I had forgotten to tell the hotel I didn't want maitence from the maids or whatver and some poor maid walked into me naked and drunk on the bed next to a rope, a broken fan, empty boxes of razors and pills and an empty box of wine and called the cops. 

Yeet.

Anyways this was over a year ago and I had to make up some story to all my friends as I was institutionalized for a couple weeks after my latest incident (this wasnt the first) 

Never told anyone the truth except my best friend while he was so drunk that I'm sure he doesn't remember anything I said.
