I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want to go back to the psych wardI was recently admitted to a psych ward for a suicide attempt. The first night sucked. I didn't get any sleep in the ICU, and the people around me scared me. But after a night's sleep, I sort of started to like it. I felt like a child again. My love of reading returned for a very short time. When I was there, I got through a book in two days, just like I used to when I was a kid. We had an art class, and I was drawing and coloring in a colorful room. I felt so happy and childlike. I haven't felt that for a long time. At first, I fought so hard to get out because I was so very scared, but God I want that feeling of a child back so much. I had to get out fast because I knew every night I spent there put my family out $1000 of dollars. (US healthcare system) I'm doing worse now. I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I told my family I'm trying to get back in college, even though I've been ignoring all the college emails. My meds aren't working, and my psychiatrist is all booked. My therapist is making me feel like absolute shit. I don't even have a job. All I do is lay in bed on my phone wishing I was dead. My only two friends are burnt out by me because I constantly go to them with my problems. I'm writing a bunch of suicide notes now. Don't have an exact plan, but I don't feel like I'm gonna be around for much longer given the current state of everything. Life sucks, and I want to go back to being a carefree child, and the psych ward was the closest thing I got to that. But I can't afford it, and this shitty healthcare system is gonna put me and my family I'm debt if I go back. I'm at a loss and just want to end it.
