Caught between running away and ending it.Once upon a time i had it all going for me. Loving parents, a good job, a full ride to college, a wonderful girlfriend. 

Now Ive lost it all. I have 800 dollars to my name and im caught between buying a pistol and trying to go somewhere new. Where i dont know anyone. My heart wants Vegas. At least there i wont be such an outcast. At least there misery will be all around me as well. But i have no idea what i would do. I imagine i would start homeless, pray i get a job and can find somewhere to live. Maybe i can find peace. It sounds so stressful. The easy way out doesnt. I dont know if i can make it until Monday.
