I was banned from r/depression for trying to help people that were hurtingMy hearts broken man. I was helping people. They were listening. I was doing good work, and they deleted it because they said that I was using "religious proselytization" or whatever, which simply isn't the case. I'm a spiritual individual, I believe what I believe, and what works for me can work for someone else. But now I'm kind of lost. I don't know where else to turn. All I wanted to do was help people that are struggling with depression and now it's like, nobody wants me. Nobody can be helped in the depression subreddit because of one mods whim. And now, it's like, I don't know who I can help. Can I help you guys? Are the mods here going to delete my post because I share a different point of view? Can I please help you? All I want is to know how you're doing. I just want to help you guys, seriously. I love you all so much. It's hard for me being cast out like that without a second glance. Let me help you. You all need it the most. My account is too young for me to make my own subreddit, but I need a place to help. I'm not useful if I'm not helping as much as I can. I believe in you guys. Please, believe in my ability to help you. That's all I'm trying to do. Just tell me what's wrong, I'm not going anywhere.
