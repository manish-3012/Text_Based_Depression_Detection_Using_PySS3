I See no reason in lifeHello Reddit,
I am a 16 year old boy, and I dont see any point in life. Its not that I hate my family, or that I am getting mobbed, its just that I dont see any point in life. I have already had suicidal thoughts about half a year ago, but I spoke to a classmate and managed to surpress these thoughts for quite a while, but they are back now and I dont know what to do. Any advice?
Greetings
