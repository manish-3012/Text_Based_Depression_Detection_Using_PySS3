I hate the decisions I've made in life.My college education was several levels of complicated. If you are curious, you can send me a message and I'll tell you, but I won't be broadcasting it here because it's very identifying. 

I am in law school right now. I hate it. I hate everything about it.

I wanted to be a doctor. Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be a doctor. But I let my parents make all of the decisions. They raised me completely vegan, told me I didn't want to do dissections, and took me out of biology classes. They told me that I would suck at chemistry so I never took it, never tried. They hate doctors and discouraged me every step of the way.

I feel like now it's too late. I'd have to go back to school for at least 2 years to get all of my practical stuff done to even get into medical school. Let's not talk about how uncertain and spacey I seemed. Not even talking about how shitty I'd probably do on the MCAT.

I look at doctors on TV and in real life and I envy them. I want to be them. I know it's not as glamorous as it seems, but when I think about doing law the rest of my life, I want to cry. It's just awful. The job market for lawyers is awful as well.

The job market is so bad. I suck at law school. I suck at everything and I feel like this is my worst, most awful regret. I took the path of least resistance with my parents and now I am doing something I hate and I will never be able to do what it is I want to do. I also have major depression that I have been ingrained to never seek treatment for (my parents) and I cannot bring myself to seek treatment. I think of suicide every day. 

If you want to hear more information, like I said, send me a message. I really need to talk.
