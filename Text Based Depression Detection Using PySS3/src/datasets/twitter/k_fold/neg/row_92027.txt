Running away as an alternative to suicide.Iâ€™ve decided that instead of killing myself im going to wait till I graduate and run away. Iâ€™m going to pack everything thing I need in a bag, take my car, and head out west. Iâ€™ll just go wherever the wind takes me. Iâ€™ll just go until I canâ€™t go anymore. I figure this will hurt my family less than suicide. And if it doesnâ€™t work out Iâ€™ll just kill myself. Itâ€™s not like I hate my family or anything I just figure Iâ€™ll go out with a bang. One last adventure.
