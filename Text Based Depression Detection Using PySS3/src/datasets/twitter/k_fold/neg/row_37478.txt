My (15M) sister (17) just told me to kill myself and she just helped comfirm it for me.The past 2 weeks since i was told we are moving out of my childhood home and moving 3 hours away from my friends and family. I have been really depressed that i Basicly have to start my life over and I just doesn't seem worth taking 15 years of friends away from me.


Me and my sister has always butted heads and never were the closest to each other as we were with our other siblings we got into a huge fight that ended with her telling me that I should just kill myself cuase it would do her a favor. I didn't cry I just walked away and now I'm here just thinking maybe i should.
