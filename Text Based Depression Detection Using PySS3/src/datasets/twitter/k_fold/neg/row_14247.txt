Why do I have to keep trying?I am a victim of incest, family violence, mental illness, and sexual assault. 

I have fibromyalgia. 
I have ADHD and BPD. 
I am so tired. 

I am a sex worker. I have been in the industry since I was 15. I love it, but I planned on moving out of â€œserviceâ€ and into social work/support specifically for sex workers. But I have been rejected by all the organizations in my city. 

I am currently recovering from malnutrition and being tested to find out why I keep fainting or sometimes going blind when I stand up. They suspect cardiomyopathy. Iâ€™m 23. 

Every part of my body hurts at all times. And painkillers are becoming harder and harder to get, and more expensive. 

Iâ€™m in therapy. Itâ€™s going well. Iâ€™ve been going for 3 years. But Iâ€™ve plateaued because my therapist doesnâ€™t seem to understand that the sheer amount of bullshit in my life is crushing all my aspirations and motivation to keep going. 

I donâ€™t have any contact with my family, which has actually helped me. But I feel lonely and unsupported. I feel forgotten and abandoned. 

I have moments of clarity and resentment where I wish I could go back in time and save my young self. Maybe find her some nice parents, ones that actually *wanted* to be parents. 

I feel like my lifeâ€™s work will be just getting through all the bs and just â€œfunctioningâ€. 

Like, Iâ€™m not even meant to bother having big dreams because simply functioning day to day at a normal level takes 100% of my energy and concentration. 

Iâ€™m a creative person, but that creative energy never gets to come out or manifest into anything because of my ADHD. 

I know we all have it hard. And itâ€™s also a really grim time in history for young people. 

But why should one person have to endure all of this? Why is my one remarkable quality that I can tolerate hell? 

It isnâ€™t fair. I donâ€™t want to keep trying anymore. I shouldnâ€™t have to.
