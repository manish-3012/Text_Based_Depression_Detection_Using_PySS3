I've had itI can't take this anymore.  I'm a complete loser, too socially awkward for life but not interesting or whathaveyou enough to be at place on the Internet.  I hate everything about my life.  Being happy is like a tiny dessert when the main course is always just shit.

It's not worth it anymore.  I'm 17, I've got my whole life ahead of me, and that's what sucks.  I fucked up high school and it's too late to fix anything now.  I fucked up my social life and I tried and tried but failed miserably to start again.  I'm stuck going to college across the country, and I know that's gonna be shit too.  It won't be better.  I probably won't do well there either.  There's just no point anymore.

I'm giving it two weeks.  I've given it long enough.  If I can't find a reason to live, then I'm done.
