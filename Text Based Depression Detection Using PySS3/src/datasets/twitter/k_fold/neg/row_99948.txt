After the years and tears, I'm ready to go off into the good nightAfter years of desperate soul searching, false awakenings, mumbo jumbo satori enlightenment, and so many attempts to medicate, mediate, and all the magic needed to finally become disillusioned. I have accepted that there is no such thing as more, there is no such thing as anything meaningful hidden or obscured by the light of consciousness. 

The road to self discovery is littered with sentimentality, false desires, and empty promises. The end and the beginning of this road loop right back to one another, its the hero's journey back to the mundane. What's the point of these stories we tell ourselves, when we wake next we're inheriting the mantle of a person who died in a dream state. 

What's the point of living the life of a ghost. The society we live in, the things we seek, the myths we tell, the gods we believe in, the mantle of humanity is an edifice to an endeavor of perception. We live to create an image of the world that is swallowed up into the machine of man. The moon I see today is an illusion that is cast by the lens of the billions that came before me, the poetry, the art, the mystery of the world lies entirely on me and my predecessors professing our love of living. 

This monomyth is the most depressing thing I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing, I hate the feeling of being an I being a thing and being an ego. I hate that I am contained to this meatbag and this mind, I hate living, I despise everything about existing as this thing. This thing that I am should no longer be because I do not wish to inherit this illusion any longer.
