I saw a Psychologist for the first time and I'm feeling really bad right now.2 days ago I had a mental breakdown and told my mom that I tried to commit suicide, I had never done it before, she yelled at me like crazy. She told my father that tried to have conversation and meant nothing to me. Yesterday I went to clean my bathroom, she started to yell at me, I locked the door, put my headphone and then she said "I'm going to beat you with a broom when you get out", I started to feel really bad, I had an anxiety attack, so I waited for her to calm down and I went to my bedroom.

Today I woke up 09:20am, I have trouble to sleep, I woke up with my mom yelling, saying that I'm useless, that I'm good for nothing, that I'm like that because I want, then I went to the bathroom (It's where I feel safe), and she kept yelling at me. At 11:00am I went to see the psychologist, she seems nice, I explained to her some things, she told me that I need to see a psychiatrist.

I went back home at 12:00Am, then my mom said "Let's talk", I didn't felt comfortable, I went to the bathroom, while she yelled, i got out and went to my bedroom, now she told me that it's all my fault, that I'm lazy...i tried to explain the symptoms of depression, in which she didn't  cared. She said that my cousins are better than me. 


Right now I'm feeling so bad, I'm scared and I don't know what to do because I can't have my parents support, that's why I never told them for years and I don't think I should have done this.
