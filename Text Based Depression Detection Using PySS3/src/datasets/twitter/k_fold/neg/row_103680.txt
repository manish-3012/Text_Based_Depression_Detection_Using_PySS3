what do i even wantim really tired. I'm gonna go tonight, hopefully an overdose of trileptal kills me. unfortunately I don't have any paracetamol.. hopefully this works

I'm 17, i have a really toxic friend, that i feel very small whenever im around her, I can't stand the way she jokes about my insecurities, the way she laugh whenever I stutter, how she makes fun of mu hobbies and dreams, I tried to tell her that many times, i cant cut her off because I wouldn't have any friends after, she is the kind of "leader" to out friend group so i know my life would be hell when i cut her off, even in university. I have this girl that i love, but i know things would be difficult for us because of this toxic friend so i can't make a move.

I'm also very tired of carving attention from my friends it just... i hate how i cling to the crumbs of attention i get from them.

I really want people to know that im gone i just really want them to suffer, i want my friends to cry endlessly when they hear the news i just really want everyone to be suffering as much as i am 

but then again it's not about the toxic friend nor about wanting attention or wanting ppl to suffer im just lining up some reasons for me to kms,

I just simply want to stop existing, i want to stop thinking, stop remembering, stop reading, stop feeling, i just wanna be a wall lol fr

it sad that I couldn't get out of my house and experienc a few stuff but it is what it is

if u r reading this just do it.
