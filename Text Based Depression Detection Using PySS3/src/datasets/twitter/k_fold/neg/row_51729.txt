everything feels like its crumbling around me.I dont know what to say to do anymore. I spend most off my time just staring at a wall thinking of all the things I have failed at, and it keeps me up at night. I feel like I have become a total failure from how I was raised. I was supposed to start collage last week but of course I failed at even to enroll, when I had months. I have not job skills at all and I can barely even lift myself out of bed before I could even lift a hammer to do any real work. I know that I will just end up being fired because I am so lazy and have no drive to do anything with my life. My girlfriend left me because I become to clingy and I kept bothering her and getting mad at her for not wanting to spend time with me. I have become an asshole and a loser. I am doing and going no where in my life anymore. I am just nothing, but all I do it sit in my own dispair and I get angry at myself because I now give my self pitty. I am causing everything to crumble around me and I am too afraid to ask for help since I have already disappointed everyone in my life and family. I just... I just dont know what to do, it feels like it would be the way out, to stop disappointing myself and others. I dont know anymore, I dont know.
