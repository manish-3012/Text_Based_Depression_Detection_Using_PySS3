My 12-year old daughter's friend (14m) has said that he's suicidal. He refuses to call the Suicide Hotline, any other kind of professional help, or tell his parents.Hi there. I'll make a quick list rather than wall of text.

1) The kid apparently doesn't have a good home life, or a good relationship with his parents. 

2) This is obviously hurting my daughter, and she is far and away my primary concern.

3) I encouraged her to call the Suicide Hotline on his behalf. They tasked her with asking details of his plan. imo, this should *not* be something that an expert tasks a personally-involved 12 year old to do. Getting non-counsellors to act like counsellors can do more harm than good...

4) My way of talking about things involves objective reality, perhaps tough love, "this is the most selfish thing you can do", etc. According to the info from the sidebar, this is the exact opposite of optimal. I can accept that as I'm not a trained counsellor and don't know what I'm doing here. That said, neither is or does my 12 year old daughter who's empathetic and caring. But the advice I've given her sounds a lot more like tough love than the advice given in the sidebar.

What I want to do is track down the kid's parents and tell them. Force the issue. Perhaps call 911 for a health check if nothing is done. My daughter, bless her heart, is 12 and has always hated the idea of going to parents, teachers, etc with problems. I explained that being a friend isn't always making your friends feel better, it's actually helping them. Don't make a person feel better while drowning, call the lifeguard whether or not they want to be embarrassed.

Anyway, please help. I'm mentally tough and deal well with cold, hard information. Please do not give me lesser advice to spare my feelings. I'm interested in solving the issue if at all possible. To me that means: if you can't get the kid to call for help, you call it for them.

Thanks.
