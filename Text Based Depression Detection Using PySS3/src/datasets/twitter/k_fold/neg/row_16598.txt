i dont know where else to goim going to lose my job. i cant keep a clear head or get out a coherent thought. i dont trust the people around me and im sure everyone is talking about me behind my back. i think my coworkers think im crazy. i can hear them talk about me behind my back. i think my friends hate me and are talking about me too but i cant hear them cause i dont talk to them. i think my mom is passive aggressive and gaslighting us into loving her so she wont be alone with her guilt. i wish i was dead and the worst part is something is killing me and no one will believe me. please help me before i kill myself. i dont want to have to do that but its the only way out i can see. i know im doing everything wrong but i cant seem to get it right no matter what i do. im scared of what im going to become if i continue to go on this way but it feels like im slipping through the cracks and no matter how many doctors i go to i still cant find any answers. im afraid im going insane. im afraid something in my being is broken and all my diagnoses dont help at all. they just give everyone more reason to call me insane.Â
