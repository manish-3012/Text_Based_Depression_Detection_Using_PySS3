There's Hope...I'm not quite sure about how to go about trying to convince you that there's hope, but there is. I know no one is quite as depressed as you are. I know that no one understands exactly how you feel; they don't know just how hard it is to keep going. 

I was there. This probably won't account for much, but I was there. And because I was able to bounce back, I know you will too. See the right people, do the right things, WANT to get better and I know you will. It get's better. Hell I was on the edge of ending it all when I met my girlfriend, at a mental institution no less. Weird things happen. *Good* things happen. They will happen to you if you just give life a chance. Why am I even writing this? Why am I bothering to try to save people I don't even know? I'm doing this because I feel like it is my duty, maybe even my purpose, to help my fellow brothers and sisters who are teetering on the edge. Please PM me if you need to talk. I will respond as soon as I'm able. And if I am unable, please seek out someone else. A friend. A relative. A stranger in a coffee shop or diner. Just someone that will listen. You owe it to the world, but most importantly, you owe it to yourself to get better. If I managed to do it, I know you can too.
