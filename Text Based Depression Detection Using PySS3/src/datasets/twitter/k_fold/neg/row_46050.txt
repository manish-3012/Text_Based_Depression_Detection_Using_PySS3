How do you cope being a dropoutIts been almost 2 years since I dropped out of highschool because of mental health. I can't really reach out to anyone irl because they always dismiss how I feel. I try to distract myself but the suicidal thoughts are always there at the end of the day. Now that I'm nearing 18 next month, everything feels so heavy and hopeless. I feel like I'm burdening everyone just for existing.


I know I'm still young. I wish this pain would stop. I wish I wasn't so alone to carry everything on my own.
