Months of depressionBefore i start i just wanna tell you Iâ€™m 18 and i donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this, actually i do for some kind of attention... sorry for bad grammar to those who read

My life hasnâ€™t had any upsides these past years, i started oversleeping my school and lost any ambitions and motivation in my life while being unable to find them i overslept every single day of school for the last 3 months and before that 6 months last year. Just as i had in all this time i couldnâ€™t motivate myself to get out of bed and woke up crying, i couldnâ€™t even get out of my bed so i stayed the day in, my parents were furious, my dad whoâ€™s lately decided to be late to work to get me to school was already late again and i just picked up the strength to reject him, he got sad and that made my mom cry while they decided itâ€™s time to kick me out of the house once i cross out the door next time and never come back, minutes after my dad leaves i get a call from my grandpa in which he told me to get ready, but i again rejected him, he told me to call him in an hour, which i never did.

Now itâ€™s been 6 hours since that call and he just told me he never anticipated heâ€™d be this disappointed with anyone he hangs up

I instinctively took scissors as i looked them and went to cut my arm veins vertically, after taking a small cut i realize what Iâ€™m doing and i stop wondering if i should continue, but i started crying and stopped, now Iâ€™m writing this for reasons unknown to me
