Considering not doing therapy if I can't be honest with them about suicideI'm having severe difficulty communicating here. I have severe this and that, I've typed and retyped all these paragraphs a thousand times and I give up.

i don't know what the fuck to write... i keep fuck fucking everything up. idk what to write

idk what to do

are therapists/psychiatrists helpful in new york? what are the consequences of being honest with them? I've already got a method, I just lack the courage for now.

hard time writing

me: no loved ones, no friends, no family, too stupid, too weak, coward, etc.

Maybe I'll post in future. in too much mental pain, too much to say. I'm a stupid piece of shit
