I want to kill myself because I canâ€™t function in societySo, this is my third time planning to kill myself within the past few months so I guess Iâ€™m reaching out here to see if thereâ€™s some solution that Iâ€™m missing. Because killing myself seems like the only real solution.  

 &amp;nbsp;

I feel like Iâ€™ve tapped out all my resources and can no longer function the way I used to, which, although was never as highly functioning as someone without mental illness (Iâ€™ve suffered with depression since I was 11 and developed anxiety and insomnia along the way), I still made it by. Iâ€™ve always struggled with work and would go through a lot of jobs till I found something that was right for me, and once I did I worked hard and was a really reliable person. I even was offered a supervisor promotion at my second job but I ended up moving to be with my family. In 2010 my dad died suddenly and it left my family in ruins, I guess you could say. We lost everything and I had to take care of my mom and sister financially... and then I had to remove them from my life because I couldnâ€™t afford to keep taking care of them and they were not working. Eventually I moved in with my best friend and struggled with jobs due to depression and panic attacks but usually could hold one down for 2 months to a year. I pursued things that made me happy when I could (hobbies, friends, dating). After a couple of years I had a really severe panic episode that caused me to lose my job again (Iâ€™d been through maybe 15-20 jobs at that point). Finally I decided to see a psychiatrist. I showed up every week in a zombie-like, barely responsive state. I felt completely traumatized that I could not handle work situations and kept losing jobs due to panic attacks. I couldnâ€™t even go to the store when I needed something due to the anxiety. We did psychotherapy for $250 a week, but as you can imagine, I could not afford that on my minimum wage salary and had to end the psychotherapy sessions but continued seeing him monthly for a couple of years. I tried every medication he gave me, none of which helped, only caused different problems. Finally he said â€œwell thatâ€™s it, thereâ€™s nothing else to tryâ€. So I felt hopeless. The therapy hadnâ€™t helped at all. I chose the medication with the least amount of side effects (Trazadone). I took it for a few years but eventually weened off of it because my psychiatrist retired and the meds werenâ€™t doing anything except causing migraines.  

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to now... Iâ€™m a 30-year-old woman who is stuck? Working minimum wage entry level jobs. Last July I was fired from a job that Iâ€™d been at for 3 years, a record for me, but I had never been promoted during that time despite being a valuable employee (or so I thought). I had some savings so I thought this would be a good time to rediscover my passions in life and I did. I started making videos, doing YouTube, started up plans to make letâ€™s plays and all that because I truly truly enjoyed it and it was fulfilling. I decided thatâ€™s what I want to do even if I have to work a soul-sucking minimum wage job. I will always make time for this new passion in life. I also thought this would be a great time to do school (a coding boot camp actually because I knew I wouldnâ€™t have the time or funds to attend a 2-4 year college)... but when I tried to apply for a school loan, I was rejected because I didnâ€™t have any credit and had no one to co-sign the loan. So, I thought, well maybe laterâ€”for now Iâ€™ll try to build my credit and get another job. Now, after taking about 8 months off to focus on my passions, building credit, and moving to a new city, Iâ€™ve blown through my savings and have been struggling to get or keep a regular job again. It feels really embarrassing applying for jobs that teenagers work at... people question why Iâ€™m trying to work at these types of jobs when Iâ€™m 30. Luckily, I look young but itâ€™s still embarrassing. The truth is Iâ€™m not qualified for anything else and couldnâ€™t get into school. Even if I did, I know I wouldnâ€™t be able to handle school AND work... I canâ€™t even handle work alone. I have panic attacks every couple days. I have severe depression spells that prevent me from moving my life forward or getting out of bed to go to work in the morning. I get paralyzed. Sometimes Iâ€™ll even get ready for work but then Iâ€™ll freeze and wonâ€™t be able to do the final stepâ€”walk out the door and go to work. I just... go back to bed, because I canâ€™t bear the thought of going to these awful places. I hate these jobs so much and want to do something that makes me happy. Like making videos. Editing videos. Making games. Playing games. Being creative. Talking. Anything besides going to be someoneâ€™s fast food servant. The thing is I have no choice. I HAVE to work to survive and pay bills. Maybe I could go to school someday yes, maybe I could make some money from live-streaming games someday yes... but what Iâ€™m worried about is NOW. Right now... I canâ€™t seem to hold a job for more than 1 to 14 days. Iâ€™m broke. Iâ€™ve almost been homeless and evicted so many times these last few months. The only reason I havenâ€™t is because my best friend is picking up all my slackâ€”and I hate that. I donâ€™t want to be a drain and a burden anymore. But I donâ€™t know how to fix this. I will spend days filling out applications, going to interviews, trying so hard to convince people to give me a job. But when I get the job, the depression and anxiety take over. And I get paralyzed and eventually canâ€™t go anymore. Sometimes on the first day. I... I really am going to be homeless. I donâ€™t have any family to stay with. My friend cannot carry me. Iâ€™ve maxed out almost all my credit cards. I donâ€™t qualify for any loans (due to unemployment). I canâ€™t afford another psychiatrist. I take Xanax, but it only helps with the panic episodes, not the crushing depression which also prevents me from going to work. Iâ€™m stuck. Iâ€™ve researched how to be homeless and survive and I canâ€™t do it. I donâ€™t want to live like that. Iâ€™d rather be dead. I really would rather be dead. So here I am, again, trying to decide if I should max out my last credit card on a gun and be done with this cycle of suffering and rapid progression downhill... or should I max out my last credit card so I can buy groceries for another month and just... keep trying. Even though I do keep trying and the result is always the same. I have good days where I feel hopeful and think â€œI can do this, maybeâ€ but something always knocks me back down the next day, or day after that. And Iâ€™m back to square one. Like, for every step forward thereâ€™s 10 steps back.  

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like if getting evicted wasnâ€™t a constant thought on my mind, yes Iâ€™d still be depressed, yes Iâ€™d still think about killing myself sometimes, because I always have. But I donâ€™t think I would be planning to actually DO it... but I think Iâ€™ve finally reached the end and I have no other choice. Is there something Iâ€™m missing? I donâ€™t know what else to do. I canâ€™t deal with being homeless on top of everything. I just canâ€™t.
