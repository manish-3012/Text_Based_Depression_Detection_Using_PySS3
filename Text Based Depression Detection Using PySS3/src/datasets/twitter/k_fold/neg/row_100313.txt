i am literally on the verge of just ending it.my name is heather, 18f. i canâ€™t stand this anymore, my life is pointless and going nowhere, itâ€™s my first week of college and iâ€™m already failing at keeping up with all of my glasswork, i seem to have nobodyâ€™s support and there is just so much of a burden out upon me.

my life is just a lull right now and sometimes i canâ€™t even get out of bed. 

iâ€™m just so stressed and right now i canâ€™t think of any other solution other than hanging myself, help.
