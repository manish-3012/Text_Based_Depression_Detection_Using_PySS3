I feel like Iâ€™ve run out of resources.Counseling isnâ€™t available near as often as I really need it. Iâ€™m taking medication and just switched to a stronger one but so far it isnâ€™t looking good (Iâ€™ve tried quite a few already). I have too much to bring to the couple friends I do have. Does anyone have any suggestions for further resources? I donâ€™t know what to do.
