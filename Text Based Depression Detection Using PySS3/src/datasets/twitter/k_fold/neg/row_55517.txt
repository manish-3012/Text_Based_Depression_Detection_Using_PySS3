hey.haven't posted anything on here 4 a while cause a lot has happened. idk what else 2 say anymore. no matter how many times i vent, no matter how many times i wake up. my life still remains the same. no matter how hard i try i just can't stretch my hand enough 2 touch it n it hurts so much n im so tired of hurting n crying. i wish i could close my eyes n feel safe n happy. i wish i had the conviction 2 kill myself. 
i want 2 love n b loved, touch n b touched. i want 2 live. im in so so so much pain it's undescribable n it's consuming me. the worst part is knowing dat just because i write dis doesn't mean things will change. after posting i'll cry myself 2 sleep n life will carry on. it's so cruel. i hate being alive. i hate being lonely. i hate myself so much. i hate it all.
