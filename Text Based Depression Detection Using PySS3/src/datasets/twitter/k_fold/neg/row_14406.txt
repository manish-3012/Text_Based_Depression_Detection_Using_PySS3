Birthdays are great for self-pityMy birthday is in a month and a half. I expect it to be a lonely one, per usual. It is on a Monday and I will be taking summer classes. I will most likely be in the apartment alone (hopefully), along with most of summer. I am going to phone the police ahead of time; I highly doubt anyone nearby will bother to find me. 

I hope I can last that long. 

Side note: Whoever I personally know that encounters my reddit posts, please don't worry too hard. If I deeply care about you, you know it, even if it may be hard to tell at the moment. To the rest, here is a neat little story you can entertain yourselves over. Although I never truly knew, I deeply appreciate those who genuinely hoped the best for me. To the rest, your welcome.  

Side side note: Thank you reddit, although a good handful of you folks are dangerously ignorant, the rest of you (suicidewatch) are kind souls. 

Carry on and enjoy the rest of your lives.
