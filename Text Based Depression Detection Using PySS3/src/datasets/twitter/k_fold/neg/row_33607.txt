I am strongly considering suicide again, and I need some adviceI'm very afraid of telling my therapist because I most likely will be hospitalized. I've posted here before, and someone always says, "oh just tell your therapist, it's fine," but I don't think they are considering the consequences of that. 

I am a student at a university, and if I put into inpatient, then I would either have to drop my classes or fail, which ended up costing more than 4k this semester. I would have to take a forced leave from my job. I do have insurance, but the cost of going to inpatient would be in the thousands. I just want some advice that will actually consider these things. 

I know that sounds harsh, but I'm scared I'm going to impulsively attempt suicide again.
