I want to dieI just turned 16 years old 2 days ago, and for 3 years now Iâ€™ve had depression. (My parents donâ€™t know). My parents own a restaurant and I was forced to work there since I was 10. Growing up I didnâ€™t have many friends or go out much due to me constantly having to work. I donâ€™t have any good memories with my family. I constantly feel sad, and Iâ€™ve turned to drugs (weed) for relief. Iâ€™ve smoked for 2 years now, and it feels like weed is my â€œreleaseâ€ from my reality. I know drugs is not a good option to turn to and I should face problems head on, but it feels like Iâ€™m unable to. My depression has severely affected how I view things and my daily life. I often feel extremely tired right after waking up, like I donâ€™t want to do anything. This past year Iâ€™ve felt more and more â€œattractedâ€ towards committing suicide. I donâ€™t exactly want my family to suffer. I want to commit suicide very badly, like itâ€™s inevitable and will eventually happen. Iâ€™m mentally torn apart. Best way to die?
