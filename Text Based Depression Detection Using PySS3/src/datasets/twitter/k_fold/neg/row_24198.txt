DeadweightI feel like Iâ€™m just weight to the people in my life. My parents Iâ€™m sure did not expect nor want the kind of offspring that I am. I got kicked out of a great school in middle school which made all of their money spent a waste, as well as make them outcasts to the friend groups they built there. I have cheated on almost every single girlfriend Iâ€™ve had, and am the king of manipulation into them still staying with me while I constantly torment their lives with my stress and anxiety, on top of having made them question everything because of how deep my lies have gone. My only accomplishments are a fat rap sheet with police and holding a retail job at a basic level for 5 years. I feel like I botched this life and I could leave it and start over. Let everyoneâ€™s stress of me in their life subside. Sure theyâ€™ll hurt for a bit but theyâ€™ll be better in the long run.
