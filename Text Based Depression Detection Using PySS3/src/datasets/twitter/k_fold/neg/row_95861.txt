I donâ€™t think I can be savedI think that Iâ€™m long gone. Iâ€™ve seek for help, but itâ€™s been a temporary fix. Counselling. Therapy. Medication. Exercise. Positive thinking. Making things happen. But nothing has gotten me out of this hell.

Throughout my life Iâ€™ve been on the other. People on this outside would think I had a good life. Good family. Good education. Good friends. Good sports player. But inside I was dying. I was in groups, but I wasnâ€™t close with anyone. I couldnâ€™t connect. I felt the warmth, but I was still cold.

My 20â€™s so far has been hell. There have been times where I wanted to kill myself. Knives. Alcohol. Medication... but I held on. I had hope. Hope that my future could be better. I wanted to do something to salvage my life. Each attempt on a brighter life was met with nothingness. Each job attempt was met with rejection. Each friendship and relationship attempt was met with denial. Each sense of hope was met with despair.

Iâ€™m 29. My resume isnâ€™t great. Good education but no experience. No entry level jobs will accept me due to lack of experience in that area. No low end jobs will accept me due to high level of education. No jobs in my field will accept me because I need to do a postgraduate degree to be qualified and registered.

I have a girlfriend... or had depending on the upcoming days. Due to my depressive episode, she has distanced herself and wanted time to think about stuff. She has other stuff going on, but the vibe Iâ€™m getting about her message is itâ€™s about us nothing being in a relationship anymore. I told her what Iâ€™m dealing with and what is happening with me. I did my best to make a better life for myself not just for the sake of her and us, but primarily for myself. But itâ€™s not enough.

Iâ€™ve lost one of the two chains that are keeping me in this world last year. Dad unexpectedly passed away. I had to handle most of the funeral stuff and be mumâ€™s rock, not having the proper time to grieve. I donâ€™t think he other chain is strong enough to keep me alive. She has been amazing but all Iâ€™ve brought is nothing in return. She deserves better than me. She deserves a better son with a better life and she has that with my brother. Already has a family, stable job, great life. Iâ€™m the opposite of all that.

Iâ€™ve already thought out my swan song and how Iâ€™m going out.

Iâ€™ve written out everything that has been plaguing my mind, my life. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything else left to say but...

Goodbye
