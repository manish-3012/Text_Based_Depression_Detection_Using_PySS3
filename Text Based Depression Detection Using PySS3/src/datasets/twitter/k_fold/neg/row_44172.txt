I'm pretty serious about this nowLast year, I wanted to kill myself really badly, but I told myself that I would wait a year. This was on March 24th. It's now been a year and 5 days.

I started taking prozac and seeing a therapist a couple of weeks ago, but now I just can't handle anything. I had a philosophy essay due today worth 20 percent of my grade, and I got the word count way short and now I'm probably going to fail it. I can't bring myself to focus on doing things when I don't even want to be alive.

I don't know what to do. I can't seem to do anything right, I'm miserable literally all the time, and I don't have anything I like doing. I waited the year now. I don't have any reasons to live anymore. I just feel so trapped.
