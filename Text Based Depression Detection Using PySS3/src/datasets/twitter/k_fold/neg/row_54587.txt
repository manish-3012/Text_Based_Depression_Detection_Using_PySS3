The mental and mechanical illnesses drive me to suicideI've had a lot of You name it OCD OCPD Phobias PTSD ASD but since I fell on the chin I feel vertigo.  
Now I've developed ear popping and a sense of fullness in the ear. The chin and the bite feel off too.  
I'm starting to think of suicide as I cannot life like that - bumping on furniture not leaving house not eating... From the Google searches I guess it's called TMJ disorder but it could be Meniere's disease that leads to hearing loss. I'm not sure how these two are related to each other but I'm scared and even though I will head out to a doctor I'm scared there's no cure for it and I will be forced to commit suicide. There's no hope
