Im an animal, im not any better than a dog or a bird.When you listen to people talk about animals they always talk in a way that makes them seem like they are lesser than us. They forget to consider that they are animals themselves. We just happened to gain a high intelligence in our evolution. We were never meant to develop what we have now. The evolutionary trait was only supposed to help us survive. That all I want to do. Just survive. With only the basics. Food, water, shelter. I cant function in this extremely stressful world. If I have to continue on the path of "the american dream" I would rather die. Im not going to put myself through anymore pain and extreme amounts of stress for something I dont agree with and dont belive in. I dont get any joy in any of the rewards society offers to me for working for it. I just want to do what I was designed to. Survive. Is there anywhere on earth that still has people who live a simple life? Like a village in Vietnam or Japan or something?
