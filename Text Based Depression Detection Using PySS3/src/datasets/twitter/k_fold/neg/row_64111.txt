Keep getting worse and worse as the day goes on.I posted http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2w6vfy/just_completely_lost/ 
earlier, and I keep thinking about what's been said, and I don't know, as the day goes on, minute by minute, I feel like I'm just rotting away on the inside, and all it'll take is just one little action on my part.  I'm so fucked in the head.  Death is all I can think about anymore.  My heart keeps dropping, more and more, leaving the emptiness and void in my chest, and it just hurts so much.  I'm sorry, but I really don't know what to do anymore.
