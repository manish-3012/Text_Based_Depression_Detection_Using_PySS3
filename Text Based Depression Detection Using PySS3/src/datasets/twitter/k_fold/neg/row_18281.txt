Im conflictedBefore I say anything: I don't have a plan to do anything. I just need to vent I guess. 
Is it weird to feel like I'm not meant to be here? Like I'm a puzzle piece that just doesn't fit right anywhere? 

My boyfriend's family thinks I'm a loser. My dad has his own family and I just keep disappointing him. My mom is out of it. 

I have absolutely nothing going for me. I don't drive, I don't have a job, I'm not pretty, I couldn't make it through college, Im an angry bitch and I push everyone away. My boyfriend pays for everything, and I'm an idiot for letting him. 

I have an amazing boyfriend that I don't deserve. He's everything I'm not. He made it through college, he's successful, he's smart, he's funny, he's attractive, he drives, he's a positive person.  I don't know why he's with me. I really can't think of one reason. 

I'm trying to get into digital marketing, but nothing is certain right now. 
Part of me really wants to turn my life around, but part of me also thinks I might not be able to. 

I was raped 2 years ago, and I remind myself every day. I don't know why. My head just says "hey this happened. The police said I lied. My (ex) best friend (of over 10 years) said I'm toxic and chose the friendship of my rapist over me. And no one listened to me" and I just repeat it throughout the day, and I don't know why. I tell myself it was my fault, and I repeat it throughout the day. 

I just don't know how to feel. I don't know if trying to keep going will be worth it. I know I won't see if it will unless I stay alive for it. But I also don't want to see things end in pain again. I have enough currently.
