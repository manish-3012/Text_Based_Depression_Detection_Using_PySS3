Another visitor coming back...What should I say... A little more than three of four weeks ago, I was enthusiastic cause I had the brilliant idea to do cold calling looking for jobs, especially in the area I was interested in. Then, an employer just told me he would need a nightwatchman soon during the summer but still I have no news from him, I have no news from anybody for now. Looks like, nobody care about me, or maybe they do care and it's just that they dismiss me as soon as I approach them. another month will come to pass and then, I'll run out of unemployment insurance for good. I thought about what shoud I do, I even had sleepless night because of it but still I'm too stupid to get my things together. I even had a phone number I found in the newspaper because they were looking for staff in a restaurant (minimum wage). I could get a work there maybe, but I don't know how much time I'd be able to handle it before I get mad and do something stupid because of my hopeless situation.

Everyday seems like the repetition of the last day except for the few things I'm still trying. Like joining a "club" dedicated to job seeking.
