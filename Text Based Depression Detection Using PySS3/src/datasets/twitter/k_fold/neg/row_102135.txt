is there hopethe only person i truly cared about left me, lied to me and is with another person now. i didnt even get to experience love irl because it was a long distance relationship with a girl i met on an erasmus.

she always told me about her emotional and mental health problems. i wanna do the same, i wanna text her again and tell her how broken i feel, how i see no hope. but she was the one who caused it all.

is there really hope. or will i just be broken, getting worse with the years until one day i finally decide to end it all. 

no one will ever love me again. i don't have the energy to go through more heartbreaks or life in general.
