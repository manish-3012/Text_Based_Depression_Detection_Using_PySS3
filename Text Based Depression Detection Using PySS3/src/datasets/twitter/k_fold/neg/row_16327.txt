Suicidal ideationI very very frequently think about killing myself and how I would do it. Also think so much about how much relief that would bring me and how much grief it would bring other people. However I absolutely would never kill myself because I have 2 beautiful children that I love to death. If in some kind of freak accident or whatever they both died I would immediately follow them out of this world. My thing is I desperately would like to express my suicidal ideation  with a therapist or psychiatrist. But I'm absolutely terrified if I did my kids would be taken away from me. They are not in any harms way and well taken care of, probably spoiled to death in most people's eyes lol. But how do I address my mental health without risking my children being taken away from me? ðŸ˜”
