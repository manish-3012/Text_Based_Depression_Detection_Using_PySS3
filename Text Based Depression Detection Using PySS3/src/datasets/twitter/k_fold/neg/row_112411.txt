I need help.I've tried calling hot lines or chats and nothing helps. 
My girlfriend of four years (who I thought I was going to marry and have kids with) broke up with me after cheating on me. My "friends" got mad at me for being so upset and I even got suicidal. They got even more upset for me for that. I have no will to go on. No one really cares about me or wants to be my friend. I don't have anyone. The only reason I haven't done anything is because of my mom. I think she would commit suicide if I did, which I don't want (not much logic but whatever). I want to try to get better but I really see my future as being hopeless and sad.
