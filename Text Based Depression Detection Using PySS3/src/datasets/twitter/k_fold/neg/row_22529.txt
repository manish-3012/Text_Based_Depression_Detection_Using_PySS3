Father's day is coming up. Anyone else's dad here commit suicide?It's the number one reason I think I should go. My dad killed himself, I should too. 

I miss him a lot. He was very tough on me but I knew he cared about my well-being.

The world is a very dark place and I hope that I will find light.

I love all of you.
