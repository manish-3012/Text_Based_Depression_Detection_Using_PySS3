The story of my suicide attempt. AMA.I told a friend one night that the next day I would change my life. I was tired of being lonely, was thinking of either running away or killing myself. When I woke up, I decided on the latter. I left no note.

I drove my car off a cliff. Silly me instinctively wore his seatbelt. Car was totaled, I'm totally fine. Police came and took me to the mental ward. I went there for a week. Now I'm in a recovery program.

I regret my decision. I'm now without transportation. I'm getting better. AMA.
