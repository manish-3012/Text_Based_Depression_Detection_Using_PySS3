Writing my goodbyes and what I want to wear when they lay me out.I'm saying goodbye after several months of pain, depression and anxiety from loosing the man who I loved with all my heart to him just abandoning our marriage shortly after we were married. I know some people will ask why I chose this option over struggling through. Truth is, I don't want to be a burden to the people who I know. My friends have all disappeared from being there when I have been in such pain. So I guess it's not really a burden for them.  Last time I didn't have the ability to go through with it,  I was too emotional, but now I'm very calm,  almost still and void of any emotion. I'll smoke another cigarette and then it's time for me to see darkness and then nothing. Te amo mucho mi esposo.
