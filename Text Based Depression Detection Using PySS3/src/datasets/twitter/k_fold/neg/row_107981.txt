Just a rant hereI'm 18, and I have no desire to live life anymore. I'm fucked as far as school goes for now, I've outlived my usefulness to my only friend who I've selfishly used as a motivation to stay alive, and I can barely even go outside anymore. The only constant happiness I have anymore is playing mobile games, but even they remind me of how much time, life, and money I'm wasting on shiny fucking .pngs. I feel like a shell of a person, but that person is so far gone that I feel like some fool in his forties reliving his high school glory days trying to remember who I once was. I just drag my body from place to place most of the time, and I just want to end this. I've been functioning like this most of my life, but these past few years have been absolutely horrible. I used to care about my grades, but now they're so fucked that it's a miracle I got accepted to any colleges in the first place. I used to care about how I looked, but now I barely shower. At this point, my strongest reasons to live are my dog, my sister, and my little cousin. But then I remember that I'm such a mess of a person that none of them would really lose anything if I died, and that my sister is likely the only one who would actually remember me. All it takes is one bullet, and I'll be free. I tried that back in May, but I started using the Suicide chat thing and telling the person there anything I could. I curse myself for not ending it every single day.

I'm sorry for the disorganized wall of text, but I just have things I really want to get out. I'm just so angry and I have no one who I can really talk to anymore.
