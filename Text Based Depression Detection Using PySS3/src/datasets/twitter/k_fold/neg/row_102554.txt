Self-centered? Attention seeking?I feel insignificant to this world, that I'm not wanted or can be loved. I have no reason to be suicidal, I have a home, friends, family and financially stable. Yet I think about my death a lot, almost excessively to the point that I'm pretty sure I won't live past 35 (I'm 22). I feel like most of my relationships are a one way street, where I care way more about that person than they care about me. I feel so alone and pathetic that I need the reassurance of others all the time, like I'm only feeling this way for the attention.
