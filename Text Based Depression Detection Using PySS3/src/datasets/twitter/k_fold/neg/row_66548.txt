Help meI tried to live so hard, but every minute I feel like I'm drowning.

My social life's a mess, and my school work's a mess, and I feel like everything is falling apart, no matter how hard I try to put it together. 

I just can't bear the pressure anymore.

Today, I put a knife in front of my heart, but I couldn't bring myself to push it further because I couldn't bring my few loved ones to face my death. I cried so hard after that.

I don't know what to do with my life anymore.

Please, somebody help me.
