I was talking to a friend and said "if X happened, I would kill myself" and her reaction was like I was exaggerating, little does she know I've actually been having suicidal thoughts for almost 6 years and I, deep down, wish I could go through with itActually I didn't care about this X thing I just said what I wanted to say and meant it but obviously as I had never exhibited any warning signs no one around me knows about it. Every day I wish I didn't wake up. I'm so tired of life. I hate it and myself.
