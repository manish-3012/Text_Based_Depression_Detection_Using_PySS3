I just want it all to end, nothing matters. We are going to die anyway so why we shouldn't just speed up this process a bit.Nothing truly matters, everyone around me are saying i am worth something that i shouldn't think that way. But they arent in my head and dont know what is happening there. the most part of me want  it all to end, but that rest is looking for help unsuccessully. I dont know what to do in this situation.

Is suicide a good way out of this?
