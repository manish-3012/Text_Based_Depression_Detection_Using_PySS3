BrokenLife has been hard the past few month. Worse than itâ€™s ever been. And yesterday was the worst. Everything hurt. Everything went wrong. I lost so many people in my life. Even my dream last night was me ending my life by bashing my head into a wall over and over. I feel like itâ€™s time to just give in and be done with the pain.
