Suicidal ideation and peanut butterIâ€™ve been considering â€œgoing on a dietâ€ to counteract my suicidal ideation because for some stupid fucking reason I believe losing 10 lbs and officially becoming underweight will make me less sad. Atm, all I want to eat is peanut butter. All Iâ€™ve been eating is peanut butter and crying because it seems like the only enjoyment I get out of my life is eating a food I like. Ive been continuously crying these past 2 days because I genuinely donâ€™t think I can keep living like this. Iâ€™m nowhere I want to be in my life and everything feels hopeless. Iâ€™ve hated my life up to this point, and I still hate it. Iâ€™ve been putting my all in so I can someday be somewhere I want to be, and itâ€™s been helping, but living because it might get better means it must not be very good at the moment. I hate how my life is so limited. I feel like Iâ€™m living in a prison in both my mind and my physical body and role in society. I have my suicide supplies, Iâ€™ve had it for awhile to kind of ease the sense of no escape. But before I go, Iâ€™m going to try something else. Iâ€™m a minor, not in school, struggling both mentally and physically, and if this is it, why not just say fuck it and finally leave? Iâ€™ve lived my life up to this point that Iâ€™ll be happy once I move out. Why not? I donâ€™t expect to be happy anywhere, but I want to die knowing I at least gave it one last chance. Iâ€™ve always done exactly as I should. I work full time and have enough saved to live for a week or 2. Plus, humans can live for 3 weeks without food. Maybe Iâ€™ll lose some weight while Iâ€™m at it lol. Of course, thatâ€™s a joke. Iâ€™m just in a very bad place at the moment and I see no point in trying to continue to get better when I donâ€™t ever see it improving. After all, life was shit as a kid, itâ€™s shit now, most adults I know act like itâ€™ll only get worse. Iâ€™m tired of being used and treated as an object.
