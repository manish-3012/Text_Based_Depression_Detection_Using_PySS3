My day today...In about 10 minutes, I have to get up, shower, shave, and brush my teeth because I have to attend a recertification course for school that would otherwise be so difficult to obtain, Iâ€™m planning my suicide around it.

Afterwards, I get to go to the emergency room, explain to the unit clerk that according to the doctor I had an online consultation with last night, I am experiencing a mental health crisis, and that Iâ€™m there, voluntarily submitting myself, to save myself the cost of an ambulance ride I canâ€™t afford. I know exactly what will happen next, theyâ€™ll put me in the â€œday surgeryâ€ room, which is always funny to me because of the number of things in that room that one could use to hurt themselves, but whatever; Iâ€™ll get a medical timeout until a doctor decides that a reasonable amount of time has passed and my suicidal thoughts should be gone.

Thatâ€™s the worst part for me: The waiting. I have suicidal thoughts every single day of my life. Every morning, I wake up and that little voice in the back of me head chirps in, â€œGood morning! Are we killing ourself today, finally?â€ I often think during these timeouts about how if I need medical supervision because Iâ€™m suicidal, then the hospital should just clear out a small closet for me. I donâ€™t really need that much. Just a blanket, a pillow, and a bucket. They could feed me a sandwich once a day, or every other day really. I have some weight I could afford to lose. Maybe let me out for an hour per day for recreational time? I donâ€™t know, that seems like a lot to ask for, so maybe not. It seems like a fate as good as death.

Or they could just let me fucking die already. Iâ€™m pretty sure I met the burden of suffering required to receive medical assistance in dying ages ago. Just write me a script for benzodiazepines - call them a â€œrescue drugâ€ for anxiety or whatever - and Iâ€™ll go get drunk and high in the woods, the freezing weather will get me if the drugs donâ€™t. Done. No more suffering for me, no more burden on society.
