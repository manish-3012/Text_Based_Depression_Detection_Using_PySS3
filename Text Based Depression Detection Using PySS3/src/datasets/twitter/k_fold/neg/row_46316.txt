I just want to dieI don't know what to say anymore. I'm 26 with aspergers, adhd, depression, anxiety, no job, no money, no hope, my gorgeous GF wanting to break up with me, and currently the flu starting. I just want to be finished with the misery that is the human condition. The very nature of existence is messy, painful, and meaningless. I really hope the flu fucking kills me.
