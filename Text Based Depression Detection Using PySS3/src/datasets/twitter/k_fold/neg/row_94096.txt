I (dont) really want to dieTo whom it may concern

       
      Life lost it's meaning to me. I used
to be the happy kid that makes you smile, It's such a shame that changed to whatever i am now.

I want to say thank you to all the people that stuck with me through thick and thin even though im such a pain in the ass.

Sorry mom and dad, I never became the star child you always wanted me to be. Sorry to my bro for being such a useless sibling. And to everyone that mattered to my life, forgive me and i love y'all

I want to make this short, so I guess it's goodbye?


Good Riddance
