crashingIt's getting to the point where I can't hold it together anymore. I've been 'high functioning' for years but it's all becoming too much. The only reason I've lived as long as I have is because I don't want to hurt my loved ones, but it's getting to the point where I cant even take care of myself anymore. I've become an adult infant, my brain is so fucked up. Sure, I'm really lucky to have people who love me, but it honestly makes me feel shittier in the long run for feeling as miserable as I do. I've been really good at putting on a mask for so long but it's all starting to crumble. My only motivation to get better at this point is honestly so I can get to a point where I have enough freedom to make my death look like an accident. I don't want anyone to think there was anything they could have done to save me. I just want to spend the last of my time making everyone feel loved and special. I want to donate all of my things to those in need and create an inspiring story of travel and healing and helping others and gathering as community. I don't want my death to be traumatic for others. I want their hearts to be full of happy memories, I want them to feel loved and cared for.
I am just so tired of being confined to this physical body.  I am so tired of hurting so badly. I feel defected. Maybe it's all of the trauma maybe it's all of the drugs I've done to cope with it or maybe it just is what it is. 

I feel completely drained and deteriorated. I don't know how to keep going anymore. I can't even think about work without having a panic attack. The physical symptoms of anxiety are causing me to basically be bedridden.  I'm broke as fuck and taking up my parents resources. They love me and want to help, but I feel far past the level of being able to ever get better- which only continues the cycle of feeling shitty.   i feel powerless.
