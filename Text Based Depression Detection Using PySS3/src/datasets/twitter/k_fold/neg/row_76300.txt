Everything that can go wrong will go wrongThat's the conclusion I came to after 20 years on this rotten, filthy, disgusting planet. I feel like I am being punished for no reason, that I am being bullied by god just for being alive.

Every. Single. Fucking. Thing I have ever done has somehow managed to fuck my life up even more. I have closed myself to the outer world completely, cut off social media, only coming out when the delivery guy is here for my meal every other day to sustain myself. I have being smoking weed in the dark of my tiny room for the past year, because it's the only way to numb my brain so I can stop thinking about shooting a bullet through my fucking skull.

I tried man. I swear I tried to be happy, to be like everyone else, to talk to people, to do stuff I enjoy. But all I have found is that the world is disgusting, people are disgusting. Everyone I have ever cared about is gone, because they were also tired of this shit, they have been beaten to their death by this fucked up life.

Every night when I sleep, when I am actually able to sleep, I hope, even pray, that I will not wake up in the morning.

This has to end somehow, someway. And I think the only way is to kill myself. Thank whatever the fuck controls this universe that no one left cares about me, so I won't hurt anyone when it's done.

See you guys in hell.
