i don't know what happened. i tried it and here i am.failed an attempt this night, that's what it looks like.

couldn't tell a close friend of mine, she had some fun at a sleepover at her friend's place...  
i wanted to call her, just to hear some familiar voice...not telling her, but asking how her night went.  
distraction, if you will.  
i didn't want to bother her...

now, here i am. alive and healthy. ~~hooray.~~

should tell my therapist what happened, but i'll get hospitalised like immediately.

i'm sorry.
