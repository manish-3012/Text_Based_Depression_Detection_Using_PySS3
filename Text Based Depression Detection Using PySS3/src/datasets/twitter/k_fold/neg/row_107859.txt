I need help, just lost my mother, can't cope.I'm 15 years old, and these last few day my mother had been sick, very sick, first they put a drain in her lung... she was a smoker for 50 years.. but tonight she died at 10AM, I saw her, laying in the bed, dead. I erupted into tears, I couldn't hold it. I'm losing it right now, she mean't so much to me, and, I don't know how I can continue to live without her, she was the best mother in the world.
