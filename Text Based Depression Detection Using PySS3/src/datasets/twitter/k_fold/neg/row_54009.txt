Two sides of me fightingOne side is ready to tackle the world, wants to make friends and be loved by someone. It has so much confidence and can take on anything. The other side pulls me down, tells me Iâ€™m not good enough or pretty enough and to just hide away - that Iâ€™m nothing but a burden to everyone. Unfortunately, it seems as though my second side is stronger and always wins. Does anyone else feel this way? I honestly feel useless, I have no friends and nothing in my life that keeps me happy. Iâ€™m stuck and I hate it.
