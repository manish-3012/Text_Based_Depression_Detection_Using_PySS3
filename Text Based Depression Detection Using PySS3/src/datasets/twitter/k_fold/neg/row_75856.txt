I'm going to die.I have no future

I have no hope

I have only two friends that i barely talk to

I have a family that i despise

I haven't even finished high school. 

I have no job and no desire to find one. 

I am only waiting for death to come get me,but now I'm tired of waiting. 

Every day my envy of death grows stronger and deeper. 

I am already seeking a therapist once a week,taking pills everyday,called the suicide hotline. 

Nothing worked,I'm a lost cause. 

I just want to die.
