I've binge-eaten so much tonight my stomach aches. I feel so disgustingI've been very down on myself lately and I've been relying on food to feel better. Now I've eaten so much my body aches. I'm not fat at the moment, but I fear I might become so if I don't stop, which will only add to the other reasons to kill myself. But I also have this feeling that I don't care about myself enough to stop. Can anyone else relate to this?
