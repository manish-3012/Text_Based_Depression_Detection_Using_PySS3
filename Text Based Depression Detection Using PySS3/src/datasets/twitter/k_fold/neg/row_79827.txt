Am I too self pitying?I've been deeling with depression and anxiety since I was 14. I'm now 28 yrs old and I've been getting steadily worse over the years. I can't seem to function normally. I've been on and off numerous meds, gone thru multiple psychiatrists and therapists. I've tried to stay active in my life with difference activities. Yoga, kickboxing, spiritual healing, etc. Nothing seems to work.
I see all the tragedies on tv, people getting shot or killed. I often think about how lucky those people were, for their suffering to be at an end. It's a horrible and selfish thing to say, and I feel horrible for writing it. But I need to tell someone. I can't feel anything, no guilt, no sympathy, nothing but this emotional deadness. People die around me, people who helped raise me, and I  
Feel nothing.
I have this cold hollowness inside of me like a void. A deep hole I've been trying to fill my whole life, an emptiness I can't understand. I think about suicide multiple times a day, how easy it would be to swallow all those pills. How easy it would be to take that knife and slide it across my veins, or step onto the tracks in front of that train. It's hard to ignore those feelings, and it's getting harder. 
I'm trying to battle all these inner demons and I feel like I'm losing. People say I'm not trying hard enough, not doing enough. I am trying. But nothing seems to matter. It's hard to focus and think straight, like I'm not in control of my thoughts. The more I try not to think about these things, the harder I see them. I'm looking for a way out. I'm trying to take control of my life. I just feel scared and confused because I seem to be getting worse as I get older.

What am I doing wrong? Am I just wallowing in self pity? Is depression a choice? Am I just choosing to feel this way to get attention or make people feel sorry for me? Am I making excuses for myself
