Seriously considering suicide, what are some things to think of? (x-post)Hi, I already posted this in two different subreddits, but a user recommended this subreddit for my post. Please feel free to direct me to a better subreddit or delete the post if it's not relevant,  I'm not sure where to post this in the first place.
Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I am contemplating suicide and have been for a while now, and since I know that I will cause my family members and friends a great deal of pain when doing this, I'm going to try to make it as easy for them as possible. That means stuff like cancelling all my subscriptions so they don't have to, return my books to the library, donating my clothes beforehand, etc etc. My question is pretty simple, what are some things that is a pain to deal with for my relatives when I have passed away that i can make easier for them? I've already figured out a lot of things but I'd appreciate it if any of you guys has some advice about general stuff that I can do beforehand. Also, this is NOT a "I might be killing myself try to stop me" type of deal, I know that I'm taking the "cowardly" way out, and I would rather not discuss that with you guys, so if you could please respect that I would be glad. If you don't have any advice and want to slander me for doing the "wrong thing", please do not comment. Thank you

Other information that might be useful is welcome though. Thanks in advance
