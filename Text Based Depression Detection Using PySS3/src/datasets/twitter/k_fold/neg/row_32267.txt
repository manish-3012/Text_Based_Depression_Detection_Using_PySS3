I'm ready. [trigger...?]Sorry for the wall of text, in advance.

I had a plan for suicide for a little while. I'm pretty lucky as far as life goes, despite 6 months or so struggling with academic failure and self-harm, despite that I used to be a bully. I made the plan because I was feeling incredibly numb and emotionless, and I'd figured out a year before that I wouldn't want to live without my emotions [as context, my only redeeming quality is my codependency and the fact that my emotions sometimes let me help others]. 


I held off on it for a while, but a slight problem I've been having rose to a climax a little while ago. Over the past year or so, there have been people at my school who have hurt me, tried to pull off my clothes, and made fun of my cuts in order to keep me from telling anyone. I was okay with it until last weekend, when they turned to hurting a friend of mine. Being the impulsive person I am, I'm going to go blow up at them/stand up for my friend before killing myself so not to deal with the consequences; maybe it'll do a small part in making up for the horrible person I used to be.


I don't really know why I'm posting here; I don't want to let anyone down who wouldn't be let down by my failure if I didn't reach out. My friends have made it a little harder too. I've been trying to get my affairs in order by giving my close friends and loved ones my treasured personal items -- one friend kept questioning me as to why I was giving her my scarf, and another said "I can't wait until in a few years when we  can look at this together and laugh at it" in response to my giving her an old notebook.


...but I'm ready. At least I'm making it worth it.

Thanks for hearing me out.
