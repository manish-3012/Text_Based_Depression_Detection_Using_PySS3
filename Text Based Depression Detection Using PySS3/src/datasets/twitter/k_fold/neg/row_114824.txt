I don't know.I don't know what to do right now, but I'm not looking for advice or anything.  I feel numb. It's a shitty symptom of having BPD and it just hurts. It's so contradictory. Being so numb that it hurts. Lol. I wanted to self harm but I know how disappointed in me my partner would be if I did. So I didn't. We are sitting on the phone right now because he lives on the other side of the US. He knows I'm not okay emotionally but doesn't know how to help me. This is one of those things where I just need to wait it out. I know I will be okay but right now I don't feel like it. I've been binging and overeating so much that I gained 15 lbs the last month and I feel disgusting. I feel like a sad sack of shit right now. I've been having so many nightmares of my dad and I feel like despite cutting him off months ago he still controls me. If I died tomorrow my dogs wouldn't miss me, they would have my mom and her boyfriend and Edgar my guinea pig would have her. My mom would be sad but I have two brothers. She would be okay. I'm not at risk but sometimes this hurts so much that I feel like I don't have any other options.
