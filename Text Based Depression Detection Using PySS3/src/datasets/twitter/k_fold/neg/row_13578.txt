I'm struggling at the moment.A little back story I have suffered with suicidal thoughts ever since taking roaccutane as a teenager and I'm now 36, I used to be a roofer and would always have to fight the urge to jump, I had to stop that job. In reality it's always the thought of pain to others that stops me and not so much myself.

Well yesterday I found out my wife had been cheating on me after nothing but love and devotion for 10 years, sure there was some rough and smooth but generally a good relationship with 3 children and now I'm at rock bottom (below actually) really broken and worthless.

I do not see a way for me to continue knowing this has happened and I'm currently seeking methods, I have always been strong, I was on anti-depressants for around 3-4 years and went cold turkey because of sweating, slurred speech etc. Am I selfish? anybody been this low and pull through? My existence is meaningless without this woman loving me.

thanks for any advice.
