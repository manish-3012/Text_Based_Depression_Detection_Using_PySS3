I will never understand you totally and you will never understand me too but...(serious post) I feel so done. I swear with all my heart I would love to found someone that can relate what I went through and with the same desire of just die together after so many longs deeps talks and weird experiences. To die in a special place and way. It's like a dream for me, to end this life at least togheter with someone, while crying in happy tears. please don't write "don't do it you will be loved ecc". It's just reality, I am sure it would be the best thing for me. I hope I will find youâ¤ï¸ and I hope this post will be not deleted
