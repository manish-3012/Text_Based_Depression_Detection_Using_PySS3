I need help finding a guy from here :(I think 6 days ago I was really (like, really) considering throwing myself in front of a train and drunk posted some shit at 5 AM here. Then someone DM'd me here and honestly it really helped me get through the night and the next 2 days or something.

Sadly I cant remember his name and cant look it up anywhere because during a full nice mental breakdown I deleted all my "social" media apps like Reddit from my phone and now I cant remember the password for my throwaway acc I texted with that guy on. (I cant use email to reset it because I used a trashy 10 minute mail)

Would be really cool if I somehow would be able to find you again man :(

my account name was u/lonelyASFlmao
