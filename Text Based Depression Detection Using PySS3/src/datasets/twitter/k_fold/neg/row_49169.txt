I want to die but I canâ€™t bear knowing how my parents will feel afterI have attempted suicide once when I was 13, ending up being resuscitated a number of times and medically being a â€˜miracleâ€™ to have come out of it without brain damage. I was in intense care in hospital for two weeks.   
My parents were broken, and I vowed never to make them that upset again.  
But now a relationship has ended with someone I truly love because I was an idiot, and I have hurt the person I truly love the most. I am a burden. I canâ€™t trust myself around moving traffic or trains because the impulse is getting too strong to just end it.   
Today I am at home by myself, parents are out working. They are the one thing stopping me from just calling it a day and turning the lights out. Hell, the lights are already out anyway. I am a shell of my former self.  
For the past 6 years, I have wanted to cease to exist. If I had the choice to leave this life and for everyone to have their memories of me erased, I would do it in a heartbeat. Iâ€™m exhausted, tired, and I feel I constantly let people down. I am a burden.  
I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. My own mind is torturing me.
