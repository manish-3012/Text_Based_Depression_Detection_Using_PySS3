Don't even know if I should postSo today is officially the 2 year anniversary of my sister's suicide, as well as the 1 year anniversary of my brother's suicide (he did it on her anniversary, nobody was ready for that. They were really close...)

I'm not feeling good today. I really don't know if there's a point in continuing... I don't have any friends IRL and I hate college so far (being the depressed loner that never talks to anyone).

What if they judge me for who I am? My only friend back from high school stopped talking to me because he found out I was gay, and now I'm just too scared to talk to anyone.

Like my title says, I really don't know if I should post here, it would probably be downvoted or ignored. But if anyone's out there, just give me a few reasons. My father doesn't love me, he kicked me out once I graduated high school, so he doesn't care, and I have no friends.

Talk to me SW. I've lurked this sub for a while thinking about it... and I'm fairly close.

edit: Thank you everyone for the words of encouragement, it means a lot to me, even if it doesn't look like it. I really appreciate it, and I'm gonna keep trying. &lt;3
