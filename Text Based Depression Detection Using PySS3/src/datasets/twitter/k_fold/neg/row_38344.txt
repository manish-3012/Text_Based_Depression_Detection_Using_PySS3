LettersWriting out my letters. Itâ€™s weird to read my old ones from my failed attempt earlier this year, and to see how my journey at self betterment and care and succeeding at it still lead me right back here. Iâ€™m doing everything healthy and I still want to kill myself. Though I was definitely a lot more psychotic and unstable earlier this year, I still feel the same way even after six months of me working out, eating right, taking meds... etc. 

Itâ€™s weird that I feel so rational about this. That ultimately I knew I was right when I said to myself that Iâ€™ll die because I end my own life. Idk when, idk how, but I know sometime soon thatâ€™ll be the case. Self-fulfilling prophecy I suppose.

The antidepressants did nothing but make me numb and sick and lose my hair. It did nothing but give me a false sense of hope.

I tried, yâ€™all. I tried so hard. I tried to be everything that everyone who loved me wanted to be. Oh well.
