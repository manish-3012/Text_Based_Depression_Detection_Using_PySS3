.every night i tell myself "this is it. i need to do it tonight i'm going to do it tonight." and i never go through with it. i have some good days but they always lead to bad. i'm tired of the ups and downs. i'm tired of thinking things are getting better and becoming hopeful when it's all just going to lead to the next shitty night. the only thing that's kept me from going is my mom. i want to die but i can't hurt her. i don't want to be even more of a burden on her. i feel like i don't have any other options but to die.
