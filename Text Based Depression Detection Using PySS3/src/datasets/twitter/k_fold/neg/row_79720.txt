Almost went to the hospital last nightLast night just before bed I had a huge panic attack. My chest hurt so badly, my arms and legs felt like they had lightening bolts through them. I tried to breathe deeply but my nose was suddenly clogged. 

I called a help line and they suggested it might not be a panic attack and they I should go to the hospital. I didn't go and eventually fell asleep. 

It was the scariest I have ever been. I debated taking more seroquel to calm down but I wasn't sure if that was a good idea 

The crazy thing is that I don't even know what triggered it.  I am scared to go to bed tonight.
