Why go on if you know it's not going to get any better?I'm 35, no friends, no family, $60,000 in debt and working a marginal job just getting by. I have a worthless college degree and too old to retrain. 

No retirement savings so I will be working until I die as a wage slave.

There is something wrong with me but I don't know what it is. I don't like being around most people. The ones I can tolerate, I feel nothing towards. As in, I wouldn't care if I never saw any of these people again. Social situations give me anxiety as I am eccentric or there is something odd about me, and it is disturbing to others. It's one of the reasons I had such trouble with finding and holding onto a "real" adult job. I could never forge the social relationships to get anywhere and not smart enough to skate by on pure ability.

So why bother? Why torture myself with hope? So I can suffer endlessly with little hope of a return for my efforts?

I just want to die but my instincts betray me. The disgusting instinct that forces me irrationally cling to life. How I wish to defeat it so I can die and finally be free. There is only truth in death.
