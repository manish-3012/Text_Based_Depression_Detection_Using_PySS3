Fuck school, fuck life, fuck fucking everythingLife is just fucking shit. What's the point to any of this, why am I here, why don't I know fucking anything? I get that I'm young but I don't get why people ignore me when I try to say how I feel, is it because I'm such a shit person, is it because everyone hates me? Maybe I should just die. If I was dead no one would have to worry about me, no one would waste their time around me, everyone would be so much happier.

 School doesn't do shit for me. What have I gained from it besides stress? I was a straight A student for ages but in the last year or two I get Ds and Es, after all, I'm not gonna be alive for much longer so I won't really have to do school ig. Why am I even writing this, no one cares about me, no one will ever know what happened to me after writing this, no one will even remember this in a week. It's fucking 2am, what am I doing with myself. There are other people that deserve help, I don't deserve it. I know how to tie a noose at least. I could walk away for hours into the mountains and just hang myself. If that didn't work I could always jump off a bridge. I think I will when I get the chance to. 

I guess this is like my goodbye note to this sub then. Sorry I couldn't be of any worth to anyone, sorry I couldn't do anything to help myself, sorry for fucking everything.
