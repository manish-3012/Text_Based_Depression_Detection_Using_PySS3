Called the Suicide Hotline the other night. They were immensely helpful and I just wanted to share.Hi,
I don't often put my feelings out in the open but I am very grateful for organizations such as the Suicide Hotline as well as this subreddit.

I called after a night of heavy drinking as my grandfather had just died. I have struggled with depression, alcoholism and self harm, and I was worried that I may hurt myself. So, I called. I never envisioned myself, as a 27 year old man, to be someone to call a crisis hotline.

I am more than thankful I did. The woman on the other line was one of the most compassionate, understanding and overall nicest human beings I've had the pleasure to talk to.

I would give anything to thank her over and over until she was annoyed with me.

Thanks for listening. I hope I didn't rant. Feel free to remove this post if I did mods.
