Just going to wait to the rest of my medication to wear off so I can do it.I missed my last doctors appointment because Iâ€™m an idiot and slept in, and I donâ€™t want to go back and waste their time again because Iâ€™ve already missed an appointment and had to start the medicine again before. 

Last time I wasnâ€™t on any medication I was a day away from killing myself, and I know if I just wait a bit Iâ€™ll be able to do it. So, now Iâ€™m just playing the waiting game.
