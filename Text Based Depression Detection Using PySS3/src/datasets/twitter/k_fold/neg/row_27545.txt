Today I told my parents I was sexually abused as a child. To anyone out there who is afraid to speak up, know that you are not alone and that people are here to help. No matter how far or near the incident is, you have the power to heal.There are many crisis centers through out the US, if you are in need, danger or just need someone to listen, call: 1-800-273-TALK(8255)

â€œSo, I guess we are who we are for alot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.â€
