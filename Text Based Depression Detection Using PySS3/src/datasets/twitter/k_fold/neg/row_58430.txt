Take it from someone who's been there.This is not a cry for help. This is a message of hope.

I have suffered with extreme social anxiety and moderate depression for most of my life. It used to be really bad. I first attempted suicide in seventh grade. Throughout the majority of my adolescence I have had one or more plans kicking around in my head as to how I would finish myself off. I hated school, I hated my life, but most of all i hated myself. There were weeks where I couldn't stand the sight of myself in a mirror, and would avoid them obsessively to spare myself the sight of the massive walking failure I had become.

Last year was my breaking point. I couldn't take it any longer. This time I promised myself would be my LAST time. I had all the supplies ready, my note written, and nothing to lose. I was lying on my bedroom floor ready to suffocate myself.

But something happened before I made that final decision. Somewhere in me was a part of me that didn't want to die. 

That Saturday I broke down to my mom. For a good forty five minutes I let the floodgates open. She finally got to know her son as he saw himself. She got me counseling, someone I could express my darkest thoughts to and who would help me overcome them. They got me on an antidepressant. I can honestly say that he saved my life.

And things have gotten better. I have gone a full year without suicidal thoughts,  I am more outgoing and less anxious, and at long last I finally love myself. I am living proof that whatever is going on in your life it can, and *will* get better if you talk to someone about what you  are going through. Don't be afraid. There are people out there who love you,and who will be more than willing to help you if you take that first step and tell them you need it. 

I am FullClockworkOddessy. I am a suicide survivor. And I'm here for you.
