The worst thing a person can feelIn my experience, the worst feeling I have ever experienced has been the feeling of being unloved or even disliked/hated by the people you love the most and call your friends. I can't be sure if they actually feel this way about me, but everything points towards this. And honestly, it hurts so much, imagine no one around you loves you, they might pretend that they do but their actions say otherwise, imagine always feeling like you don't have anyone who is there for you, you don't have anyone who cares for you, you don't have any friends...
