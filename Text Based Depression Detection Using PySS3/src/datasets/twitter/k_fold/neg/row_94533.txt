Help me go through with itI gave away pretty much all of my possessions and money to charity. I was supposed to jump off this ledge and just stood there for five hours.  Now Iâ€™m thinking about robbing banks.

I have no future cause i come from no money and while I fought tooth and nail to keep my dreams alive it finally fell through and Iâ€™m priced out of education, medical treatment, and means to live. 

At the same time I think itâ€™s happening Iâ€™m getting very physically sick. I eat one meal a day and Iâ€™m homeless.  I used to be runner up valedictorian music prodigy and popular. Then I had health problems and lost everything. Took a decade to lose my will to live and redeem myself.

Anyway I sometimes seriously consider killing lots of people I deserve to die help .
