A traumatized chick who just wants it all to end.Read post history to get an idea of what has happened.

These past few months have been very hard for me mentally. I had a lot of things happen to me that keep me having nightmares almost constantly, which means I haven't been getting sleep. I recently lost a decent job I had that covered health insurance and seeing a therapist cost me $100 per trip, which I can't afford. I am stuck doing a job I hate for minimum wage and my bills are due soon and I'm not sure how I'm going to cover it all.

My fiance is in a totally different country from me, my friends a two-hour drive away. I told them all I was struggling and needed something to get me out of my head, and so far nothing. It's like they don't care, but I couldn't really blame them for that. There's not much of a decent human for them to care about.

I haven't eaten these past few days because I just don't have the energy to. I'll make the food, but as soon as it gets to where I actually eat it, I get tired and don't want to. I just don't know what to do. I guess posting here is my last resort since no one else in my life can help me.
