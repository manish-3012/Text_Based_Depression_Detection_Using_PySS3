I just keep going because of my mumMy dad allready died when i was four years old. First i didn't even looked at the hurt that the death of my father caused. When i got older i slowly realized that it had something to do with my problems in life. But i used it as an excuse, for me not listening to myself. If no one ever listened to you, how could you listen to yourself?

My mother would be heart broken if i commited suicide, and i would die 4 years prior to when my dad died of lung cancer. So it is not an option. But it gives me comfort, that i least have something left under my control in my life. I gave up control for all the other things in life: relationships, friendships, school, work. I was to afraid to step up for myself, and now i pay the price...
