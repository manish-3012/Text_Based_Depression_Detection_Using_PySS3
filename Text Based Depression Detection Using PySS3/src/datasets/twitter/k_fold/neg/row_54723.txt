Every time I think about ending it.I don't want to end it without saying goodbye to people first (cry for help, attention seeking, being a little bitch?) so I message people telling them how I feel and afterwards I don't want to die because they don't deserve to have a persons life on their hands. But I want...I need to say goodbye.
