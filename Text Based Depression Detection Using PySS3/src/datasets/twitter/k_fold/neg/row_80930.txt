I Feel like I'm out of other optionsI am extremely lonely, depressed, etc.  I have no friends or family to turn to.  I don't know the last time I have been hugged/touched by another human.  Tried therapy and meds multiple times without relief.  Tried the hotline but was on hold for over 30minutes once before hanging up then finally got someone who seemed to rush me off the phone after giving me a list of resources over 3 hours away from where I am.  I just feel that there is no hope for me and if I'm gone no one will likely know because no one cares ...
Edit: Done trying to get help because there is none out there for me...bye
