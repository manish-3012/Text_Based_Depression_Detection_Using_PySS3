Iâ€™ve accepted suicide.Iâ€™ve accepted that fact that Iâ€™ll leave this world through suicide. I believe in God, but thatâ€™s not the point. Iâ€™ve accepted that the only way my suffering stops is if Iâ€™m dead... Iâ€™m preparing myself for the inevitable pain Iâ€™ll feel during but itâ€™s all worth it not to exist anymore.
