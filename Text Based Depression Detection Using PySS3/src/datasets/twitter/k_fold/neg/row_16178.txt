Don't even know what the fuck is wrong anymore.As of right now, i've pretty much given up on recovery. I want out.

I suffer from chronic severe nausea. It lasts all day every day. There is no break. Its been 2 years, almost 3. I suffer from panic attacks at least 5 times a week. I'm not talking 5-10 minute attacks. They last hours. The anxiety and racing thoughts alone are enough to want to die, but paired with physical symptoms, i'm convinced anything after death can't be as bad as this. I haven't left my house *literally* in 7 months.

When I was younger I had selective mutism, and am now forever known as the weird one. I skipped school a lot and eventually dropped out of public school in grade 8. I'm now in grade 11. I remember going through the halls and people would say "Ewww". Even in the parking lots, I would see groups of peers and they would make animal noises at me. I have no friends whatsoever. 

The hospital is shit, doctors in my area are shit, the crisis line is *complete* bullshit. I think staying in the hospital has made me more homicidal than I ever was before, because of how incompetent everyone is. I hate Canada. I hate the fucking 18 month wait lists. I feel like I am smarter than the doctors. I KNOW what symptoms I have and what medications would help, yet they try to tell me. I'm not dealing with this bullshit anymore.

I don't see life ever getting better or changing.
