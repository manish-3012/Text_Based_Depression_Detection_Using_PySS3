My life is pointlessI'm 20 and I've accomplished practically nothing. Yes, I graduated hs and got into college but the stress and anxiety are killing me, I don't even know if it's all worth it. The only thing that I'm good at is probably quitting. I quit piano as a kid bc it was too difficult and my parents spent my entire childhood reminding me that I'm a quitter. Turns out they're right. In college I quit a research program bc i was burnt out from schoolwork and didn't have time for that; quit a job at a school publication for the same reason. Now I have another job at a small local newspaper writing stuff that nobody will ever read or gaf about. And I'm thinking about quitting that as well, since it's totally meaningless and is draining my energy and will to live. I recently relocated back to the country where my family immigrated from b/c of how badly the US is handling the virus, but i still attend college in the US remotely. Let's just say the time difference is not serving me well. My sleep pattern is non-existent, and I had to find a new therapist since now I'm out of state. Geez, if I were to just die from overwork tonight i wouldn't object to it. anything that ends this suffering. I know how privileged i am to be able to afford college/therapy and every day I think about how undeserving I am. I also know that practically no one is faring too well in this pandemic. I apologize if my experience comes off as trivial/tone-deaf. That's not my intention I'm just really hopeless. Anyway, thank you for reading.
