not that I will, but I just want to die.My father was killed by doctors on dec 31st 2015 during knee surgery. He wasn't always, but he became a great man helping many others in his life time, at the time of his passing he was a teacher, a minister, a Counselor, a Bigbrother, lead 2 youth ministries, ran for county judge, and probably the first person to visit you at a hospital if he found out you were sick, regardless how far you were from him.

He's gone, my Grandmother (died 2 years ago) is gone, these were the people who loved me, the people I wanted to pay back, the people who shaped me and my inspiration to go on. my determination. they're dead. My Google is offline, my Roadmap is invisible, my support has fallen and I feel lost, and life feels meaningless.

I know people say "life feels meaningless" all the time, but they probably dont mean it the way I do. I have no will to live. I dont want to live anymore, I want to be where my loved ones are. I feel left behind and this world feels really lonely. I dont understand God's plan and though I have faith, my feelings are still what they are. And the fact remains when I call my father to get guidance about some issue, it will only go to voicemail now. 

I'm trying hard to continue to walk, to continue to fake and please others so they dont see me always suffering, until maybe something makes sense, but currently nothing makes sense. I can hide it. I do when I go to work, I do when I know people expect "happiness" or whatever, but honestly I'm just crying on the inside and suffering. My phone doesn't ring anymore. I doubt anyone would notice if I died or ran away for a few days because those who noticed me are all Dead. Why am I here I wonder every night. 

And dont give me cheap and easy words without real direction because that's exactly what they are. They're useless. Like trying to please a father who is already dead. 

I know my father wouldn't want me to give up, but at this point I wonder is there even any point in this game of life? some people just have bad rolls right?
