Yesterday I almost did it..Yesterday I stabbed my self repeatedly with a long stellito blade and the authorities were called 10 cops detained me on my lawn and went to hospital check in and was released. All over being ghosted and blocked by a women now that was obviously to good to be true. Mind you the relationship was in person we made out etc shared feelings then boom blocked in a instant.. It broken me because I had this happening exactly in the past .. It must be us quiet types we must not be cut out for life or love in general.. I see no other perspective logically.
