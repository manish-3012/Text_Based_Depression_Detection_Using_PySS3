I'm losing everything.My only happiness is my friends. And they're online. Dads a felon so we can't have internet at home. Neighbor let me use hers. But she lied to me. Her house will be up for sale in five days. Probation officer won't get back to me.

I find no enjoyment. I work two jobs, pay rent for parents, go to school. Lagging behind assignments, can't tell professor why. Only taking it for health insurance because of my anxiety disorder.

Sleep isn't an escape. Its full of nightmares. I'm breaking down, but nobody seems to notice. Everyone's all in for themselves. It all comes back to me. I have no way out. I'm trapped. There is no bright side here. Please help.
