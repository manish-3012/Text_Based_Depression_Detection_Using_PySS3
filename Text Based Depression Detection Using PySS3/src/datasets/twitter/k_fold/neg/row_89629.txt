18 and broken in the land of the freeMy parents make too much for financial aid. I work 56 hours a week and still can't afford college. I'm through one year with thousands of dollars in unsubsidized debt, with less than a month to pay for my next semester. I can't even move out of my parents house, even though I have the money. There are no apartments. It's not going to get better. This country is shit, and it's too hard to get any foothold in life at all. I think I'm done. I hope America fixes it's higher education system someday.
