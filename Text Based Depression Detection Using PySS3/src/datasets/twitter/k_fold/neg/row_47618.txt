I don't want antidepressants and no one will listen to meNo matter where I go online or offline, people keep telling me to give them a try. One person online even got sarcastic and told me that I was being self destructive. I don't need antidepressants. I know what I need, but no one will listen to me. Go on, tell me how great antidepressants are, and how they saved your life. Go ahead.
