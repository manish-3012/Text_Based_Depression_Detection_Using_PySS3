Why do I feel so disgusting and manipulative for asking for help?I just need to talk to someone, but Iâ€™m so bad with words, and I donâ€™t want to bother anyone. Iâ€™m so sorry for the way I think. Iâ€™m so tired of being a burden. I feel so trapped and alone. I hate that I have to bother other people so they can help me. Even I think Iâ€™m a horrible attention seeker. I donâ€™t want to be that person.
