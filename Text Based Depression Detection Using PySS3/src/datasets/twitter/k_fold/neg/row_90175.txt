I have an opportunityIâ€™m leaving in about a week to go to New York. Iâ€™ll be all by myself. I have been given the opportunity to finally kill myself. Iâ€™ll be far away from home. I can run from all my problems and finally have the guts to die. Itâ€™s strange Iâ€™ve been waiting for almost 4 years. Iâ€™ve planned for so long. Came up with all these ideas on how to die. Iâ€™ve attempted numerous plans and failed. I really want this to work. For some reason there is a little voice in the back of my head saying that I will fail. Itâ€™s saying Iâ€™m going to become a flake. Itâ€™s saying Iâ€™m going to chicken out, that I have things I still need to do. All I have to do now is tell that one girl how I really feel. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s my last regret. All I want is to tell her how I feel, tell her how much sheâ€™s mattered to me. Is that worth living over? Itâ€™s one small regret compared to all the things that I regret. If my life is full of them, why does this one hurt so bad. Why am I hesitating because of this girl? This is why I should have cut my ties way back. This is why you need to isolate yourself. What is she doing to me? If I want to die so badly how come she is holding me back from doing the only thing that I need to do? 

I know that Iâ€™m privileged. Iâ€™ve been given so many opportunities. Materialistic items just have no value to me anymore. Why did I have to be given this life? Why couldnâ€™t someone who could have used all that Iâ€™ve been given for good. Other people could have fucking benefited from what I have. I have best friends that say that I live a perfect life. Sure, I agree that itâ€™s better, but that doesnâ€™t mean that what I suffer isnâ€™t valid. How can someone say something like that if they donâ€™t know anything about what Iâ€™ve been through. They call me a best friend, yet they no nothing. Nothing at all. That person that told me that also said that suicide is a sin and if any of her friends tried she wouldnâ€™t care. How could she be so full of it. She thinks that her problems are the worst. She thinks that everyone elseâ€™s problems donâ€™t even compare to herâ€™s. Like what the fuck? Iâ€™m not invalidating her problems, but doesnâ€™t she need to understand that she isnâ€™t suffering the most? Other people suffer too. It made me feel like shit. I know that Iâ€™ve been privileged, but that doesnâ€™t mean we are rich, it means that our family works hard for the money they earn to live. She can only see and know what Iâ€™ve given her. Who is she to judge if she doesnâ€™t even know half the story? 

Her words meant a lot to me. I understand. Iâ€™m not stupid. I know that people know pain. I know that people are suffering more than me. I know. I would never judge someone based on what they choose to show the world. They could be suffering, because if you think about it who isnâ€™t?

This takes me back to the beginning. I want to die. Iâ€™m suffering and have been for a while now. Getting help can never help me. I am who I am. Itâ€™s practically part of my description. All I know is depression, if you take that away then what am I? Who would I be? I wouldnâ€™t know who I am. Because without depression, without my suicidal thoughts, I am nothing. Killing myself might hurt those around me, but why should I stay alive and suffer just so others donâ€™t have to suffer? Why must I suffer? Why must anyone suffer? If I want to kill myself, then so be it.



Sorry I really kinda just ranted....
