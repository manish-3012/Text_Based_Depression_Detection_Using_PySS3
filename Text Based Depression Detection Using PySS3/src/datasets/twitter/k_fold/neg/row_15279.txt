Tonight might be itI'm getting drunk I think I might do it tonight. I just feel guilty. My father was never really there growing up and I hate to to that to my daughter as well.  She's only 1 though she won't even remember me.  Idk gutted if I post tomorrow I couldn't do it. Maybe a few more beers...
