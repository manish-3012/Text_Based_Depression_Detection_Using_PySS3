I donâ€™t want to live anymoreThe cycle never ends. I tired, but it not even close to enough. I canâ€™t keep a job, Iâ€™ve quit 3 now in the last two years. Lost everything. Canâ€™t support my family. Tried every medication for depression and anxiety, but it doesnâ€™t stop.

I thought I made progress this last time, the I could hold down a real career job, but I quit after two weeks. 

I am a burden. Family would be sad at first, but itâ€™s better I donâ€™t drag them down for the rest of their lives. Iâ€™m in so much constant pain. I want to die.
