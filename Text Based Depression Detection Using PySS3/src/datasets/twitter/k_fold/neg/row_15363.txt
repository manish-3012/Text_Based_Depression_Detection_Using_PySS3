I honestly have no idea what I'm going to do with my life.I'm a junior in highschool. I literally have no friends. I have no one to talk to. School has been online the whole year, and I have no opportunity to talk to peers or teachers, due to how the new school program is set up. I have no idea what job I want. I have not idea what I want to major in. If I even want to go to college anymore. And I don't know how to tell anybody except strangers.
