"My biggest regret in life is you." help.I was raised by my controlling narcissistic mother. I'm not going to get into the f**ked up stuff because I'm honestly feeling the absolute worst I've felt in a very long time. Worthless. Unwanted. Unloved. A waste of time. An accident.

This is what happened today; late last night my brother (15) accidentally dropped the "f" bomb while playing a video game, in his room, with the door shut, around 1 am. My mom has been known to lurk around the house to try to catch either my brother or I doing something, so she can do a full search of your phone, your room, literally everything you own will be searched through. This is why she was able to take his phone and proceed to look through it at 1 am.

My twitter is private. I rarely use it, but I follow my brother and he follows me. Since my mom has his phone, she can now see my tweets. Now, several months ago I had tweeted "I think it's funny that my mom hates me" because she was acting very hateful, and actually hit me and told me she hated me. She sends me a screenshot of the tweet and I confront her via text about it later.


This is what happened.
