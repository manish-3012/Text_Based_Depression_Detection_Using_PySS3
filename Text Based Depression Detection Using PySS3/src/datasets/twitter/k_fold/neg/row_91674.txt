I have forfeited my emotionsDealing with this for years upon years really drains you of any sort of care for anything. Nothing helps anymore and I feel absolutely inprisoned within my own mind. I am the reason for the massive rift between my parents. I caused the worst shouting match between them I have heard in years. My mother is done with me. In a fit of sadness I told her that she is the reason I feel suicidal and that I will cut any contact I have with her as soon as I move out. My father thinks I am pathetic and that I don't care about him. I can't reverse this damage I've done. It's time for all of this to stop.
