im not gonna last very long lolmy life is so fucking meaningless. im 16, no friends (i literally have no fucking friends), no job, no school, no social life whatsoever, all i do is sleep for 15+ hours then play on my phone for another 9 hours and repeat that. every day. i feel nothing but everything at the same time. im so tired and miserable all the time. i dont know why i keep going on. i try to go to ged classes but im so tired all the time. i have no motivation. whats the point of a job anyway?? i would have already killed myself if i wasnt such a pussy. what am i waiting for? i could end all this bullshit so easy. i wish i had the guts. i dont care anymore. i dont know what to do. im trapped here with 3 disabled elderly family members and an equally depressed 15 year old sister. weâ€™re all so miserable. things will never get better. i dont see myself living past 20. once both of my grandparents are gone the pain will be too much. im literally never gonna be anything in life. theres nothing anyone can say to me to make me feel better at this point. for the last year i have been so miserable. my life is so fucking worthless fuck this oh my god whats even the point in sitting here and feeling like complete dog shit every fucking day like what is the point why cant i just fucking kill myself already
