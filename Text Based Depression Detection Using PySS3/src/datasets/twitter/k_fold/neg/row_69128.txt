I donâ€™t know if I can hang on any longerI feel so done in. Week in week out Iâ€™m tired of putting on a brave face for everybody. Making everybody laugh,  trying to make them feel better. I feel like crap today. Today is one of those days. I have two children who are currently with their father for the weekend. Iâ€™d like to think I could be strong enough to never hurt them in this way and every time Iâ€™ve been strong enough. They are the reason I live and breathe and when I donâ€™t have them, I sometimes go to this dark place. Friends are amazing, I have some wonderful people around me, I truly do, but they couldnâ€™t possibly comprehend the pain I live in day in and out. If it wasnâ€™t for my children I would no longer be here. I really do scare myself sometimes. I wonder what irreversible damage Iâ€™m capable of doing to myself. I didnâ€™t deserve this.
