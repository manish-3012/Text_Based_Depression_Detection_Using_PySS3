I donâ€™t want my mom to be sad when Iâ€™m gone
Last time I overdosed I spent a week in the icu and then another in a mental ward while my court case got figured out. Ive never seen my mom cry so much when that happened and that makes me so sad. Iâ€™ve failed twice now both with overdoses. I have my last day on earth marked on my calendar. One week from today. This time Iâ€™m eating a bullet so I know it will actually work. I just donâ€™t want my mom to be sad when she gets the news that Iâ€™m gone. And I want her to be able to say goodbye to me but how is she going to do that with my head blown off. Why the fuck am I even typing this fuck Iâ€™m such a pussy. What can I do do to make my mom to hate me so sheâ€™s not sad when Iâ€™m gone or how do I make it as easy on her as possible.
