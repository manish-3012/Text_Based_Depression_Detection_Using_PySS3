Need to VentI've felt like I've been depressed for quite some time.  I don't get enjoyment out of anything most of the time.  Now, a bit about me-I'm a good student, a star athlete, competitive video game player.  I've won a state title in track and field and have been first team for football every year I've played.

Now for my problem, getting out of bed is really hard.  I feel like I don't have anything to get out of bed for.  I dread school, social interaction, football practice.  We had a storm about 2 months ago, something is screwed up with my ISP since then, I can't have steady ping to competitively play the only thing I enjoy doing.  I think about killing myself at least every other day.  I don't know what to do anymore.
