Young, broke, disabled... Fuck itI don't think I'll kill myself but I don't know anymore. I no longer want to be alive. 

I'm in constant physical pain, I can't get a job that isn't shitty and too physically demanding for me to do for a prolonged period. Yet I don't qualify for disability because I am physically capable of working. 

If I ride the bus for an hour and bust my ass for 8 hours so I can ride back home for an hour, that leaves me fucking exhausted. (I actually injured myself without knowing and wound up in the ER the other day) I'm half crippled. That means I get no help from society yet I have to struggle much more than a normal person. 

Whats the point in living if all my time is either sold for an hourly rate or spent recovering from selling my time for an hourly rate. 

If I could get a job I could actually do life might be worth living, but who will hire a depressed half crippled recovering opiate fiend. 

I think I'll give it a few more months, then I'll turn to crime, then I'll put a bullet in my head. 

I don't know why I wanted to post this. I feel like I have to share my plan with someone I'm sick of lying when people ask what I plan to do with my life. 

I plan to sell drugs with my life until that inevitably goes badly, then I plan to end it.
