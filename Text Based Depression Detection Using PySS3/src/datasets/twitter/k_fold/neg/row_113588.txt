I've tried like 4 times to make a decent title and gave up each time, so fuck it.I feel alone and hopeless even though I rationally know I have a possibly bright future if I continue to try. I have a good relationship with my family and I have two very close friends, so why do I believe I deserve to die? I feel like I've been carrying a giant weight for a few years and I want to give up. I've been looking at poisoning myself. I'm rambling, I guess I don't want to feel alone right now.
