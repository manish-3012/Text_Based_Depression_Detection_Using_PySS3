Having a hard time coping with a history of sexual abuse.It's currently 11:40 PM on a school night here, and I cannot sleep for the life of me. Thoughts and memories of my mother's sexual abuse are just filling my head and I don't know what to do or feel. There's no one up that I can talk to comfortably.
