I canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™m trying to stay happy. Iâ€™m trying to stay positive. Itâ€™s so hard, I always overthink everything.It gets so bad that I canâ€™t breath. No one knows how I feel, my parents donâ€™t even know that iâ€™ve been self harming for a long time. My mum said iâ€™m being dramatic. The only people that knew how I feel and knew everything have passed away. I donâ€™t know what to do. Whenever someone asks how iâ€™m holding up, I say iâ€™m alright. Iâ€™m lying. But I feel like if I open up to them they wonâ€™t even care. I wish I could just disappear out of this world without hurting myself. I want to kill myself but iâ€™m scared of the pain and iâ€™m scared that it wonâ€™t work and iâ€™ll just wake up in hospital with everyone staring at me.
