Each day is only one inconvenience after anotherThe title doesnâ€™t make a lot of sense so Iâ€™m just gonna explain what I mean. Everything I do I am inconvenienced. Itâ€™s mostly little things too like doing homework or trying to play a game or trying to record a video. For example last night I was trying to play a game on my phone and I disconnected each time I joined a server. And yes that isnâ€™t significant, but stuff like that happens to every single little fucking detail of my day. It just makes me so stressed. 

For example, I was just trying to record a video and my dogs wouldnâ€™t shut up, and when they do shut up my parents will be in the living room so now I have to wait until nighttime until I can record. And the problem there is that Iâ€™m recording my reaction to a 6 and a half hour long video and itâ€™s a school night. Again thatâ€™s insignificant but it happens all the damn time. 

If things worked out better I would probably have the inspiration to do things like homework. But they donâ€™t. Life will hopefully be a lot better in the future, because if it isnâ€™t then I donâ€™t see a point in living if nothing works out.
