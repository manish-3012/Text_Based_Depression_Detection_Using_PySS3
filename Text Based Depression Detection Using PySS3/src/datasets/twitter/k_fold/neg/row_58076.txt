I'm Really Proud of All the Homeless People Out ThereSee, I'm one of the many worthless humans on this planet that nobody wants to hire. Been this way for over a year. About 30 minutes ago I went into a screaming fit followed by loud sobs. I guess that's just how you physically react to realizing you have no place in this world and that any hunger you had for that world is now gone. 

All the homeless people in this world have somehow found something to live for, but I have not. I thought it was work, but that never happened. It isn't sex or love: I can't do either. I think, after 33 years of life, God is really showing me that he messed up when he put me here. That he didn't mean to. Or maybe whatever I had to do is now done.

I hate those assholes who call suicides selfish. Whatever feeling of loss they feel, the deceased felt 80 times more of that. It is far from natural or easy to kill oneself; shit must be pretty fucking bad and life must be beyond pointless for it to happen. And to anyone who wants to tell me "think of all the x and y you're gonna miss!" No, I'm passed that shit. Right now I'm trying to muster the energy to just do what I have to. 

Shoutout all the homeless people who got to this point of poverty and worthlessness, but still managed to find something to live for.
