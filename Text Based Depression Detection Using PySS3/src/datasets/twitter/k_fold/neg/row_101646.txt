I'm really concidering suicide.I can't help but contemplate how easy it would me to kill myself. No one cares. I have no real friends. I smoke pot so I'm now abandoned by my mother. I have my dad but I still crave her love. I want her acceptance. I cut myself on a nightly basis. I cry all the time. I hide in the bathroom sometimes to cry. I already tried to kill myself a few weeks ago. I went to the hospital and that did no good. I weigh down on my whole family. I've always though suicide is the cowards way out so I might just be a coward. I have nothing left to live for. My sibilings would be better off without me. I honestly think I need help.
