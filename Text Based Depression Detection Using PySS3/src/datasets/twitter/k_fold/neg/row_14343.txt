Not sure if I'm suicidalTW: suicide, self harm

I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and recently I've become more and more preoccupied with suicide. I think about wanting to kill myself all the time; I google methods, constantly browse this sub and other places on the internet, write out suicide notes and even do things like make a noose and wrap it around my neck. I also constantly look at images of self harm and find new ways to self harm myself (I've been self embedding a lot recently). Even when I'm with friends and I'm meant to be having a good time I just can't stop thoughts like 'they'd rather me be dead' and 'if I just killed myself I'd never have to feel sad again'.

However, although it's constant and almost obsessive, I don't think I actually want to die. Thinking about killing myself makes me feel really peaceful and calmer, but I'm 90% certain I'd never go through with it.

I really don't know if I'm genuinely suicidal or if I'm going crazy. I feel like I'm addicted to thinking about suicide and self harm but I can't make the thoughts go away and it's stopping me from doing anything else. I can't even game or watch TV anymore because all I do is look up suicide.
