Iâ€™m a walking mistake and my time to leave is soon.Iâ€™m only 18 and thought things would get better. They only seemed better on the surface. Maybe ending it all tonight wouldnâ€™t be a terrible thing to do. 

Iâ€™m such a walking mistake and I keep hurting people. I think Iâ€™m making the right decisions and then they blow up in my face consistently.

 I think itâ€™s time to end my life. I thought this feeling would never return but here it is again.

I donâ€™t think things will get better. I hate being isolated but still ruin everything. 

I think my time to permanently rest is soon.
