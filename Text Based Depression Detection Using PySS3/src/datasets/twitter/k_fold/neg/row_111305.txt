nobody cares why bother?my teachers dont care about me,they scream at me for being one of the worst behaved students because another teacher put a bunch of 'bad points' on my school account which has landed me close to a report. i was being bullied and someone tried to put me in a headlock i but them on the arm to break free and was given a day in inclusion for 'leaving a mark on another student using violence'. and theres a ton more.

my parents dont care one screams and threatens to hit me and the other emotionally abuses me.

my step brother rapes me and if i actually end myself he will probably target my 1 year old brother (when hes older) or my 8 y/o step brother(started raping me at 8).

the only thing im useful for is being a sex 'slave'.

i decided to waste this subs time instead of r/teenagers.

i downplayed everything and now my post looks like i have first world problems instead if actual ones.

edit:30 minuites and i'll either pussy out or you have to convince me not to do it
