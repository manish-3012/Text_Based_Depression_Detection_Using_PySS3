Should I off myself tonight?My life is going nowhere. I wish I could just cease to exist. My cat would be devastated, but she'd recover. Cats always recover. My mom doesn't know that I'm depressed and suicidal. Nor do any other family members. I'm anxious, depressed, and generally fucked. Reddit, should I kill myself and face going to hell? If so, what's the most painless and fast method?

Edit: Is plastic bag over the head a good idea? I don't have very many materials... I'd prefer gunshot, but my family doesn't even have a gun.
