I just donâ€™t want to be alone anymoreHi I am Elena I am 13. I have said this some many times but only to myself. The only reason or one of the only reasons I am alive and am gonna stay alive is cause of my family and friends I really hate life but non of that matters. My family deserve my alive I canâ€™t let them go through all that just cause I was selfish enough to kill myself. I canâ€™t put them through it especially not my Mam i donâ€™t know what she would do if I ever did and canâ€™t let that happen. I have to live no matter how much I hate it or am suffering itâ€™s all for my Mam so she gets to live. I darenâ€™t leave her she has gone through to much already. I hide everything I feel from them. I wait for my Mam to go to sleep before I cry and cut only my stomach so she never sees and I wrote my note in Japanese so should wouldnâ€™t know what it was if she found it. I dunno why I am telling you this itâ€™s only ever been to myself and I need it to be said to someone else. I am just sick of it and everything . You donâ€™t have to answer itâ€™s just to get off my chest and feel not so alone for one moment if I can.
