I hate pain but my suicidal thoughts are getting worseI know a forest near me, and Iâ€™ve started to daydream about hanging myself (well not really me since I have bdd). I know how much it hurts but I find that kind of death peaceful. In a calm, slow forest, hanging from a tree. My mind is wack. Too bad Iâ€™m going to a forest, and donâ€™t worry I donâ€™t has access to rope or anything. My parents control all my meds because Iâ€™m suicidal so of course theyâ€™ll think of rope.
