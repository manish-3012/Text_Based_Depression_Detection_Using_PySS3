I chose my date, time, and placePosted on my main account cause none of this matters anymore.

Ill be jumping off of an overpass into oncoming traffic in a month and a half. Marked it on my calender, scouted out the location and everything. I just need to videotape myself with my last words, and say goodbye to people i cared about.  I just wanted to let the world know this is happening. Im genuinely convinced this is something i have to do.

The root of the problem is me, i cause problems for other people. Therefore, if i remove myself from rhe equation, people will be happier. I dont want to stop anybody from being happy. The logic is flawless, and im confident in positive results, despite my absence to see those results.

that's all.
