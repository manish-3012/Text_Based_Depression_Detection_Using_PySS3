Just found out my ex is datingEven though when we broke up he said he needed to be single. Fuck. I had a feeling he would date her eventually. I hate feeling like this. Last week I had it all planned out but didn't have the guts to go through with it. And now this.. I know I have to end it. I don't wanna feel like this anymore
