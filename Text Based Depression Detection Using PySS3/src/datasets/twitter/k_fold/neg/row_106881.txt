Wanting to disappear into thin airI feel guilty about wanting to die but here it goes. 8 months ago I tried a psychedelic to help with my depression and since then I got something worse than depression: derealization. I become completely non functional since I cannot work, I cannot drive and I canâ€™t enjoy anything since nothing feels real. I feel like I am not a human anymore, I feel like I am not there, I donâ€™t feel sleepy or hungry anymore. I tried everything under the sun to fix this but depersonalization and derealization is still there. I am 25 and this is supposed to be the best years of my life, instead they have become the worst. I donâ€™t know if this feeling will ever pass and I just want to not exist anymore. I donâ€™t know when will I have the courage to pop the pills and have a peaceful death but I hope it is sometime soon.
