Is there any way to "soften the blow"I've attempted multiple times in the past month, and I know my next one will be it. I feel really bad because I know my family and grandparents will be heartbroken. To be honest my family is not helping, they think I'm doing it for attention, and they are constantly yelling at me. But I still feel guilty for leaving them like this. Is there any way to make it less bad? Thanks.
