I fucked up my lifeI fucked up my relationship with the love of my life. With the man I thought I'd grow old with.

I broke his trust because of my jealousy. 

I destroyed my family. 

He wants to leave me as soon as my covid test results are here and negative. 

I don't know what to do. I destroyed my life. 

I don't want to live anymore. 
I've already cut myself. 
I'm scared I'll end it when he's gone and I'm scared I won't. I don't want to continue.
