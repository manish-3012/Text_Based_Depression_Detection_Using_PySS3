What will probably happen after you die...Is you'll be sent to hell (aka similar life, but harder) where you will go through a bootcamp and get your ass peeled until you can't take it anymore. 

After you die, you'll be back into this same life you're in right now, but this time your desire to live will have increased, the same way a starving man enjoys poor food dozen times more than before, and will complete this life.

Once this life is finished, you'll be rewarded with a life you desire. Soul economics, but the currency is experience and challenges overcome. You may be reborn into any timeline, any body, do whatever you wish. 

Don't believe me and going to use 'scientific evidence' to deny this? Well, you know better than me that dead men speak no tales, so no evidence can ever be collected. If you believe in eternal darkness and 'luck' that gave dead things the ability to comprehend themselves, why does this sound more ridiculous to you?
