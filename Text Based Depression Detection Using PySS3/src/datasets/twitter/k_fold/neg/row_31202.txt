I'm considering suicide once again At 30 years old about to turn 31 I've simply have had enough. My best days are behind me and there's really nothing left to hope for.

No friends, no girlfriend, only family left is my mother and sister, no career or job prospects and being stuck in a job I don't like, alcohol abuse, no passion for anything. A guy like me can't hope to be happy. And what's the point of existing in a perpetual state of unhappiness?
