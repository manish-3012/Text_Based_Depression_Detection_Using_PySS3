I mean, what can I say?Grew up fostered. 3 homes. 2nd home had me raped on camera, locked in a kinnel for hours all to keep my brother and my "sister's" younger sister from. Experiencing the same thing. Adapted, acclimated and eventually graduated HS. Joined the Navy, married my HS sweetheart, divorced in 3 years, because I was gone all the time. 2 years later, Married again; for 7 years. Came home from a deployment found out wife had an affair with best friend . Gave her a 2nd chance was unluckily given another deployment 3 months later. Came home to find another affair with the same guy. Since then. After finding about multiple things like pregnancies and making my daughter call "him" "Daddy".  Since the affair, I've had 7 attempts. Been to the hospital 4 times and retired early from the Navy after 18 years of service. Right now, I'm at a strip club, trying to find ANY form of validation I can before I actually go and buy a gun. I became a resident of VA 3 days ago and can easily go to a pawn shop now and get one. I just don't see any reason to keep my retarded existence going on. Maybe in a next life, I can keep some semblance of humanity and know what the hell I'm doing.
