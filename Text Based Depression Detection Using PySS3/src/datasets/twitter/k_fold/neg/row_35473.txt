Why does my mind start getting worried when my suicidal thoughts are going away?If I had a way out I'd just end things and get going. But I'm sticking around for family and I know they'd be devastated if I end my life. 
After a couple of days of feeling very suicidal and unbearably depressed I'm starting to feel better. And I don't feel like ending my life right now, a part of my brain is seriously scared that I actually want to live. What even is this, does anyone know or have an answer?
