Never felt lower in my life
20 years old.  No skill.  No relationships.  No passions.  

I have to decide my major in a couple days and itâ€™s sad how uncertain I am with what I want to do with the rest of my life.  If I donâ€™t even seem to care now, then whatâ€™s gonna happen when I start studying and trying to get a job?

I tried to get into weight lifting, but itâ€™s just not going well for me.  I gained a shit ton of fat while trying to put on muscle and although my body has a better shape now, I donâ€™t feel any different than I did before.  I canâ€™t even squat due to groin pain 

Iâ€™m supposed to be doing ab work right now but I just canâ€™t convince myself that thereâ€™s a point to any of this 

Wish an accident would take me from this world
