I wish I had someoneI wish someone would just hold me while I sob. I wish someone would care. I just wish someone would notice. I hate when itâ€™s this bad and nobodyâ€™s here, nobodyâ€™s ever here. Itâ€™s always just me, alone, left to deal with all the loneliness and pain and sadness. I just wish someone were here.
