Mmm just some feelings i need to write downI am tired, really really tired, i am not sure if i have depression or it is just me faking everything.But i am not able to be â€œhappyâ€ ( or not being sad) for more than 3 hours in a long time. I used to be objective about suicide like â€œ i think being dead is much easier so it is a much more intelligent option to kill myself than to try livingâ€ .But now i just feel i canâ€™t do one more day,  and days passes and i am still alive, and for some moments i even forget why i am sad, and then everythings comes back and i just canâ€™t breath.It is really dificult everything, i am not even able to do simple tasks, and i think i might be developing some sort of ED . I am constantly fighting, with my parents (who i share a terrible relationship with but i am 15 so still live with them) , with the mirror, with school, with damn society, with memories.Specially memories as i have stopped talking to the most important persons in my life and now i really need them but i cant cause one was a boy which we were starting to share some feelings for each other but i got really scared and ghosted him , and the other is a sib which used to be a really close friend but them told me them loved me and well at once said that if i ever killed myself would kill also (what made me apart because...well it was toxic for them and is really better without me, now them is really better) .So as i was saying... i miss that two persons, really missing them. With the boy i still talk, he is coming back from his holidays in friday so i don t know if i will kill myself today or wait until then so i can hug him one last time (hugging him feels like heaven) . So... i am not really sure why i am writing this...just want to take it all out, but i hope you people are being able to better your lifes, donâ€™t give up sometimes things are dificult but maybe if you just smile a bit longer ;D haha wishitwouldbethateasy xd it is normal that i am going to be dead and i am still worried about exams?school sucks. Btw, GO VEGAN !ðŸŒ±
