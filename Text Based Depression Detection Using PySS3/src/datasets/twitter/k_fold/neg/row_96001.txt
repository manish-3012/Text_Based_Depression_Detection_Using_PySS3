Turns out I can't be happy.So, I've been a miserable fuck for as long as I can remember but I've always had hope that one day I'll get past the trauma of sexual assault and physical abuse from partners and one day be happy with myself and have a happy life.  Turns out I can't be happy.  I'm not fucked up because of what happened to me I'm fucked up because I have aspergers.  Maybe what happened to me made it worse but I'll never be able to experience happiness because I just can't.  Hope gone. Now I just don't see the point.  Before I thought that if I just kept going then things will get better but things can't get better.  I can continue trying to fit in, people will continue to find me entertaining and engaging, I'll continue to be witty and amusing and I'll continue not feeling anything.  Yay for me, the chameleon.  The end.
