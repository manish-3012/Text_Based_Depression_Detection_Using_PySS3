Suicidal After Intimate Times (You Know What I Mean...)Long story short, I have noticed over years, a habit. Either after orgasm in sexual activities with a partner, or with myself alone or not alone, I become severely depressed. 

I already have had depression since 7yo (22yo now) and have attempted suicide MANY times (it's more than you could imagine, trust me. I won't go into details). And I've begun to notice the depression really drops down into the depths of all hells after masturbation or sex or whatever. Any orgasm means havoc for me no matter how it's achieved.

I finally noticed this, as I am currently suicidal, still, after the fact that happened about 2 days ago that I done stuff with myself alone. I had to leave work today because I just couldn't keep my emotions straight.

Every time it happens, I become severely depressed and actively suicidal for days (yes, days, not hours) afterwards. You can imagine how low my libido is. Once I gone 9 months without even playing around with myself, let alone anyone else. I was still depressed but not this bad. After the 9 months and I did that for once with myself, instantly I went about trying to hang myself afterwards.. and cried for no reason for 7days.

The hell is going on here?
