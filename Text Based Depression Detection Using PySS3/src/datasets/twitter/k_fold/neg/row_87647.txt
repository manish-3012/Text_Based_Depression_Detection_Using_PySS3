Im just so tiredFinals week is over for me and Im pretty sure I failed almost all of my classes again. This will be the third time in a row that this has happen to me. I dont study, I dont do the work, I just sit on my ass all day watching TV and playing video games. My mom is going to be so upset with me and even my friends too.

I feel like the only way to get out doing this is to just end my life. I have a razor hidden in my room just in case I get too mad at myself. Ive convinced myself that I end my life a while ago. But when ever Ive held the razor to my wrist I cant bring myself to do it.

Instead I just want someone else to do, I want someone else to either cut me, shoot me, or even run me over in the streets. Im just so tired with myself.
And this is just the beginning of my problems, I have so many social issues that i have to work at. I hate the lazy pathetic person that Ive become
