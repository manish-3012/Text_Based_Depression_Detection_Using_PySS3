it seems okbut it's not. every fibre of my being is going through torture daily. My immediate surrounding makes me sad and depressed day in, day out. I don't have many friends. I don't know when I will make enough money to change my situation. I am trapped in this tiny room. Still. No one listens. No one cares. People around me are super selfish. Family, Friends have taken me for granted and left me hanging. I just need a fresh start on my personal life. I am way behind the curve and I'm not sure I'll make it out alive on my career end to see positive changes in my personal life (family and friend relationships) from my recent years of depression. I can't remember the last time I was content with life. I wish some friends would remember me and reach out as a genuine caring friend because I never had that type of family support. I try reaching out and still get blown off. I feel alone in this battle. Not suicidal, but just depressed at life. These are supposedly my best years and yet I am chained to my mother for life it seems. I don't have a life of my own. I just go with the motions. Only thing going for me is this job. I really hope it will be long term so I can finally get to move out on my own and start living a healthy, normal life.
