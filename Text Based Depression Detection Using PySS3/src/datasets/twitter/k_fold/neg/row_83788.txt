I need help, but I don't know how.I'm a 24 year old white man from suburbia. I've had suicidal thoughts just about every day since I was about 13. I have never really come close to actually following through on the thoughts, I never have had the balls to. And yet the thoughts sit there, in the night as I'm laying in bed, as I'm driving, as I'm working--sometimes my mind will just fall into the thoughts. I don't know how to shake them. I've never been to a therapist or to a psychologist or anything. I'm starting to think I should. I just don't know if I have the money for it, and I'm not even sure if my parents have mental health on their insurance. I don't want them to know I'm like this anyway. I can't imagine the shame I'll bring them.

And even if I get to the point where I know what to do to get help, it's going to end up with a phone call. I get severe anxiety over phone calls or anything that involves, you know, other people. It took me months to gather the courage to write this.

I just want to remember what it feels like to be happy. I don't remember what it feels like to be happy. What does it feel like to be happy?
