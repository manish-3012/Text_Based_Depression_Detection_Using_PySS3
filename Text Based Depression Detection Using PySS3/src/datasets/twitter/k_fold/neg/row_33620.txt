nobody knows mePlease help me. I'm so lonely that I can't fucking breathe. I can barely see. It hurts so much. I never let anyone know me and now I am absolutely alone. I'm young, pretty, everyone wants to fuck me but nobody wants to know me. Once my looks go nobody will want anything to do with me. I wanted to be an artist, but I'm not brave enough. I want to disappear. It's already starting.
