I'm going to leave in a couple of hours alsoI've reached out to everyone and no one gives a fuck about me. I'm just the girl that's always depressed and who throws a "pity party" for herself. There's no point in existing anymore. All my friends gave up and left. I met an amazing guy months ago who also gave up on me. I am just done with life and don't want to live it anymore. It's true that no one cares and everyone hates me now.

Peace.
