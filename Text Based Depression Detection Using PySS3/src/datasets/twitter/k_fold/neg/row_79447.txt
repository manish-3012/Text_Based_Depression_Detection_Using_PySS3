Will never give in and give up, going to face this bitch (life) out of spite.Going through an incredibly harsh period, my anxiety and phobias are trying to fuck me up completely, I came to the realization that it is good to make fun of whatever is trying to bring you down. I became an alchemist. 

It is all just a test, no matter how harsh it is, it will pass. If you are seeing this message dont give up!
