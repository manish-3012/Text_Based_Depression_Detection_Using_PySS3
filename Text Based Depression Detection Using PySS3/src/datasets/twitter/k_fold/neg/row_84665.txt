Threw away everything I had, now it's time to finish the job.I've been depressed for a long time. I don't have any family left, I can't afford to go back to college, I'm broke, can't find a job, and I threw away the only person to ever care about me. She's the love of my life, but for whatever reason, I guess it wasn't enough. I always swore I wasn't the cheating type, but I guess I didn't know myself as well as I thought. She says she wants to be with me. But now a new "friend" of hers is taking all her time. I guess it's only fair to get a taste of my own medicine. Maybe knowing that I hurt her will make this easier, like I have it coming. Anyway, I'm done for now, I guess I just needed to get this off my chest before I do it. Thanks for reading.
