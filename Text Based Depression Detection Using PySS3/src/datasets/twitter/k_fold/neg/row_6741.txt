Iâ€™m losing my gripMy parents gave me their old nice bmw and want me to sale my car but Iâ€™m too scared to drive it Iâ€™m scared to even touch it because I am spoiled and I donâ€™t deserve this. 

I feel so much pressure I donâ€™t want this. I literally just want to take some sleeping medicine in the car on and just sit there and die. 

Iâ€™m losing myself right now I canâ€™t picture anything good. I feel like a dead weight, please someone come into my work and put a bullet through my head because im just a disease. 

I hate myself...my extended family doesnâ€™t even love me. I obviously complain too much about nothing even significant why canâ€™t I appreciate anything!? Why am I so fucking afraid to accept anything I donâ€™t deserve to live. Fuck man I didnâ€™t think it would come to this again but Iâ€™m so fucking ungrateful seriously I want to rip my skin apart I feel so much damn pressure to show how grateful I am but I canâ€™t even do shit for anyone. 

I am a fucking failure. I am so fucking scared to live.
