About â€œit will get betterâ€.This is my view, from someone suicidal.

A lot of the time, probably most of the time for most people on here, it wonâ€™t just â€œget betterâ€. Even though we didnâ€™t cause of our problems (a lot of us), theyâ€™re ours to own now. And if we want our problems to be fixed, WE have to do it OURSELVES. We own the problems now. And it will probably be very, very hard to fix them. And it will hurt a lot more than I can put into words for a lot of us. 

But in the end, if we can do the work that needs to be done and go through the pain, we can fix/remedy our problems. We can make it out on the other side. A better side. 

And it can be more than worth the pain we have to go through to fix it. It will hurt, but sometimes that pain is more than worth it.

I wanted to address this. We all hear people say it â€œwill get betterâ€, as if we can just sit around and do nothing and it will get better by itself. Thatâ€™s not true for almost everyone.

For almost all of us, WE have to make it better. Or, if we just leave it alone, it will just get worse for many of us. 

Best to you.
