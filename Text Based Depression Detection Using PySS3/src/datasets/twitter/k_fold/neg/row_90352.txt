Vacation was great. Real life is trash tho.I just went on vacation, it was amazing. One day back into work and I want to kill myself again. The reality of my mediocrity crashed back into my face as I see no exit. Wake up, do trash job, get pushed around, feel like garbage.

I posted a nice picture of me and my wife during the trip. We were truly happy, I can't tell her. I can't. She will see me as this frail piece of shit and not as a man. Why is she even with me.
