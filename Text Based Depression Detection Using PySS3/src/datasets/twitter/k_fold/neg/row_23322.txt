I'm calm about this. Why am I calm about this?I am at work right now, at the front desk of a hotel. I'm being polite, amiable, sociable- just like I always am when I work. When the phone rings, my voice doesn't betray my current state of mind. When a guest checks in, my routine is flawless and friendly. If any of those guests were to ask me how I am doing I would smile at them and say, "I'm doing great, thank you for asking! How are you tonight?" And it would seem sincere. Not a single person here tonight would doubt me.

When my shift ends, I'm going to chat for a minute with the next shift and fill them in on how things went tonight. I will laugh and joke with them about how busy it was tonight and how they will be bored with no rooms left to check in. Then I will say goodnight and drive home. The only difference between today and any other day is that I have no intention of coming back tomorrow.
