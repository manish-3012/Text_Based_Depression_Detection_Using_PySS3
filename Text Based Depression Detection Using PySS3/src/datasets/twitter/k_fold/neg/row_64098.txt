I donâ€™t even know what to do.Trigger warning///self harm, attempted suicide, abuse.

New account btw because a friend is on my main and i donâ€™t want them knowing. I am diagnosed ADHD, anxiety, depression, bipolar, PTSD.

I (15m) have been in a deep depression lately. I relaped and cut myself again, i canâ€™t stop. I tried to kill myself last week, no one knows, just now i have had flashbacks and memorys from abuse both physically and mentally from my father. I have just tried to kill myself. I cut my self again and i tried to hang myself. It obviously didnâ€™t work. My father messed me up. One of the reasons why i hate myself is ADHD. I hate everything about it. It just makes life fucking hard. In class at school i cannot focus, i doodle, i get shouted at for not paying attention, i can literally get distracted by the noise of a pen touching paper and lose focus instantly because of it. I do take meds for everything. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I canâ€™t talk to anyone or open up to people because of anxiety, i canâ€™t call anyone because of anxiety.

I have been lying in my tears since the attempt 45 minutes ago.
