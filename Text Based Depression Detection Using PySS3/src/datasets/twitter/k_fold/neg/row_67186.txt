SelfishnessIs it really that selfish of me to want to die? 
Ironically, isn't it selfish of people to want me to live?

If I'm in so much pain, isn't it selfish to expect me to live on? 
Brand me a coward if I did proceed with the deed?

I know everyone's going through with something.
I'm so sorry it always has to be about me, me, me.
