Tonight might be the nightI've wanted to die for a longtime. I've never been diagnosed or treated. I've asked for help many times, I'm always dismissed or ignored. I lack the ability to fight for myself, or anything I believe in. 

Tonight I had a fight with someone who has both endlessly supported me, and also endlessly damaged me. I'm tired. So very tired. Tired of sad and hurt. Tired of try and fail. Tired of striving and longing and wishing and praying. Tired of never catching a break. Tired of always being alone. Tired of being dismissed and ignored and judged. I dont want to go on, i dont want to try, i dont believe that anyone actually cares. People care because I'm human, or because they should  care, or whatever... but no one truly cares about me for who i am. Suicide help lines are no help... they're just strangers who dont understand me telling me why life is a precious gift. They dont understand that its not true for everyone. Not everyone gets to be happy, or safe, or good. 

I've brought myself back from nothing, and for a while it was easy... i was doing better just by doing right... but now no matter how good i do i can never catch up with who i should have been. Who i'll never be. 

The thing that's been stopping me is my chosen method is burning charcoal in a confined space, and i didnt want to risk my cat getting hurt too.... but she's not here right now. She's safe, in a place where people will love her when i'm gone. My roommate is away for the summer. Its just me...and my charcoal. 

I feel better thinking that i dont need to worry about anything anymore. I'm past all that now. Just a few more hours, and when i go to bed tonight, i wont ever have to wake up again.
