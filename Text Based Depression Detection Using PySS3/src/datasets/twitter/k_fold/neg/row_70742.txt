I wish i could end it without sufferingFrankly, i just want to be dead. Life doesn't change whatever i do. The mental suffering doesn't stop. I don't like this world and how it is, and that will never change. I don't feel at place here. I can't be happy. Every day is a torture for me. I wish i could die accidently or naturally. Just go to sleep and never wake up again, or just get hit by a car and face instant death. Can i for once get what i want, please âœ‹. There is no point in staying alive, as i will never be happy. I have reached my limit. I know this post won't change a thing, neither will the comments, but i just needed to vent this out somewhere
