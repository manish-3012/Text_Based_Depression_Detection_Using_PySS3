NothingnessWell where do I begin, I canâ€™t feel anything anymore. Like itâ€™s just the same old thing wake up and get through the day. Itâ€™s hard to explain I just canâ€™t feel anything itâ€™s like I have no feelings. I have almost ODd twice, that was the only time I felt at peace with myself, it was like a big weight just lifted off of my chest. I want to feel that again. I have already written my last note. I made it clear that I donâ€™t want anyone to be sad when Iâ€™m gone. Idk when Iâ€™ll be gone but I get closer and closer every day. At random times Iâ€™ll just get a voice in my head telling me to do it, and after a while I started to believe them. I never imagined it would come to this. I know it just seems like Iâ€™m just bitching about problems but death is a relief itâ€™s like your soul being set free, I remember distinctly feeling nostalgic and euphoric. It was a beautiful feeling. When I woke up I felt cold, I couldnâ€™t tell if I was dead or what. Other things bother me like am I depressed? Hell it seems like everyone is depressed these days. Am I mentally ill? Is something wrong with me? Guess I donâ€™t even know. Guess this is both a blessing and a curse, I donâ€™t know when my time will come but just know I have traveled into a better place, DO NOT CRY FOR ME. 

I love you all
