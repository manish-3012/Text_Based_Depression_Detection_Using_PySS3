I'm going to do it on Friday.On Friday I'm going to take a shit ton of Soma and hope for the best (worst?).  My life has gone to shit and seeing my friends with happy lives is making me miserable.  I have made a ton of posts on here on different accounts and none have ever been answered, so maybe this one will.  I really just need to talk to someone who isn't just going to tell me that "things get better" because I'm sick of that shit.  No it won't.
