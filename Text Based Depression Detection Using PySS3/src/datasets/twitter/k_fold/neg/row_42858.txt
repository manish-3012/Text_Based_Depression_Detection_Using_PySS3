Not for the usual reasonsIt seems everyone here has a terrible life and shitload of reasons to kill themselves. Not me - I had pretty fine childhood, grew up ok, I'm doing great right now (25/M). Cool job, some money, relaxed lifestyle, bright future, a couple of friends although I enjoy being alone. I don't feel anyone hates me or doesn't care about me. I'm sure there's literally a billion people that would trade places with me in an instant. 

Still, I just want to die. I'm thinking of suicide almost every day for the last 10 years, I'm just tired of living and I'm not looking forward to anything. You'd say I have so much to live for, but I don't feel like that at all. I don't care about tomorrow or the day after that. Even all the great things just don't move me. It seems like I'm only observing and waiting for something to happen, even though stuff is happening all the time. I'm really just waiting for heart attack or lightning or car crash or cancer or whatever. Suicide seems too much of a hassle maybe, except if I had a chance to impulsively do something with fairly certain success. In a couple of months maybe.

Anyway, thanks for reading and I hope my story is a nice refreshment  in the sea of poor, lonely, abused, and otherwise broken souls that write here. I don't expect anything to get better, but hey, I already did something - this is my first time talking about it, even though it's complaining to internet strangers. Anyone feels the same and has any ideas?
