Going outMedication is not helping, no one to turn to, house to myself. The taste makes me nauseous so have been slowly drinking over the last twenty minutes two months of grounded medication, chest and arms feeling strange. I am writing this because I have been alone so long I want someone to know something about me before I go. I'm 18, my name is Rorry, I've had no friends since everyone found out I was a faggot, tried desperately to hang on to the one person I thought I could trust and was stabbed in the back, my dogs name is Benny, he deserves a good home.
