Making my planI've struggled with mental illness for nearly all my life, and every day just feels like a battle against my mind. I have OCD, which means that I can barely do anything or go anywhere without having intrusive thoughts, and I constantly have unwanted urges. I feel trapped by my own mind. I have tried therapy and medication, neither of which have helped.

I've had suicidal thoughts every day for the past year and a half, but I've forced myself to live, to keep seeking help, to keep trying. I feel trapped in an endless cycle, where one week things will feel bearable, only for the next week to be filled with constant pain and suicidal thoughts. I feel broken inside. I lost all happiness and motivation years ago. Over the years, I've become a complete recluse, spending all-day-every-day (except when I'm at school) locked inside my room listening to music or playing video games, which is the only situation in which I can feel okay, rather than feeling like utter shit.

My family expect me to live a happy, successful life. They are all happy and successful - my dad is a sales manager, and my aunt and uncle are scientists. I'm naturally very intelligent, and I would be following in their footsteps if it wasn't for my life being ruined by mental illness. My family also have a long life expectancy (my great-grandmother is 99 years old), but it looks like I'm breaking that trend too, since I'm not even legally an adult yet, and I don't finish school for another few months.

In three days time, just after my next payment comes through, I'm going to buy some supplies (I won't say what exactly, just in case it violates the "don't be explicit about methods" rule). I just want this all to stop, and to be honest I don't even see the point in trying anymore. The only thing that scares me is the possibility of somebody discovering my plan and subsequently being hospitalized, or unintentionally surviving the attempt but sustaining severe injuries.
