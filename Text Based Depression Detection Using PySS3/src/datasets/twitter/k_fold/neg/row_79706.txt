I regret being born. Rant.There's just honestly too much for me to talk about anymore. There's nothing left for me. No one notices when I'm not around, I've always been forgotten and replaced. No one seems to realize how much that fucks a person up.  I'm just so done being a last choice, and being unimportant to everyone. I wish I was never born. I hate having to deal with the horrible pain of being alive, and dealing with death, mine or my family's. The pain and pressure inside is too horrible. I want to have never existed. I just want to sleep forever. My life is such a fucking disaster, I'm such a burden. How did I even get on reddit, I don't even use it. Doctors won't be able to help. Nothing can help. Nothing changes. I fucking hate myself, I need to die. I must have been a really shitty person in my last life to deserve this in this life. If I was somehow able to be gone, of course my parents would be sad, but at least my school debt would be alleviated for dad. Then no one else would care. They'd do the whole, "Oh she was such a sweet kind quiet girl, what a shame, we never knew." God, that would fucking piss me off. Why does no one give a shit about me now? Why doesn't anyone like me? What did I do? I'm just an observer, always have been. No one fucking cares. I hate being alive. No one really fucking cares about me. Why can't you just accept me? There's no respite in this life. Just the same boring pain of life day after day nothing changes nothing new the same routine the same pain nothing changing I'll never be happy
