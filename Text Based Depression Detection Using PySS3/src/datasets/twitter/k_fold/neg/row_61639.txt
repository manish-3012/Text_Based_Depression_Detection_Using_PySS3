Do you know your purpose?Sorry for the long read. I'll give my background and go in depth. 

I am 23m, just graduated from college and have a decent paying job which I don't mind working at but hate some people. Having the thought of working just gives me anxiety and when I'm there I usually have panic attacks. My heart sinks which makes me almost cry at work. I have had a co-worker who is just an absolute asshole made me cry on the job while I was working on the field with him. I make good money out of this which is why I'm still sticking around. I worked my ass off to get to where I was and didn't get the job I wanted but still got this one.

I wake up everyday and go to this job from 7-4:30 and go home at 6. Eat, browse internet for a while and then sleep. Then Repeat this the next day. I do not have any feelings towards anything. I don't like going out, I don't have any friends. I have listened to my parents for my whole life to what to do even when they haven't told me to but I do it anyways so they can be happy. I have lost some friends because of listening to my parents. Is it because I'm trying to impress them or live how they want me to live? Who knows.

In the near future I can see my parents trying to get me to marry some girl and I cannot imagine being responsible for someone else. I hate the thought of it in my head. I don't even want to be with anyone. I like to live alone, but they want all to be together which I hate. I don't know what my purpose is in life, no goals, no nothing. 

Im waiting for something big to happen so I can off myself. I have collected some money for my family which I'll leave behind. I don't want to do this where everyone lives and the property values goes to shit too (idk why I'm like this).

Hopefully this day will come soon. Peace.
