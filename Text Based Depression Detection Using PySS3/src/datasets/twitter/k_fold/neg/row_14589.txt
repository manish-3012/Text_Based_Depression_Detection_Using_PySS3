i dont want a fucking thing.i dont want friend. i dont want family. sll i want to do is complain to no one and have no one give a shit because i dont deserve anyone. to make people feel bad and worry and care about me is painful qnd i dont want them to care and i hate them for caring even when i say im grateful because thats what a good person does

im not even trying. im a piece of trash. im not grateful for gifts and being in a 1st world country with air conditioning, a warm bed, electronics, not having to worry about being human trafficked or put into child marriage or being beaten or yelled at. im abusive. iâ€™m a poison. this dog hasnâ€™t done snything for 3 years because of me. never took him outside. his first years of his life are wasted because of me. and im too busy complaining to do anything about it when hes suffering and my family is suffering and so many humans and other animals are suffering every day but what is the goddamn point

i wish i could feed the starving. give money to the poor. save victims from being murdered or r*ped. free people in cages. destroy isis and the cartels. free north koreans. expose the governments. save everyone. 

so many bad things happen everyday to so many people and they die or suffer alone and no one helps them and no one cares even though they should. why dont they. why the fuck dont they? 

im not owed anything. stop telling me i am. im not a victim and i never was. you dont see how bad i am. i wish you would.
