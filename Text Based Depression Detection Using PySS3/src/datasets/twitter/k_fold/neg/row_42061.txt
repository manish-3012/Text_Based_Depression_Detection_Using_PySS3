My nameI think I'm overdue for death. I'm one of those people who aren't worth the time of anyone around them. I wouldn't want to bother them anyways. My life is a complete failure. I've failed college once and almost got fired from my job for being too stupid. The only reason I'm still allowed there is because my family knows my boss. I don't want them to keep me for that reason. I see myself succeeding in the circus. I could be one of those animals locked in a cage and have stuff thrown at me and get laughed at because in reality, it's what I deserve. I'm not human anyways.

Why should I continue on knowing I don't have a future ahead of me? I've been this way for so long and I don't see me ever getting better. Even the kindness of strangers doesn't help at all. I have so many options of how to end it that I get anxious just thinking about it. 

Me leaving would make everyone's lives much easier in this case. I have done nothing but ruin everyone else's. I'm not worth this life and I don't even know why I was brought up in the first place. The past 19 years have been hell for my entire family, and I don't want them to suffer any longer seeing that I don't provide anything. I am too stupid to study what I want because of such horrible anxiety which causes me to not be able to focus. 

I've tried to get rid of this pain by inflicting some damage on myself, but even that does nothing. I don't see it going away unless I get rid of something else that is far more big than I could imagine. It's a shame I have no idea where to get a weapon because I'd definitely love to use one for it.

I'm not worth existing anymore and I need to die.
