I wish I could just do itI've been planning how to do it since I was 8 years old. The one thing that stopped me was the thought of my baby sister. Now she's grown up I know she would be able to come to terms with it one day. I love my family and I know the hurt it would cause them, but I know they'd realise I did what I needed to for me.

I just want to be brave. Brave enough to do it and just let the life drain out. I just wish I had my old dog with me or someone to hold my hand and me as I lose consciousness. I want that so badly, I want someone to hold my hand and understand that I was never meant for this world.
