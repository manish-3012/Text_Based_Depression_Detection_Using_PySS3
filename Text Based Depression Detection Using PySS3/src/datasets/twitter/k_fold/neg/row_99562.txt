A connectionIf I were to tell you who I am I would say that I am a simple man living his simple moments. There is my dog, my antique music, my rare writing, my stubborn thoughts, my cup of coffee and my games. But if I were to tell you what I think I would tell you that life is a collection of little things each lived at a time. That each day should be spent finding beauty the adult eye has trouble to see. That each day that you get to find that refreshing thought or inspiring feeling cannot be bettered. That those little things held strong to heart, and luckily shared, can not be traded. I think most misplace love and simply don't get it. An old man best said it, 'We don't love to those who give us. We give to those who we love.' I have a dream that one day I'll be sitting on my bench next to a lake with my hand resting on her knee. Her who I haven't met. It's just a thought, but this dream gives me hope. It reminds me of what it is like to put your heart on the line and remembering what really matters. It make me remember that is life little mischief of putting a name to things. I don't know if this post will lead to a welcoming and unexpected change or if it'll bring me nothing in return. But I know that I have to try to keep that dream alive. I don't know you and you don't know me. If you do respond, I hope that despite our differences we can believe in each other for them. I hope that each moment spend together can remind us that life shouldn't be taken for granted. I hope that regardless of how many struggles may come we are strong in each to not let go. I hope that every day spent together can remind us what love is. And I hope that in the good days, just like that dream, we can fall in love again as if we haven't done so a thousand times before.

Edit: I am aware this is not the right place to post such thing. If I do is out of hope alone. I've struggled with mental health for over a decade now and have attempted against my life multiple times. What I thought I had beaten is back and I don't have an answer on how or why to fight. All that I know that it is wrong to give up. All that I know is that I seek to find that meaning again and if this the way to understand with a blunt heart, I am not against it.
