I've been having these strange thoughts.Lately I keep having these thoughts asking myself like "Why am I here?", "Is this real?" and "What makes me different from everyone else?". I've been having thoughts about death as well. I don't even really see a future for myself. These questions that I'm asking myself are keeping me up at night. I feel depressed as well. I just want to get rid of these thoughts that I'm always asking myself. I was suicidal about 2 years ago and I don't want to go back to that. I just don't know how to stop these thoughts.
