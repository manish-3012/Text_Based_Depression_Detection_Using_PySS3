I am on a list of psychoactive medications and I still want to kill myself.Carbamazepine is the mood stabiliser, Olanzapine is the antipsychotic, amitriptyline is the antidepressant. Yet, I still want to kill myself. I thought the medications would get rid of my suicidal tendencies. Now when the doctor asks me how the suicidal ideation is, I feel the need to tell him i'm fine otherwise what else is he going to do. Admit me in a psych ward- no fucking thank you. He could try electroshock therapy and make me a living vegetable. I would rather die.
