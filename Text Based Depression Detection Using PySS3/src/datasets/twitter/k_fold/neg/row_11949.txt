99% sure I'm going to die tomorrowI'm 24

I'm really really close. 

I've lost 99% of my hope that I will get better/ not be a constant failure. I feel like a burden on my amazing friends, mediocre acquaintances, and family because I fail so often. 

I wrote a longer note explaining my work/ financial situation which has contributed to my issues mentally. 

My last note to most people I know will be "I'm sorry. I have no other choice. It's not your fault. Thank you so much."

I'm 99% sure that I'm a lost cause. 

I just needed to vent this somewhere.
