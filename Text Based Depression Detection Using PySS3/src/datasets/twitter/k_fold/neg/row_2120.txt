How long does it take to get over a "loved one" killing themselves?I really want to end it. I don't see the purpose of most of the things people want out of life. I'm depressed, I'm unattractive, and I hate where I live. I just...I don't see why I can't kill myself. Its my body, my life. But everyone always says "think of your family." They don't think of me, why should I keep living miserable day after miserable day just so they're not sad? I guess my real question is, have any of you known someone who killed themselves? Did you get over it? The only thing that's ever brought me joy in life is bringing joy to others, I can't stand the thought that I may ruin someones life...but if its not going to ruin anyones life I'd just like to be done...I'm tired. I just want to sleep.
