Nslkjejejejeuejrjehbssbsbi am so tired i cant do this anymore. My family hates me because of the way i act and they dont want to listen i keep telling them i am in pain nobody listens to me they only make it worse i dont have a job right now i cant move out my dad paid the first year of uni but i blew it Nd now i have to pay for my own education if i want to continue i have no friends to turn to in this country i have no support system nobody that cares i have been holding it in for so long u am severely depressed and i dont frel well at all right now but everyone keeps blaming me maybe i am to blame but i keep refusing to believe that but maybe i should i dont know what to do i dont know what to do where to turn i want to just leave and never see anyone i know ever again i want to be free but im chained to this toxicity. I ahve no one and i want to kill myself. I have been seriously considering it for a while now. I dont need support i need a concrete way to deal with my problems but no one is giving me advice theyre just shaming me but what they dont get is the effort it takes to get out of bed to shower to talk to eat etc just the most basic of tbings and i have no money for therapy. There is no way out
