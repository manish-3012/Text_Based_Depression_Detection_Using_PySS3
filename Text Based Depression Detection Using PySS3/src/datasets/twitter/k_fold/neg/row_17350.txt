I checked myself into the hospitalBackground story: Iâ€™ve had seizures since I was 16, and almost daily panic attacks for the last year, some mild and some severe. I also struggle with anxiety and PTSD. No medicine has been able to control it, and higher dosages have only made them worse. Iâ€™ve prayed to die in my sleep many times.

Two days ago I had two panic attacks and a seizure. By the end of the second one, I was sobbing uncontrollably. I was hopeless and wanted to OD, but I didnâ€™t want to hurt my family so I asked to be dropped off at the hospital. Iâ€™ve had these thoughts for the last few months, which have only gotten worse with time.

The staff mainly focused on the medical standpoint, giving me explanations as to how my medications can cause these suicidal thoughts. I spoke with 4 doctors, 3 nurses, and a social worker. I felt like my emotional distress meant nothing. They decided that I didnâ€™t need to be transferred elsewhere to deal with my suicidal thoughts.

They kept me overnight, giving me medicine just to calm me down and prevent risking another seizure. In the morning they decided I needed to further increase my medicine, and explained how medicines are trial and error. I was discharged yesterday afternoon.

Just because my medications could possibly be a reasoning for my mood, doesnâ€™t mean that itâ€™s okay for me to experience them. I felt like I wasnâ€™t being heard. I came home and cried. I still have those thoughts. It feels unfair.
