tried to end it all tonight...didn't work, obviouslyI took about 15 extra strength diphenhydramine pills and laid down to go to sleep and never wake up. I woke up 3 hours later with a splitting headache and puking up stomach acid. Plus I've been hallucinating. 

I wish I didn't wan to try again tomorrow
