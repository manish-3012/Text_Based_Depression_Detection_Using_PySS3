Complete and Utter ApathyHey there Reddit.

I'm a teenage girl who's just started university this September. The past year has been very rough on me - I've recently had to testify against a very close family member with regards to past sexual abuse against me. It's really shaken my immediate family up, forever. Guilt and PTSD make it very difficult to move past.
To add to that, I've been dealing with the issue of my homosexuality and the negativity it's brought me regarding my family.

The past year, what really pulled me through was my psychologist and my close friends. I was not attending school at all that year (graduated high school and took a year off inbetween) and instead worked fulltime to save up for this year. Unfortunately, having recently moved to a city pretty far away for school, I've had to leave that all behind. I'm living off campus with one very close friend.
With my predicament I've simply lost myself to apathy. I don't feel as close to my classmates due to living OC and since I still don't know what I want to do in life I feel detached from my schoolwork. The psychologists here at the school just can't seem to connect to me as well as my old one (though I have tried very hard to find one).

I just feel like I don't care about myself anymore. I have maybe two friends here, no family, and I feel like I'd be burdening my roommate to constantly seek her out for help. Apathy, and depression. I spend a lot of time sleeping when I should be in class, and feel like I don't care - nothing brings me passion.

I'm so tired of having to go to court and deal with things, and have so little interest in living currently. I've been told things will get better, but with no interest and no direction I have no goal to pursue.
