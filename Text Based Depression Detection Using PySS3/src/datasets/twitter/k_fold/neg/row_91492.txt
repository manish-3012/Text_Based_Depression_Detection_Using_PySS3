Iâ€™ve been so okay and Iâ€™m falling apart again.I had both my second and third panic attack in consecutive days now. (First one was around August last year). What the actual fuck. Why canâ€™t I be okay for long? 
I like to think of myself as a good person, I deserve enough good things but why do I always come back to wanting to die. Iâ€™m so tired.  Iâ€™m doing good things with my life but thereâ€™s always going to be that burden of responsibility of keeping up with everything and I just want to go away, man. 
Iâ€™m going to my first therapy session on Wednesday and Iâ€™d rather die before Saturday even comes.
