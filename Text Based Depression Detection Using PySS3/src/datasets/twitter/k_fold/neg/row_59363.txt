Too tired to fight anymoreI'm 29 years old and have had severe depression since I was 12. It runs in my mom's family, most of whom have killed themselves. I've done therapy. I've been on every antidepressant. I've tried ECT. I've tried TMS. I get my testosterone replaced. I've been through every treatment except ketamine, which I can't even begin to afford. I'm feeling like I've run out of options. I've tried a lot of other drugs to feel. Cocaine didn't bring me up. I tried mushrooms, no effect (because I'm on ssris). The only times I have not been depressed was when I took gratuitous amounts of acid, but would spend the day or two after feeling horribly depressed. Marijuana  helps bring me back from the edge most nights, but it takes a lot to get me neutral and I have to consume a lot to stay there.  I think of killing myself every day. Lately I've been focusing on it more. Holding my guns and just feeling the texture, the metal. Wanting to end it but pulling back in guilt of how it'd make my mom and bf feel. I'm exhausted with life. I don't have any more hope that this will change someday because I feel like I've tried everything
