What are the benefits of shooting through the chin or through the mouth rather than simply the side of the head in suicide with gun?*I have no idea where to post this. Got removed on r/nostupidquestions. (How ironic.)*

So: If one wants to commit suicide with a gun in a movie, they put it in their mouth or to the chin? Why? If you want a painless death you would want to have a "quicker route" the bullet would have to take, thus minimizing the things penetreted. Is it because the tissues and the skull surrounding the brain is harder on the side and would stop the bullet or reduce its speed or is it somehow more painful? Is it less effective?
