Everything is ok.I skipped all 3 of my classes today. But that's ok. I'll just catch up later this week, hopefully. I couldn't focus today, couldn't focus last week, but it'll be different later this week. There's no way this'll be the 5th semester in a row I have to drop a class and get a 2.0. No way. My parents aren't wasting $1000's. Im not graduating in 4 years, 5 is fine. More than that is fine too as long as I do it. I'm gonna change.

I've been looking at my phone a lot. Kinda hoping a message would pop up every once in a while. Or maybe I had someone to spark a conversation with. That's ok though. Once I fix myself, people will flock to me.

Can't look at girls. I'm not attractive, history says. But that's ok. My parents will get over it. They've had to deal with a lot, this isn't much more. I know I'm over it. I'm just meant to be alone.

Don't really have any hobbies or talents. But I'm gonna start writing this Friday. This Friday for sure. This is the one. And running. I'm gonna start running. And this is really the last time I'm gonna eat fast food. I'm gonna be better.

I'm not the same person. I'm changing. I don't need to have those thoughts anymore.
