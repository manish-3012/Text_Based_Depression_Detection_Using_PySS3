Guess i should just give up on being happy everNot sure if this entierly belongs here, since im not actively suicidal i guess, but still feel like shit and im not sure where else to put this. 

Ive tried everything i can think of. Ive gotten a job. A pet. Hung out with friends regularly. Made sure i had all my vitamins. Went on anti depressants. But none of this really made me feel... good. Fleeting moments sure i felt kinda happy. But 90% of the time i just feel dead inside. Not even sad just emotionless. Everyday i just spend time finding something to make the clock move faster so i can sleep again, and then wake up and do nothing all over again. Its not like i haven't tried. Even tried transitioning when i thought i was some tranny or something. But still... nothing. Just dead inside. I think im just going to give up on ever being happy. Its just not for me in this life.
