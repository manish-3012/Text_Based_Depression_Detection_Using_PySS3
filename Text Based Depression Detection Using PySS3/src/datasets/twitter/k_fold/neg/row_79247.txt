well fuckmy parents interrupted my suicide attempt, told me they don't care anymore if i commit suicide or not, my best friend told me "i don't want to live in a world where there's no you" so i literally feel like i'm being held hostage on this earth because i love her so much, and then i put on B99, a show i never thought would make me feel better but does, shockingly. i still want to end my life more than anything, but i feel like if i just dissociate and ignore the terrible situation i'm in right now by watching TV, it'll all just go away until i finally crack and slit my throat. yeehaw.
