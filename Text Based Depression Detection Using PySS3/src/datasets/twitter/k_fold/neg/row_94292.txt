"you don't want to die, you just want relief right now"I don't,,, really know if that's true. I get angrier and angrier the older I get, but I don't want to be like my father or my boyfriend. So I turn it inwards. I hurt myself. For the past few years I get this intrusive thought, this image, of slitting my throat. I see myself do it over and over again and yet the only thing I slit are my thighs, so no one sees. But I deserve to die. I am worthless. No, I have a negative net value. I am a burden. To my family. My friends. Society. I don't want relief. I want to hurt myself. I want to hurt them. I want my family and my friends to feel how I feel, to know how I feel, just for a second, and then they'll go about their lives as usual. And I won't be here anymore. It's as easy as that.
