I don't even know anymoreI just feel internally lonely, I tried to be happy for a week, it was good when it happened, now I'm back to my suicidal self again. I just want to end it because I lost all of my old friends for being too awkward, and I've done some really stupid things this summer. I've wasted my life... I just want to end it... This is going to be buried though, I really want it to be..
