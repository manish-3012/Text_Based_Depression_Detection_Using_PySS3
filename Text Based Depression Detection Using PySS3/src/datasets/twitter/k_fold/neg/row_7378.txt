I donâ€™t even know what to title this.I donâ€™t feel good. Frankly. I feel like itâ€™s just a cycle. Like yea, itâ€™ll get better, but then weâ€™ll be here again... and who wants THAT?

My anxiety is up and all I feel is DREAD. Itâ€™s not going away. I talk about it a little bit with some friends but then I laugh it off because Iâ€™m not â€œthe typeâ€ thatâ€™s depressed or suicidal. So I have to switch back to that â€œhappy go lucky girl!â€ but Im faaaaarrrr from that rn. 

I canâ€™t be alone - idk how to handle - I am afraid of being alone and right now it just very much feels like I am and I am trying to cope with that. 

I have switched my TV from app to app trying to put a show to distract me but not finding anything frustrated me more and I cried hard on my cat. He got scared and left. 

If I die I know people would care.. but yet when I try to talk about it, they donâ€™t understand. Iâ€™ve tried talking to some of my best friends and like I said... it just feels like they donâ€™t understand. Like we speak a different language or something? As if the words HI I WANT TO DIE are something they canâ€™t process the same. 

My bf got mad at me because he says I lack common curtesy â€œfor someone trying to make you feel betterâ€ when I told him he doesnâ€™t get me. But he doesnâ€™t get me lol. He isnâ€™t here over the edge like me...guess I wish I could share screenshots of how that convo went but in no way was I being rude trying to explain my problem. 

I just feel like Iâ€™ll always be depressed no matter what I do... what I try... where I go... live... work... itâ€™s a cycle. And I always end up here.. alone.. afraid.. in so much emotional pain that dying is the only way for it to feel like itâ€™ll go away.
