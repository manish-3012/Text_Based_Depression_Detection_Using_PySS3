Life just wont help me do it.Fuck this.


I've been clinically depressed since I was a kid, I was abused pretty much my entire childhood. I tried to OD on my medicine but that just made me drowsy and kinda sick.

So, in the car, I said, hey, I'm drowsy AF. I don't give a fuck. I had to make a left turn to where I was going, so I said fuck it. I picked out a big escalade going 60 and pulled out in front. I should have been T-Boned. Easy instant death right?

Nope. That fucker was paying attention. Stopped like 2 inches away from my car.

Fuck this shit. Life fucks me in literally everything I do, it makes shit as hard as possible, even suicide. Medicine, nor pulling out in front of a speeding car...neither worked.
