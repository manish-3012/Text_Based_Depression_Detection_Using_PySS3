These are the thoughts I deal with dailyI am angry and if people blame me for anything, yell at me, talk down to me, treat me like I'm inferior to them, abandon me, neglect me, or treat me like my feelings don't matter then there are going to be some pretty big issues between me and them and things are gonna get dark real fast. Screw everything. I've been having a lot of dark thoughts for a while now because of the way people want to treat me. I'm very angry.
