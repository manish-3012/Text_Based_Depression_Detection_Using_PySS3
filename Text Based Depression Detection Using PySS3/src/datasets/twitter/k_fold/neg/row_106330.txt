Iâ€™m 17. I became deaf in my right ear when I was 13, now itâ€™s happening to my left ear.I canâ€™t keep up with conversations anymore and people just ignore me when I say I canâ€™t hear. I donâ€™t know what to do. Everyone I care about gets too frustrated with my hearing to talk to me. I feel so lonely. Things only seem to get worse...
