Something I wrote during my hard time...It was another night


It was another episode


The burdens I had in my mind


Even my thoughts couldnâ€™t control


It was the same tub 


The songs were the same


I just felt so numb 


While I acted sane 


The water was hot 


Yet the chills made it cold


I had a razor on my right


About which I felt bold


Everything felt depressed


While nothing could be expressed 


The razor went deep 


And so did the blood 


The water turned cold


While I witnessed a flood


The water turned red


And so did my face 


The walls turned darker


On which laid an apology 


Written with a marker


I carried no regrets 


And so do I now 


As I woke up in the hospital


Witnessing my life frown

(PS. Iâ€™m glad nothing really worked out back then... Iâ€™m still going through shit but Iâ€™m fighting to live another day,

If youâ€™re ever going through shit and need someone to just vomit it all on, Iâ€™m right here fam :) take care redditors, we got this!
