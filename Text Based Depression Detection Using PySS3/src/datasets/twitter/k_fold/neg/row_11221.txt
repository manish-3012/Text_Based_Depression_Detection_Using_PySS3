Why do we bother?Seriously, I'm so fucking lost these days.
My ex left me so she could hoe around without judgement. I'm socially awkward around women, I think I have very little empathy and that makes conversations fmso hard. 
I'm a Bartender who hates customers.
I want to change industries to make some real money, but did fuck all in high-school so I have 0 other experience. I've done 2 uni degrees in business management but Hbe never worked a desk job in my life, so walking into a management job is impossible.
I have no idea where to start looking for answers. I just spend my days dragging my ass to a job I hate with no hope to get into another job. I get home and consume various media's until I fall asleep. I can't stop myself from ordering uber eats every day because I don't know how to cook anything, and I never tried anything new as a kid so I'm a very picky eater.
This is just the tip of my probem-iceburg.
Please someone help me find a reason to live. I've found myself looking for the most painless ways to die, and I know that I should want to live  it fuck me I can't see a way towards happiness anymore.
