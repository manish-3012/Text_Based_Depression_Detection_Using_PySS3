Thanks on behalf of all of usThere a these people on reddit, lifechangers, life savers. They dont have to- they could live a normal life but they try so so so hard. I dont think i give enough thanks for what you redditors have done for me! You pivked me back up and gave me a purpose! Most of all thank you Mohammed Abdelaziz- thank you buddy i cant ever give enough to makr up for the shit ive put you through- mate you didnt have to be there- you didnt have to asl how im feeling - you didnt have to stay by my side when i was having panic attacks- you didnt have to take precautions when i wanted ti end it all - you didnt. Yet you did. You were there Mohammed, understanding, even though having no experiences of it- you were there helping me and comforting me. Youve never left my side Mohammed and ill never leave yours. Mohammed your an absolute legend! I could never say this to you in person so i did it on reddit. I dont think youll ever read this Mohammed but hey.
Thanks to you all redditors as well- you dont know my name- you have no obligation to care about me- and yet you do! I cant repay any of you for the wonders that youve given me
