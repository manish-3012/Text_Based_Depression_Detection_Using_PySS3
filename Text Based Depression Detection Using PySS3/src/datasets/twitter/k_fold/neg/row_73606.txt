I just wish I werenâ€™t so aloneI just wish I had an outlet but at the same time I donâ€™t want to unload on all my friends because I know they have their own problems. Canâ€™t talk to my parents either. My dad thinks people with narcolepsy are demon-possessed. Hates LGBT. Momâ€™s a bit more open-minded/exposed but she only cares about my grades.

Iâ€™m so tired of having to process everything by myself in my diary. So tired of it. I have to be the one that comforts myself. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of it. Iâ€™m run down. I have barely any energy to process my feelings. My friendships are wavering.

Iâ€™m glad my friends arenâ€™t that judgmental. I wouldnâ€™t want to bother them with my rants, but somehow Iâ€™m just glad that they donâ€™t seem to hate me for not really talking as much. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t like them or anything. Iâ€™ve just got no energy even for myself, much less other people. Although I havenâ€™t told them anything about my mental state, I think they can sense that Iâ€™m not really doing well? I mean, I did tell them I was worried that I might be failing this school year, and they seemed very perceptive and understanding about it.

I just *need* to not write in my diary right now. Like I said before Iâ€™m so done being alone, and I feel like going to my diary is just a signifier to me that I have nobody. *Nobody to talk to.* Iâ€™m so done carrying everything by myself.
