I'm pretty sure the only reason I'm still alive is because of death anxietyI don't see the point in trying anymore when inevitably I'm going to die anyway, it's just a matter of where and when and how. Even if I managed to form better relationships with people, what is the point? I'll die, they'll die, they'll leave, or one of us ends up hurting the other. What is the point of dragging out all of this misery? What is the point of trying when most of it is out of my control and I'm just getting older and accumulating even more problems and there's no way around the fact that I will eventually die?

Actually going through with it is becoming more tangible. Everyone lies when they say it gets better when you get older. It's only been getting so much worse. My problem is following through with a plan because I'm afraid of it both failing and succeeeding because no one truly knows what happens when you cross over? What if there's a God that will get mad at me?
