Iâ€™m just sadI feel like the way the education system is set up here is so depressing and toxic. When you work hard and your sad sad B+ average gets treated like you just never mastered any concept in your life. All to get a degree and a job just so u can live comfortably. I donâ€™t want to do any of this. I hate having to kiss ass just to have an opportunity I hate all this shit! I love the way sleep feels like not existing to Me. I donâ€™t wana die but I am not enjoying any thing abt living at this point
