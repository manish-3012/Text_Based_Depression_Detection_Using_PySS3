every day is harder and harder, i feel lost and disgustingmy depression ruined me, i was so happy and outgoing and popular but at some point i broke and i dont know why or how and i lost all my friends and my family doesnt know anything and im failing school and my boyfriend is long distance and cant help and sleeping forever is becoming more and more appealing

when i feel too strongly i get carried away and become toxic, that never used to happen before, why am i so volatile and horrible? who am i so set out to torture? myself? why? i just want it all to stop
