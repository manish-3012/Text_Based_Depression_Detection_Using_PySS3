My life is truly shittyI don't have a single friend (neither online nor physical), thus I do not make any human interaction except ordering my food and saying thanks you too lol....and even though I'm not stupid, I failed all of my classes because of procrastination and anxiety. Now my life will get even worse because I'll have to go back to my shitty country where i'll live like a prisoner. Even without friends or academic success, I feel happy in the bald eagle country because I have freedom and there are more things to see and do. Til the age of 18, I thought I was a normal, smart kid with bright future but I now realize that I am socially inept, boring, slow and sad person who isn't exceptional in any way and keeps letting down my parents, seriously I just wasted my parents' effort of sending me to college in america when my family is already extremely poor I wasted so much of their hard earned money. I honestly just want to disappear and erase everyone else's memory of me. In the end I am just one of society's robots (in fact a defective robot who's failing to function) and my existence doesn't have any impact on this world like I'll never be like Newton or Mozart or Elon Musk that left legacy in history and actually positively influenced human kind.... I guess my life is a punishment for whatever I did in my previous life :((((((((((( I don wanna live :'(
now my only joy is eating and internet I don't do anything productive that improves myself as a person..  I even gained back the 7 kg that I lost. As you can see my writing ability is like a mentally challenged person's but I am not autistic or anything related to disabled :(
