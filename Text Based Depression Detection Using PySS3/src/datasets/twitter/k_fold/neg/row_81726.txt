Uncontrollable thoughtsDue to my social akwardness, social axiety, and depression, I ruined my chances with this cute girl that I was friends with before (by texting and now im blocked) and I've been feeling nothing but shit all day even though I try to forget it but my brain reminds me "hey remember that thing that you did to creep out that girl you liked and if you responded normally like any human would have you could have been in a relationship with her" just gets me depressed. So much so that i lost all motivation to do anything (not even play on the computer) and just stare at a wall remining me of my mistakes. I also stopped eating I feel my body wasting away and the anxiety attacks are really getting to me making me feel worthless and powerless. All this shit over some person that couldnt care less about me. Im a fucking mess
