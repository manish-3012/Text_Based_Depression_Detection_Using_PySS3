I don't know where else to turn right now. At rock bottom and was pretty close to killing myself. Then I read Will Wheaton's article and now I want to work towards living and not just existing. Problem is, I don't know where to start because I have nothing.No family, no close friends. I don't have anyone I can talk to or lean on for help. I want to get better, but I don't know how. I am turning 30 this year and am barely surviving. I can barely afford rent. I got laid off from a steady corporate job last year, which gave me severe anxiety and depression so I wasn't that upset about being let go (I've been prone to it regardless of the job, but it certainly didn't help to work there for 3 years). Since then I have been working on my own business, which barely gets me by. The thought of having to go back to a job in my field again makes me want to end it all. I genuinely don't want to go back to what I've been doing the last 7 years. 

I want to talk to a professional and get help with my depression and anxiety. I want to go back to the gym again. I want to be able have a steady job again in a field I can tolerate. I can't do any of these without money first. 

I sort of just spurted out things off the top of my head and didn't proofready - sorry in advance. Throwaway for obvious reasons.
