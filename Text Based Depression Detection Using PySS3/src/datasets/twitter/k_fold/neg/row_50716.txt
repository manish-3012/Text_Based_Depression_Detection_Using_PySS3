Making a Plan.Recently I have gotten into another fight with my parents. After that, I felt really stressed and was just in pure emotional pain. I looked into a lot of suicide methods just to figure out which one would cause the least pain. I didn't find anything I could do. But then had an idea of combining all of the methods I can do. I was going to steal some of my father's alcohol and take all of my meds with it. Then slit my wrists. The alcohol and meds should make it so I feel almost nothing. I know this is filled with assumptions but my whole family is gone for up to 12 hours a day. If I do this as soon as they leave I don't think I can be saved. I don't think ill make a note. I think it would hurt them more if I didn't explain myself. As for my friends, they might be hurt but I don't think they won't expect it. I've told them how I feel and they don't really understand since all of their parents aren't like mine. They don't yell at their kids when they do bad. They don't punish them for every slip up they make. They don't try to hit me anymore as im old enough to where I can defend myself. I don't even think this will make them feel bad. Of course, they will get a shock from it, as they seem to expect me to get yelled at and feel nothing. I told them how I feel and they call me ungrateful. My dad takes every chance to call me a failure, but as my brother makes the same mistakes I did he gets away with it because he's mentally handicapped. While I have ADD so its a lot less understandable and I should be able to work through it. I plan to sit in the bathtub with earbuds in listening to music as I die. Finally free of the pain of living without anyone to love me. I've made other posts describing my situation more in depth. Whenever I have the urge I have everything prepared. I will finally be able to sleep without fear of waking up the next day.
