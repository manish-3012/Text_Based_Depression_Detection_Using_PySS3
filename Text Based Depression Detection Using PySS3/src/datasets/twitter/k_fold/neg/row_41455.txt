I feel like Iâ€™m going to have a mental breakdownIâ€™ve been casually suicidal (like... I wouldnâ€™t care if I got hit by a car, wouldnâ€™t move out of the way if one was speeding toward me) for most of my life, beginning at age 5 or 6. I turn 20 in two weeks, for reference on how long itâ€™s been. I used to pray back in elementary school that I would die in my sleep, and Iâ€™ve never reached a point where I actively wanted to be alive. Recently, Iâ€™ve felt so fucking awful and Iâ€™ve wanted to die so badly itâ€™s insane. My mother treats me like shit because Iâ€™m not a Trump supporter. I hate my job. Iâ€™m not good at anything, I lack a lot of basic skills due to my years spent crippled by mental illness, and I objectively offer no worth to anything in the world. Talking to therapists doesnâ€™t work because I donâ€™t trust them not to judge me and no medication works. Recently I had a big confrontation with my parents because they were talking shit about me with my little sister when they thought I was out of the house. I wasnâ€™t, and I let them know I heard everything. Of course, then they were like â€œomg youâ€™re just so negative! Itâ€™s hard to spend time with you because you make everything so glum!â€ and I finally snapped and was like â€œIM SEVERELY DEPRESSED AND HAVENâ€™T BEEN HAPPY SINCE LIKE 2007 WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DOâ€... so they pretended to care about me for a couple hours, which was nice. Immediately afterward tho they continued to treat me like pond scum. So like I said, itâ€™s always just been casual and not anything concrete, but for the first time in my life, Iâ€™m genuinely considering ending my life. I just donâ€™t know how or which method is most precise while also keeping the pain to a minimum. My biggest concern would be who would walk in and find my body? Thatâ€™d be scarring for whoever it is, regardless of how tenuous my relationships with my immediate family are. I imagine Iâ€™d place increasingly blatant notes throughout the house like â€œthereâ€™s something upstairs!.... please prepare yourself before going into Emmaâ€™s room!..... call an ambulance first maybe!.... there might be a dead body in there donâ€™t freak out itâ€™s fineâ€ lmfao  ðŸ’€ anyway. Hopefully I can muster up the courage to do it very soon. Not sure if I should wait until before or after my birthday tho it might be cool to be 20 for a little bit
