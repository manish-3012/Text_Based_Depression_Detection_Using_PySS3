Sometimes I just want somone to beat and murder me because I'm too sensitive to do it myselfI *know* there's people out there who would do it. It sickens me but also... I think about seeking them out when i feel to cowardly to hurt myself. I feel if i can't punish or kill myself for everything then I also need to be punished for being to weak to kill myself. It's a cycle.

Sometimes it's just a thought and sometimes it gets close to feeling impulsive. I'm scared I could actually contact someone one day and go through with it.

It also makes me want to prove myself wrong and have the power to shoot myself instead. It looks so easy. Parents have their guns just lying around the house and everytime i see them i get scared because of how i could just easily *do it* i look at them and I've picked up the handgun before. It scary to feel.
I'm impulsive enough to know that it will happen one day. Either i do it or i fall weak and let someone else do it.
