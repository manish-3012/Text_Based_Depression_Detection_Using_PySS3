Getting a lot of increasingly serious suicidal thoughtsKind of scared I will end up doing it in a few months if I can't fix my life. 

I have antidepressants from my doctor but I am scared to take them because it will make me a zombie and permanently change me.

If I keep living, I will be a failure and unhappy. I am scared of shooting myself, it will hurt, I will ruin my familys life. But fuck, the alternative is to live as a loser just for their sake.
