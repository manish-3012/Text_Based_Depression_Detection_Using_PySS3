All My Options SuckI basically have until august 15th to find a place and job but it feels impossible. My friend who I am staying with and his mom are pressuring me to just leave early too it is so damn stressful I can barely function. I have never had a job before and I have so much social anxiety I can barely talk to people. I am trying so damn hard but it is not enough.

I am at the end of the rope really I could go back home to my mentally abusive parents, become homeless, keep trying, or off myself. None of these options seem pleasant, I want to keep trying to find a job and place but nobody believes I can do it not even myself.
