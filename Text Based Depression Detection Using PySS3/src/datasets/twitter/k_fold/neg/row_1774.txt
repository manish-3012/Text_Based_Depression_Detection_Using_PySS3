It feels like I'm plotting a murderI guess I am, in a way.

Navigate around everyone else's schedules, birthdays, and holidays to lessen the impact. Drive out to the desert so you won't be interrupted (and watch the milky way while you die). Between 12AM-7AM on a Sunday morning is best; there's fewer people out and about. Set out important documents and passwords before you go. Take the 4Runner because the Expedition won't make the trip, even if it's the better candidate for CO poisoning. Write down contact info for the first responders, and bring a hospital bag in the unfortunate event you live.

I think I'm going to do it on my birthday, so my family is left with only one day to grieve. My only concerns are inadvertently turning myself into a vegetable, people going through my things, and harming my little sister. But, she's long outgrown the need for me.

Iâ€™d rather not die, but I canâ€™t think of any other viable options.
