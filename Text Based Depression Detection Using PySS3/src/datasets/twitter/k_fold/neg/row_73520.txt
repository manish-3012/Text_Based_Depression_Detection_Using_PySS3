got advice for a boyfriend?so my girlfriend has had depression before we started dating(we've been together for 3+ years now) (she might have inherited it for a part from her dad) 

last almost year it has gotten really bad and she is also anorexic now and was really thin for a few months but getting a bit more normal after alot of therapy etc. 

but now her depression has rolled it's mug around the corner at full blast and she told me last tuesday that she is extremely suicidal (she asked me to sleepover after being adviced to do so by her therapist because she would kill herself otherwise because she was home alone(her mother stayed home after hearing this btw)) 

so my sister heard she got cancer this friday and my girlfriend just said that she really wanted to kill herself tonight but felt really guilty because my sister has cancer. so I called her mom to go to her and now they're calling with help and everything(she already has therapy planned for the morning)

so my question is knowing that she already is getting help: what can I myself do as her boyfriend to help her?
