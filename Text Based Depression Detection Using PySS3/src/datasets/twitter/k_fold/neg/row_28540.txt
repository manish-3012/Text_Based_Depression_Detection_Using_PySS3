Anybody ever feelLike there is nothing that you could ever possibly do to make yourself happy? Idk Iâ€™ve had a somewhat sheltered life you could say with great parents and did well in school and am now working a good job. But I often think about what the point is of carrying on. Iâ€™m 20 now and working for the next 30 years, coming home, eating, sleeping repeat does not feel like I could carry on that long. I hear all the time people say to think of what your happy place is or what makes you happiest but the answer for me is there isn't one. I never feel excited to do anything or go anywhere, I have great friends itâ€™s just, I donâ€™t have a good time when they are all having one, because I never feel Iâ€™m having a good time or enjoying anything within my life . Idk what Iâ€™m gonna do from here, donâ€™t know why I posted if Iâ€™m being honest..
