why is suicide so hard to complete?in terms of the physical act of committing suicide, it is very hard to succeed. for 15-24 year olds, for every 100-200 attempts thereâ€™s only one successful suicide. thereâ€™s almost always a high chance that youâ€™ll fail and end up with some sort of injury or internal damage, which makes you feel even worse. i envy people who have committed suicide. honestly, i think it takes guts to commit suicide.
