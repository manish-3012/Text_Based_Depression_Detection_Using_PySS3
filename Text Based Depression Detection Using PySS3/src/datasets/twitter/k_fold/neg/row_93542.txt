I'm running out of reasons not to do it. (Stream of consciousness rant)I think I'm reaching the end of my rope. No... I know I'm reaching the end. My depression and anxiety has taken almost everything from me, and what I've been able to hold on to, is slowly drifting away. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm 25, I have a spotty work history due to my depression and anxiety. I moved away when I was 19 but had to come back when I was 21 due to losing my job. I just failed out of college from not being able to attend classes due to having constant panic attacks. So I'm now 145k in debt and nothing to show for it. Yeah, that fucking much because I moved out of state to go to school with my girlfriend because my home life was fucked. In hindsight, not the best idea but the school shammed me out of a scholarship that was suppose to cover the difference in in state and out of state tuition.


I'm sorry if there is no flow or anything to what I'm writing, Im just letting everything out while I'm sobbing. So yeah, huge debt, no job, live somewhere where there is NO work other than fast food or a restaurant... and no way to get out. My girlfriend says shes always behind me and will be with me no matter what... but I feel like Im holding her back. She honestly deserves better than me. 

I just don't fucking get it. I'm a kind person.. i've never so much as hurt another living soul... I try my best to help everyone when I can... all I want is a god damn break. But I can't get it. Hope has become nothing more than another way for life to torture me. 

I dream of dying. Every fucking night. I dream of being shot, hanging myself, jumping off cliffs.... its the only thing I truly desire anymore. I've held off for this long for my girlfriend, friends, and family.. but I can feel myself caring less and less about that each day. I just want it all to stop. That nervous, fuzzy feeling in my chest that never goes away.. the pounding heart beat... the never being able to stay asleep for more than two hours. I just want to not .. hurt. Is that so much to fucking as for? 

I stopped counting the number of different meds I've been on after 15... and therapists are useless. They only tell me what I already know. I feel like I'm going insane because I know the only thing holding me back is myself... but I can't overcome it. I dont know why.


I don't expect any replies or help because most of this (if not all) is just random bullshit I wanted to get off my chest -somewhere-.
