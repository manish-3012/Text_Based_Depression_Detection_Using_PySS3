every time I look at myself I go into a deep depressionI can look into the mirror just fine - i actually like the way I look. However the second I get a photo of myself I'm repulsed at the way I look. My face looks like it's uneven, pointing in a sideways direction and i go into a deep depression for about a week after. Over the past year I managed to avoid looking at photos of myself but curiosity always gets the better of me. u can guess what i just did tho. There's no way I'll be going outside or doing anything for the next few days - can't stand people seeing me. no point in even living if you look like a monster 

why do I like the way I look in the mirror but hate the way I look in photos? Do people really see me at this disgusting uneven monster or do they see me in the same way I see myself in the mirror?
