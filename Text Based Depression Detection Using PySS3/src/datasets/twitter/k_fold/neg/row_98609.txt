I'm tired of pretending I'm happyI'm stupid, bland, flabby and a waste of space. I feel broken, my mind is broken and I'm just tired. It's too late to make something of myself and even if I tired I would probably fail miserably. I'm trying not to drink, to get through the day, but if I can't drink, all I want to do is sleep. I have no MOTIVATION and no fucking DRIVE and I'm worried people must think I'm lazy. I see other people around making moves and I don't get it, HOW THE FUCK DO THEY DO IT? Why can't I?

I fucking hate myself.
