Im a complete messI need to get my shit together I've cut myself for almost a year now havent been diagnosed with anything everyone in my school thinks im a fuck boy Because of rumours i fingered someone and took a photo of another girls ass all I've had is a few close friends but 2 of them keep calling me a fuck boy even if it is as a joke i told them to stop because it genuinely hurt me and they haven't stopped and another one got mad at me because they heard the rumours and thought i actually did it so they didnt even hear me out or listen to me and ive only got like 1 left and im scared of being alone i depend on social interaction a lot to keep me alive and im slowly losing my friends because of these fucking rumours made up by a bunch of dicks all because i dumped my girlfriend because she kept flirting with my friends so she took revenge and started spreading shit and noe im in a dark place where i have no hobbies and im just blundering through school hoping one day it gets better and i realise i have a passion for something but a few weeks ago i was on the edge of a building and i was so close to ending it all there but i didn't and im not sure if i regret that decision or not so to conclude i have no aspirations for my future my friends are slowly leaving me one by one and multiple rumours have been spread because i broke up with someone that i went out with
