The lure of the oceanI woke up this morning on a beach 8,000 miles away from home, drunk and in someone else's bed. My mental health has been spiraling as I have tried again and again to ease up on drinking, and I cracked last night and finished a bottle by the ocean and next to a bonfire. I drank to numb the pain and depression that I've been fighting until I blacked out. I had a boyfriend who I love more than the stars (back home) until I told him what I did.
The ocean has always been this giant lure for me. I want to swim until I can't swim anymore, as far out as I can go, and just float. Its been there for me during the good times. But now, it's giant tempting and drowning would be such an easy solution. 
But I can't. I was about to swallow more pills and booze and end it when I woke up and realized what I did. I had it planned out. And something stopped me. My little sisters need me. My mom died from suicide, and I can't do this to them. 
So I'm on here, after 12 hours of being on the edge of death I walked away, back to the house I'm staying at here, and called my now ex-boyfriend, apologized and hung up. Then I called a friend and told them that its either death or sobriety. 
So I'm going to make it. Just one day at a time. And avoid the beach, because every time I swim I just go so far out and float, and it's so tempting. I'm going to make it, just for today. And tomorrow, I'm going to try and say the same thing. We can make it, life might get better.
