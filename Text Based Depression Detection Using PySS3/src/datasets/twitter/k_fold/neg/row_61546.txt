Donâ€™t See a PointGot dumped, I work with poisonous people day in and day out, I spend my weekends alone, and I canâ€™t see things being any different. I put on a good front but I think Iâ€™m too sensitive for this world. Tasks at work are becoming unbearable. And if I donâ€™t have a job I canâ€™t support myself. But what Iâ€™m doing now ainâ€™t livin and My cynicism is growing. Thinking about doing myself and everyone a favor and ending it.
