Suicidal thoughtsI have been struggling with major depression and substance abuse problems for the past four years. In the past year it has gotten far worse than ever before. In a bid to keep my substance abuse problems secret, I have slowly isolated myself from every member of my family and all my friends. I have been flooded with suicidal thoughts. I feel like everyone's lives would be better including mind, if I was dead.
