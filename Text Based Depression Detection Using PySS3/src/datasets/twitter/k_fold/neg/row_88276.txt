Thinking about ending after this weekendYa Iâ€™m not really close to anyone I donâ€™t see my life getting any better and really canâ€™t seem to get close to anyone and really donâ€™t want to any more the only thing keeping me around this week is a fight I have after that I really donâ€™t have anything or any one that makes me stay around any longer and I think the only reason I am still here is because Iâ€™m to indecisive about if I actually want to die
