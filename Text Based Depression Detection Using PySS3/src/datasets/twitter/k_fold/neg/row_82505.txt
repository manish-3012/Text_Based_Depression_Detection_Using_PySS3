I give up and Sunday is the dayI abandoned my mom because of abuse and my ex roommate due to paranoia. I've been nothing but a sensitive leech. My friend is currently roommates with my ex roommate. At her apartment the ex roommate told me to just disappear just like I did with her. I'll do her one better and disappear altogether. All I cause is pain. People will be better without me. Sunday I'm helping a friend move and then I have no further obligations, no further way to hurt anyone. I'll say goodbye to my pastor and that'll be it. My roommates don't like me and I have no love in my life. Nobody I crush on likes me back. Can't fix broken.
