I want death and peaceNo one asks to be born and you cant choose who you are or what you're given. Why cant we choose to leave it behind? No one knows what comes next but people are so obsessed with keeping people here. 

 We all die, usually its painful and untimely and devastating. Why can't I make amends and decide when it happens? I'm searching for ways out but all I can find are horrible ways that I know will hurt people. Pretty pathetic.
