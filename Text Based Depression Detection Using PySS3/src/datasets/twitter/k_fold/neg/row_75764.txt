I cant do thisI fuck up everything, Im destined to fail another school year if I make it to September, Iâ€™m destined to blow up on my mom again because she asks me to do a simple task and it stresses me out till I canâ€™t take it.   Im not good at anything I do I broke up with my girlfriend who genuinely cared because I couldnâ€™t treat her the way she deserved and now she pretends to not know who I am.  I can only be good around the boys but I dont even know if its me when Iâ€™m with them Im just distracted to whats waiting for me at home.   This is my 7th night drinking in a row 4th alone,  I just want to eat a bottle of pills and hope not to wake up to my shitty 7-5 job but who knows ill probably fail at that too.... 

Fuck
This
Shit
