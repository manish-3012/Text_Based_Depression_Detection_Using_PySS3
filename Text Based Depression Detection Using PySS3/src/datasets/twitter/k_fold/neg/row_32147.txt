My final try (tho Iâ€™m still depressed)I stopped to a new low.
On Saturday night, I took 15g of aspirin in one sitting and went to bed next to my partner whom I love with my entire heart and went to bed hoping Iâ€™ll die in my sleep.
I woke up in the morning, partially deaf, nauseous, lightheaded and sick to my stomach about what I had just done.
I rushed to the ER with her ( I was driving) where I was placed in the ICU almost immediately, ended up staying 2 nights and 3 days in the hospital.. 
they took various blood tests, were worried about internal bleeding ... brain swelling and etc. I denied suicide attempts there to avoid the psych ward, I said I took it for a headache.
And my lovely girlfriend was going through this so hard... it hit her so hard even though she didnâ€™t know about the attempt. 
Iâ€™m heartbroken but Iâ€™ll never attempt again
