A poem I made.Title: Black

Poem #1, Black

As he walks this lonely road, on this cold, bitter, yet inviting night
He sees a different world than his peers
A world devoid of all color
A world lacking in real meaning or depth 
A place without love
A place without meaning
Not a glimmer of light is present yet he still persists
No matter how much he dreams of a future of light and prosperity 
He never progresses

Walking along this path has tired him to a certain degree
He continues
He then encounters a very slippery, wet terrain
He struggles to stand
And regardless of his efforts
He falls
