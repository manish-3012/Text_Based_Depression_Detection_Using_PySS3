My storyI'm a disabled air force vet. I got injured in the states commuting to my base. While I was recovering on bed rest, I was watching CNN one day and two names of people I went to tech school with had been listed as killed in action we all had the same afsc, but I'm like them, I had my expert Marksmanship badge. Due to my lineage, I was more prepared for warfare. I have been depressed ever since because I feel that it should have been me over there instead of them. And, if I was stronger, I would have been able to take the pain from my injury and they'd still be alive. I still blame myself for their deaths. 

I will find myself in a state of self-loathing, and regret. I wish it was me instead of them. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself.
