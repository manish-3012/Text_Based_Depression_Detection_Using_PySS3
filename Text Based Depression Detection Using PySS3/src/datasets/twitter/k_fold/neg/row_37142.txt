Plz letâ€™s talk about deathIâ€™m so ashamed of myself but Iâ€™m scared to die, Iâ€™m 6 years in USA 19y old boy, who was so ashamed of his accent that barely spoke and improved my English in any sort of way, never wanted to study although went to college, never wanted to work, but was pretending like Iâ€™m a regular person that wants to work and study. I was technically being fake all my life, I was telling my friends from my country that I know English that everything is perfect but I just wasnâ€™t thinking about my future at all. Applied to a job to be a lifeguard at a big water park but then COVID happened and everything closed and went online, I just stopped studying at all, forgot about job now they wanted me back from furlough so I went there looked like a complete idiot cuz I simply forgot everything and was scared to ask for help and now Iâ€™m ashamed to go there again... Iâ€™m just so fucking ashamed and embarrassed that I hate myself... been hiding from people cuz I thought whatâ€™s the point of communicating and learning if Iâ€™m gonna kms itâ€™s only getting worse everyday cuz Iâ€™m not doing anything with my life, I thought that if Iâ€™m gonna die itâ€™s just gonna a long sleep, but now I think Iâ€™ll go to hell... cuz killing yourself is unforgivable... I donâ€™t see a way out, I really donâ€™t, I just wanna go back in time and either not to come to USA, or tell myself to study learn English and donâ€™t do drugs, cuz that fucking destroyed my life... and not being fake and never fucking lie... never... Iâ€™m just a piece of shit... who canâ€™t fucking do anything, and doesnâ€™t want to change or improve. What am I here for, whatâ€™s my fucking purpose in life? Plz tell me that death is just a sleep, plz
