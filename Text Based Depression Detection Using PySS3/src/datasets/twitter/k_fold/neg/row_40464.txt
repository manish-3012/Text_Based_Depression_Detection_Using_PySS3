Help please. Anxiety and depression and a humiliating scar all wrestled on me... I can'tIn the past 5 months I have been having some depression and panic attacks. It really interfered with my school and behavior and family. I just don't enjoy my life anymore. And in the past month, someone in my school hit me and gave me a scar. I got more depressed. But in some weeks i managed to forget about it. Then one day, I looked at it and thought why did this happen to me? I am not a fight person. When I get verbally bullied in school, I can go home and forget it. But this scar is like a reminder of how shitty my life is. It ruined my life. My face was ruined. I can't look the way I used to look like. Whenever I see him uncaring about my situation and I am depressed I get depressed more. I feel like there is something is depressing me. And what is more depressing is that it's caused by someone I hate.


 Right now I am deeply depressed. I have a ton of works to do for my school and I just can't even do so. I feel my life was ruined by this scar. I talked to my school manager but he did nothing that made me feel better. I'm not in the US or any European school.


 My life got way worse right now because of a person. When I see him happy and sitting in a class with me I feel I'm weak and can't do nothing. Even my physical body is stronger than him but i don't know. Have anyone been in the same situation because I think that I'm the only in the world who has this and  I'm more depressed.

I really need help. I can't anymore.
