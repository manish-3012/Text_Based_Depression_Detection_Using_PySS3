Overheard my dad talking to my mom about being suicidal.My dad has been unemployed for 9 months, and before that he had 2 other jobs in 5 years. His industry is really dying and he's 60 years old. He just sits at home and watches TV. But I didn't know how bad it had gotten. 

I'm a college student, home for the holidays, I don't know what to do. They know that I heard them but I don't really want to talk about it because I have no idea what to say, I don't want to make it worse.
