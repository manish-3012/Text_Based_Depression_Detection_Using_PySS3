Girlfriend left, Iâ€™m at my tipping point.So as of just now, my girlfriend has officially left me...and itâ€™s all my fault 

She says we could get back together but she doesnâ€™t see how. Guess weâ€™ll see in a month or two but Iâ€™m just broken. 

Iâ€™m just beginning my therapy (depression, anxiety) but I donâ€™t see any hope right now....

I just feel like ending it all right now and I think sheâ€™d hate me more if I did
