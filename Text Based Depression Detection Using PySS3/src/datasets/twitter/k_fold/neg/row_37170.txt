I feel like this is part of life and normalI feel like its normal for me wanting to kill myself and going through with it. Wasting your time and everyone's else's is not cool. People be telling you have so much to live for, and its all gonna be okay, asking for relationship advice. I just can relate to it.
If this is what it takes to end the suffering of other and myself, then so be it.
