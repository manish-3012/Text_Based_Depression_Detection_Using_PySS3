Im going to killmyself in the mext day or twoxThese last few months have been horrible probably the worst of my life I got a new job that promised better pay and flexible hours and now they are screwing me throwing me on the graveyard shift working me less then 12 hours a week and underpaying me my last check was only $62 

 But last month the girl I have been with and talking to for the last 9 months cheated on me with her friend when we were supposed to be working on our relationship which totally destroyed me and broke me into nothingness but because I am hopelessly in love with her I forgave her and let her back into my life and now she treatens me with it all the time that she will do it again which destroys me everytime and just lastnight she told me she was in love with her friend and even sent me a screenshot of her and him saying they loved eachother which fucking killed me I really became a husk after that all life is drained from me I have not been the best guy by any means to her I have yelled at her called her mean names and treated her crappy sometimes but so has she and she's treated me worse especially recently

When I got home just now from working the midnight shift the one thing I still had that brought me a little bit of happiness my ps4 bricked and now I really have nothing left I wish I had the money to replace it or buy a ps5 ya know so I cab play the new demon souls cuz the souls games are my favorite but I don't even make enough money to pay my rent so now I have nothing to distract me or keep the demons away so now so now I just sit and wait for my demons to consume me fully and take me away from this horrible place and make all my sadness and regret go away the souls games always sucked me in with there beautifully worlds and beautify deep lore which I could be sucked into so deeply and put myself in that wonderful world and be ok for once be truly happy 

But I don't have that anymore I have nothing to envelope my head in to distract from the pain I have nothing but the darkness of my room the horrible thoughts in my head and the cold dark walls surrounding me and there getting closer and closer by the second like they will crush me soon I hope they do so my pain in this world will finally end and maybe I can even wake up in a new world and be ok for once its been so long since ive been ok hopefuly the pain will end soon
