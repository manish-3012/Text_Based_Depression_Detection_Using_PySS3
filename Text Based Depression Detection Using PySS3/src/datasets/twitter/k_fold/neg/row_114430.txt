Pendulum as he calls itSomethings wrong with me and I canâ€™t figure out why and itâ€™s tearing not just me but the relationship I have with an amazing person apart. Me or my emotions seem so unstable, I donâ€™t want to argue or hurt him but I couldnâ€™t stop and everythingâ€™s my fault. Itâ€™s always my fault, Im a mess, and all I can think of is running away, Iâ€™m afraid of fixing things cause it never works. Iâ€™m constantly saying things out of anger just to make things work, I just- donâ€™t know what is wrong with me. These stupid doubts and fears, I just want to go away, Iâ€™m so tired of myself being in this loophole Iâ€™ve made. I just donâ€™t think I could ever get out of it... I just want to sleep and not wake up so no one has to deal with me anymore.
