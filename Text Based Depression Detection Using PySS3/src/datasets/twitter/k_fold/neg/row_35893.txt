My Time Is ComingI have been suicidal since October 15, 2017 as that was the day that the woman I loved more than anything told me she no longer loved me and had moved on with someone else and was kicked out of my home, abandoned by her family and my stepson and forgotten about. The woman saved my life in 2013 when my aortic valve (which had already been replaced in 1999 when I was 16) disintegrated and to this day I struggle to move on.

I have been to therapy, anti-depressant meds and even spent a few days committed with no change. I made an attempted and failed in March (which for most is a wake up call) but every day I wake up and struggle not to end it. Even after finding a woman who is head over heels in love with me I find that I just canâ€™t let her completely in (even after she was by my side through yet another surgery which sadly I lived through ) not because I want my ex back but because I donâ€™t want it to hurt as much when she does leave.

Iâ€™m at the end of my rope, every day I go through the motions with work, interacting with my family, my gf, etc and hope Iâ€™ll be at peace soon. Only thing currently that stops me from making another attempt is to make sure my gf is taken care of as Iâ€™ve gotten her a car, helped her find a good paying job and helping her get on her feet so she will be ok once Iâ€™m gone.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this
