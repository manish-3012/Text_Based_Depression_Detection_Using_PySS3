I will be forgottenThere have been a small number of suicide attempts where it got very close to succeeding. One of them was a little more than 2 years ago.

Tonight, I was at a social event. I looked around at everyone laughing and realized that if Iâ€™d succeeded 2 years ago, the would be exactly where they are right now doing exactly the same thing. 

Iâ€™d be a memory tucked away in the back of their mind. Then eventually, not even that.
