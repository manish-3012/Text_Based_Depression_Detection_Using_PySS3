No one caresLiterally not a single person on earth cares about me all I want is death is that so hard. There was a huge storm that came through my area with tornado warnings and everything so I just went outside and stood there hoping I would get hit by a tornado. There wasnâ€™t a tornado so Iâ€™m probably just going to go to the city and jump off the highest building I can get onto. Not like people will care.
