Why will I never be good enough?I try so damn hard. I changed my lifestyle. I dropped 20lbs. I got a degree. I got a job. I took â€œtaking care of myselfâ€ seriously. I made it my mission to be a happy, positive person no matter the circumstance. 

Itâ€™s not good enough. Itâ€™ll never be good enough. Not for my parents, my boyfriend, my friends. No one. Thereâ€™s always something else that Iâ€™m failing at. 

Boyfriend is unhappy because Iâ€™m not meeting his needs in our relationship. Parents are unhappy because I wasted thousands of their dollars on a college program I switched out of. Friends are disappointed because I never seem to be around. Clients are disappointed because apparently I canâ€™t do my job. 

I am constantly craving the companionship of my loved ones while simultaneously wishing that I just could disappear without a trace.

My life has been a waste. I have brought nothing of substance to anyoneâ€™s life, and I doubt I ever will. I want to die and I want that to be an option.
