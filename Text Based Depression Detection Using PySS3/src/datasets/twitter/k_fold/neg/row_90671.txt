15M and tierd of life, plan on ending it the weekendim fifteen years old and i already feel like im done with my life. i don't have the energy to do anything, my homework falls behind, my teachers hate me and i feel like my friends only pretend to want to be around me. to sum it up, i've already tried to end it twice before. third times a charm, am i right?
