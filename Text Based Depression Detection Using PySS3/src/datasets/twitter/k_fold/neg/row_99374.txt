Need Advice Please!Hi everyone,
Someone I know tonight self-harmed. I was told of this before by friends, but I've never witnessed it until today. There are many details that I'm leaving out, but I was at a complete loss at what to do. The individual was very emotional, but I am not sure if the individual is depressed or not. They appeared to be very happy, but once they had a few drinks this happened. During the event, I tried to wrestle away the object, but was unsuccessful. Afterwards, I just spoke to them for hours. I tried to bring up random topics, but their responses tended to be centered on their reasons why they don't want to live anymore. After a few hours, things settled down. However, I am extremely worried. I want to suggest the individual to get help, but I feel that the topic is extremely sensitive. How would I even suggest that? What should I do if this happens again?
Thank you everyone for the advice. I am extremely appreciative.
