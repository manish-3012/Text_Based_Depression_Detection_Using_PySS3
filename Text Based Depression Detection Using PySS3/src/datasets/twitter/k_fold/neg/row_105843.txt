Shame keeps me from connecting to people which continues my cycle of isolation and constant suicidal ideationI feel so worn down. I've been in treatment for years for my mental stuff and i feel like I am just more aware of how crazy I am but I'm actually getting more symptomatic as I get older. I just hide it well so people don't know.
I am surrounded by people and am constantly scared they hate me or don't like me that much. I go from loving my partner a lot to thinking I should break up with him because being alone is easier. I don't know. I'm just tired of fighting all the time to not off myself. 
I feel shame every day for most of the day. My baseline is shame. I don't know how to get rid of it. I don't connect with people because I assume I'm something to be ashamed of. 
Sorry this is disjointed I am sort of just broken down and at my wits end.
