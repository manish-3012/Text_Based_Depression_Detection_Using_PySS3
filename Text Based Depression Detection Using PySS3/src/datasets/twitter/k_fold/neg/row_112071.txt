is there ACTUALLY a point in living?i'm 15 and have struggled with suicide for the past three or four years. it's usually because of school, but now it's also... everything else?

the news is always awful, people are murdering each other for dumb reasons, there's a whole fucking pandemic that my country (usa) has done hardly anything about... for the first time in a long time, i feel genuinely scared about what's going to happen in the future.

meanwhile, i have to pretend to be optimistic and prepare myself for adulthood by spending three hours on online schoolwork a day while my parents tell me i'm not trying my hardest.

i've been clean from self harm for around six months but jesus, what's the point in not doing it?

i want to talk to my parents about it but what would they even do? the last time i attempted i got sent to a hospital for a week where all the nurses glared at me and all the patients had it way worse. and if they didn't take me back there, it's not like they would give me a break from school.

i'm not keen on doing therapy during a pandemic, and last time i went to therapy i could never work up the courage to actually trust my therapists (i went to three). i was on antidepressants before, but it just made me feel even worse. 

i've abandoned all my friends because i'm an awful person, and everytime i talk to someone i shake, and i usually ghost people online.

i'm not confident enough to take art commissions, and i'm not dedicated enough to write a book. those are my only "talents" and i can't even use them for anything.

it feels like if i keep living i'll just watch as everything  spirals downward. is there actually a reason not to die?

sorry if this is rant-y, it's 3 am and i'm very emotional right now. i'm probably just an edgy teenager, and i'll also probably regret this when i wake up
