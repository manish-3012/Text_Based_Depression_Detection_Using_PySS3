Help with a situationHey Reddit,

I responded to a post the other day.  They person stated he was former military with an addiction issue.  We are DMing and I am quickly realizing I am in over my head and I have really no idea what to do.  I do not know where this person is or I would call the local police to do a wellness check.  I am looking for suggestions.  User is akumaxchumli.

Any guidance would be appreciated
