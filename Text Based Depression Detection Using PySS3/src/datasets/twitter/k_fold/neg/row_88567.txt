I may have subconsciously tried to commit suicide with pills - woke up in the ERI have been a shut-in living with newly divorced mom since July-Oct 10.  Mostly been playing games on the PC until I got persuaded to resume drug treament.  Great psychiatrist, I love him.

My pschatrist had just prescribed me Lorazepam for my anxiety and back pain. ( addionally take prozac, seroquel, lamictal ) He said I should  take 1-2 .5mg lorazepam per day when I felt I needed it.  SO, I decided take between 2, 6, or 8 of them total, am not sure, to feel a max effect or high.  Oh and since it was Friday I played some drunk heroes of newerth (but only one shot) From that point on I have little memory of what transpired.  I wake next evening in a room with padded walls at my local hospital.  I told them I thought I had taken up to 8 pills they called me a liar to my face and said 30 where missing.  I had no answer for that and when I counted them back at home, sure enough 30 missing.

My main question is, how many people do have suicidal urgings but couldn't act on them BUT my take risks that might potentiality kill themselves.

Was I trying to commit suicde?  I an looking forward to the next episode of MadMen and feeling less depressed.  I was looking forward to getting a job, getting a girlfriend.  One of the nurses was reading my file and asked about Brown University.  I would like to finish my degree.

This is the first overdose situation I have had and seemed involuntary.  How can I trust to take my own medication safely? tips?
