Am I the asshole for wanting to give upSo I posted this in AITA but it got removed. 

Essentially I'm at the end and I'm ready to take the plunge. The only thing stopping me is my daughter and the baby on the way.

My relationship of 8 years is falling apart because I have anxiety issues and overbearing family and anger issues that stem from a lack of control. 

I know if she left, shed get the kids, and as I said they are the only reasons I have to carry on, my parents split when I was a child and my father said that everytime he was drop us home his heart would break, I know o wouldnt be able to take that

So I plan on pretending to my wife that I'm fine and hide the depression, my opinion, and essentially be a convincing robot so she doesnt leave and take the kids.

I have a family that loves me, a daughter that is obsessed with me and a wife who loves me but feels the need to protect her children from a mentally Ill man.

Now my question is am i an asshole for wanting to give up on life when i have people who care about me

And

Am I an asshole for pretending to my wife so she doesnt leave me
