Any minute nowIt's 11pm i have everything i need to do the deed and until recently had a good last day. 

Earlier today i was actually thinking about pulling through another 18 months just until my mom becomes a full fledged teacher and is no longer in training since she is very sensitive to the point that she cried about the child of a friend she hadn't seen in 15 years (never even met the child).

Just now though i found out that she tried to kill herself this afternoon.
 I know it's selfish but on the emotional component i've always been more her mother than she was mine to the point my life goal in second grade was to move halfway around the world to get away from her because even then i knew she'd drag back into her shit otherwise. 

I know this might be what pushes her over the edge as well but it's just to much.  We've always had a very unhealthily codependend relationship so no matter where i go and what i do i won't be rid of this or of her in this life, even if i try to pull away my own mind won't let me. I'll start worrying about her and return. 
I'm not afraid of dying only of the pain since i opted for the classic emo method. 
Sorry to bother you all i just needed to vent since "we don't talk about this sort of thing (aka our negative feelings)" in my family ever.
