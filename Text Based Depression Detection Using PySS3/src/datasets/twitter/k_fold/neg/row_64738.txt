I want to Kill myself but donâ€™t know howIâ€™m a college student living in a dorm. 
I donâ€™t have access to any pills, no belt or rope, no sharp knives, no gun. I could jump as Iâ€™m on the 12th floor but I donâ€™t even know if the windows open wide enough and plus thereâ€™s a screen window that I donâ€™t think even comes off. But my main problem I want to make it look like an accident. Iâ€™ve tried to write suicide notes before but I just feel I canâ€™t put everything into words and no matter what I write I feel like people wonâ€™t understand. And I donâ€™t want my family to know that I deliberately took my own life, and I think if everyone believes it was an accident that they wonâ€™t blame themselves and wish they could have done more. What can I do?
