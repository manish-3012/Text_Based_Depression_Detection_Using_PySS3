I'm thinking of just giving in and stop fighing.I'm too tired. I've fought for too long, day in and day out, going over problem after problem, never being able to get over them.

I'm just too sensitive, everything hurts me with a thousand times the intensity it should. It pushes my friends away. When everyone has already gotten over tiny inconveniences or altercations, I'm still ruminating and thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking everything over until I fel like my brain is bleeding. I don't get over anything, ever. All I do is pile on sadness, sadness which I can never wash off of me no matter how hard I try. I never stop thinking either. I have to live in constant cacophony to drown out all my overthinking. I can't sleep in silence because if I do the thoughts come in and I let the dark clouds swallow me whole. 

And nothing makes me happy anymore. Not my new relationship, which is perfect for me but I regret every day without ever having any idea why because he's amazing. Not my future career. Not my amazing grades. Not my loving family. Nothing. Nothing. I'm too sensitive for happiness.

And I've never been able to just... stop.

Gender dysphoria, body dysmorphic disorder, atypical anorexia, depression, anxiety. One after the other then all together. Every single day of my life. Fighting and fighting and fighting.

My friends think it's sweet and cute that I'm this sensitive, but it's not, it's sad, it's pathetic, it's ruining my life. It's disgusting. Annoying. And it always ends up pushing everyone away.

So I want to just

Give in. Stop fighting. Stop looking for happiness. Every single one of my efforts has been fruitless. Why continue fighting? It just makes it harder to swallow every time. It's safer that way. That way I don't have to be scared anymore. 

I don't want to suffer anymore
