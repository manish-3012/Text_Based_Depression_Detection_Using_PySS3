I think I'm about done.I don't know if I can keep doing this amymore. I've been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety for about 16 years now. I've wanted to kill myself just about the whole time. I got into self harm really bad about 9-8 years ago. I was self admitted to a mental hospital and stopped for a long time (little times here and there) but here in the past year I've picked it up again. I'm too old to be doing this shit but it feels like the only thing keeping me going. I have no support system, no friends.. no one that cares. I would have killed myself already if it wasn't for my dog and cat... the dog has anxiety issues and I'm worried if I'm going she'll be put down because she can't be around new people. I can't do that to her but I really don't want to be here anymore. There is no point in living. I pay my bills like everyone but what's the point in breathing air every day to pay bills until I die anyway.. I've planned it all already.. but my animals have held me back.. I think I'm to the point that I think even they'll be better off without me.. I'm ready for it to be over... I guess we'll see what happens... thanks for letting me vent...
