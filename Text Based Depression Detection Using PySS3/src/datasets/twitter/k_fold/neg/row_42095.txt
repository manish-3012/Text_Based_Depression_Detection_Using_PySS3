Reliving abuse all over againHi,  as a teenager I was verbally and physically abused by my mother.  Since then I now have a 21 year old daughter that has connected with my mother because she wants to know her grandmother.  My mother disclosed lies and has now caused a rift in my relationship with my daughter.  The result is that my child now wants no relationship with me.  I feel like a teenager all over again and want to die.  My mother has that effect on me where she causes mental anguish and makes me feel 14 again.  I attempted suicide 2 times when I was younger and was always angry I never succeeded.  I asked God why he would not have mercy and let me go.  Bottomline, I have sought help and it is not working.  This is my last attempt to make life make sense.  I have contemplated shooting myself or overdosing on the pills my psychiatrist gave me.  Can someone help me make sense of life?  I always hear you have so much to live for and all the positive notes but everyone sounds like a Hallmark card. I want to teach my mother a lesson and this is the most effective way.  I even get mad when I wake up now because I no longer want to be here. Please help me make sense of why I exist.
