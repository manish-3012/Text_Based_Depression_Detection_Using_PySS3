Don't know what to doI haven't felt this low in years. To be told by an older relative that my parent isn't abusive, that I'm wrong and that I'm an outsider to the situation is so disheartening. The one time I've ever stood up for myself like that and i get treated like I'm too stupid to even form an opinion of my own. They made me truly question everything despite knowing deep down that they are the one that's wrong. My dad is a gaslighter and my mom's a severe alcoholic. I feel like I have no one at this point. My heart hurts and I can't handle this pain anymore
