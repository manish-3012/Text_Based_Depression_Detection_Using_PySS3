My cat is one of the only things that keep me from killing myselfHe suffers from ptsd (he was hit by a car when he was a kitten and thatâ€™s why we took him in). Iâ€™m generally a very quiet and just reserved person so me and him get along really well because he is really sensitive to noise, sudden movements, etc. last night was a particularly bad night for me. I had been searching ways to kill myself that were possible with the things I have in my house and I ended up relapsing with self harm after about a month of not doing it. I was laying in bed bawling and he came into my room and started to headbutt my head and laid down right next to me and allowed me to hug and cuddle him. This is especially weird because although he likes sleeping in my bed itâ€™s always at the end of the bed and heâ€™ll leave if I try to pull him closer. I love him so much and genuinely have no clue what I would do if I were to lose him.
