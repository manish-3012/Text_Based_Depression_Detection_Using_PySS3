Just realized I don't have anything in the next year that I'm looking forward to.For years I've been depressed, but I've always had something to look forward to. A friends wedding out of town, a vacation to Vegas or the ocean, or just anything.

I drink very heavily, and have had thoughts about how it's pointless and killing myself before while drunk, but I'm stone sober and have been for a week, but am just strongly wondering why I don't just end it.

I work entirely too many hours at a salaried job, and don't get the recognition for it. With the commute thrown in, every day is basically get up, go to work, work, go to gym, go home, eat, and by then it's time to sleep if I want 6-7 hours of it.

Weekends I don't do anything fun anymore, as I've alienated all of my friends, and honestly can't think of anything I'd actually want to do that wouldn't involve an amount of money I can't spare right now, IE a vacation somewhere away from here. I just watch Netflix alone all weekend.

I just turned 31, but I have jack to show for it. I've fucked off my entire twenties and now everyone is married with kids.

I know this is just rambling, but I stared out the window for an hour before coming to post this, and believe that there isn't any reason anymore for me to not end it. I don't see an end to the cycle. I haven't had a day I would call fun since mid december and before that it was a long time too.

The last thing I was looking forward to was my tax refund, as I was going to take a trip, but it was taken by a collections agency so I never even got that.

I see now that it'd be better to not be, than to be unhappy 99% of the time.
