im sinking back into depression, giving upi want to end my life. so badly. im so tired. my relationship is falling apart, my body hurts all the time, i cant take the pain and discomfort anymore. im sick of managing my diabetes and exercising and drinking water and being healthy just to be doubled over in pain constantly. i want friends. i cant make them even though i keep trying. im so fucking lonely. nobody sticks around with me. im not that bad i swear, but everyone hates me. the world would be better off without me, and honestly im going to end my life soon. soon. very. soon. im so fucking tired of going on like this.

ive tried so hard to be better and happier recently, i just cant do it anymore. my life is worthless and i have no place. fine. i dont wanna be here anyways anymore.
