Iv'e Been Single My Whole Life And Have Never Had Anybody. It hurts to be alone, it hurts to be lonely, it hurts to see all of these beautiful women walking on campus and knowing that none of them will ever want me. I did all the normie shit; I joined college clubs, I talked to girls at these college clubs and classes that i'm in, I worked out at least 4 times a week, I started dressing nicer, but none of it worked.

You know what happened when I talked to girls? They ignored me, every single one of them. I would go to college clubs and talk to girls and half of them would act very cold and stuck up towards me, some of them would literally walk away from me mid-conversation. I tried texting girls, but they always ignored me and left me on read. I even asked out 3 girls last summer and they all said no. Iv'e never had a single woman express instead in me. And you know what? I'm tired of being written off.

All I ever wanted was to be wanted and to be desired by someone, just for once my life. I never got to experience what that feeling was like, instead it was the opposite. And you know what else is painful? Seeing everyone else get to experience love and sex and always being left out! It's the reason why I deleted Facebook and refuse to go to wedding, it's because all of my friends from high school and my family are all married or they're in a relationship and I literally have nobody. I have nobody to go on vacation with, nobody to spend valentines day with, absolutely nobody! Iv'e seriously been lonely and depressed everyday for the past five years because of my lack of love life, I wish that was an exaggeration.

I know why women don't like me too. It's because i'm different... I'm short, I have aspergers, i'm a naturally quiet person. There's nothing I can do about that, absolutely nothing. I'm already 25 years old, and i'll probably be a 30 year old virgin too.
