14 years is long enoughNate Molina. 14 years old and Iâ€™m sick of it.
Sick of life. No matter what I try to do it seems like it always fucks up in someway.
Sorry if my grammar is fucked. Iâ€™m trying to write this fast before my mom does something crazy.

Iâ€™m only 14, with an anxiety disorder, depression and a broken home. My mom and Dad constantly fight and argue, they never seem to see eye to eye. There was even one time my mom started beating my dad and the only reason why she stopped was cause I told her to.

I donâ€™t get physically abused but I get mentally abused. Itâ€™s not uncommon to hear that Iâ€™m a pig, useless, a failure, stupid, crybaby or being compared to someone else.

I do take therapy, although I canâ€™t anymore. My mom says it doesnâ€™t help and Iâ€™m only crying to the therapist. She even said itâ€™ll be better if I lived with the therapist. So she canceled appointments.

Sheâ€™s even said shit like â€œif youâ€™re going to kill yourself it better not be in the houseâ€ and, â€œ I canâ€™t wait until your brother and yourself move out, you two are useless!â€

Not to mention thereâ€™s also stress outside the house. Iâ€™ve known people going through shit as well and people who have thought of suicide. Feeling like I had to do everything to make them stay alive. Iâ€™m trying. I swear god I am. Iâ€™m even losing friends to comfort me.

And if youâ€™re wondering if I have medication for my anxiety, yes I do. Iâ€™ve tried to overdose, cut, drink, drugs. All at the age of 14. Iâ€™ve taken a month worth of pills, and I didnâ€™t die. Unfortunate.

Now I risk losing a home, being threatened to be kicked out and as well as my brother. I donâ€™t want to have to live with my brother however, because heâ€™s only 22, very little money and a small job. Not to mention still a student looking to help other by becoming a surgeon. I donâ€™t wanna bring him down.

So now what? I want to die. Thatâ€™s what. I know if I die the only person Iâ€™ll hurt is my brother and my girlfriend.

Whatâ€™s that a girlfriend at 14? Yeah. A get lots of fucking looks. Just because Iâ€™m 14. I did drugs. Iâ€™m 14 but I donâ€™t feel 14. I wanna move out and live my own life. And follow my fucking dreams.

Welp. Suggestions reddit? Because if not, I may end up in the gutter dead.
