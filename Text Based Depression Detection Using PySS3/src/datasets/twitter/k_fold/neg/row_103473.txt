Lost my job yesterday....Got fired yesterday, just signed a year lease to a new apartment, my mother co-signed, and rent is due the 1st, and I have no savings with only $300 in my bank account. 

Honestly I just want to turn my phone off and down a bottle of pills in my bathroom. I feel like my world is ending and I have no idea what to do. Im to ashamed to even tell my mother and to leave her with the burden of being responsible of my rent since she co-signed is devastating. Iâ€™ve been crying since yesterday, i canâ€™t eat, and the way i see out of this one is death. I would never be able to find a job in two weeks and be on payroll fast enough to pay rent. My landlord already explained that they start the eviction process after five days of being late no exceptions. I feel like checking myself into a mental hospital because i donâ€™t see how this is going to end well for me. I deal with crippling social anxiety and telling my mother is going to kill me inside if i dont do it first. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t even know where to begin.
