Don't think I can do it anymore.Thanks to everyone who commented on my previous post I made on here, but I don't think I want to continue on with living anymore.

Everyday is plagued with suicidal thoughts and my depression has done nothing but gotten worst. I don't think I'm fit for this life anymore. All I do is hurt people with my depression, and because of it, I have no more friends. I don't think I deserve to have friends anymore. I'm lonely and don't think I will amount to anything in life and just want it to be over. Maybe I truly am a monster.
