Looking around and not liking itWell, I feel like I am at the end of my rope, and I'm only 21. My life has been a horrible one. I have spent over half my life between being homeless and bouncing around foster homes. I have a broken family, brother's are in homes, Grandparents can't stand the site of me, and my father walked out when I was only 4. I feel like I'm just an empty shell walking around waiting to die, and this thought keeps popping up in my head, 'Why not take the easy way out?' I have attempted to do the task before. It was after I was told I couldn't join the military for medical purposes. I am the only one that knows this fact, I am too ashamed to tell my broken family. I now lack motivation to do anything, I feel like I am just wasting space and being a burden to my family. I can't find a job, and no college will take me. Life has really lost it's meaning for me. I just sit around and do nothing. I chain smoke so bad that I can't breath when I wake up. I smoke because it is the little miracle that makes me feel ok, and Cancer runs in my family. I find myself hoping to get cancer. My so called "friends" have deserted me. I just feel so alone. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up, at least in my dream I am happy. Another thing that makes me want to end it, is that fact I think I am gay. And I don't want to be. I do find Women sexually attractive, but I have these urges and thoughts that tell me other wise. And I don't want that life. I can't stand it much longer. I don't understand why I am being punished in this life. Is it my fate to just disappear and become nothing? I don't know what else to say, I just had to get this off my chest. Thank you.
