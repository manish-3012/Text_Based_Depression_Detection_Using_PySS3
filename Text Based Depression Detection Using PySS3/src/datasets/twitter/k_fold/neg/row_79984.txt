Am I okay? Whatâ€™s wrong with me?I feel silly. Things are going great for me. I have a job, and my girlfriend has recently moved in. My family is supportive too. But for whatever reason, I feel the same as I did when I was jobless, single, and abused.

Iâ€™ve been to a bridge before, ready to jump, before I was shipped to the hospital. They let me out after a couple weeks saying I was fine, and my life has only gotten better since I started those meds they gave me, yet when I dream and create stories in my head, or even remember walking to that bridge again, I just canâ€™t think of anything else besides my desire to make it happen again, as if itâ€™s where I belong, much like how jocks belong on a football field or geeks at a video game convention.

Why am I like this? Why do I still feel that desire to cut when everything is going perfect. Whatâ€™s wrong with me? I feel like thereâ€™s a ghost in my head telling me how I would be so much better at the bottom of the bridge. Am I the only one who feels like this?

Why am I like this?
