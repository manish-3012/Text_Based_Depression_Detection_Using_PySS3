Im lonely and stressedI am stuck with subjects in high school that I absolutely hate and now i cannot even change them. Everyday when i got to school i just feel so isolated from everyone even though i have some friends. This is a stressful year for everyone in terms of studies and i dont wanna bother my friends with my problems. I hate every moment of school and even though my parents are very supportive at this point even they cant do anything. The worst part is that my brother who was like my best friend recently went away to college and i feel like ive lost the only person i could talk to. I dont have anything to look forward, not my career, not my friends and not my future. I dont think there is any reason apart from my mother that would convince me to live.
