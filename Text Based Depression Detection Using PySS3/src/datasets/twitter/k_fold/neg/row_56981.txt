Whats the best way to try to kill yourself, so that if it fails there won't be too bad of damage?This is probably a really stupid question, I'm not really sure if I'm asking this at the right place either. I've been thinking about committing suicide, but one of my worst fears is if it fails and my family finds out, and they pay for my expensive medical bills when I'll most likely just try it again. I am not seeking help, because some random people on the internet aren't going to persuade me out of doing this. I'd just like to try, knowing that if it fails, it won't be that much more of a burden to my family.
