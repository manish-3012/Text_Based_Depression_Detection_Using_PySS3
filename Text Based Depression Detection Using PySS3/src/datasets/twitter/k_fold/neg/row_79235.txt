Realized that I have a problem with suicide ideationRecently, I've realized that suicide has been creeping more and more on my mind. I used to simply think "I just don't want to exist" or "I just want to sleep forever", which is not good, but better than thinking "I want to die", but now it's getting increasingly worse. I probably won't do actually anything, I am too afraid to die and I also have reasons I don't want to die, but it's so scary that these are getting more and more common. It's starting to pop up almost every time I get in my car. The amount of times I've thought about simply driving into a tree at highspeed or driving into the river is absolutely terrifying to me. On top of that, I'm getting so overwhelmed by everything. I was just doing a school assignment and I got so overwhelmed for no reason, it's actually a pretty easy assignment. But I ended up getting so overwhelmed, I looked up to see which medicines we had could be used to overdose. I did end up stopping myself, but god, it scares me so much that this is getting worse and worse.
