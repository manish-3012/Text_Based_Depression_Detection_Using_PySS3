i really just dont know anymore at this pointlike??? i just finished two big events and did relatively well on one of them (but obviously i had to go and make a mistake and i probably still dragged the score down for my partner and i) and the other one is unknown but it was pretty easy. i thought i would feel very relieved and happy now but i dont. i feel like im still a failure. and i really tried this time. i feel like now nothing will really make me happy anymore if that makes sense (also sorry if this sounds fake i suck at writing even worse than everything else) i just feel so lost but at the same time i feel so found?? like i cant move on from this point and ill be stuck like this forever. also like i feel like i shouldnt be like this because i have parents that are still together and a computer and hot food and friends

sorry for the paragraph of shit
