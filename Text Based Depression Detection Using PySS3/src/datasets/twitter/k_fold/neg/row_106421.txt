I don't know what to do anymore.So I've been depressed for three, four years now. At first it was existential, you know, why are we here and all that stuff. but now my life just suck. Ever since I got depressed my life just got deeper and deeper in a hole of depression. I lost all my friends. I stopped going to school. My girlfriend got so tired of me she broke up with me. And I just got fired from my job, about an hour ago to be exact. My family practically doesn't exist. I have nothing now. Why bother when no one's even gonna notice if I'm missing. I'm crying in the bus now. I know I'm young (18) and I have time to improve but it just hurts so much. I'm seriously considering suicide this time. I've thought about it before but it was never this serious. Sorry if this post is messy/everywhere. I'm just writing whatever comes into my head.
