My friend wants to kill himself.As the title says, today he casually told me he's gonna kill himself. He said he's not completely sure if he will yet, but he's definitely depressed. He's dyslexic, and takes crap from his teachers/parents all day about not getting good grades. He's one of my best friends, and I just can't stand to see him like this. Please tell me what to do.
