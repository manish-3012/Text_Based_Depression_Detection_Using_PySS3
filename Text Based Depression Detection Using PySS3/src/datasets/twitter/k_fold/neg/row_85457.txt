I need a hugI keep making plans to drive down somewhere alone,and just cry for help,literally...in most of the scenarios Iâ€™m somewhere alone and call a suicide hotline or the police saying how I have suicidal thoughts ( which I do have but never show any sign to actually do the things I think about which really freaks me out and makes me feel like my feelings are invalid), I feel like this is the only way to get help because Iâ€™m scared it would upset my mother or family if I just told them directly and they wouldnâ€™t get me the help I need,Iâ€™ve been having these thoughts for months about seeking help this way so I can get better but now with the covid 19 I feel trapped and like I canâ€™t get help or else risk spreading/catching it somehow...what do I do?
