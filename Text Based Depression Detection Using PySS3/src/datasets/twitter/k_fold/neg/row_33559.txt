Heâ€™s basically goneAfter trying not to get into a relationship because I wasnâ€™t ready for one after a traumatic breakup. My online bf doesnâ€™t talk to me anymore, we had a fight because Iâ€™ve been emotionally abusive. I hate myself and my life so I donâ€™t treat people the best but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m a bad person. I thought about cutting yesterday, I really donâ€™t wanna hurt myself but Iâ€™m so depressed. Help
