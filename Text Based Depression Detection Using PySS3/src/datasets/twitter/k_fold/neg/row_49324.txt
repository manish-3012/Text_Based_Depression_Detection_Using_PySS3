I plan on buying a ticket to San Fran today!I am 31 year old man, dead set on dying in the manner I want. I have been fascinated with committing suicide by jumping from the Golden Gate bridge for several years now. It makes sense for me to go out that way. I love water, and swimming. I am meant to die this way. I have been suicidal for over 7 years now. I do not see these feelings going away even if I get back on Medication. I am too ugly to date let alone even have friends. People seem to be embarrased to be around me, because who wants to be friends with the ugly person. I completly understand the revulsion. I do the same thing. Between the severe social isolation, money issues, anxiety, and depression I am at my wits end. I have skin hunger, but cannot afford a prostitute. No sane woman woud willingly have sex with me.Sorry if I shared to much. Tomorrow I am leaving to throw myself off the Majestic G.G. One last thing, before I hear it. I have watched the Golden Gate survivor videoes, and I am well aware there is a small chance i will survive.
