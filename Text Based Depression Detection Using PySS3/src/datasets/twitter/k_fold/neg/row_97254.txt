my parents were abusive, now i'm an abusive partner and my close friend wants to kill herself. it's hard to find a reason.my mother is an authoritative, verbally abusive, emotionally non-existent parent. she merely yelled at me every day about my grades, about how I'm a failure compared to her because she was the perfect student, perfect athlete, perfect child loved by her parents, while I can hardly compare to her. she reminded me of this every other day when I was a fucking kid. I have distinct memories of throwing myself down stairs and stabbing myself with a pencil while studying with her because she would never listen to how I felt. when I mustered up the courage to tell her I was depressed and suicidal in 8th grade, she screamed at me, saying I made no sense- that I was too immature to know what I was saying, and ignored me for a day or two. she ignored me a lot. I've never heard her apologize to me in my fucking life.

my father was an alcoholic. he never hit me, but he was the one person I cared about as a child because I couldn't find the same thing in my mother, and when I saw him drinking vodka until he passed out in the bathroom every weekend, or I'd be forced to go on "drives" with him because he felt so good and confident when he was drunk and I was too afraid to say 'no' as an 8-year-old, it caused me unbearable fear and pain. the best part is that my fucking mother never tried to intervene, emotionally distant as she was. now, I can't even listen to a friend or coworker talk about drinking without clamming up. when I hear close friends or my boyfriend mention it, even in passing, I start to have flashbacks and a panic attack. I go into the fetal position and start crying and screaming if it gets really bad. I feel so fucking socially isolated because of this. I hate alcohol and I fucking hate its smell and I hate that even now when my father has stopped drinking entirely, I'm always on edge, and that when people mention it around me, I stop talking and zone out, and that I seem to not be able to go to any social gathering because of this.

i grew up in one of the most rich suburbs in america, but my family isn't well-off. I'm currently in college. my school system was incredibly rigorous and I was taking college-level courses in sophomore year. junior and senior year, when my anxiety and depression intensified, I was taking nearly 6-8 college courses worth of work, with no socialization, plus wrestling myself out of a toxic friend group. when i hear people who say they had friends in high school, or was truly friendly with others in high school, I can't help but laugh. the friends I had in high school fucked me up, and let me know that I'm forgettable and not worth standing up for. the only 2-3 friends i have from high school, all of whom were kind of social outcasts, all grapple with serious psychological issues, due to bullying and social isolation.

I've been saving up what I can financially with an on-campus job into a savings account with my 50k debt that I will have, half of which my father will pay for. I have a great therapist, I have nearly a 4.0 in college, I can functionally take care of myself, but I still struggle to find a reason to live.

my close friend told me the other day she still cuts and that her friend at college called the police on her because she asked for her cutting tools back from him, which he had taken away from her. she had to go to the hospital from how much she cut herself another time. I didn't even know about this until I saw her in person for this winter break.

I've been at my parents' house for the holidays and my suicidal ideation and thoughts, both of which i'm generally able to keep at bay when I'm at college, have become overwhelming. I curse the structure of my house for not having a place to hang a noose and I curse myself for not having the confidence to go to the river at the end of my street and just finish my life. 

I tell my boyfriend, who I truly love but have serious problems expressing this feeling, that I want to kill myself every day. He hasn't had the kind of experiences with mental health that i have had, and he sometimes says things that makes it worse (arguing with me about my worth, threatening to call the cops, for example) and I'm terrified he'll call the cops on me, or have an emotional breakdown himself and say he can't take me anymore. 

Right now I'm stable, but just an hour ago I was looking up ways to kill myself. My emotional/mental stability are practically nonexistent; this morning at Christmas, I couldn't bring myself to even fake a smile as I opened the gifts my parents bought for me. It was hard enough as it was to make myself not burst out crying, because all these gifts are, are shit my mom bought for me to try and prove she "loves" me, which is hard to believe considering the times i've thrown myself down stairs, stabbed myself with objects, and slammed my head against walls ever since I was a young child in order to get her attention because I was so fucking desperate. So, so fucking desperate to have a parent to unconditionally love me, not ignore me and "forget" to make meals for me for a week because she's moody or some dumb fuckshit. 

All i've been taught in my life is that I'm worthless. I'm worthless because I couldn't make my dad happy enough, so he had to drink to smile and be happy and enjoy life; I'm worthless because my mom always reminded me of it, slamming doors in my face and mocking how stupid I was compared to her, ignoring me for days on end because she's "upset"; I'm worthless because now i've become manipulative and abusive myself to my own boyfriend whom I love; I'm worthless because I don't even know how to help my friend who cuts herself and had to go to the hospital for how deeply she cut herself, and uses sex to forget her pain.

I'm in so much fucking pain, but I can't even bring myself to cry writing this. I'm just numb, and I curse myself for not having the courage to end it all. I know I probably won't do it, but just living in this void between life and death is worse than death itself, and I just wish it'd all fucking end, whether it means for the better or worse.
