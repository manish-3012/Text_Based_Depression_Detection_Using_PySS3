Why does it really matterHey I probably wonâ€™t really ever come back to this but I just want a place to put how I feel. I feel like I just am a waste of space with no point in life. I feel like I canâ€™t ever really make friends and everyone hates me. I try to be nice and be generous but that seems to just get people to take advantage of me. What difference does it all make it the first place itâ€™s not like it really matters Iâ€™m just gonna end up dead anyhow. If Iâ€™m going to end up dead eventually and my life will have no impact, then what is even the point of living it at all.
