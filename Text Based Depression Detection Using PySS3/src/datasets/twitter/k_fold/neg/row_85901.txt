Went for a walkLeft a party to go on a walk. Watched cars speed down the road. Sat in the street for a moment, and waited. No cars came Clearly I survived, but I wish I didn't.My walk only ended because someone else was walking, and when I heard their footsteps and their car start, I ran. Crazy how fast some people drive on a thirty mile road. Probably gonna talk to my mother about it when she gets me in the morning. Unfortunately I'm entirely sober. I have work tomorrow, and I can't call off since I already did last week. Nobody here(at the party) knows what I did I just walked out the front door. Now everyone's asleep and I can't. It feel sickening just being alive. 

I told a girl at school I was gonna buy drugs and overdose, she thinks I'm joking, I said it was a cry for help. She said, "your face is a cry for help." 

A teacher told me I had potential, but I don't try to live up to it. Soon after told him I was trying. Guess he would be disappointed. 

I chased a drunk girl down the road because she wanted to go to the elementary playground. I gave her a piggy back ride back to the party. The other sober girl told her we have more alcohol so she wanted to go back. That was cool.
