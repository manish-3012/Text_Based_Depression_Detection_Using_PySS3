Killing myself after I move out.I've touched on my family trouble and dysfunction briefly on this site and nothing's gotten better, so as soon as I find some place to run away to, I'm going to commit suicide. The reason I won't do it now is because I'm scared of what my father will do the rest of the family, especially my brother and my mother. He doesn't like me, but it'll be one less human to bully around the house, and he'll probably murder someone after my death, so I'm job-searching so I can buy an apartment or just move somewhere else, convince my family I'm alright long enough for them not to panic, and then I'll finally end my misery. 

Therapy doesn't help. My meds didn't help. My friends can't help. I suffer from severe mental and physical illnesses. I hate my sexual orientation and gender issues. I hate being such a sensitive, whiny sack of shit. I hate being so obsessive. I hate myself. 

But, I just can't end it yet, because I want to keep the peace in a house that has beaten and abused me to being this way. 

If you read all of this, thanks.
