Facebook friendI have a girl on Facebook. We have never really met or talked much, but she seems like a great person. Recently she has been posting statuses eluding to being depressed and â€œending it.â€ Stuff like â€œIâ€™m going to throw a death day party. No crying, just loveâ€ and â€œI know how Iâ€™ll do itâ€ and stuff. Iâ€™ve reached out to her on messenger and asked if she was okay and stuff. She said she broke up with her bf and life was rough lately. I told her she could vent to me and I was there to talk but she didnâ€™t really say much after that. 

Iâ€™m not sure what to do- I donâ€™t know how to help. Iâ€™m considering talking to the police about her wellness, but Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s the right decision. 

Any advice?
