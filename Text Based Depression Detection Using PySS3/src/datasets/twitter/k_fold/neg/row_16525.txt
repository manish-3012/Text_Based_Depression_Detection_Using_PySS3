Wasting my life being a clutterbug. Can't find something im good at that people and opposite sex is attracted to. Feeling like a failure ðŸ˜žJust sitting on my phone all day everyday, wasting my time with shit and have a few friends that it's too embarrassing to talk to. Plus, the women thing is so upsetting for me which is wack. Just feeling kinda like a stupid nice guy.
