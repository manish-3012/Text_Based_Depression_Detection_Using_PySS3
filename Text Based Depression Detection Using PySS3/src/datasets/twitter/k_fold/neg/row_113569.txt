I want to kill myself.I want to kill myself. Iâ€™m just scared of the pain. I donâ€™t know the easiest and quickest way to do it. What if I fail? 

Iâ€™m a nobody. As someone has told me, I â€œlove being miserable, love being sad, love crying.â€ And â€œalways have a fucking gray cloud over my headâ€. 

I have nothing. I didnâ€™t choose to be here. I donâ€™t want to deal with the pains of this world. All I do is cry. Iâ€™m taking medicine, Iâ€™ve tried working out, Iâ€™ve tried dieting, Iâ€™ve tried talking to people, tried journaling, painting, golfing, everything I can think of. Nothing makes me happy. I donâ€™t love myself. How can I love another then? 

I want to die. I want to be gone from this world.
