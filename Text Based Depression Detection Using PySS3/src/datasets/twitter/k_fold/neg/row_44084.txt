The person I'm in love with lied to me.I started talking to this guy a few months ago and everything was going fine. We talk 24/7 and we even started planning to meet up. He told me that he was 25 but turns out he was lying about his age the whole time and he is actually 17 (almost 18). I've always been honest with him about everything and it hurts so much to know that he lied to me for months.
I just feel like I can't trust him anymore. He was the only person I trusted. I feel betrayed. 

I told him that it's not a big deal and I still wanna meet up but my suicide thoughts got worse and I'm just sad all day. I know it would hurt him so much if I kill myself so I can't do this to him.
