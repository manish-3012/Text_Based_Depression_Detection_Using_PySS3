Iâ€™m being watched.I have episodes of complete anxiety. Iâ€™m have a feeling. Iâ€™m being watched and I can feel it. Someone is in my house. Watching me. They are after me. I canâ€™t find them and I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Sorry for posting again but I wanted to know if anyone else got these feelings.
