Pushing people away?In the past six months I have attempted suicide four times. Two of which were serious and that my family and friends know of, including my ex who plays a part in due to a break-up.

Lately I have been getting the feeling that people don't care anymore. They simply ignore me or get pissed at me for being depressed and suicidal. Only my brother still seems to genuinely care.

My ex, who left me but wanted to stay friends, has blocked me. She said she cares and hopes I get better, but that she can't stick around. Of all people, I need her the most. I need to just talk to her. She won't. I have already sent her a farewell letter, but even to that she did not reply...

I am surrounded by people, but I feel alone in every way except physically.

I don't see any other way than to do a fifth attempt...
