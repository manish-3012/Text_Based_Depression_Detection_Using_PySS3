Giving myself 6 more daysI'm meeting my girlfriend Tuesday and then I have work Thursday.. I would feel bad if they had to find someone else to cover my shift. I am so tired of everything and I've even asked for help here. Seems like next Friday, the 14th is the day to kill myself. See you later world.
