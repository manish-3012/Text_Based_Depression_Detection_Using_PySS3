5 months is too long. Goodbye.For years, after struggling with my sexuality, as well as mental disorders, I'm starting to believe it's impossible for me to make it any further. My family has hated me ever sine I came out of the closet as gay, doing as much as they can to belittle me in every possible way. Due to mental reasons, I'm unable to hold up a job, so I'm called useless.

 A useless faggot who serves no other purpose other than to sit at home, unable to get out of the house and speak with people who have a higher average intelligence than that of a doorknob. It's another 5 months until I'm finally able to get out of  this house, where I would attempt to find an apartment with a source of income from government money for basically being retarded. I've already broken down mentally and emotionally several times over the last month, and it's quickly spiraling out of control. If I don't get out soon, I'm going to go insane. I have no where to go until then, and I don't want to continue my life with my abusive family. As far as I see it, there's only one way for me to get out. I'm sorry to anyone I know who may be reading this, and I'm sure life would get better if I could just hold on, but it's just too hard. Goodbye.
