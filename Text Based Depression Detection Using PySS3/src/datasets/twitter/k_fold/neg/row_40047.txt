I'm about to give a speech which will determine whether I fail or get into collegeI have autism and social anxiety. I've practiced the speech but last time I did one the start of the school (we have two, one already did and another one at the end of January), I got low marks despite practicing many times.

&amp;#x200B;

If I fail this, I don't get into college as two speeches make up 50% of my final mark. What can I do?
