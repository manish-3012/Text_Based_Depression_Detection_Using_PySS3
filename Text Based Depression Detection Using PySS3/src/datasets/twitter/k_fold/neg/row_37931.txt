Itâ€™s 4:29 AM and iâ€™m thinking of doing it.I fear death, but Iâ€™m constantly thinking of committing suicide. I struggle heavily with social anxiety and iâ€™m entirely unable to live my daily life, i think about how i could end it all. though i promise myself i would never attempt to harm myself, i find myself thinking of the outcomes, I would be disappointed in myself for wasting my loved onesâ€™ time, draining their resources, and causing them so much trouble. I desperately need someone, please.
