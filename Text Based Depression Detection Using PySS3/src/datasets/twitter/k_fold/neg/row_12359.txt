Homeless again in 7 daysMy doctor dropping me as a client because of personal bias, leaves me to go through severe benzodiazepine withdrawal which is exacerbated by having no support system, have to be out of my apt within the week. I don't see any light, I'm so so tired of carrying this even when i'm "Happy". I just don't know, I'm sure this breaks some rule or something how I typed it I just would rather talk to reddit then cause some huge panic for myself with a mobile crisis unit...help please, i don't believe god has forsaken me
