I don't know what to do.I can't think without even having this sensation of emptiness. I have only one good friend who'll stick by my side, but I can't continue living this life anymore. My life is an endless cycle of keeping with my parents' standards and expectations, but I always fail to meet up with them. I'll never have a partner in my life because of my dull personality, my confidence is always low because I'm not the most handsome dude. All these problems cloud my head on a daily basis, and I don't have any solutions to them. I'm really considering suicide as my way out; I plan to kill my self on January 6, 2018. I'll write a letter to my closest friends and family before I go. I'm just so tired of living like this.
