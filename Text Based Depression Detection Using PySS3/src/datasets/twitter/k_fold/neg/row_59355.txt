i just want to be happyi honestly can't remember a time when i was actually happy. the only nice times are when i'm distracting myself on the internet, and it's ruining my life. i can't get anything done because if i'm not distracted my mind will wander and i'll end up unhappy. i'm always just so sad and angry and i don't know how to make it stop. i just want it to stop. i tried to tell my dad but all he does is guilt trip me for it. i don't know what to do.
