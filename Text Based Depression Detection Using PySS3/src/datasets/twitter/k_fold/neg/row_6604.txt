The source of my suicidal thoughts and depression is being forever aloneI met this girl we hit it off well we had a lot in common same interest in anime and music,I asked her on a date and she agreed(I didnt ask her right away we messaged each other for about 4 months first)We went to a restaurant to eat and then we saw a movie that date was magical it was like a dream I was so happy I thought I finally found someone who would love me I really thought she was into me she was always smiling making eye contact and she even let me hold her hand,but after that day it all went to shit,she became more distant I tried asking for another date but she made a lame excuse then went to ignoring me, I said fine I give up,why does this shit happen to me with every female I try to get with?Im a freaking a 25 year old kisslessvirgin for fucks sake!,I dont think im that bad looking I take care of myself go to the gym,eat healthy and shower every day ,on top of that I have to work a shitty construction job to pay my dentist bills and also help my family with the bills because fuck this economy,If I had a lovely girlfriend to come home to after a hard day of work I would be a lot more motivated to get up at 5am every day for work,Is anyone else like me?fallen into deep depression because they cant find any love? What's the point of living if I am doomed to be alone forever...
