NYE ;(Im alone, and forever will be alone. I have nobody. I just wanna talk to someone.. I just wanna have a friend who would care for me..Not pretend to then a week later forget im a person.. I just wanna die..Maybe this will be the last New Year I will see, The last breath I will take, The last blink I will have, and the last Moment I will live...
