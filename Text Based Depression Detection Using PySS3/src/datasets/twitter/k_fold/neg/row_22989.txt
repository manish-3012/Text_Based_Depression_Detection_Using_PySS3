What dehell am I supposed to do now? Need best advice ever.Hello, I'm currently have major issues and I can't escape from it. I currently have tinnitus ringing in both my ears and it's loud. I have a fuked up spine where I move around and also I lost feeling down my private area from it. I have hypothyroidism and get depressed. OCD from germaphobic tendencies. No friends or anyone talk to which fine I just block them after they use me and throw me away like a used condom. Everyone in life growing up was super hard on me. I'm tired and want someone love me back. I tried my best and got my bachelors in accounting but still more to go from there. I'm poor so I can't use assisted suicide sadly how expensive it is. I don't know why I'm writing this post I don't know what to do. I'm anxious all the time. Okay thanks for reading.
