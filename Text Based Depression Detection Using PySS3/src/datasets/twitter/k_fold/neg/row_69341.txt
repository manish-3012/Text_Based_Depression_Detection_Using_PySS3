Considering going out on my own terms but donâ€™t know if that is the fear and stress talking or notCurrent total pill out: approx 117 
Yeah I know  

Hereâ€™s the backstory to my past 72 hrs  
My parents who support me, are in the process of being tested for Covid. Both of them. They have a lot of the symptoms. My moms friend and her friendâ€™s husband is on a respirator. 

Im emotionally exhausted. I just want to go. I want to leave earth. Iâ€™ve had enough. Between my real father, my ex best friend suicide attempt last year, and this. Iâ€™m ready to go. I canâ€™t fight anymore and I donâ€™t have help.
