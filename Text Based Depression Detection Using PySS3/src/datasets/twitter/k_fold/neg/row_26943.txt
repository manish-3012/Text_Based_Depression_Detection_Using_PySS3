I'm really trying to beat this with a passion, but I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle.There's not even really a reason, save POTENTIALLY my ex breaking up with me. That was months ago, though, and I'm over her almost entirely--sometimes a little pain, but never horridly much and never for longer than a few minutes. I know there are things to be positive about--new roommate, I'm trying to develop friendships and some are flowering quite nicely, and I'm stellar academically (not this semester due to my horrible sadness). Chicks dig me when I'm funny and confident, and I realized a few days ago that I definitely can be still!

But it just isn't enough. The blows knock me down a whole bunch of pegs, and the blows aren't even that bad. By the end of the day I feel broken, and suicidal thoughts have been steadily building and building and building and building. Right now I'm sitting next to an unloaded rifle, and have no intention of loading it soon. But I fear one day that the horrible cold emptiness will become so much that I get rash enough to load the barrel. 

I cannot do this. I can't go back to this school that bores me, surrounded by people that only have half interest in me. It's been two months since the relationship ended, but several months before that since I've been continuously sad, and I don't think I have the energy to keep trudging myself along much further. I don't want to hurt people that care about me, or people that think they don't, but I just don't want to anymore. I'm so very tired, and just want to sleep for a very long time.
