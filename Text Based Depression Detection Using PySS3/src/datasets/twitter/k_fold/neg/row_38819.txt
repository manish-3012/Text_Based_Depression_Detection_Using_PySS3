Am I missing something?Why am I always just sad? I haven't had a day where I haven't felt like I should just disappear. I just watch videos about suicide online and how easy it is. I've even thought about what I'd write on my note that I'd leave behind. I have a friend who knows about what I feel like but after I told him I still felt empty. I've tried telling my parents but I chickened out after crying a bit. By the way this is my first post on Reddit and might be my last depending on how I feel after posting this. I'm sorry to be a burden to you guys.
