I feel like Iâ€™m only postponing my suicide.Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was 13, but I didnâ€™t kill my self because I thought it would get better. That was 6 years ago and everything has gotten worse. Iâ€™ve gotten more and more mentally ill. My situation has gotten worse. The world has gotten worse. I really feel like Iâ€™m supposed to go through with this sooner or later, like Iâ€™m destined to, and everything I do is just postponing the inevitable. Maybe Iâ€™d save me and my friends a lot of hurt if I just gave up.
