Why does it feel like as if nothing helpsI have the feeling as if I have depression my whole life. In my entire childhood I tried to find my place in society. I cant even remember how many people that have left me through hurting me or even by me hurting them while I slowly fade away more from reality every day to not completely lose my mind.
Many doctors and psychologists have tried to fix the broken pieces of my life and gave me some sort of hope but which slowly turned into dust and only worsen ny conditions. Every single day I think of the details on how I will leave this life but the hardest part of it is the question: when?  Maybe life is just not meant for everyone

Is anyone else experiencing this sort of struggle?
