Why does everyone hate me?No one cares about me. Iâ€™m all alone and I donâ€™t know where else to go. I just bother everybody. Itâ€™s like the only time I do anything with someone else is when I basically force them to do something with me. I feel so clingy but Iâ€™m just sad and I have to post here because I have no where else to go
