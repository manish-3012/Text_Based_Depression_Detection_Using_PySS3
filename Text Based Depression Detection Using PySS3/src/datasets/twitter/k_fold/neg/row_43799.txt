For you, dear child.I'm writing this in advance. You will read it when the time is right.

You woke up today a little later than usual, and when you did you wished you were still dreaming. Even that nightmare you had the other night seems preferable to the reality you wake up to every day. Your mother used to be your hero, but ever since she and your father split she's been on a downward spiral. You love her with all of your heart, but deep inside you struggle with your disappointment for what she's become. And your father? Heh, what father?
Your sibling needs attention and ought to get it from your mother, but you feel like it's now your responsibility -- a responsibility you never asked for.
As you lied there in bed, trying to will yourself to wake up, those are just a few of the things that were running through the back of your head.
You almost feel like giving in to substance abuse. You just want to forget your life, and sometimes you've felt like ending it. Remember that time you almost went through with it?
Your friends don't understand the huge amount of stress you deal with on a daily basis. Sure, some of them have stuff to deal with, but can it really compare with the drama in yours?
Your burdens in life are unusually heavy, and, no, it's not fair. But, you don't have to go through it alone. I haven't even talked about the biggest source of drama in your life yet. Sometimes, you just wish you could erase that memory.
I understand it. There's a hug waiting here for you.

You'll read this when the time is right. I'll be here.
