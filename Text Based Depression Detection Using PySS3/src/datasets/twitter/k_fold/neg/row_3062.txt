why do they say, if onlyWhy do people always say, if only...blah blah "insert whatever catch phrase they say" or  I'd known, they had told me, if I had one more chance etc etc. Why won't people do those things right now. When I've clearly stated intentions why do they wait. Why not now? Because they don't really care and all that "if only" stuff is something they say to make themselves feel less guilty for not helping.
