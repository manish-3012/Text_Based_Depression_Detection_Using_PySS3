Why shouldn't i, isnt it all just painI don't want consolation, I don't want someone to talk to. I want to be alone. The world is cold and miserable and every day I wake up thinking I'm better off dead. I honestly didn't think I'd make it this far. I put a smile on my face and I sludge through every day mindlessly wishing I was dead. So why shouldn't I just die.
