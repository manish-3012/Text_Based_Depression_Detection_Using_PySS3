Does anyone else feel like an emotionless robot?Like for real im 18 and the isolation of no friends at my college/high school for 2 years non stop has driven me crazy. Im legitimately starting to think that prolonged isolation has left me scarred in some way I cant relate to the people around me and I feel like a subhuman bottling my emotions up before i cry myself to sleep. I really see no point to life or living, I bullshit myself everyday with lies when in reality my life is a fucking mess and im going nowhere I may aswell end it right fucking now there is no point in existence for me
