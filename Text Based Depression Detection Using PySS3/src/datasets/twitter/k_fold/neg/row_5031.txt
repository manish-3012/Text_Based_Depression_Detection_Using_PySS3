For the first time, I have a life I can fuck upI'm 18 and have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for two years now. I've been drinking too much for six years, and have spent most of my youth distancing myself from everything and everyone. 

For the first time since I can remember I have someone I'm in love with, I'm close to my family and my recovery seems to be getting closer. Still, I'm more miserable than I've ever been. I can't deal with having a life I could easily fuck up. 

Recently I've been going in and out of severe mania. I found a guy online who was willing to meet in a dark field, in the middle of the night, and made out with him just to feel something. I've been drinking nonstop and taken an excess of medication to see if it would kill me by accident. 

I want to fuck up my life, so I have nothing left and kill myself thereafter. 

I can't deal with living my life anymore. No matter how happy I seem, I feel like I'm rotting inside. It all just seems so pointless. 

I'm tired.

I don't want to be alive. 

I've had a plan since I was 15, and have attempted suicide twice now. I'm just waiting for my recklessness to kill me, or to have pushed away all I love so I can go without the worry about those people. 

 I have a family history of mental illness and suicide. My grandmother is a selfish alcoholic. I'm scared I'll end up like her if I don't end it soon.
