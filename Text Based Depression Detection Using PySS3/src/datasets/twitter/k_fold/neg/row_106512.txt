This is mainly me venting.  I went through a terrible break-up and am still dealing with the fallout.Dear My Horrible Ex:

The worst thing about you is that you will go to your deathbed believing you got the raw end of the breakup. You will believe this even though you got to keep the house. You will believe this even though I paid for most of that house. You will believe this even though you stole from me so you would continue to pay for less than half of the house after you threw me out. You will believe this even though the share of rent you actually do pay is less than what you paid for your apartment by $300 or more. You will believe that even though you had free car insurance for six months AFTER because I paid for it. Even though you can unilaterally ruin my credit rating any day by not paying the rent or have me fined by canceling MY car insurance. Which you could do any goddamn day that you wanted. You will believe that you lost even though you aren't the one who's homeless and jobless now.

You ruined my life and got away with it. You treated me like shit, had the unmitigated gall to kick me out because I was unhappy after being treated like shit, and you will never have the decency to acknowledge that you WON.
Maybe you don't think you won because you didn't get quite everything that you wanted. You know that every day I was with you since the day after Christmas, I wanted to kill myself. You know that you were listed as the beneficiary of my account if I ever had the courage to kill myself. You also knew that I was prone to depression and self-harm, and so you pushed and pushed and PUSHED. You called me retarded. You called me a pedophile. You said living with me was like living with a heroin addict. You isolated me from the only people I knew in Dallas and LAUGHED when I told you how that hurt. Then you told me I had low self-esteem and took me to a therapist--a therapist YOU LIED TO and made ME lie to--who told me I was a bad person because I had low self-esteem. Then you started worked from home while I was stewing in my own self-loathing over not having a job just to rub it in mu face. When I was enjoying myself in Houston, you asked for permission to watch two of your married friends fuck (which you would NOT have asked if you didn't want to, not matter how loudly you tell everyone how ugly you think the wife in that pair is), and then told me I was an asshole for giving you permission even though I didn't want you to, as if I could ever have stopped you. And the very fucking day I got back from Houston, you told me you were through with me and that I should go back.
I know you wanted me to kill myself so you could have the rest of my money. You said otherwise, but: (1) you are a liar, and (2) even then, even when I told you point-blank that I had thought about killing myself all morning one day, what you /actually/ objected to was me killing myself in such a way that you or your daughter would see the body. You wanted me dead or in jail or confined to a goddamn nuthouse, you just didn't want to be bothered by a corpse.

Do you have any conception of what it's like to live under the kind of threat you pose to me? Any day you wanted, you could take pictures of your daughter in the bathtub, email them to me, and then call the police and have me arrested for possession of child porn. Even if the charges didn't stick, my life and career would be over, and you know this because that's why you threatened to call the cops on me before. You could also call a nuthouse and tell them how I was suicidal for three months and bashed my head against the patio and have me committed, which I know you know is possible because you know how to fucking Google. And if you ever decide you want some extra spending money, you can unilaterally cancel my car insurance and have me fined or arrested. You already took $9300 from me that you KNEW should have gone to the landlords when you KNEW I wasn't thinking right, so don't you dare say you would never do that, don't you fucking DARE. You even asked for a cashier's check for that money! You PLANNED for that!* And, of course, since you already have that money, there's nothing stopping you of you decide to skip town and leave the rent unpaid, which I can't afford to pay on my $0/year income and which would kill my credit rating. You have literally all the cards. Hell, I bet you even have my bank account and Social Security numbers too. For the rest of my life, I have to live in fear of the day you decide to go "fuck it" and destroy me.

And I know that day will come. You have no incentive not to. You have demonstrated that you are a liar, so whatever you say to the contrary is bullshit. You already have everything you can legally get from me, and now you know you're not on the beneficiary list any more, so if I do decide to kill myself, you won't get a cent. And you have a history of making my life so miserable that I wanted to die every single day for three months AND YOU KNEW THAT EVEN THEN. If half of what you said about how much you hated being with me is true, I'm surprised you haven't tried any of these by now. And if it isn't true, well, I already know you are a liar, so that's no surprise.

Before I met you, I had a job and a home and a life. After I met you, I lost my job, and now I have no home and no life. And you want more. You know I have nothing left to give, and you want more and more and more. That's why you kicked me out on my broken ankle after I lost my job: because I told you no, you COULDN'T look through my phone records that day. And you still looked up my browser history on my computer, which you had promised you would never do again. You just couldn't stand ever not getting your way: the school wasn't zoned just right, so you lied to them and implicated me and my mom in that lie; your therapist (she was never my doctor and you know it) "wasn't the right one," so you lied to her and made me lie, even though what we were lying about was the entire reason for going to therapy; I didn't give you complete access to my every private thought and conversation, so you lied to me and got it anyway and threw me out of my house.

Maybe I will kill myself one day, now that you know you won't materially benefit. Or maybe not. My sudden death might make you happy even if you don't get any money, and I would gladly make myself suffer through any torment or indignity if it would result in you being unhappy. Torments like being a fat, homeless, jobless loser whose ex is going to have arrested for being a pedophile or sent to a nuthouse for having been suicidal. Whatever I decide, I have nothing more to say to you. Until the car insurance runs out or you decide you need my signature to sublet the house** I will never speak to you again. 

I've said about all I can say for now, so I'll leave things at that. I hope you've gotten some use out of those season tickets I got for you and that your married friends are as good in bed as you wanted them to be.

*It must have killed you that I didn't kill myself after that--then you would have gotten the rest /and/ gotten to keep the cats.
** That's another lie: you don't want to let the landlords know for some reason I cannot fathom. Remember how you said, "If you have to keep it a secret, then it's cheating?" Well, going by your logic, you're trying to cheat the landlords out of something.
