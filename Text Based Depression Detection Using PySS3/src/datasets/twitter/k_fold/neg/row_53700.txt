I'm new hereI honestly don't know how this works. I just needed a new platform to vent freely on. Twitter was becoming too well known for my circle of friends and family. I rather them not see my thoughts but I have to project them online, not for attention but for help. People feel ways and sometimes others can relate. Strangers, if you will, don't judge as harshly as acquaintances and family would. Its contradictory considering that social media is a breeding ground for judgemental trolls. Maybe I'm just rambling. Here's a little about myself if you're still interested  reading this post. I'm 29 years old and I live in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder,  PTSD and of course coupling with that came my lovely anxiety. I cannot begin to tell you when this all came about, but I can tell you I lost a good job over it and can no longer get it back. I was denied unemployment for it. I do not receive disability checks. I barely work due to a back issue. I live with my grandparents who are in need of care...my grandfather not so much because he kind of closed off from the rest of the family. He has COPD and a host of other ailments. My grandmother is on dialysis 3 times a week. I have no children, I am not married. I was in an on and off again 10 year toxic and sometimes abusive relationship. I don't have many friends except for 2 in North Carolina who I know I burden the most. My mother is diabetic...and lost her position at work where she was able to maintain her health, but now this position has her on her feet every day all day. Which HURTS ME. Because if you know anything about diabetes,  your feet HAVE to be taken care of.

Here I go rambling again. 

Bruh idk where I'm even going with this but nice to meet yall. Hope you can save me soon.
