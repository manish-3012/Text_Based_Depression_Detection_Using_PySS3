I don't even want to get help.Everyone tells me it gets better.

That's a fucking lie. I'm so ruined that even if I 'got better,' all I'm doomed with is a life of regret and mediocrity.

I never got a childhood like everyone else. I'm barely even a human. I got called a robot again recently. I can't even deny it. I don't know what to do I just want to fucking not exist and the only reason I haven't is because I'm too weak to do it.
