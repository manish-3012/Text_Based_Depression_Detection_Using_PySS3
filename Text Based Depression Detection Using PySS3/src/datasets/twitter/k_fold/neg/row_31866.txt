No chances leftI fucked up in life. I'm 25. I dropped out of high school- which made me not able to receive any grants or scholarships. Then I tried college and failed out of that. No I'm unemployed and almost homeless. But I studied in school, I guess just not hard enough. I just don't know what to do anymore. Ive been applying to places and no one will hire me. I genuinely want to kill myself and just might before by boyfriend gets home before 9.
He'd probably be happy about me dying bc i won't be around anymore. He's always being condescending and thats getting to me too.
The reason I'm unemployed is bc I was pregnant a few months ago and while at work I kept fainting. I asked my boss if I could work lesser paced shift due to me becoming pregnant and he wasn't willing to budge. So I lost my job and now I'm here but ill just be dead soon, so yeah
