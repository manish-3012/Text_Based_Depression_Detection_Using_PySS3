My dad said he was proud of me.It finally happened. I have been waiting for this moment for a very long time. And it finally happened. I've never wanted anything else in life. The successful career, the loving family, the lifelong friends. I lost feeling for those dreams a long time ago. I think of them still sometimes but my body has long stopped reacting. 

But there has always been that warmth and fuzziness whenever I thought about my Dad and the hope of him saying he was proud of me. And there were many nights I cried thinking of him dying before he could say it. But now he has. 
And I didn't feel a thing. 

Just the same sinking feeling that has swallowed everything else inside me. And it's finally taken my last hope with it too. I smiled at him when he said it. And he smiled back. And then we talked about something else. And that was it. I didn't feel a thing. I tried to make myself cry after but I suppose that's gone too.

That was the only thing I had to live for. I just wished I could have felt something when it came. 

I'll see y'all in another life.
