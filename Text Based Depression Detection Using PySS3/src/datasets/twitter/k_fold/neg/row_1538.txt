HelpI was born into a strict Vietnamese family.
Itâ€™s just me &amp; my brother &amp; my parents.
To other kids, I had a perfect life. 
They thought my parents had money and crap
and that I would be so happy with how much
theyâ€™d spoil me. My parents are strict and have
high expectations. High grades, Do alot of chores,
and stuff. I get burnt out. Iâ€™m tired. I feel alone. 
I have no one to talk to. I just got out of an 
relationship. I have mood swings and when I canâ€™t
control it I lash out at my parents and they get pissed
off and yell at me or hit me and it never gets better.
Iâ€™m only a teenager, I have hormones everywhere but
they donâ€™t understand. I get hit and lectured everytime I speak English at home. And to my friends,
Iâ€™m just seen as a rich Asian girl living her best life.
I want to die. I sit in my bathroom and cry because thats the only place I can cry without someone yelling
at me. I go through so much drama. I get hurt mentally all the time. My dad has anger problems, a short temper, and he always lashes out on me. I want to call the Suicide Prevention Line but Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t because my dad checks who I call. I want to let them know how I feel because I really want to seek help because theyâ€™re the type of people who donâ€™t care and get pissed off when I talk about how I feel. If I told them, theyâ€™d say Iâ€™m full of bullshit. I donâ€™t know what to do. I have no one to talk to. Iâ€™m afraid of killing myself but it seems like a choice for me.
