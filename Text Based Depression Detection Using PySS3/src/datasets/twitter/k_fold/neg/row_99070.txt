Broken and desperateAfter yet another physical assult from my boyfriend of 13 years tonight and I find myself again looking for a way out.

I have scars all over my body. I have new bruises on my face, arms and legs. I think, "Fuck him, this is the last time." But then I remember that I AM responsible for my actions, and therefore his. I shouldn't talk when he tells me not to, I don't have any right to argue with him. I am creating this and brining it on myself. I am evil for making him snap again; I brought it on myself. He hates me as much as I hate myself.

Every time I think I'm entitled to move on to 'a better life', I remember that I don't have any place and never will. No one will ever truly love or appreciate me, because there's nothing about me to love or appreciate. 

I desperately want out but I'm too much of a failure to even accomplish that.
