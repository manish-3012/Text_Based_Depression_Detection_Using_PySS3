Thank you Reddit comrades.About a months ago, I was gonna do it. No one liked me, I was a piece of sh\*t and don't deserve to live anymore. At least that's how I saw it. Friends were no help, and I couldn't talk to anyone in the family because it wasn't something I was comfortable talking about.

So I turned to you guys for help and you were one of the only reasons I can write these words.

I just wanted to thank you guys on here for just talking to us and that you really change lives of the people you talk to. Please keep on commenting on these posts.

To all people who suffer the same shit that have, just talk to someone about it. You think it doesn't do anything but it does, it helps. Please reach out to anyone you can.

Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                          -Joseph, a thankful git.
