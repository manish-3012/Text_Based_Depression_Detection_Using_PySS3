I'm really getting fed up with this life.I'm a 24 year old iranian and well someone used my name to steal lots of money from some people i tried defending myself but no one except my parents believe me, I had some evidence but court system in iran is really primitive and they just don't give a shit when you bring prints from internet that you didn't do something.


We don't have enough money to hire a lawyer and cost of traveling to courts all over country to get redemption from the victims is more than i could ever make i try to keep a happy face in front of my parents but it just hurts so much feeling of anger ,helplessness and extreme stress is making me go insane.
