How to deal with friendship/protecting friend's feelings when about to die?I have this friend I care a lot about, I only know her online though, and I don't want her realize I've died/killed myself. Something that happened between us recently means that if I did do it and she knew, I think she couldn't help feel she was somehow responsible even though its definitely not her fault. So it feels like drifting away from her or telling her we should stop being friends is the best idea so that she doesn't realize/guess what i've done, or notice me "disappearing" and never contacting her ever again. I feel horrible about the idea of telling her I want to stop being friends though or just disappearing on her with no explanation. I can't think of any way to make it easier on her whatever option or lie I choose to hide whats going to happen. It just seems like I have to choose the "lesser evil". thank you for any thoughts on it.
