I want to kill myself but my friends keep getting in the wayI don't mean in that they helping but that I keep having arugments with them or I ask if I can talk about something (unrelated to sucide) and then put me on hold. So I can't kill myself without people thinking it because of that and it's so fucking annoying because I fed up with people misunderstooding me it's been a constant fucking thing that keeps happening and just want my death to be understood but I get annoyed that all these things get in the way and people will selfishly make it about themselves
