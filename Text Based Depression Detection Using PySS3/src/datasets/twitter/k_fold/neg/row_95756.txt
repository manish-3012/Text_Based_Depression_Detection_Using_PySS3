Practical SuicideI lost my job. I cannot afford to buy the medication I need to live. I was denied coverage by Medicaid. There are no state resources.

After twenty-five interviews and zero job offers I have no other choice. I have changed my resume, my interview style, appearance, everything. Nothing budges.

Now it is a matter of practicality. An animal who is not allowed to participate in the economy nor are they allowed medication that will help them to live.

I'm just saving America money with a cheap and easy method.

I won't beg to live anymore. Comfort is beyond my reach. 

God bless America.
