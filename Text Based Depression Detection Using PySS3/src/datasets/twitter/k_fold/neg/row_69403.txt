I'm only 19 years old and I wanna kill myself so badI'm 19 years old. I've lost both my biological parents to suicidal. I've lost my grandma who's raised me. I'm a high school drop out who's depressed and bi polar. I feel like my life is already over. I only have my grandpa who will die soon ish and my dog who I'm scared to lose. If this is the only quality of life I'll have what's the point. I feel like I'm being cruel to myself by living. I try to stay positive but my friends treat me badly and I'm so scared of being alone. I'm so fucking scared of being lonely. The friends I've made on Reddit are helpful but I'm losing the battle and it's so hard. I need help please. Just anyone. I don't wanna get older. I don't want things to change. I need help. I need love. I wanna stay 19. I want my grandpa and dog to live forever. I'm sorry this is all over the place but I'm losing my mind. I love you all. Please say you love me too
 Or say anything really.
