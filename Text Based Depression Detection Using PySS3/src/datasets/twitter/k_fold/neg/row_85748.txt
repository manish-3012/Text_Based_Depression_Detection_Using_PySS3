im a burden to everyonei have a plan for killing myself. i'll do it in august (i just want to see my friends in school for the last time). 

i feel like my family will get mad when i do it. i am just a glorified helper to them after all. they'll probably feel inconvenienced with my death, saying shit like "ah, another problem," or like "who's gonna do the chores assigned to her now." well that's their problem now, lol.

my friends are too busy tonight. it's not their job to be open all the time, of course. i just wanted to rant, but i don't want to be a shithead and ruin their fun time. i'm already a burden to them as i am. i don't want to make it worse for them.
