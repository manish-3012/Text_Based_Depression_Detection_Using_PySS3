I need someone to talk too....Lately I've been thinking about killing myself. My parents are physically and emotionally abusive, the only person i have actually trusted has well betrayed me :( And I don't have any friends to turn too. I can't afford college even though I got in. Is life even worth it? These last 4 years of my life have been hell. I was always told that if I worked hard, I could accomplish my dreams. But as of right now, I'm alone, and a failure.
