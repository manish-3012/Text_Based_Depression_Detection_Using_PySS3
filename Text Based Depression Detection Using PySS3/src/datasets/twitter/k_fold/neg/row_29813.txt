I don't know why I keep goingI've had depression and social anxiety for as long as I can remember. I can barely function on my own, but I've found I can pull myself together when I'm around others. I fall apart when I'm alone. I only really talk to 5 people, all of whom have other friends and lives. I can't constantly be around them, but these thoughts come back whenever I'm alone. I'm so unhappy with myself that I can't be alone without wanting to die. It feels like it's getting more and more serious. I can't get meds or therapy (it's complicated, I literally can't). I don't know if I should even fight it any more. How can I go on, or should I?
