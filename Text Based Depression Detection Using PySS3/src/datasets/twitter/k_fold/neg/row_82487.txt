This constant worrying is making me physically sick and tonight I'm ready to make it all go away...I gave a guy a blowjob about a month ago and he came in my mouth. I convinced myself, with no evidence and knowing the % of risk, that I have contracted HIV. I've been worrying non-stop and I just can't fucking take it anymore. I'm getting sick also and I think it's the reaction to my body trying to fight off the virus. 

I'm worthless and I can't make good decisions for myself. I lied about being raped by my uncle to my family because I couldn't handle the responsibility of my drunken decision to sleep with him. Being gay and having sex was literally the worst fucking thing to happen to me. 

I have a bottle of NyQuil and a bottle of pain pills from a recent surgery. Help me... I can't take this. I've been tested and it came back negative but I won't know 100% for sure that I don't have HIV until 2 months from now. I can't sit in agony this long. I'm falling apart. Therapy isn't helping. Meds aren't helping.
