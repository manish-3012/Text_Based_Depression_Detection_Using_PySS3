I feel like i've lived out my story.In september, my nearly 5 year relationship ended, and since then, nothing good, or worthy of note has seemed to happen. Im just sad or empty all the time, and people always tell me they're always here for me, but they're also beginning to get bored of be being upset about this.
My ex has moved on and is happy, and despite me being heartbroken about this, I genuinely want him to be happy. 
But also, here is where I feel like maybe I've served my purpose in life, when we first started going with each other, he wasn't in the best place, and he has everything going for him now, maybe I was only here so he could find himself, and now I've lived out my story, and it's time to go.
I always said a break up wouldn't ruin my life, and when I was with him, he wasn't everything in my life, but now we've broken up, there just isn't anything for me to live for anymore.  

I realise I sound pathetic - contemplating suicide over a breakup,  but i've been doing it for months, and i genuinely feel like this is the only way, I cant go on living for no reason. There has been no happiness in my life since then, and nothing that makes me feel like I have reason to be here anymore.

Basically I think I'm done.
I think I've served my purpose.
&amp; I should probably stop burdening everyone with my sadness and depression, and let them enjoy their lives, since I've done what I was put here to do.
