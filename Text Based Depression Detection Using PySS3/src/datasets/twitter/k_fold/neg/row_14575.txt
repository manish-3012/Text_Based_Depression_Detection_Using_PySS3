Some people never get a chance. I got mine.I've seen many posts where people feel hopeless, and how life is unfair and everything. Some people never really even get the chance to be happy.

But I got my chance. I was about to kill myself a few years ago. Then I met her. Then I caused her to leave me because I had a breakdown 1 day which I implicitly said if she left me I would kill myself. That's how she took it at least.

For those saying I'll get another chance, I most likely won't. I'm not interested in anyone else. I had a crush on her for over half a decade and me asking her out last year was what everything built up to. I don't go out. I don't try to meet new people. I don't want to. I just want her.

Well its safe to say I had my chance and I blew it. She has me blocked for months now. I know I'm selfish for doing this, but I send her flowers from time to time even though she has me blocked. When I die, she'll be relieved at least. That I won't be bothering her by sending her flowers anymore.
