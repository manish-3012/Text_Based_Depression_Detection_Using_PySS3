I can do something good in the world. I can end the McSmithsNot a lot of people like me. It's very hard to like me. I'm dense, rude, arrogant, I talk down to people, I turn people down, I am rude to people, I disrespect people. I do all those things to my own fucking girlfriend to the point where she doesn't love me anymore. 

Though it's not too late to good, I can make a sacrifice to the universe that will be great and will benefit many people to come in the next hundreds of years. I can end my fucking line of genetics. 

My great grandfather, my grandfather, my father and I, we're all dense fucking dicks. We're all assholes with barely any friends. All assholes that made people unhappy. All people who lived miserable lives and died from alcoholism one way or another. My grandfather died at 59 by Cardiac Arrest from drinking too much every night and now my father's liver is completely fucked and hes gone in the next 5 years.

I am 17 years old now and I can make change before it's too late. For anonymity, I'll pretend my lastname is McSmith. The McSmith's should no longer exists. We should no longer exist. I will improve the lives, of many fucking people in the future, by simply ending the McSmiths by killing myself. I doubt my dad would create another fuckin kid in the next 5 years and let that kid growup without a dad.

McSmiths shouldn't exist, I lost my girlfriend, she doesn't love me anymore, and it will be nothing but this stupid shit for the rest of my life. I should not waste my time by living my life. I must make a positive sacrifice for the rest of the world by fucking ending it.

Requesting methods that are quick and painless.
