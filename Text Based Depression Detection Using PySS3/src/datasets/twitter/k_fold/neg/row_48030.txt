Opiate Overdoses?I'm extremely suicidal. I've been wanting to do it for a  long time.  I've reached out to people in my life for help, but the siren song doesn't ever go away. The fear of failure has kept me from doing it so far with the small gun I have, a rope, benedryl, slitting my wrists, driving off a bridge, etc. If/when I do this, I'm going to do it right the first time.

I was recently prescribed hydrocodone / acetaminophen 7.5-325 T for a broken leg (accidental believe it or not).  It just occurred to me that this could be another out. Does anyone have any overdose stories they can share?  Honestly, reddit has been the best place for me because of how much people have shared here. For instance, I had no idea too many benadryl doesn't just knock you out and lull you to sleep. Anything helps. Thanks in advance.
