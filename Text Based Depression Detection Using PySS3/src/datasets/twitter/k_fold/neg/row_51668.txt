I hate my body and mind. I wish that I was never born.(sorry for errors and that it's just rambling. Can't be bothered)

It seems like I've lost the genetic lottery - every bad thing about my parents but worse. It has only gone worse since becoming an adult. I'm a almost 21 year old male and I hate my body. I'm standing at barely 5'3" tall, and won't grow anymore. Both my parents are taller.

My hair is thinning on top, like my dad, but earlier. I'm losing something I was proud of and liked, like always. Thick brown locks are being reduced to pathetic strands.

I'm autistic. Aspergers syndrome. Feeling connected and comfortable around others. I've never been in a relationship and is a virgin. I don't think I've even properly kissed. My prospects of intimacy seems more and more laughable. It feels like I've wasted my prime years. The youthful ones. The ones I'll NEVER get back. And I'm wasting my life right now as well.

I can't talk to my parents about it. I still live with them but want to get away from them. Talking about deeper and emotional things with them is impossible. They have never been able to give adequate emotional support. At best I just get to hear myself speak. At worst I feel stupid for my emotional conditions.

Are they even people who should've ever been parents. They should be ashamed to have made an abomination, a walking atrocity, like me. Everyone would've been better off if they just adopted one or two babies. I wouldn't have to exist and they could've dealt with a normal needing child (for better or for worse).

I'll be alone for a while in a couple of hours. I'm thinking about tying a lamp in my room into a noose and hang myself. Or commit a spree killing. I'm just done.
