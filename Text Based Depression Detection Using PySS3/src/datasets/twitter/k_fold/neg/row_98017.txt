See No ReasonI've had major depressive disorder, severe anxiety and insomnia since I was a kid. 18 months ago I met my SO, now diagnosed as BPD, and it's been extraordinarily difficult. I'm now pretty much all she has, and she still treats me like shit half the time. Don't see much reasons to go on, frankly, or drag out what feels inevitable.

Am currently working my way through my first written novel, have been thinking a lot lately about making it my last. Fourth attempt might be the charmer of the lot, I certainly don't see much future for myself besides these cards fate has dealt me.

Constantly in conflict with myself, constantly in pain, this might be a cry for help or I might just wanna say this so it's somewhere. I don't know how to hold all of this load on my shoulders, why bother continuing to try?
