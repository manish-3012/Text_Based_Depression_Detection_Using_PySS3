My life doesnt have any sense.Hi everyone, this is my first time writing on this sub. By the way, english its not my first language (im from Latin America) so please forgive me if i misspelled something wrog. 

I just want to talk about this with someone. Ive been depressed for 8/2 years, i also suffer from anxiety, low-self esteem and insomnia. I feel hopeless, i dont want to go to college anymore, my sex life is frustrating, i start drinking again, im consuming a lot of caffeine, the only good thing, its that i quit smoking, because i can't afford cigarettes.

Right now, my live doesnt have any sense. Â¿why? 

- Im currently 20 years old and i live with my parents at my grandmas home, because i cant find a job.

- I barely have time to be with my friends, because i study all day.

- My family always criticizes me about the things i do. The say that i cant be a Videogame Designer because, in the real world, that its not going to give me any money.

- My girlfriend left me almost 1 year ago, and i really need her; she was the only person that could make me happy, beside my best friends.

- Nobody wants to be with me. Whe they get to know me, they always find out that, i'm really fucked up from the head.

- I have a dysfunctional family, all they do is discuss.

- My parents are very overprotective, they dont let me go alone to many places.

I try to kill myself last week but, it didnt work, the rope wasnt very strong. I was planning to commit suicide today but, i was so depressed that i didnt want to leave the bed.

So thats it, i just want to end with all this pain.
