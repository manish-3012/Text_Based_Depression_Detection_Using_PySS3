Better off dead.For the past few years IÂ´ve been living without a sense of purpose.
Every day I wake up wishing I was dead. IÂ´ve disappointed my parents countless of times, wasted their time and money. Made horrible mistakes, and probably just ruined my future, if I even had one to begin with.
Would it be called "living" if I have no purpose in life? Am I better off dead? I feel like for once in my life IÂ´d be doing my family a favor if I killed myself.
The thought of whatever may come my way frightens me. This isnÂ´t how I thought things would go.
IÂ´m sure IÂ´ll disappoint my parents again today, and IÂ´m afraid that will be my breaking point.
