My lifeI've had suicidal thoughts for months and I can't stop thinking of being forgotten and just upright killing myself. Recently I found out in medical test I took behind my parents back that I have autism and depression. they don't know and say stuff like "Stop yelling at me, I am done with your bs." WELL, I CAN'T HELP IT. I have heightened senses with hearing AND NO ONE EVEN KNEW I HAD AUTISM AND THAT WAS A SYMPTOM. 

And recently I had a dream that my crush was with someone else, I haven't seen her in 2 years.
