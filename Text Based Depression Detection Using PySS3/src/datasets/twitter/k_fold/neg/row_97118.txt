Looking for other optionsSo i'm not sure what other options to try. I cannot go to therapy anymore because they want to institutionalize me. I tried other therapy and they want to do ECT on me. I can't call the hotline anymore when I need distraction and somebody to talk to because they will call the police. I can't talk to friends anymore because they will call the police. I tried medication and it did nothing (other than give me massive headaches at all hours), so I can't try that. I tried exercise for three years but it didn't do anything. I tried vitamin supplements, but those don't do anything. I don't know what else to try. When I want to die, I sometimes break my head on things because nobody can see my bruises under my hair, but that only helps for a few minutes. I want to finish it all right now, but I can't because I don't want to hurt my family. Since I can't go to therapy (DON'T TELL ME TO TRY ANOTHER SHRINK I'VE TRIED SO MANY THAT IT IS A SICK CRUEL JOKE TO TRY ANOTHER I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE), drugs don't work, exercise doesn't work, food doesn't work, what else is there? I refuse to submit myself to an institution or go through ECT. I've had this for over 20 years, so don't tell that it will ever get better. I don't know what else to try.
