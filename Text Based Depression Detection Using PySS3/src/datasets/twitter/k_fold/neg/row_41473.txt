Why do we do this?I don't want internet hugs, I want some real answers.

If I'm this depressed, what am I giving back to society? And aside from the "every life is precious" blanket argument, what is the real value here? There are plenty of people in the world that can take over any gap I might leave.

Living to not make other people sad is weak. People become sad all the time, but they carry on.
