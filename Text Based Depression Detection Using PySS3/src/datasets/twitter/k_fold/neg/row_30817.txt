generally hopeless and full of self-hatredFucked up my studies for the semester I think... Last year I had straight As. Dunno what happened to me. Don't think I can continue this shit, I've already wasted 40 grand, might as well save some parents some money if I'm not going anywhere anyway. Socially awkward as fuck, only put on a smile to seem not-insane. Probably too lazy to go through with it, but certainly contemplating it a lot. 

Doesn;t help that my boyfriend's hundreds of miles away for most of the year, and I feel like I waste too much of his time and take him away from his studies while I just continue to mess around and get no work done at all. No focus. Can't bring myself to care. Gaining weight, too, because I don't really care.
