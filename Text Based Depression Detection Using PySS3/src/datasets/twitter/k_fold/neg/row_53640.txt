It's goneI've just lost it. I've lost this drive. I've been passively suicidal since I was like 15 and I've finally just been pushed over the edge and I don't know what to do. All I've ever wanted was to escape this stupid, awful family and have my own in whatever form that might take and now I feel even more alone than I did before. First my boyfriend left and I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with him, now I feel isolated from my friends because I got screamed at randomly. cause I was hurting our mutual best friend with my horrible thought processes. I can't talk to anyone without hurting them, or myself (my mom made a suicide joke at my expense recently) and the only reason I haven't done it yet is cause it would destroy my best friend, but that's less convincing right now. I just want to be gone. I want out.
