Scared I might do it, but not scared of dyingI donâ€™t think about how it would be after Iâ€™m dead because itâ€™s getting really hard to care about anything anymore. Itâ€™s getting a lot easier to fall through with suicidal tendencies. Iâ€™m not good at anything. After numerous attempts to make things a little easier in school, Iâ€™ve never found anything to make it less frustrating. I canâ€™t do it. School is so hard for me but I donâ€™t think I can do a hard job right now because Iâ€™m a pussy.  Any time I think about my future the knife pierces harder in my kneck. The ONLY thing I know how to do right is music and Iâ€™ve been trying to get better at that but the more I try the less I feel I could make it in the music industry because letâ€™s face it. Chances of making it are close to none. Anyways Iâ€™ve got good friends and good parents. They care about me, but Iâ€™ve got nothing going for me. I would 100% rather be dead than homeless
