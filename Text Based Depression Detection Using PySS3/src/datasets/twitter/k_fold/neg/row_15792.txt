If you simply want out no emotions evolvedFirst: I want to start out by saying I strongly believe I'm going to commit suicide soon. I ask myself why before I make this decision. This decision is based on me. I have no real family, no real loved ones. I live my life alone. Most people that will miss me will probably be my coworkers but my job is easily replaceable. To me there is no God. We are biological beings with conscious emotions who's feelings end when life comes to an end. I've suffered in this 26 year old life. I've been through foster homes and a divorce. I no longer desire to feel anger, depression, sadness, jealousy, and all of the other emotions I feel on a daily basis. Honestly I do not even want to feel happy, confidence, love, or pride. I just want to go away. I want to die, and end all of this suffering. I don't want to hear "but it gets better, just tough it out, go parachuting, go climb a mountain, etc." Honestly, I just want out. I feel life is silly and means nothing. I believe I'm going to end my life soon and I will do so with confidence in my decision.
