My parents keep telling me to kill myselfEveryoneâ€™s pushed me away. I canâ€™t find anyone who cares about me. No matter how hard I try. Iâ€™ve changed my personality hundreds of times, Iâ€™ve tried so hard to make other people happy but still, no one cares. Everyoneâ€™s just waiting for me to do it. Iâ€™m the reason my parents got married, so they both hate me. My health problems drained their bank accounts. My autism made their lives hell. They have every right to want me to die. My roommate hates me, last time he found me hanging he told me to go somewhere else and do it. Iâ€™m gonna be homeless within the month, Iâ€™ve tried looking at the army but I canâ€™t, Iâ€™m too fucked up. I tried joining a commune, only white people allowed. My dog died right after my uncle who was the closest thing to a father figure I had. Eveyrhing in my life is falling apart all at once and I donâ€™t want to die but I genuinely donâ€™t have any options left. Iâ€™ve tried everything. People donâ€™t realize, Iâ€™m not this depressed for no reason, Iâ€™m depressed because therapy, medication all of that cant fix my life, and neither can I
