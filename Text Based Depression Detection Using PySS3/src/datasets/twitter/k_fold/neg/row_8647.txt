I just want to end it all..I've been dealing with depression ever since i was a little kid i can't even remember when it started anymore. Sometimes for no reason, but as a child, it was always there. At the moment i'm only 15 and the feelings just get stronger and stronger everyday. I know what you're thinking, one of those annoying teenagers that hasn't seen the world and thinks his life sucks. But i'm not that type of person that goes and complains about my life all the time blah, blah, blah. I don't have anyone to talk to anymore since my close friend found out about my drug abuse and told me to fuck off and have a good one..
Honestly drugs have done nothing but bring me down more and more but i'm addicted to being high itself. If i can get my hands on it, then I'M on it. But overall my life isn't as bad as it could be, or even close.
I just need help..i don't have any close friends anymore, my parents are both depressed and always talk about how their lives suck and my Dad drinks all the time. So i don't like to talk to them.. I could go on about what else is wrong but you guys have probably heard it all. I just wish i was optimistic. I always see things as half empty and i'm about sick of myself. I hate being who i am.
