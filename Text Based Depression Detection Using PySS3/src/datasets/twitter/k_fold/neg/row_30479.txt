I'm about to commit suicide?I've been isolated for so long. No one tried to stop me. I can't go back. Nothing will be the same again. I just want to be dead. I can't go on. The mental torture. Being reminded everyday of what was and what could've been. It doesn't make it any better that people rub it in my face everyday.
