Christmas... MDD is a Fucking MonsterIt's very hard for me to do almost anything and even harder to feel good about anything. Someone I know that has control over me is being a dick and he really is not making me feel better. People say "you have such a good life", if I'm not happy it doesn't even matter. 

I want to do so much, but there's something in me that pushes me away from doing it and I really want to know what it is.

This comes down to watching fucking TV. I have so much regret it alone just makes me want to leave.

A bit of info: 

I'm 19

I never had a drivers license or a job because my parents don't think it's good idea right now.

I been asking for OT (for an other disability) and  other things for like two years and they are still "working on it."

I never had friends or been on a date.

I had leave school for a while and I'm getting my GED.

I will go to college if I live long enough.

Just going out or being around people has NEVER helped me make friends.

I went to Girl Scouts for seven years.

I want to learn to talk to people, like at all.

I am bit psychotic.

THANK YOU SO MUCH!
