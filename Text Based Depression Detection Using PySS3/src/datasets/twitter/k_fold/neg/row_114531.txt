Iâ€™m really not okay. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m staying together for so longHumans are created against their will in living situations that destroy their lives all over the world. 

Iâ€™m alive against my own will and I have to kill myself against my own will. How I die can be a painfully slow disease called life. I like how everyone has kids but no one can help them.

Me being born is slavery to my biology requiring food, warmth, etc. it does not matter where I live, society is handcuffed to my life. My brain is sad for realizing life is buying fun products and the currency is misery. 

You work every day hoping a dude signs your name into heaven where you can sit around being lazy on clouds but here on earth, people have their limbs cut off to become sexual slave statues in basements while we tweet about political opinion. I am not okay.
