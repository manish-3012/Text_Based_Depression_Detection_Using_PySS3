Incoherent gibberish. I don't even want help. I write what's in my headFUCK! I'm in so much pain. I feel like I can't do this anymore. My arms are aching to be cut again.


My chest hurts, though I'm perfectly healthy. And I can barely breathe. Yesterday I almost got run over on my way home from school. I didn't care.


I keep getting these surges several times a day, when I can't stand up straight due to the emotional pain. Heck! I can't even sit properly.
And pack that in with some serious lack of sleep, because of course it takes me 3 hours of lying in bed before I fall asleep...
I often catch tears rolling down my cheeks...


I'm literally gifted in every way. I'm athletic, good looking and a really quick learner. It's torturous that I can't access the benefits of any of these while I'm in this state.


There's one guy whom I regularly talk to at school. He's my desk mate (though the last few days he changed desks and I just sat alone for 6 hours a day). He says I'm his best friend. Though I seem to vanish out of existence whenever his girlfriend says anything. I mean, no problem, bro, I'd still feel like shit even if that didn't happen. It's just another thing I don't really need.
I'm afraid of telling him that this bothers me, as in my head that'd mean he'd leave me.


I'm not even envious of the social people that I see at school anymore. I don't even care about what they're talking about. I can't see myself ever being that way again.


And everyone's so nice to me, it completely contradicts the hell inside my head. I only get to be the misfit in my imaginary world


But there's someone who's trying her best to make me use my resources and move. She's really unusual...odd...


I failed my theoretical exam for the driver's license 3 times now... 


Got an A in programming class, though...


I just keep spacing out, whenever.


I have to complete 3 projects for school and study for a kind of important exam (3 exams, actually) and the only thing that's on my mind is how I'll kill myself before any of these hit.


I feel like I'm literally starving to death, but without the dying. So it just keeps on going forever.


Fuck I broke down so bad I'm having trouble remembering if I did anything else other than sitting in my bed sort of crying, sort of fake laughing and punching walls this week at home.


My mind is so foggy. This thing doesn't make any sense.
I'm in so much pain writing this didn't even help.
I don't want to talk to anybody, leave me alone.
Fuck.


What if I just died?


But I can't. I have to go snowboarding this winter. If I reincarnate, I'd have to wait a few years before I'd get to do it again.


Fuck! My mind is so foggy and everything hurts so much. My arms are aching to be cut again. This post makes no sense. I'm sorry. I'm so drained.


I can't "live" lie this anymore. I'm so lonely and it's so cold...


I'll hang in there. I always have, somehow.
