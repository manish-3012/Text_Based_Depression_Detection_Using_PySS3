2 years.If after then I'm still living like this, I will allow myself the freedom to end it. Likely nothing will change and I will end up offing myself in 2 years. But I'll give the universe a chance--out of some vestige of faith?--no, but because I acknowledge I am not seeing clearly. I haven't been for over 2 years now. But it would be unacceptable for this to become my new normal. I'm giving myself 2 years.
