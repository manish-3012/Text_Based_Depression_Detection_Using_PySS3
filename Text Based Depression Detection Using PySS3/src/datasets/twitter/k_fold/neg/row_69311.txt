words for a long-term person going to attempt suicide.I'm having these random depression episodes. This is the second time it has happened to me in addition to making a post about it, I am not like this let alone making posts about them on Reddit. I want to kill myself, not now, not tomorrow, but plan on doing before the next decade. I have two ways of how I will attempt to end my life, but I'm satisfied with how I will execute them. Maybe my parents will miss me for sometime after I am gone, but I have been literally lonely all my life, I'm a very nice person trying to fit in this world but seeing the worst in humanity and how they take advantage of someone like me as I am just some puppet. Anyways, I plan on finishing up school hopefully, make some friends, have a girlfriend (life goal), get my dream job; then end it. You may say things will change overtime and I would really like to think it would, but the things I think about, it'll stick with me.
