Will I ever be okay with the subject of suicide?So I had a failed attempt at sucide around 4 years ago, since then I've been to alot of therapy and am generally okay most of the time now. My question is, will I ever be okay with the subject of sucide again? Both in the media, and people talking about it. Whenever it comes up I completely break down every time into a sobbing mess. So I guess my question really is, was anybody else ever able to broach the subject after an attempt?
