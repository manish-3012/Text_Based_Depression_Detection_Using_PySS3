i want to kill myselfand I feel so pathetic because I should be content with what I have in life( family, home and a job) But I am not happy. I feel at 26 I should be out of the house but I still live at home. I am miserable at my job. 
For the past two weeks I have persistently have had low moods. The past few days the suicide ideation increased. Thinking about the multiple ways I  can kill myself. 
I really have nothing to live for anymore. I am single and no kids. Which I am grateful for because they don't need to be with me and deal with my depression.
I am not on medications ( I did not like how I reacted to them). I know they fuckin say to get out of bed and exercise but it all seems so hard. I feel so fuckin alone. My family has their own stuff to deal with and I don't want to be burden with these issues. I mean I'm fuckin 26 for god sake. My friends, well my only close friend seems to only want me around when she has an issue. Works friends are well work friends. If I die it's not gonna be that much of an impact. What bothers me is the sadness and grief my family would feel discovering my body. What I fear is I don't do it right and I survive living a life of shame, pain and further suffering. 
There are plenty of people out there suffering but with more ambition and drive. Here I am taking away those resources that they can utilize and make more of themselves.
