I'm doneI've finally made the decision to kill myself even before doing what I first wanted to do:
Write some stories I had in mind.
But I'm done. I came to the conclusion that it doesn't matter anymore. I don't care anymore.
I'm simply done with the world and everything as well as everyone on it.
I may be posting sooner or later again here. But if I don't. I'll be dead. Have a good day/night and watch out for yourselves.
