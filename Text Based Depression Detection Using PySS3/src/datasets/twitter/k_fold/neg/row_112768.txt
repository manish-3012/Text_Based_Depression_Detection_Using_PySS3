It's my birthday and I don't want it.Today is my birthday and I just want everyone to forget about it, I'm at the worst my mental health has ever been and I don't even want to be here anymore.

I've never felt like this, even last year I looked forward to this day and I felt happy that people remembered and congratulated me, today I feel so depressed and weak, I don't want to get out of bed and I don't have the energy to respond to people's texts as if I'm happy to live another year, I don't have the energy for that. 

I really just want to skip today...
