Lost my friend, lost my will to liveEver since 2014 my best friend was always there for me as I struggled with dark thoughts and overall sadness (I don't know if it was depression). I could always count on him, he could always count on me and we considered ourselves family.  


We were four guys in our group, throughout my teenage years I only had 4 friends and now I'm alone. As my bestie joined college and I started work we started to drift apart, we would still hang out when we could but I could feel we were growing cold.  


A few days ago I asked him if he'd like to hang out but he said he's got some project for college and he won't be able to come so I left him to it. A few hours later as I was scrolling through Instagram a post from one of his friends popped up where they were all hanging out at some pub, of course, without me. It was clear as day: they wanted nothing to do with me, all those years meant nothing anymore.  


I don't know if I've ever felt like this in my life but it felt like the whole world just crushed me, my heart started to race and I had trouble breathing and understanding why this happened. Sent him a message asking why he'd lie to me and he said that his friends don't wanna hang with me. Even though it hurts like fucking hell I told him okay, wished him the best then blocked him because even though I didn't want to lose my best friend I know not to beg and if that's what he wants then so be it.  


So here I am, 21 years old, I have literally 0 friends, no hobbies, no social life, no achievements in life, my parents are probably disappointed as fuck in me, a dead end job.  


I'm aware there are people out there who have it way worse than me but how do you get up from such a low point ? Where do you even start ? Can you even do it ? Because right now I feel like ending it all, no one would probably even notice I'm gone if I do it.  


I know strangers online probably don't care but maybe someone can tell me what to do
