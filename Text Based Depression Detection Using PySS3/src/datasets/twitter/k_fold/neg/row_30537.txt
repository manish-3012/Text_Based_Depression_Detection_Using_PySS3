helloi hate when people tell you that you have so much to live for and that there's so many people that will miss you. it's clearly projection. they are so used to having people in their life they can't understand the possibility of a completely solitary existence. it doesn't make sense. some people don't have anyone. not a single soul. a friend, a family member, a lover, a boss - any relationship of substance. they don't know what it's like to cling on to the smallest forms of human contact - like struggling to ask the cashier how their day went because it's the most you've interacted with another human being in days. they don't understand what it's like to have every single ambition and desire you've ever held wither and die. to the point where you don't get out of bed for days or muster the energy to have sex, or go to the LCBO for more booze, or shop for groceries sometime this month so you have something to eat. it's incomprehensible. some people don't have anything to live for at all. in the slightest. but that doesn't mean they should kill themselves. end this fucking ridiculous train of thought. some people are broken and useless, and still alive.
