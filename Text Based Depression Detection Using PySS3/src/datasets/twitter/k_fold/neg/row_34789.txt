my last day here, I guess?I've got the plan down, but some part of me is still unsure whether I should do it or not. I'm afraid that if I fail I'll get sent to a mental hospital, but I guess if I wait and come up with something better I'll be dead for sure. 
as for why I'm doing it, I'd say I'm tired of living. may not be the best reason, but that's how I felt for the last 4 years.
just wanted to share and say goodbye.
