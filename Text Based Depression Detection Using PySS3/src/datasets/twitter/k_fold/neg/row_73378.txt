I was doing fine.I guess this is a kind of rand (if that's the right word, I'm not English) 

I was suicidal and depressed for a few years from the age 11 to 14. I still feel depressed but I was getting so much better. I'm older now and I still have one main problem (and an other problem that I simply ignore) that I'm struggling with and somehow it's breaking me. 
My parents know that I "was" depressed, but my mom didn't really believe me but still pressured me to talk to people. For a year I had to talk to so many different people and my parents apparently gave me a choice, get serious help or go to a Christian camp for a weekend where someone we know has a phycology degree. I as a 12 year old obviously chose the latter because I hated talking to people. (Not that I remember getting the choices, because I don't remember anything about that year) 
I was doing better and met some amazing people, but lately I just feel like being dead would be better. 

I guess that's what I wanted to say.
