Was going to send this paragraph to my â€œfriendsâ€ but I donâ€™t want to be judged. It probably doesnâ€™t make sense but my mind is all over the place nowSo I know everyone treats me like a kid for obvious reasons. And it may always seem like I want people to laugh at me, like I want to be the centre of attention. I struggle with bipolar, so Iâ€™m either really attached to people, activities and just things in general. Or Iâ€™m either having a depressive episode, being detached from everyone. 
I come as weird too coz of my issues, Iâ€™ve always struggled with anxiety, so to hide that anxiety, I make a fool of myself, letting people make fun of me, being a literal joke and what not. Iâ€™m aware no one genuinely likes me and I canâ€™t help that. Iâ€™m not a good friend. I canâ€™t form relationships. Iâ€™ve got borderline personality issues, always changing who I am depending who I talk to, just to fit in. Pleasing people all the time, making sure everyone is happy, not caring about my own reputation or myself in general.  I realised, I donâ€™t fit in with anyone coz I donâ€™t know who the fuck I am myself. Itâ€™s not easy being me. Itâ€™s not easy being someone who donâ€™t even understand themselves. 
I know people say things I like to hear and not what I want to hear most of the time (like you would with a child) and laugh at me, not with me. Iâ€™m aware, Iâ€™m not stupid. I guess this whole paragraph could be one of those things you laugh about. :)
