The one person that's made living seem worth it can't even be assed to spend time with me.Maybe I'm just not equipped to live. I can't keep living for others, right? I feel like I've given more than enough and I've tried hard enough. I can't just keep hoping they'd care about me as much as I care about them.

I'm to blame for making others my drive to continue on, though. I chose to make those hopes and dreams with them. And yeah, it seems like they do want those hopes and dreams as well but the fact is I'm just never gonna be as important to them as they are to me. Because they're my drive and I'm not theirs. I'm just their cheerleader, cheering them on while they make something of themselves, while I'm stuck there dedicating my time and effort to keep them going.

I have no one on my bench, no one to cheer me on when my legs are shaking from exhaustion and the world is heavy on my shoulders. I'm alone in this fight. And who says I have to keep fighting?
