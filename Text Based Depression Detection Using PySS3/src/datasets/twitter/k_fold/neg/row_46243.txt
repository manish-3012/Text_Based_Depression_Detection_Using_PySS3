I thought this community was supposed to be a support systemI was urged to come on here by a friend. Everyone talks about how supportive it is, but someone talks about committing suicide and most of the comments are â€œhow are you gonna do it?â€ and â€œgood luck, hope itâ€™s not painfulâ€ etc. I thought this was supposed to help, not enable. People come on here when theyâ€™re vulnerable and they become encouraged to take their lives, not seek help, not given coping methods. Frankly, Iâ€™m more suicidal leaving this page than I was coming here after realizing the ridiculous amount of enabling that exists even in communities created for the opposite purpose.
