Feeling suicidal againHey everyone, I guess I'm just looking for support. I'm a combat veteran with PTSD and my suicidal thoughts are coming back, it just really fucking sucks having to deal with this. I'll be doin great for a while and then the thoughts come back. I don't plan on harming my self, I guess the reason for this post is to just IDK talk to people dealing with similar situations..
