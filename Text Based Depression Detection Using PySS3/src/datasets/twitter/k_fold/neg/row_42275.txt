It's been 1 year, 7 months, and 27 days...Since my best friend was found dead of a planned overdose in his home. I have a folder on my desktop with pictures of him, videos he made, drawings he drew, and his suicide note he left. Today was the first time I looked at any of that stuff since he died. I cried for him, for the empty hole left in my heart from my loss. I dream about him. I did just last night. It helps me remember the way it felt when he'd hug me and hold me close.
Time keeps moving forward. I still blame myself but it doesn't eat away at me until I'm sleeping. When it comes to suicide, it's not a one and done action, at least not for the loved ones.

I hope everyone else is coping okay today.
