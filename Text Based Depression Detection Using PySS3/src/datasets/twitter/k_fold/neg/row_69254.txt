HelpIm 17, Its 7am i cant sleep, suicidal thoughts. Backstory i suffer from anxiety, depression and ocd-inteusive thoughts. I dont see the point anymore, im lonely, the girl i love can never be with me and i cant tell her cause it will ruin our friendship. Im on the computer everyday doing nothing, i think honestly that suicide is just the right way to go...
