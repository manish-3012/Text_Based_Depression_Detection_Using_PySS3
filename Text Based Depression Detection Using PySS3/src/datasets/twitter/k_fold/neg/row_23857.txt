People are tired of me but so am iI feel very unappreciated by everyone around me. I know that i shouldn't force friendships or relationships but i think i've come to a point where i dont care anymore, im just so desperate to have someone genuinely care for me. At this point i feel like people are exhausted dealing with me, and i wanna tell that i am, too. So. Damn. Exhausted. Im extremely unhappy with myself and with my life, i feel so damn alone.
