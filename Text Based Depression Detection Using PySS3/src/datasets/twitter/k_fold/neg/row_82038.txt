Always get a call when i'm about to kill myselffor some reason the past two times I was about to squeeze I end up gettin a call from someone I love, before it was my mom, this time it was my baby sister (2) wanting to call me from my dads phone, before the call i went in my kitchen  and the candle was out after i washed a dish and turned to the left to go down stairs it was lit somehow, Im 100's sure i wasn't tripping... any how I did make a count down on my fridge until my next birthday 257 now...could be ptsd...know of 2 funny guys that did it while i was in but dont really think that counts I've had that feeling since a child...b4 I hung myself on my bunk bed in middle school i was attending nicholas orem (pg county) at the time...woke up with a sore throat...second time i was in my G35 stick shift match box in the 2nd floor of Santa monica college after math class, kinda messed up by not caring about school when i went into hghschool but my mom had just got deported so it was just an entire downhill from there, didn't really care at that point b4 i loved math was always ahead but you know when you dont practice it a lot it takes a lot to get really back into it, main reasons why i joined the army after high school in 14' cause of messing up in HS and thinking "ok ima join, get my school benefits and get into IT" but that math discipline didn't cross my ming...ended up dropping out from SMC then PGCCC (18') but had started watching youtube started learning about real estate investing...closed on my first aug 4th.....the mental drain of the 9-5 tanker trucker local isn't what's killing but just the unhappiness that never goes away, idk kinda wanna go out soon but just scared of the instant regret of not being able to see the other worlds if i do it on my own
