I'm going to kill myself soonI get that this probably reads as a cry for attention but I really just wanted someone to know; I'm too afraid to actually tell anyone that I know irl in case I end up failing and then I would have worried them for nothing.
Literally nothing makes me happy anymore. Everything that I used to be interested in is suddenly a chore and I really can't see myself both alive and happy any time soon. I know that this is going to hurt lot of people around me but I'm just incredibly tired of having to get up every day.
