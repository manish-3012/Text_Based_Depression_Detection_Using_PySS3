my life has no value and i plan to end it by the end of the year.my plan has always been to die before 2017.  i've been giving treatment years and years, so i'll give it one last year.  i've posted about my problems enough already, so i won't be telling you all about that.  just wanted to let someone other than the therapists and nurses and counsellors know that this is my last year.
