Contemplating it a lotI find my self contemplating suicide a lot during the last months. I was even at the point where I stuck my head through a hung up rope, but I never really meant to kill me, because I'm to afraid of hurting my body.


There are some things that causing me feeling so miserable. The main point is loneliness.

I'm lonely because I isolate myself and don't feel comfortable around people. Even if I might act confident, I feel stressed and insecure very often.

I never had a girlfriend even if some girls liked me and even if I likde them. I would just feel so insecure that I would always be completely passiv, often even going out of her way or being unfriendly. I just never feel that I could provide any kind of security for a woman, because I'm self so insecure.

And I also have a problem with most men I always feel they trying to surpass me and show me that they're better. That's something that I can absolutely not stand.


I'm nearly 30 now and just flunked out of college. I'm doing nothing but smoking weed, jerking off, working out and surfing the net.

My state of mind during the last months is that I just try to reach a peaceful mindset. I feel so much pain, that this is my very first goal.
It works I'm at peace, feel pretty relaxed. I just can't see me getting anywhere from here, that's why killing myself often seems attractive.
