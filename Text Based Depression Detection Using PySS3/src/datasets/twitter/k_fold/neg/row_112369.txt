My wife left meMy wife left me last week. She called me and said that she no longer loves me and that she fell in love with another man. We were 9 years together and everything was great. I know, typical story. I'm just alone and she is in another country. I'm completely alone here. I want to end this pain, but i'm afraid. I'm afraid of physical pain. I'm also afraid of this thoughts about ending my life. But I just want it. If it was as simple as going to sleep and never wake up. I don't even know why i'm writing this. Maybe because i want to write to her but i can't - i'm just going to alienate her. Anyway, here i am. 26. Unemployed. Not living in my native country. All my relatives are far away. I want to die
