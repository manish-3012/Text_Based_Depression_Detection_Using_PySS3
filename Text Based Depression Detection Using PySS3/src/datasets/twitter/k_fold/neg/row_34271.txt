I want to die, I really really want to die. I canâ€™t wait.The past three years have been the worst of my life. Throughout high school life was amazing, star athlete, healthy, friends, family, and a great girlfriend. Since my first year of college when I was tricked into taking one cycle of steroids my life has changed. A year after the cycle Iâ€™ve had 5 surgeries, constant pain, lost my life, my contract, my girlfriend, and have no connection with friends or family. Iâ€™m 22 years old and when from AP classes in high school to hardly being able to read. Iâ€™m sick and tired of the pain. Iâ€™m done with life. Iâ€™m 22 and I canâ€™t work, travel, party, study, without constantly being in pain. Iâ€™ve lost everything of who I used to be and Iâ€™m fucking done. Iâ€™m fucking sick and done with this life and I canâ€™t wait for it to be over. The pain, the constant pain, the pain even in areas I didnâ€™t have surgery like my shoulders, I canâ€™t play the guitar, lift food to my mouth without pain, Iâ€™m just sick and fucking done. I donâ€™t want to live with this pain because in reality Iâ€™m not even alive. Sitting in my room immobile is not alive and Iâ€™m done.
