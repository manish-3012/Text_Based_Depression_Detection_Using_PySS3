Thinking about suicide is peacefulWhat a fucking pathetic life. Can i finally die. Im soo fucking dine with health problems, im fucking tired of living with anxiety 24/7 and daily panic attacks. Every time i try to talk with my closest one, im always getting blamed for everything. The only peace i find is when im thinking about suicide.
