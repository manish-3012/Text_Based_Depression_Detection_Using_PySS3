How to properly die using an exit bag.. any experts?I feel that everyone has the right to decide on when to die.  Suffering in this world and not being given a way out is so painful to me.  Learning about this exit bag method gave me a sense of hope and gave me so much relief that I am actually feeling happier because of the excitement.

It would mean the world to me if someone taught me how to set it up and where to buy all the equipment.  I've been trying to do my own research but haven't been finding any luck.  If anyone knows, please chat me or reply to this thread.  Again, it would mean so much to me to have someone help me while i'm nearing my last days on this earth.  Please.  I am literally begging.
