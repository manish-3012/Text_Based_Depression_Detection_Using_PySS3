The only thing keeping me from killing myself at this pointI'm paranoid that at the end of life, a person's perception of time stretches out logarithmically to fill whatever time is left. So when you die, rather than just going black, you basically experience that last moment for what seems like eternity, even though everything I've read says that some methods are so quick that the mind doesn't have time to perceive them. But what do we really know?!?! The last thing I want is excruciating pain forever. What I've got sucks and usually hurts like hell, but it's better than that.
