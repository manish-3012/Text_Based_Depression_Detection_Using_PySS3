No hope, no love, no desire, loneliness,emptynessEveryday is the same. i try to get through day. But I have noone. Maybe one friend i talk to sometimes online. Irl i have noone. I am ugly and loser. Once I was in love and someone treated me nice online and I felt so happy and positive, but the person faked it to fuck me up and in end i was left alone and became a joke. Life is so boring and repetitive. Only issues. I am 23 almost now and still nothing much in life. I am useless and i dont deserve to live. I am pathetic and hopeless. Even people that ever tried to help me gave up on me. I am forced to live because I dont want to hurt my family. They deserved a better son and not someone like me. Everyday I go to sleep hoping I dont wake up. But I wake up. It feels like maybe as long as I want to die, i will never be able to die and live long life. Anything I want always opposite happens. I am cursed and life is bad to me. i have voice but i am basically mute because its bad voice and people always made fun of me or bullied me for it  I am also fat. I never have any motivation, no goals, nothing that helps. Lately i fap a lot and stuff and just fuck myself up with bad fetishes and porn just cause i am already a mess nothing can make me any bad.
