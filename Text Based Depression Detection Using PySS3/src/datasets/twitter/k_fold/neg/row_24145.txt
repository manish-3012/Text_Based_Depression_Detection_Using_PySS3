I feel so stuck. Bad breakupHey. I get that breakups are hard and they hurt but you ever feel like you found the one and you just canâ€™t move on? Like nothing else matters now? I was with this girl for a couple of years. Iâ€™ve never felt more sure that i wanted to be with her for the rest of my life. And now she wants to leave because of personal reasons. I feel like nobody will ever match even closely to the amount that she did. I just want to leave and not be around anything ever again. I hate not ever being able to have what i really wanted. I hate feeling like everything is hopeless. I just want to not feel anything right now.
