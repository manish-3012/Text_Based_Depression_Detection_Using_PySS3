I don't make a lot of sense.I'd always thought about suicide. As a kid I even checked out a book about self harm from the junior high library. I was curious. I didn't understand why I got the impulses I did, a tad stronger I'd say than the typical intrusive thoughts we're mostly all familiar with. 

In highschool, I bought sleeping pills. I kept them in a box under my bed and waited, wondering when I'd use them. My mom kept a bottle of tequila in her closet. I threw them out when I got to college. After I'd taken two. 

The impulses got stronger. The intentions more sincere. I dissuaded myself with logical arguments, that if I offed myself now, my parents would have to pick up my slack for student loans left unpaid, and that wasn't fair. So I'd stay alive to pay my debts to society. That's what a good little girl does. 

After college I got a job. And then another. And then a third. I worked myself ragged. I still made less money than my sister makes part time. She has a degree that's worth something. I don't.

I usually think about crashing my car. It'd be the easiest, most obvious solution. I drive a lot, to near and far places and not always a regular route, in all kinds of weather. This past winter was exceptionally tempting. It'd be easy to write off a car hitting a pole and killing the driver as a slip on the ice, as losing control. Other times it's simply a windy way. How easy would it be to just not turn the wheel and drive off the hill, into a tree, a pole, a wall. Even if it didn't kill me, maybe it would shock me back to life. There are times when, despite everything else, I truly feel vibrant and beautiful - and then I always descend from that parapet in a devastating swoon of deprecation. 

Sometimes I overreact. Something small happens and I can't help but take it so deeply to heart I implode, despite a voice in the back of my head screaming at me to stop it, stop making such a fool of yourself, stop acting like a child. There's no need to cry over a broken plate, no need to go catatonic at a misuse of words or a joke. Nobody means it. The plate is replaceable. My feelings needn't be hurt so easily, but they are. I can't help it. 

I tried talking to my mom. She thinks my emotions are a choice. Why do I get so worked up, she wonders, when I have an uncontrollable episode over something as minor as getting my key stuck in the door. She thinks that my scars were a silly attempt to gain her attention. I first told her about them when I was twenty. Some of the oldest were from when I was twelve. If I had wanted her attention, I must have failed pretty badly at it for her to ignore the (what I thought was) obvious for eight years. But it's not her fault. It really isn't. 

I tried talking to my sister, too. She placates me with my two-year-old niece, who was diagnosed with severe autism. She needs her aunt, my sister says, and no matter how bad we think our lives are, they can't be worse than hers. I don't think that's a fair comparison. I could be wrong.

I talked to my boyfriend initially, but I've weaned him off my distress. I hate to see him so upset. He doesn't understand, and that frustrates him. I can't stand to see him cry. It's too unfair. He doesn't deserve to suffer my unhappiness. 

I'm not sure what I'm even talking about anymore. I just feel like there's no one left to talk to. I've always thought about getting a giant phoenix tattooed on my back. Outwardly, I've told people that it was because I loved the idea of a phoenix, constantly being reborn. Inwardly, I knew it was because I was fascinated with the choice of a Phoenix to sacrifice its current life for a new one, although I'm sure some will argue the aspect of 'choice'. For me, it'd be the choice to transcend the fate I had always thought I had, and to embrace the world for all it is, its terrors and wonders, its fretful endeavors and vivacious adventures. It'd mark my choice to be reborn, in life or in death.   

I just worry that, when the numbers break even, I won't have an argument left to put off what I feel is inevitable. I don't want to be a wayward spirit chained to a life she views as a waste. But I do want to live. I just don't see how.
