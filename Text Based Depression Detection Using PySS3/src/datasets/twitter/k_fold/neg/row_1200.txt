Why won't it just go awayThrow away account.

I don't really know why, of all places, I choose to talk here.  Or what I'm expecting to get from it.  

I'm a burden to everyone.  I have a good job and I hate it.  I have a husband who loves me.  Still, every night I weigh the option of killing myself vs dragging my ass through one more day.  There is a weight on my shoulders that's so heavy I can feel it in my stride when I walk.  I have dreams every night that I can't stand up straight, I walk bent over unable to see where I'm going.

I've talked to a doctor, been put on pills, they don't work.  

I wait until the husband sleeps and I stay up crying most of the night

Friends and family would rather cry about what they should have done at your funeral than deal with you while you're alive.  Not that I can bother staying in touch with any of them.  It is exhausting even responding to a text.

I keep praying to a god I'm not sure I even believe in.......the silence in reply is a slap to the face.

So what do you do when you feel worthless, have no clue who to talk to..(suicide hotline is useless, they read off a script and won't actually talk to you).  This box just keeps getting smaller.  There's a constant screaming in my head to end it.  I can't look at my wrists without wanting to slice them wide open, or get a new prescription without looking up how many of the pills it would take to kill me.  Not that I would try either of those, I'd opt for a less painful experience.

I don't have that feeling of relief yet that people talk about, once they decide to actually do it, so I guess that means I'm not quite there.  If I was I suppose I wouldn't bother posting here at all.

Maybe I've just gone completely mad.
