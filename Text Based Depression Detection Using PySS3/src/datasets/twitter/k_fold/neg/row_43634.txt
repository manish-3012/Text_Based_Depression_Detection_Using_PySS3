...Sorry to bother you all...I'm one of those shy, quiet, and distant teenagers. I've been in a near-constant state of depression since the end of summer school. I'm on my last year of school, and have a steady boyfriend. My mother works nights in the maternity ward and practices kendo on the side. My father's job moved to Georgia last year, but he still occasionally visits. My sister has a wedding planned for April and I'm a bridesmaid. My Mom is like a semi-responsible older sister to me, while my actual older sister is like an annoying younger one. I don't feel like I can talk to my Mom because she also has depression, and I don't want to push her over the edge. She's also completely preoccupied with my sister's wedding. I won't talk with my sister because she's not the understanding type. I have talked with my father, but he doesn't understand depression (or other people's emotions) at all. I've also mentioned it to my boyfriend on occasion, but I end up downplaying it because, well, I hate seeing him look that worried. My grades are at an all-time low, but the teachers apparently don't think it's important. My school councilor should be able to tell that low grades+despondent+diagnosed with depression=depressed, but either hasn't or doesn't care. I have minor trust issues, so I hate actually talking to councilors. I also have a low sense of self-worth normally. Nobody has been helpful thus far(hopefully you guys are, though), and I really needed to get this off my chest. I'm at risk of failing out of a program that I need for graduation and to get a foothold in life, and if I fail this quarter, I'm out. The best part is: Nobody thinks I can. I really don't think I'll be able to handle failing it. I've been thinking about ending it all already. I know it's probably annoying to read all this, but if you think you can help, I'll listen.
