I need to know how I can helpMy girlfriend has been battling depression and self harming habits for months now,  and she's attempted suicide more than once. She's been admitted to the hospital for her problems,  and when she's there,  her optimism rises, but when she gets out it seems to just drain away.  She's struggling to find enjoyment in things she does,  and the fact that she doesn't feel like much of anything is helping her just drags her down further. 
I do my best to be supportive, and be there for her when she needs me.  I'll suggest things she might try or people to talk to,  but a lot of the time,  it feels like I'm not saying anything that useful. I'm terrified at the thought of losing her,  and I want to do anything I can to help her get better.  I just feel like I'm not learning anything about her problems, and I'm confused as to what I should do to help her. 

I need to know what I can do to help her get back on her feet and motivated again.  Something to lift her from the depressed mind set.
