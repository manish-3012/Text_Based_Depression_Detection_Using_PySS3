Is this how itâ€™s supposed to work?I am taking Opipramol for three weeks now, 50 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the evening. I had really bad anxiety and panic attacks, have been stuck in it without being able to eat because of swallow difficulties, started to have chestpain because of breathing weirdly for months every day and I was just breaking down the whole time. Ever since I started taking the Opipramol both anxiety and panic attacks are 100 % gone but now my depression is just a billion times worse. I never hated myself this much, never wanted to die this much and overall I am just so mad the entire time, I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening. 

I canâ€™t consult my doctor or therapist because of the Corona garbage going on and donâ€™t know if this is normal or not. What can I do?
