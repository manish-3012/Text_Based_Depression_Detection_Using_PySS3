So this is supposed to be helpful?These policies are doing more harm than good.

Not allowing someone to say 'it gets better' or 'suicide is selfish' is like trying to swim with your hands tied. You can flail around but it's not really helpful. At best it's covering the reality of the situation. And you know what? It *does* get better. You just have to take steps to make sure it does. But I'm not allowed to say that. 

Abuse or "tough love" including any guilt-tripping like "suicide is selfish" or "think of your loved ones". 

So advising someone to think outside of themself is forbidden? The fuck? I've been there, and the thought of hurting my mother was the only thing that prevented me from taking the final step. That's just me, sure, but if anyone in this sub actually wants to help someone they should be able to try. 

This place is ridiculous. Very pro-suicide if you ask me. But no one did so I posted this. It'll get deleted though. 

Seriously, either close the sub or change these policies. I wonder how many people could have been helped but weren't because they weren't allowed to tell their truth. But that's on you. 
Happy travels.
