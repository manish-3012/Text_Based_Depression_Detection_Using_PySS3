Throwaway for obvious reasons.I've lived with suicidal ideations since puberty. I'm 30 years old, and I just created my first real "plan". I don't know if this qualifies though - it's less a plan to suicide and more a plan to take it out of my hands. 

In March, I intend on heading out to the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina and just, staying. I would have a fully equipped Bug-Out Bag with the intent on survival, but living in a dense forest would come with risks of exposure, infection, bears, etc. 

I still wrote a note to my friends and family. It still feels like a suicide note because I am saying goodbye to everyone. I am not telling them where I am going, because I do not want them to be able to find me. If I survive a few years, and decide to come back, I'm not sure I would reach out to them. It feels cruel to do that. 

I am posting this because I know if I tell my therapist or husband or anyone that I have this plan, they would do everything they could to stop me. I want to live off the land, and separate myself from society/capitalism, but they would never understand. How can tell them the truth and still live the way I want to?
