Can't stop thinking about our mortality.Thoughts of our mortality keeps looping through my head non stop. What is the point of trying to live a happy life if we all die anyway. I know it's a stupid thought to have because death comes to everyone eventually but everytime I try to do something, or care about other people or anything, the thought will spring up in my mind.
 
A baby is born? Doesn't matter, it will one day die. Best friend getting married? Who cares, they will both die one day. Having fun enjoying a hobby? What's the point? I'm just going to die. Hear about an horrible murder on the news? Well that person was going to die anyway.
 
I'm agnostic so I don't know what will happen to us when we die. The thought that atheist could potentially be right though terrifies me. It just makes everything so unimportant. Not worth it. We all die one day so why exist? We are cursed with the knowledge of death.
 
These thoughts lead to me to nihilistic thinking and I don't know how to see life as meaningful anymore. I'm afraid of not caring about humanity due to the thought that they will die. If everyone thought like me, then humanity would die out. But I often wonder if I am seeing the truth of life and everyone else is just pretending they are immortal.
 
I don't know how I can get past this. I am losing hope.
