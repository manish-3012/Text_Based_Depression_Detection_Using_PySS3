I'm ready to kill myselfI want to jump off the balcony in my dorm and just have it all be over with. I got my wish I got to go far away for university but I still have to go back in the summer. For the next four years. What's the point in anything? What's the point in me doing well in school, making friends and getting a job if every summer I have to go back and live with a disgusting toxic man who makes me feel like shit constantly? 

When I first got here I was so happy. I really felt like I would be okay. Nobody was screaming in my face for menial shit like spilling tea on the floor or going to the garage w/o shoes on. He's the reason I started drinking. He would always pull this stupid shit and still expect me to be 'part of the family,' and everyone would look at me like I'm the irrational one for not wanting to be part of it. I thought it was finally over until my mom told me I have to come back in the summer to sAvE mOnEy. I can't do it. Her advice to me was to just 'roll with the punches' but I can't fucking do it anymore. 

Today during one of my lectures I asked a question to which the prof said it was a "problem" that I was asking that so late into the course. Gee, sorry to inconvenience you but I can't exactly focus when I spend every lecture thinking about killing myself. I'm going to have to be in this same routine for the next four years and I just can't do it. I'd rather die now so I don't have to deal with it.
