Changed my perspective I've always joked about suicide and cracked jokes on people that try and fail. Now I'm laying in a hospital bed after I cut myself 50+ times on the arms, stomach, and face in an attempt to kill myself. I got really drunk last night and woke up to my best friend and my shop chief getting me into a truck. I blacked out twice from blood loss on the way over. I'm indifferent to the physical pain but the pain I caused my wife and friends is crushing. I'm disappointed that it took this to get me to realize that suicide isn't a joke.
