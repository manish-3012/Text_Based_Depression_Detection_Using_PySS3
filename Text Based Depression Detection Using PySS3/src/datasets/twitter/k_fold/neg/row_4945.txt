I have been so depressed with my life...it started when me and my boyfriend were laughing about something in our apartment, I laugh very loudly and he told me to "shut up".

I can understand he is a very private person, but I have told him how many times that hurts my feelings, but this time I had no energy to fight. I went to bed at 8:30am because I've been so depressed since that incident yesterday, I don't see any hope for my comic book I've been working on, and my job I'm doing now is on the rocks because I seem to have imbalances on my cash register, but I would never ever steal anything and try so hard to control things...

I don't know, I feel miserable, my boyfriend is fine otherwise, he is paying fora trip for the two of us, but I feel selfish as I want a little more romance and sensitivity from him...I know nobody is perfect so I don't have the energy to argue anymore or talk with him about it...

I just don't know, I feel like I'm in a rut and have no way of getting out and so bored with life...
