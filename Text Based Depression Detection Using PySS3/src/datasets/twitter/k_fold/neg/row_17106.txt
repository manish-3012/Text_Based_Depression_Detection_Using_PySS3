Killing time before I kill myselfThe title is how I describe what I've been doing for about six months now. I'm stuck in a limbo of sorts. I have zero hope for my future - all I see ahead of me is a life not worth living, and yet I lack the resolve to actually end my existence. So I continue on, just waiting for the morning to come when I will finally awake and say "I've had enough. Today's the day."

That day cannot come soon enough.
