I'm Ready to Give UpI just don't want to be on this planet any longer. I'm stuck in a horrible relationship with a man who goes to work then comes home and plays video games. He doesn't bathe regularly, he has filled his bedroom with garbage, spit tobacco on the walls, and refuses to do any work around the house at all because he's in terrible pain all the time. I have to work, cook, clean, do all the yardwork, take care of the kids, everything. I never get to go anywhere or do anything, other than work. I told him to leave in November but he wouldn't, even though it's my house. I know I'll never be able to find anyone else because the kids are a liability. I don't want to put that part of my life behind me, so I'd just as soon be dead as be unloved. No one can help and I realize that I'm simply better off dead.
