Deformation and cerebral palsy - please readHi,

I'm not sure how to word this, but here goes nothing. I'm an 18 (soon to be 19) year old guy with cerebral palsy and a bad case of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemifacial_microsomia. 

I also have an abnormally small head that further strains my already terrible relationship with the society around me. I'm in a major city in Australia, where people are said to be kind and decent. This isn't so with my palsy and deformity. People are cold, callous, rude, manipulative, deceitful and heinous to begin a description. I have been laughed at, mocked, gawked at, refused service a number of times by many people and my life is a living breathing fucking hell.

I won't sugar coat it; I am extremely desperate for money for plastic surgery. Surgery won't fix everything but I need a fucking break. A reprieve. A little relief. 

I am begging you, the users of Reddit, to maybe help me out. 

I'm not sure what else to put here, I'm very fucking tired and desperate. 

If you guys want, you're more then welcome to query me about my experiences interacting with regular, joe-shmoe people. They're much different from the norm and I have been shat on in a variety of ways.

Thanks for reading.
