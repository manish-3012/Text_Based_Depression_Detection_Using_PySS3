please, seriously, give me GOOD reasons to stay aliveI have treatment resistant depression: every single antidepressant ever made, don't work for me. Weed has worked but it's illegal and you don't want to know what comes with the weed available to buy illegally in my country. Ketamine works for a few days but a dosage is half the minimum wage in my country. Microdosing LSD has also worked but it's impossible to find pure in my country, most of it comes mixed with dangerous substances I don't want. Shrooms don't work, even 500mg makes me feels like shit and increases self destructive thoughts. So, ingesting things don't work.

I don't believe in god, I don't have faith in anything. Saying "You are worth it, you matter" means absolutely nothing to me. I'm a tiny mixture of particles in this huge universe: no one matters.

"People love you and care about you" doesn't work with me and I don't want to explain why.

Therapy doesn't work, I'm tired of therapists bringing up my father in therapy (he was the professor of 100% of the therapists in this city) even though I KNOW they shouldn't be doing that.

I'm autistic and I can't find a job, not even a shitty one, and even when I find, I get fired because I can't so chitchat and people think I don't like them because of that, so I get fired FOR THIS EXACT reason all the time.

Government is corrupt. I'm 36 and I was planning trying to finish University this time, but with all the cuts this shitty government is making, the university I was going to apply announced they are closing their doors on August. The best Universities are public, so with this government they are all collapsing.

I've been living with my parents (with a enabler father and a  narcisistic borderline bipolar munchausen mother, yes, she's all this things at once!) and a brother (who is extremely violent and tried to kill me in the past) since last October and I'm only getting worse.

So please, give me good reasonS to live, because right now, I have none.
