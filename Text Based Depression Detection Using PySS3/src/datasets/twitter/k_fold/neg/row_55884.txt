Right I donâ€™t know if this belongs here but I need someoneâ€™s help.I know this isnâ€™t a helpline but on r/offmychest there is a user (my last comment was to the post) called u/mysteriousbebsi who said theyâ€™re going to commit suicide Tuesday night (tomorrow). I live in the UK so I donâ€™t think I can do anything as Reddit is based in the US so please, if anyone is able, please some call some form of emergency services and report it. They claimed theyâ€™re going to delete social media and they havenâ€™t responded to any comments so Iâ€™m not sure what else I can do.

Sorry again if this isnâ€™t welcome itâ€™s just this is likely my only avenue to get this guy help before tomorrow.
