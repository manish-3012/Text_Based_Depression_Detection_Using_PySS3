Nothing would make me happier than not waking up tomorrowI never want to go to this class again.  The professor is soul-crushing, the topic bores me even though it's my capstone, and I do not have the work ethic right now to get anything done.  If I could peacefully go right now without having the stigma of suicide on my family and friends, it would be perfect.
