Hopefully the final postHey guys I know Iâ€™ve posted a lot in the past few days but I wanted to say...

Life isnâ€™t that bad.

I failed another suicide attempt.

Itâ€™s possible that maybe I should try again, but after three times, maybe itâ€™s time to try something else.

I mean, I can walk. I can speak. I donâ€™t have the smallest dick in the world. And I can always make new friends.

Iâ€™m gonna die eventually anyways, so postponing my death isnâ€™t that crazy of an idea.

I think maybe you guys could consider doing the same. If you ever wanna talk just comment in my post Iâ€™ll come to your aid.
