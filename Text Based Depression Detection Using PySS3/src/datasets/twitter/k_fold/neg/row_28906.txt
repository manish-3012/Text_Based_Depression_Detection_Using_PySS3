My PostHello. Please just call me Latios.
Ive been depressed for about 4 years now from many reasons.
Ive been having suicidal thoughts for about 2 years now and ive almost decided to just go through with it.
My depression was just something to hold behind me for a while.
It recently spiked around 3 years ago and ever since ive held it behind.
Alot of it is loneliness.My siblings moved out and left.My mom ditched me and my brother and I just feel alone.I haven't talked to anyone about all of this and could really use some help.

Thanks.
