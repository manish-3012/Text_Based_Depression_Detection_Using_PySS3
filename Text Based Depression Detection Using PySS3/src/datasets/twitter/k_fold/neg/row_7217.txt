Really could do with some adviceReally could do with a hand...

My Mother &amp; Father-in-law are splitting up, and it's really hit my Father-in-law bad. He's 40 years old, has 4 daughters, and lives in the UK.

He's told my wife (his daughter) that he's had suicidal thoughts on 3 or 4 different occasions in the last couple of days. My wife then forced him to go to a doctor today and as a result they've given him some sleeping pills.

You guys seem really good at talking to people when they're on the edge like this, what's the best way we can help him? Anything you can recommend that's good to say to him would be great, as would any outside resources you know of that are actually helpful.

Cheers,

Chris.
