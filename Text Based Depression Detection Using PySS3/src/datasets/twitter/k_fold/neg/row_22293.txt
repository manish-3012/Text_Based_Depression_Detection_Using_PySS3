No more will or motivationI don't plan on attempting again, but it's all I can think about lately. Just another bad hit maybe. I have no motivation or want to keep living though. I just don't fucking want to. There's nothing. I can only keep thinking about my 2 attempts last year that both failed. I was so close, but just ended up in ICU both times and had an actual room for 2 days the last time after my time in ICU.

But now I wonder if there will be a time where it just snaps and I down pills again. It's like a....background noise telling me to just do it but it's not loud enough for me to even listen to. But really? What's the point to living?

Or maybe I'm just dwelling on the extreme guilt of failing at something that should have been something to succeed at. Guilt of still living even though I am comparing it to nothing and no one else. I just really feel I just shouldn't still be alive. All the pills, all the alcohol, all the attempts of cutting deep enough, the attempts of hanging, just all keeps leading to nothing. I still end up waking up the next day.

Honestly, what's the point of living if you're always tired and just want to sleep, just go to work then go back home to bed, never doing anything else, never having money to do anything else, never having the want or energy to do absolutely anything? I'm not living, I'm not even surviving.
