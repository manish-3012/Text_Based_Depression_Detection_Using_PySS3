Lost in this place.It's starting to get a lot harder for me, I struggled with many things in life, from bullying to memories I am not fond of. All what I lived in my past has evolved to something greater, I have questioned "what's the point of my life?" Am I supposed to do something impactful here? What's the point of struggle? Everyday that goes on it's just a battle after battle after battle. I really feel like I am close to giving up this fight. I'm 21 yrs old, the older I get the more I realize what awaits me the more I age is more pain. 

My past will always be with me. Now my future has been affected. I'll take 6 yrs to graduate university, due to failing, I have not achieved nothing in my life. I am starting to feel like I won't do nothing and be a failure. Maybe I should just go to sleep forever, nobody will care once it all ends. If god exists, why does he make us go through all this bullshit? Its hard to believe in a god like that. I don't think I'll make it past 23 honestly, maybe I should just end it now. At least then, I'll be at peace and not a burden. 

I feel like I have to help peoples lives, I am making music. Then I realize I am living a fantasy, chances of people listening to my music are almost 0. There's really no point I feel now. 
I am about to launch my first business, then I realise so are thousands of other entrapeneurs and fail. 

You see, it's like reality is starting to hit me. What I'm pursuing has almost a 0% chance of success. Maybe I should give up. I don't know how long I can last here. Even with all this, my past still haunts me, I feel like a useless person in this world. Best choice might be for it to all end.
