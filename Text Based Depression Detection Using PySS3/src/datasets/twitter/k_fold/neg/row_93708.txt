A third person voiceSometimes, you wonder why are you putting yourself through all this? Why can't you just end it once and for all. Why subject yourself to such fluctuations? Why???? Sometimes, he hurts you so badly you just want to end it. You just want to end your life. You want to see if after everything, would he care. It is so stupid, but there you are wanting to end your life because of this stupid guy. You want to walk out to a vehicle and allow it to knock you out. You want to head over to the highest floor and plunge. I don't know why. You are so stupid. You know you can do better, yet you are subjecting yourself to all this. You know it yourself that your own fucking emotions are unstable as hell. This wasnt the first time you fantasise about death. You keep putting yourself in situations that only add onto your mess.
