What is normal?It feels so distant I dont even know what normal means anymore. I've been deeply depressed for over 2 years at this point for reasons most are depressed over (family loss/relationships/work)At times I find it impossible to wake up in the morning, I prefer hiding in my dark room, I'm not the bubbly, extroverted person I once was. I'm the spawn of Satan according to my mom, grandparents, sister and brother. I have my dad who works 24/7 left as family and basically 1 friend who I dont deserve. He has done everything to drag me thru anything and help me with my depression but nothing has helped and I can tell hes giving up. I just dont see the point of living anymore. I have no one to enjoy life with anymore, and I'm far too intimidated to go out and meet new people. I tired in the past and my dad found me and saved my life, but now with him working basically all day every day, I see nothing stopping me. I'm more just scared of myself at this point cause I'm not totally sure what I want to do...
