21 year old male and Iâ€™m ready to dieI have Bpd and itâ€™s killing me from the inside. I keep on having the impulse to do self destructing things, I have no close friends, I hate myself, and my own family doesnâ€™t know how to take care of me. I quit my job because I impulsively decided to move across the country and Iâ€™m super depressed. I canâ€™t get over a girl who I dated for only six weeks. She dumped me because she found out about my bpd and now Iâ€™m thinking Iâ€™ll never be loved again. I was sexually harassed, bullied and neglected as a kid and even saw my own best friend die in a car bomb when I was around 12-13 years old. I have ptsd from that and uhhhhh Iâ€™m just so exhausted. I donâ€™t even have the mental energy to write the rest of this text I just really want to die
