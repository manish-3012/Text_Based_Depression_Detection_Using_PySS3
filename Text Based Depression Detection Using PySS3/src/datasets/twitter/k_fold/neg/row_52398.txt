Please help meI am 17 years old and have been diagnosed with social anxiety when I was 13 years old, that was the first time a judge ordered police to kick in my door and throw me in a psych ward.

I had a great childhood, but when puberty hit, my anxiety got worse. I think one of the biggest reasons for my low self-esteem is my weight. I am fat. Really fat.

I was admitted to psych wards three times and each time it was because I wasn't able to go to school.

Now I live on my own and don't go outside again, my mum pays rent and provides food. She said things will need to change or she will no longer support me.

Before yesterday I felt relativly okay, but all of a sudden depression hit extremly hard, I never felt like this before. I feel like I am going insane. I cut myself a lot in the past two days. All I can think about is suicide. I abuse drugs. I have no education.

Give me a reason not to end it all. I am so lost and just wanna go back to when I didn't exist.
