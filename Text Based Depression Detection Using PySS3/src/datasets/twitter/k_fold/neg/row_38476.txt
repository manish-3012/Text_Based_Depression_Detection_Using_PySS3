I'm not important. Like. At all. God made a mistake.There genuinely no reason for me not to end it. Not one reason. I do not have anything that is keeping me here. I'm chronically suicidal, depressed and angry. I think I have anxiety too. I have no future. Barely any friends. Family don't give a fuck about me. Shit job. I hate myself. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, keeping me here. 

For some people, suicide is the answer. It really is. Some people are just useless and worthless and unloved. That's the reality. God made a huge mistake on me. I'm a waste of life. He could've traded my life in for someone else's. Someone who is good. But he made a mistake. 

I'm a mistake of a person. I should not be here.
