lost all hopeMy spirit is gone. I have nothing left. I struggle to get out of bed in the morning. It's a personal fight. I push myself to get to work. I half ass it there all day. I used to love my job. I hold in the tears all day. I watch myself in my mind walking out the doors because I just don't know how much longer I can make it. It's a struggle. At home, I sit in the chair. I make sure my kids get fed, dressed, their meds...basically what they need...when my husband is home, I do none of it, because I know he can take care of it...and I sit, or sleep...in the chair...I don't even eat if he's not home, I can't, I can't think of what to eat, it's too hard. Everything is too much. I don't want to do this anymore. I can't do this anymore. I'm done with this.
