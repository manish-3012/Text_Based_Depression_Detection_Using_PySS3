i feel so alonei want to tell my friends or my s/o that iâ€™m feeling suicidal but i already told them before and none of them cared as much as i was hoping for. i feel so alone. this world can be so cruel. i just canâ€™t believe that i broke down in front of them and they just kinda temporarily comforted me and left. no follow ups. nothing. and my s/o has seen my cuts and never takes them seriously. itâ€™s almost as if everything is pointing me towards just doing it. i feel so alone.
