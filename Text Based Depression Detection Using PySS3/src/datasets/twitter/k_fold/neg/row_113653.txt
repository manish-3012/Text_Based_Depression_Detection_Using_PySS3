New Yearâ€™s decisionI think I wanna pull the trigger on New Years Eve. I felt like I wouldnâ€™t make it through 2019 and I feel like if thing havenâ€™t gotten better by the end of the year then might as well finish it. It gives me time to wrap up and few lose ends and everything as well as yâ€™all myself out of it so idk. Iâ€™ve been so much calmer and things are more clear since I decided I wanted to do it
