The only thing keeping me going and alive is a tiny puppy, and it's becoming a thin thread.I was in the process of planning to end my life. One day a family member brought home a puppy and ever since then he's been my reason for waking up and still struggling. It helped ease the numbing pain yet the thoughts are coming back to me, and ideas of suicide have been returning at an alarming rate. I feel incredibly lost in life-going through the motions and the feeling is terrifying to me.
