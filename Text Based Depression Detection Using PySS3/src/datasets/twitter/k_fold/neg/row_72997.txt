I'll kill myself soon.I have a rare disorder. I suffer from severe depression and OCD. I am a lesbian and have homophobic parents. I can't sleep at night. I can't go to sleep early cause I'll end up crying, scratching and punching myself because my illness is more endurable, if I'm asleep.

I have to redo a final. My suicidal thoughts, laziness and illness prevent me from studying. I'm not doing that well in my new school. I'm addicted to energy drinks and feel bad, if I don't drink one. I drank like 6-7 in the last 3 days. I'm disrespectful to my parents. I have one crazy crush on the teacher I had in the subject I failed in. I almost only fall in love with much older people. My illness prevents me from having a love life.

In the last 3 years my life has been going down-hill and the last time I had at least a little peace was back in 2015.

Please don't tell me it'll get better because it WON'T! My illness is my main problem and it can't be cured. It's constantly there and it's killing me emotionally and preventing me from living a peaceful and happy life. I've given up a long time ago. I've always wanted to be alive and become successful. It won't happen because I have no inner peace and have lost myself. I don't know who I am anymore. I'm just floating in the air and wondering about how I'll kill myself. I really want to take my favorite bike, take my sister's sleeping pills and hang myself underneath a tree next to my favorite biking place.
