I just want to vent.

It is been on my mind lately, and I want answers. Can I really survive this feeling of anxiety, fear, sadness, etc..? I don't know if I really am depressed but I know that these feelings are bothering me for a very long time and it is getting worse as the time passes by. All these years of suffering makes me feel like I'm inside a cave and not a tunnel because I can't see an opening from the other side of this instead it is always dead ends. It makes me want to give up, no matter how many times I cheer up myself there is always something that brings me down.

I just found out recently that my brother feels the same thing, he came out by telling to my aunt and uncle of what he feel after all these years of staying at home and not even trying to find a job. There are times that I suspected that he was depressed but I'm more convinced that he was just lazing around and now I know what he truly feel. My uncle strictly told me to help my brother but I don't know what to do. When I said the same thing on my parents, they are convinced that I'm faking it and sometimes they said that I'm no good at all. And now most of my relatives are asking me to help my brother from the same thing that I've been feeling? Why? Is it because I finished college and my brother is not? Is it because I am the first one who got a job instead of my brother? Or am I the only one who they can depend upon? I know I sounded like a bad person even I know my brother's condition but I had enough.

It's been a very long time since I seek help from other people. I decided to stop because I don't think people's advice and opinions can't help me. I seek help but do nothing with it. I never follow up and now I make my life more miserable instead. Some considers this as narcissistic trait but I can't help it.
