My friend just told me that she wants to kill herselfHi I donâ€™t know where to begin but I guess the title gives it away: my friend just told me and two other friends that she wants to kill herself sooner or later. Iâ€˜m not 100 percent sure if itâ€™s alright if I post this in here but itâ€™s urgent and I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Sorry if the format is weird, Iâ€™m on my phone and itâ€™s also almost 3am so my brain is kinda done. 

Iâ€™m asking for advice because I really donâ€™t know what to do because Iâ€™m not a professional or trained in any of this and I think I may have overstepped. Iâ€™m currently visiting a friend with two other friends (ofc following all covid regulations) and weâ€˜re not in our home country which makes this a little bit more difficult. 

One of my friends has recently been diagnosed with severe depression and we helped her with going to a doctor and getting professional help. This is where the problem begins: even though we helped her see a doctor to show her that we support her and want to help her get better, sheâ€™s not really going through with anything. She stopped taking medication even though sheâ€™s only been on it for a couple of weeks and it usually takes some time to see if they work or not. The problem is that she didnâ€™t take them for a long time as she forgot to take some and then decided to not take them anymore without consulting her doctor (because she said they donâ€™t work). After consulting her doctor (who told her to slowly go down with the dosage) she didnâ€™t go through with it and just continued to not take her medication at all. She has also been going to a therapist but hasnâ€™t really â€žclickedâ€œ with him which is obviously not a problem because not every therapist fits everyone  BUT she went there two times and then stopped because she didnâ€™t like how he always told her the same things over and over again and didnâ€™t really let her talk so she stopped going there without ever addressing this to him. She also hasnâ€™t been looking into other therapists or getting new medication. 

We all know that itâ€™s bad and that she currently experiences a â€žlowâ€œ. 

So now that Iâ€™ve explained a little bit of the background information, Iâ€™ll come to the point that really concerns and frustrates me:

after dinner, she was talking to our friend (who has depression as well) and then told her that she wants to end her life sooner or later because therapy and medication wonâ€™t work for her and that she doesnâ€™t see any sense in continuing her life like that.

The friend that she talked to was getting overwhelmed and called me in to talk to her and I basically told her that we will always be her support system but that some things are just too much even for us and that she has to talk to a professional because we canâ€™t really change her thoughts or even talk to her the way a therapist would (and we also donâ€™t want to say anything that could trigger her to do anything to herself). I then also told her that we canâ€™t force her to go to therapy or take her medication but that we want her to try harder and find reasons that are worth living for because I know that she has reasons to stay alive (she also has told us that she doesnâ€™t want to live or die). 

So this is the moment where I thought that I may have overstepped a bit because I told her that in the end we canâ€™t force her to do anything and that we can only push her towards wanting to try harder but that we canâ€™t decide for her if she wants to do it or not.

I also told her (because I didnâ€™t know what else I couldâ€™ve said to explain it to her) that itâ€™s just so much to think about if someone just tells you this out of the blue in such a casual tone. Because I obviously donâ€™t want to say anything that could make her make her decision. Also I was a big harsh (which is obviously not right but I was overwhelmed) because I was getting angry with her for just casually telling us this. 

She had a panic attack after talking to me and now Iâ€™m scared that sheâ€™ll do anything to herself but we canâ€™t really do anything because weâ€™re not in our home country and obviously canâ€™t force her to do anything she doesnâ€™t want to do. I also donâ€™t think that she wants to do it right now but itâ€™s still important to make her try to go to therapy again and take her medication. 

I know this may sound selfish but I canâ€™t really handle it? None of us really can because she just said it so casually and while we believe itâ€™s urgent, we think she does not want to commit suicide right now (hence why the sooner or later). She just said without thinking about how this just immediately put us into â€žalarm modeâ€œ and this also kind of explains me getting a bit harsh because it frustrated me that she didnâ€™t even try to go through with therapy or medication (which was insensitive and I acknowledge that). And I know her not going to therapy or giving up on medication is caused by her depression, I just donâ€™t know how to change it? I donâ€™t know what to do.

If anyone could maybe give some advice, it would be appreciated..
