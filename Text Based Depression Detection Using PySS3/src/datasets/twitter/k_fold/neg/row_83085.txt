I have a lot of pain and sufferingI'm constantly tired, everything hurts, there's pain in my chest, and I feel terrible. My sadness keeps getting worse and I can't stop it. I have no one to truly talk to about my problems and I just wake up everyday feeling miserable. My anxiety has sort of died like I want to and don't want to simultaneously because I've lost actually caring about how other people think about me and keep thinking one day I'm just going to lose it and burst.
