Can't take itI don't know how to put this all into words, but I'll try. My whole life, I've felt like an outsider, just different from everyone else. I don't know what it is, but it's almost like since a young age, I've been addicted to  the feeling of rejection and liked it better than being surrounded by a happy social setting. I've just always felt so much better not bothering other people, so my amount of trying new things and making myself happy with accomplishment had always been a little hard. And I had a lack of motivation the last couple years, for one I had less opportunity in the place I lived but after my family and I moved I started to isolate myself and I wasted a good whole year of my life. when I mean wasted, i mean WASTED. Locked behind the doors of by bedroom. But now I've come to an awakening and I am overwhelmed by opportunity and I'm constantly thinking, "should I be doing that?" or "should I not be doing this?" It's so stressful sometimes, because I'm about to turn 16 in January and now that I see all this opportunity that i didn't seek out when I was younger, I want to do a lot but I don't have all the time in the world (besides, this is the age that my friends and myself will be getting jobs so that makes even LESS time for things). I don't want any regrets. I resent myself for wasting my childhood on bogusness and I feel like I'm lacking so much experience. i feel naive and like i dont know anything. I also have a close friend, he's the greatest but sometimes I feel like I should run away because I don't much to offer. 

Also, when I was just getting to be absolutely satisfied with the place I lived in, i was going out like everyday with my bike and riding around town, but then we moved again, to a small neighborhood right off a main road. So once again I felt isolated, but this time I didn't want to be. Ugh it's so fucking agitating I want to rebel more against my parents. This whole summer I was suicidal and even after telling them, they did JACK!  I knew what I needed to, too get out more and be in my favorite places in town but no one listened to me. Just thinking about it makes me want to kill myself. I resent the past and feel little for the future.
