How does one study with suicidal thoughts?I have a test tommorow but I can't study whatsoever because I keep wanting to die and feeling depressed. I've had this problem/question for years now and never answered myself.

It's not like it would be a valid excuse whatsoever to the teachers, they don't even believe people can have mental health problems or negative thoughts!
