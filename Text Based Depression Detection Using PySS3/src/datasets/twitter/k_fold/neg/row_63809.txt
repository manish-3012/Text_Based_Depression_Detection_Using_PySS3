I want to die, but I'm too afraid of the painI don't see any hope in living anymore. There's nothing that I'm good at, nor is there anything left that I enjoy. I waste away my time watching TV or playing stupid games just to kill the time until I die. But still every single day is like a torture and I want to get it over with, but I'm just too afraid to die. I've been thinking about suicide for years, but I never had the courage. Recently the pain has become overwhelming and all that's holding me back is the fear of the pain when dying.  
  
I'm a failure. I'm a parasite. I have no worth living. I fail at everything, even dying. I'm not even worth to talk to people. I should just die lonely in a fucking corner of my room. But I'm so afraid. I can't stand this torment any longer  
  
Edit: Thank you for your help. I managed to get some sleep and I guess I'll try once more to get help.
