I just wish I were good enoughI wish I were good enough as I am. I wish people would want me as I am. I wish someone would want me as much as they want other people. But I guess I'm just a nobody. I'm nobody special. People don't want someone like me who's boring and a loser. And those thoughts right now are enough to make me wanna die.
