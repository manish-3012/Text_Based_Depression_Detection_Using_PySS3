I(14f) picked up my phone and I want to die because of itI received a call with the following words (Contains graphic language

&gt;!" Some dogs are doggos, some are puppers, and others may even be pupperinos. There are corgos and clouds, fluffers and floofs, woofers and boofers. The chunky ones are thicc, and the thin ones are long bois. When they stick out their tongues, they're doing a mlem, a blep, a blop. They bork. They boof. Once in a while they do each other a frighten. And whether they're 10/10 or 12/10, they're all h\*ckin' good boys and girls."!&lt;

I feel empty after reading it and now I'm actively thinking about suicide.
