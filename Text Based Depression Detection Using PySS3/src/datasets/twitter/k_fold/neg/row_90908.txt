Don't know what to doHey y'all


Throwaway cause people know my main account. I apologize in advance for the length story but I don't know what do anymore. I don't have anymore fight left and I want to give up.


Some background, a year ago I went through a really traumatic experience that led to a PTSD diagnosis. I was still in university at the time but because of the PTSD I failed my classes which delayed my graduation a year and had to petition to be let back into the school. I thought life was going great because I thought I had finally overcome everything. I was given a new slate at university, I had just finished a prestigious internship, and I was ready to take on the new year.


So now, I go to register for classes and I find that I can't because of a hold. Find out my hold is for a past due balance because the loan I had taken out expired before I submitted a missing part (was never told the expiration date). I try to talk to the FinAid office but there's nothing they can do since the only loans that can cover past due balances do not work for me (no one in my family has good credit). The balance is something I could never pay out of pocket. So not only is it looking like I won't graduate this year but it's looking like I'll never graduate and achieve my dreams.


I feel like I'm watching everything I spent my whole life working on slip away. I don't know what do. I feel so lost and scared. Ending it all is looking a better and better option. I know that there are worse things going on in the world and there are people who have it worse so I feel incredibly guilty for writing this. I just don't know what to do anymore.
