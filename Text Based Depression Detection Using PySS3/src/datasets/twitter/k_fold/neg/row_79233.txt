Suicidal and can't even afford therapyI don't even know if it makes me mad or just sadder, probably both. I need to talk to someone so I find a will to live and I can't even afford it. I know therapist must have money to live too but how come all of them have prices that would cost me half of my pay, can't think of a child being put in the situation when they want to die and their parents can't afford to help them.
