I want someone to tell me taking my life is okay.I've been through the bullshit. The therapy, the meds, talking to everyone under the sun. I don't want any "internet hugs" or fake sentiment. I just want one person to tell me all the good that could come from dying tonight. Reassurance that the world will continue without me, and that there is no heaven or hell or god to meet me, only rest in the void and nothing more.
