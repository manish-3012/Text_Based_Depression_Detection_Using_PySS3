Your typical teenagerI am a teenager. I have friends and a lovely sibling. Last year, what my mother would say all summer made me feel bad about myself, and looking myself in the mirror thinking all the comments she said, was one of the reasons I believed her, and counted me as a failure. I spent three whole months traveling inside whole country with my family, and I appeared to do nothing correctly. In mid-summer, I wanted me gone. I was disappointing everyone and everything. All I did was punching walls causing my hands to bruise, and crying silently. Not long after, I was tired. Tired of talking to my mom, tired of feeling disappointed in me. I was gonna jump off my balcony, but once I opened the balcony door, my sister started knocking the door aggressively. Turned out, she wanted my help on a math problem she couldn't solve, and needed me. I told her I would do it in a second, but it was just a lie at the time. She opened the door one last time, hugged me, and left. 

I couldn't do this to her. I couldn't just not watch her grow up. I couldn't just leave her alone with our parents. She is the reason I am alive right now, and still going. 

My mental health is not good right now thought. My Significant other found out about my suicidal thought and has helped me feel better, but the option "kill myself" is my only way not to be a abomination and disappoint everyone.
