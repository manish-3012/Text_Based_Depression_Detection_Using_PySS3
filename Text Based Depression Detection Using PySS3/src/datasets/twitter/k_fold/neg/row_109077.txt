I donâ€™t want to kill myself, but things arenâ€™t getting any better.Iâ€™m from the UK and Iâ€™m 23 years old.

I want to kill myself. When I was 20 I had a suicide attempt, and now I wish it had been successful.

The thing is, I have a mum and sister who love me very much. I donâ€™t want to hurt them, so I keep living.

So I want to avoid killing myself, but everything is awful and things are getting worse every day.

The reason Iâ€™m making this post is because I want to advice on how I can improve my situation. There are two main things: 

- I graduated from university this year. I got a First Honours degree, but it means nothing because I canâ€™t find a job. I apply for about two jobs every single day, spending my days writing new cover letters and resumes. I get NOTHING back. Not even an interview. 

I studied Film Studies and I know thatâ€™s a notoriously difficult field to break into, but Iâ€™ve worked so hard these four years I thought I would have found SOMETHING. Especially because last year, I was an intern for Disney Channel for 12 months. I thought I would have a better chance than other graduates. 

So my life right now is fucking awful. I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere with my mum and sister. I walk the dog and thatâ€™s the only time I leave the house. I donâ€™t see people. I donâ€™t have friends. I just wake up, apply for jobs and then go to sleep and then do the same thing the next day.

I donâ€™t know what to do. I just want a job. Thatâ€™s all I want. Iâ€™m so hardworking, I know I would make a good employee.

I canâ€™t move out until I get a job, so Iâ€™m stuck here until that changes...and Iâ€™m starting to think it never will.

I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s something wrong with my cv or my cover letter, or if itâ€™s just bad luck. Iâ€™m currently trying to apply for positions as fast possible when they first pop up. Until now, Iâ€™ve been applying on the day of the deadline purely for organisational purposes, but I think if I apply earlier it may increase my chances.

Iâ€™m also trying to get a driving license cause thatâ€™s essential for a lot of runner roles, but itâ€™s difficult. Currently doing lessons, but itâ€™s really really slow.

- My girlfriend broke up with me. We were together for a year and we did long distance for 6 months. She was the love of my life and sheâ€™s gone now and everything is worse. We had a fight and she blocked me on every social media.

Itâ€™s been a month now. I want to move on...but thereâ€™s nothing to move on to. I donâ€™t know anybody and I donâ€™t know how to meet people. I donâ€™t want to do Tinder because frankly, from past experiences, I always meet insane people.

And I still love her...Part of me thinks that all I ever wanted was to love and feel loved. So maybe itâ€™s ok to call it quits. I achieved what I wanted to achieve, so maybe Iâ€™m allowed to just die.

I donâ€™t know what to do. I know these two problems may not seem that grave, but everything right now seems so hopeless.

I canâ€™t find employment and I lost my girlfriend and Iâ€™m trying, I swear Iâ€™m trying, to make my life better, but the more I try, the more I fail and itâ€™s exhausting. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m so tired and I just want to give up.
