I'm fighting my thoughts alone now.I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was 11ish, 18 now, for 2 of those years, being the past two, someone irl knew that I wanted to kill myself, and them knowing helped me somewhat get through some things I went through, i've attempted many times, but i've been too scared every time I almost harm myself, attempted drowning 3 times, tried cutting my throat too many times to count, but always been a weekly thing, now I just cross roads without really looking and stuff like that, idk how I have never been hit, regardless no one in my family knows I want to kill myself, and now the problem being no one in my course knows I want to kill myself, which obviously I don't want to tell everyone, but I feel alone again, i've been getting the train recently for Uni too, and I feel like at some point, I will attempt to jump into the rails, I don't get any time to myself which has stopped me most the time on my attempts, I've been at my breaking point for years, and no one online wants to hear my venting anymore, i'm a burden, and I want to kill myself soon.
