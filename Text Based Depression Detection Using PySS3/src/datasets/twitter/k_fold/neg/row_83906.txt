i feel completely hopelessi'm a 16 year old girl. my depression first came up when i transitioned into highschool. ive been to different therapists, ive tried group therapy, im on 4 ish different medications, im finishing a partial hospitalization program. my mother has tried to support me through all of it, but she's starting to say that she's tried everything she can and i can tell im a burden in her life. i've tried so hard to combat my mental illness and it feels like it always fails. the only times ive felt a little better is when ive gotten drunk or smoked weed. ive been suicidal for years, but now i feel like i hit the very rock bottom of it all and i wish everyday i was dead. lately im starting to experience unreality and other symptoms that i cant even explain. i just feel like im at a breaking point and i want to kill myself more than ever. i tried one of the suicide hotline chats cause im scared of phone calls and no counselor responded to me after 50 mins of waiting. sorry if this is rambling i just needed to get it off my chest. thank you
