Lost on HopeI'm pretty much close to giving up- this is not the best moment for me. Well, almost every moment is horrible- so I'm not ever seen in a positive light. 

Before contuing, let me introduce myself. I'm Vic, a 16 yearold (17 if I last another month in this hell) female. 
I'm Iranian- so things haven't been the best since I was born here. 

Everything is just going south- and I don't know what to do. 

I lost someone dear to me months ago and it hurt my aching heart more than imaginable. She was so dear and just generally, the sweetest thing I had ever seen. 

I'm in a relationship with this girl. She doesn't love me- I don't know why she wants to pretend and go on. I feel like a let down to her- I feel like I'm the most unlovable thing there is. 

I don't have ANY friends. Nobody likes me and I am uncared for. You'd expect that I'd be used to it by now- but I'm not. My pain just got worse and worse- I really can't wake up feeling like I want to start my day. I abandoned the things I loved.. life is just bitter. 

I just want to not wake up, leave whatever reality I'm living in. This is seriously too hard. I can't and I'm sorry!

I appreciate you for reading this, and if you left a response- I just want to thank you for any advice..
