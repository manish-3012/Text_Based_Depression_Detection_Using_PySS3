The prospect of working a shitty job for the rest of my life just for the sake of breathing may be enough to drive me to suicideI graduated college with a liberal studies degree like a fucking idiot because all the stupid college advisors, parents etc assured me that I would be fine and I wouls get a job. It's now going on 6 months and the only jobs that i can get are shitty customer service jobs which I rathee kill myself then take. Why do people bother working when that is literally all they do? I can't grasp it for the life of me and nobody else in my life seems to understand the issue. I rather die then sell my fucking soul. I was at the top of my fucking class, I wrote an award winning thesis. Now I'd be lucky to get a job at fucking walmart. College got me absolutely nowhere. I would be better of it I didn't go with my current degree. If I could go back in time I wouls have went into a STEM field. But it's to fucking late not. How fucked up is society that you have to make the most important decision of what you want to do for your entire life at 17 fucking years old. Fuck the world, fuck our shitty dreamboat education system. I can't live like a useless sack of shit any longer
