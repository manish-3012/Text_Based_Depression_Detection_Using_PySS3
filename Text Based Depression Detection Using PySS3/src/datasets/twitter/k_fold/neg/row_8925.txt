cannot rewind my life, so I should end it.My life is falling apart. I am 27 and have an okay job but it does not have any upward mobility. I am a shy and somewhat socially awkward woman so I do not have much of a social life. I have never dated anyone (which I recognize is pathetic). I have one friend but she belittles me a lot and makes me feel like a loser. She has tried to set me up on dates a few times but gets mad when I do not like her friends (they are extroverted type men who like to go out to parties a lot and/or flaunt how much money they have. My ideal person would be someone shy like me who likes more low key things). This friend is always making it seem like I am too old now to find anyone like that and that I should settle for whoever offers to date me first (she married at like 21 btw and always makes me feel like shit for not doing the same). Lately, I have started to believe her, maybe my time to find love has passed and itâ€™s all over. Iâ€™m not a â€œcoolâ€ person, I enjoy silly things like films (as a hobby I have dabbled in video essays on films/tv on youtube), video games, and writing screenplays, these are probably time wasting hobbies that arenâ€™t efficient and I realize Iâ€™m probably too old to enjoy them. I have wasted so much time, if I cannot rewind everything then I should just destroy it completely.
