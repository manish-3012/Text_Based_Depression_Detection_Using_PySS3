My suicide would be a shock to my best friendIâ€™m so ashamed to be depressed. Iâ€™m ashamed I had to go to the hospital, Iâ€™m ashamed I had to be put on meds, Iâ€™m ashamed that Iâ€™ve ruined so much for the few ones who do know about my depression. I feel like Iâ€™m a burden. Iâ€™m the villain in my life and I have to stop it now.  But my best friend has no idea any of this is happening to me and the last thing sheâ€™d know about me is that I betrayed her.
