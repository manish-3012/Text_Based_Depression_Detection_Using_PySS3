I don't want to die, but there is no reason to live.I don't want to be suicidal. I don't want to die. I want to find things to live for. But there isn't anything. No matter how hard I look I can't find a single reason that I should stay. I have a couple things that need to be cleaned up, but after they are finished... there isn't anything that I can find to keep me going. 
It is so sad. I used to think that I could keep pushing and going, but there was something to live for back then. Ups and downs suck but when you know there is something on the other side, it isn't so bad. But why keep climbing the mountains and scraping myself on the valleys when there isn't anything on the other side? I just can't see the point. There isn't anything that could make me happy, and there isn't even anything that could hurt me anymore. Everything that could hurt has already happened - nothing matters enough for me to even care now.

I don't want to do this, but I just can't find a real reason not to. There is no one left for me, and no one who will notice much that I am gone. A short span of physical pain doesn't seem so bad.
