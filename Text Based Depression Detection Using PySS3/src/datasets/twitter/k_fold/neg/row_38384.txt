Why Do We Live?I think about this question often.  Suicide is an occasional thought as well.  I've grown used to very pessimistic thinking and lifestyle, where I wouldn't bother trying things, I think you can relate.  I've grown used to being yelled at, broken down, to the point where I just sit there and just clear my head until it is over (The person yelling at me stops).  I was pretty calm tonight when I was being yelled at my mom (I'm in high school) but as she kept going on, she brought some significant points; like where will I be in 10 years, those type of questions.  My mom is devoutly religious, and even said; "Might as well just kill yourself if you aren't going to do anything good," (Something along those lines).  I know she doesn't mean it; I admire her greatly, as she is hard working and caring, but she is constantly making these talks.  Today, /r/suicidewatch, I ask this:
How can I change myself to like something I hate?
-A little background:
I'm a really lazy person.  I have several siblings, and I am the one that took the lowest level courses (They took AP classes while I just take honors, with some advanced).  I get yelled at and raised to them quite often.  My friends; they think I am smart, but I have such a shitty work habit, I don't take those courses.  I fully believe that I could do all of this advanced work, just that my work habit is just so shitty.  Like I won't even do my homework at home; I do it the day it is due the period before it is due.  
Perhaps if someone can answer that question for me, it may help others as well.
So how can you grow to like something that you hate?
I'm not feeling terrible tonight, and I think I can stay strong and work through this stress.
