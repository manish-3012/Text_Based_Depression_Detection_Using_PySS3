Really suicidal...It just dawned to me how pathetic I am. More pathetic than 90% of this sub, r depression and r anxiety. 

I'm so subhuman that I cannot even relate to most of the problems people on this sub are having. "Ever since my ex-girlfriend/wife left me...", "It's hard to kill yourself when you're a father/mother", "MY friends and my SO love me, but I'm only a bother to them...".

How did I become this way? What did I do wrong? Am I really that subhuman?

Life is horrifying. Why do I HAVE to fight depression, anxiety, bullying and loneliness while my peers are having a blast? My best years are flowing away. Why bother living? I've never been happy a day in my life. There was always something standing in the way.

Yeah, who gives a shot anyways? I'm not a hot girl, nor am I a hot guy, so, who would give a damn anyways. And don't dare you say that "looks don't matter".
