Hello I'm BackSo after taking zoloft for a while life started getting better.

but what is the point really,

the past few weeks I just did nothing, but I have a lot to do.

I feel like I got mostly what I wanted.

gilfriend, house, job.

And now I just really want to let it all go.

if she dumps me then I can just disappear, no one would notice immediately.

I'd just be gone for a week and then people would find out.
