I do not know how people do itEvery time I find it harder and harder to cope with failures, even the ones that are nothing new for me, like something not going as planned at work or receiving negative feedback. I would have expected that turning 30 would make me moreÂ resilientÂ but it seems like it's only getting worse. All the failures make me want to jump out if the window and sometimes it's very scary, because these thoughts are coming up spontaneously in moments ofÂ distress, andÂ I am afraid I will do it. I don't really want to die I think but I feel a total failure for not having better coping skills. I also feel guilty because my problems are not that big, compared to rest of the worldÂ â€”Â I have a well paid job (for my country standards at least), a husband, few close friends and so on but I feel very lonely. Even my therapist does not quite get me. How do you guys cope with stuff and find hope to keep on living?
