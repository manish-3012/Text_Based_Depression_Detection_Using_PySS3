I just moved to a new city and feel completely dead insideI need some words of encouragement. I moved here for school about four hours away from home, where I was living with an SO that gave me the best year of my life in our apartment. I came out a lot better than when I went in. I was mentally in the best place I had ever been. I'm in so much pain for leaving that behind. I just want to die.
