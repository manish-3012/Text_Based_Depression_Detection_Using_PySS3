Schizophrenic, unemployed, depressed. What can I do?I sleep for 15 hours a day and refresh the same 5 subreddits the rest of the time. Nothing brings me joy anymore. There's a mild case of restlessness caused by meds which means I can't sit still and watch a show. My music isn't getting me anywhere so I can't do that as well (getting 10 plays on a new track half of which are my own is really discouraging). I don't have a suicide method and can only pray to die. I wish I could work at a 9 to 5 job. I can't leave the house without someone accompanying me (usually one of my parents), which makes me undateable (no woman wants a mommy's boy). I wish I were dead.
