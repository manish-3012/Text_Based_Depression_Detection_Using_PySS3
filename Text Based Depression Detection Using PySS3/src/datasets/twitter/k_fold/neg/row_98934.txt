I'm the closest i've ever been to suicidei graduated high school last year, and my parents expect me to go to college. i took a gap year to save up some money and get used to having a bit more responsibility but now i feel stuck. I'm nowhere near where i need to be to start college this semester, and everytime i try to make progress it feels like my parents just arent there to help me. they always have more important things, im invisible to them sometimes. its almost the end of july and they haven't even asked me about college at all in months. aren't parents supposed to help with this kind of stuff? i genuinely don't know what to do but they always seem so put out when i ask for help that at this point i don't even want to ask.

i hate myself, ive always hated my body but its only gotten worse during coronavirus. i used to work out at least semi-regularly but even then it would always make me feel like shit afterwards. even when i try to diet it just worsens my emotional state because ive been using food as a crutch for years. i feel like i can't wear what i want because it either doesn't fit or i just look dumb. i grew my hair out and actually kind of liked it but my parents just made fun of it, and when i did get my hair cut it just made my self image worse.

i have amazing friends but i feel like im a disappointment around them, i go out to escape but then i just feel worse afterwards. i want to be with someone so bad but i know it wouldn't be fair to start a relationship, and it would just make me feel worse anyway. it doesn't help that im constantly telling myself that nobody could ever love me.

ive just felt so empty. i went on a camping trip with some friends and i couldn't even enjoy half of it because i was so stuck inside my own head. all my hobbies have stopped being fun, the only reason i get out of bed on my days off is because i know if i don't i will get yelled at. at this point work is the only reason i haven't completely given up, probably because i have so much anxiety about being late or letting my coworkers down.

my parents seem to either not care about or not notice my mental health. they treat mental illness as a joke but even if they didn't i know they probably cant afford treatment and it's probably not covered by our insurance (yay american healthcare)

seriously considering getting some sleeping pills or something after work and just ending it monday. i just dont want it to be painful
