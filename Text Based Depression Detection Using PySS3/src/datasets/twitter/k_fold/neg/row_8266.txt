Anyone else want to die but not suffer?I wish there was a button I could click that would just end my life, or if I went to sleep and just never woke up. Every suicide method seems too painful, and I don't want to fail and end up in a worse position. I'm sadly too much of a pussy for that. Also I'm not looking for any of that fake "why don't you want to live" crap I just want to see if others feel the same way.
