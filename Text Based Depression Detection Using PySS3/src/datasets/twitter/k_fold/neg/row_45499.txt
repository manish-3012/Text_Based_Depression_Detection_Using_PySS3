Lost a co worker to suicideShe was actually a friend we wernt close but I definetly consider her a friend ðŸ’œ
When my other friend from work told me yesterday he called her a stupid bitch it mad me mad and sad cause we didn't know her struggles nor did any of us know her pain I think its wrong to pass any judgement 
I hope she is at peace I have empathy for her cause suicide has come up a lot in my life but I also hope all her family and friends can heal from her loss 
I feel bad but I also understand how it feels like you have no way out 
I hope this is not in any way offensive to anyone like I said everyone's pain and struggles are different
RIP my friendðŸ’œðŸ’™ðŸ’œðŸ’™ðŸ’œðŸ’™ðŸ’œðŸ’™ðŸ’œðŸ’™ðŸ’œ
