Iâ€™m not gonna die today but I certainly donâ€™t want to live!Iâ€™m not gonna die today I can tell you that, I always make posts on here but always seem to come back thanks to my survival instincts and shouts from my father bringing me back haha. Honestly I just feel such pain, I feel guilt, sadness, anger. I feel like whatever I do I ruin everything in my path, Iâ€™m never good enough and I canâ€™t simply just love myself. I feel like Iâ€™m gonna become like Ronald in the movie Bad Ronald, the isolation and pain is really getting to me.
