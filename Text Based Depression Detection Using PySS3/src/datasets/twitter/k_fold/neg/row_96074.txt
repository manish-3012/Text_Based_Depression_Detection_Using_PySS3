Confused and OverwhelmedI'll be honest and say I am very confused  on where to even begin. I guess more than anything I am overwhelmed with all the information about suicide and could use some real advice on where to begin.

Now this is about my niece. I am also overwhelmed with situation because I want to help but it is very complicated. I guess I am saying that it is a delicate situation. My niece who I'll call Mary has tried to commit suicide twice. Mary is an absolutely brilliant girl with a complicated family life. She is in high school and even skipped ahead a few grades because she is so smart. Her Biological mom is not in the picture at all. Mary is also the product of a rape. 

Mary is being raised by her grandparents and another aunt. The whole family loves Mary and tell's her so everyday. Everyone is afraid to push her to open up because she might shut down completely. She was taken to a hospital for psych care for a few months. The family is also trying to keep everything on the down low because we live in small town. People really talked when Mary was born. I really don't think  need to paint the picture on what kind of things were said. The other aunt and grandma really don't want people talking about Mary now or making her more upset.   

The real problem is getting Mary to open up to anyone about what is really bothering her. We are all just guessing. Is it her bio mom, is it kids at school or other people talking about her conception. Right now, she is giving the usual teenage answers of, I am alright, everything is fine, and I don't need to talk to anyone (counselor, still pushing for it though). She is trying to put up an obvious front. I really think she doesn't want to appear to be any less normal than her peers. 

What are some steps that we can take without making her isolate herself more?
