80% of suicides aren't first attemptsThis statistic makes me sad. All the time, I see people post on social media that suicide is caused by things like lack of resources, and we need to add more resources, so that way those with depression can be treated. 

It's bullshit. Perhaps it isn't about a lack of having resources. I have a therapist and a psychiatrist. I take antidepressants everyday, and today I felt like absolute shit and felt like killing myself. None of this shit helps. 

What this statistic tells me is that even after attempting to kill themselves once, nothing was able to fix these people's lives. Why am I any different? Why will my life change for the better? I could live the rest of my life with depression. Why should I?
