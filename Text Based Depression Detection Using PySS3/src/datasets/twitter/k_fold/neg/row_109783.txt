I just feel pushed away and easily forgottenI generally just always feel pushed away by everyone. At first they'll accept me but in the end I just end up ignored, or forgotten about. Even by my own family it feels that way, they push me out of conversations, ignore what I have to say, I have to contact them to talk to them they never even call, I sometimes don't even find out family news until two weeks after everyone else. There was one person who would never push me away though, always listen to me, be there for me, and give me love like no one else would and after a little over a year of dating she decided she didn't want me anymore and before that even I still had suicidal thoughts or an urge but I could just talk to her about anything and they would disappear and now I have no one and each day those thoughts grow stronger and everyday I feel weaker no one wants to include me anyway and really I'm tired of carrying on I'm done with it really
