Should I hang myselfIâ€™m 12 year old who goâ€™s to church lives with my parents,  stuff like that, but since the beginning of 2019 I feel like my mental state has hit a low. A couple days ago me and my family were planning on going to Niagara Falls, so we were all packed, and right when we were leaving the next day my mom told me that my dad  wasnâ€™t going to go. I got so upset I thought it was my fault and how I canâ€™t do absolute shit besides play video game so I ran downstairs and grabbed a cord out of my pc and tied it around the fan and got on my bed then I tied it around my neck and I jumped...I was planning for just a bit of pain then my eyes would slowly shut than I  would be ok like if my goal was complete but what actually happen is that the cord yanked my neck as if some chocked me, and then the cord came loose.  Iâ€™m only 12 so why should I know how to tie a knot.. I fell on the floor and just sat there crying wondering if there was a god or if lifeâ€™s a simulation. I was planning on calling the suicide prevention hotline but I didnâ€™t want police to show up to my parents house. So now Iâ€™m stuck here not knowing what to do. I need someoneâ€™s advice on how to get help but not release my info.(p.s I donâ€™t wanna sound like a 12 year old seeking drama or some hoe that just broke up with a girl Iâ€™m honestly asking for help.)
