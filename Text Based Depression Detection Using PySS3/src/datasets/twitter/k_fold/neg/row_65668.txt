Not sure what to do anymoreHi, Iâ€™ve never posted on here before. Everything seem so messed up in my life right now. I keep having nightmares every night about horrible things that have happened to me in the past, and horrible things that Iâ€™ve done in the past. Itâ€™s like I just canâ€™t shake these thoughts. The dreams compounded with the constant depression and anxiety are making it so difficult for me to go on day by day. I love my husband and I donâ€™t want to leave him, I know this will hurt him so much. But Iâ€™m just not sure what to do anymore, Iâ€™m really at my wits end, I am crying just writing this because I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve been getting therapy and they put me on some medicine for the nightmares. I journal and try to talk things out with family and friends, But nothing seems to be helping. I feel like the only way out right now is to take my own life. The only way to end all of this pain and sadness. I donâ€™t even know what to do anymore, I just donâ€™t. I just know I donâ€™t think I wanna be here anymore. I feel so horrible about the things Iâ€™ve done in the past, and all of the people I have hurt. I randomly find myself saying Iâ€™m sorry out loud all the time. Iâ€™m trying to see if I can find some time to go see my therapist again. But at this point Iâ€™m not sure what to do, the pain of living day in and day out itâ€™s just becoming too much to bear. Thanks for reading this.
