I need some advice and someone to talk to.I have an overall 2.0 GPA and I'm making a 1.5 GPA this semester and I'm changing my major. All my friends are getting distant. I have a very hipster personality and the only people that go to this school are racist country people. I'm getting so sick of this place and I feel like there is no decent people left to talk to. Nobody cares about me and as I get older it's getting harder to make new friends.  The only way I feel like I can make new friends is if I know something about sports or getting Drunk and going to the bars. I'm getting so sick of it.
