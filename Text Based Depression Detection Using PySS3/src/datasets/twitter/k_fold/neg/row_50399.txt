Some less urgent thoughtsEvery day I have a constant feeling of being worthless. There's a constant feeling of being out of energy and just a terrible feeling in my chest and stomach that won't go away. I'm tired yet I can't seem to sleep. I cry whenever my mind wanders. I don't have the motivation to do much. I feel ignored by someone I care about and used to be pretty close to, which certainly isn't helping while now feeling so shitty.

None of this seems like it'll be changing anytime soon. I've grown too exhausted to continue looking at life as "I'll feel better in the future. Things will be better." And so I've started thinking of just killing myself to end the emotional pain. I'm scared and afraid of dieing. I worry that I'm one impulse decision away from ending my life.

Really, I don't know what to do to feel better, though.
