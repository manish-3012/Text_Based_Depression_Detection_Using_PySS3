Nothing will ever be okayI'm tired of fucking worrying all the time. I have severe anxiety and depression and don't take anything for it. Mostly because my dad won't take me to get a subscription, but also because i'm always high and that doesn't help, so why would anything else. I can't tell anyone in my life how I really feel about anything, they would only start caring about me even less. I'm planning to hang myself tonight, I just hope my sister doesn't find me first. I'm gonna mke sure I tie it right this time.
