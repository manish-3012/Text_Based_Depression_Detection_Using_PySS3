could really use some helphey guys. iâ€™m having some pretty bad thoughts right now.

my best friend, her boyfriend, and i moved 10 hours away from home for a new start with a one year lease.  two months in, she tells me sheâ€™s moving back home. the move out was very messy and iâ€™ve lost almost all semblance of a support system here. i moved out at 17 (now barely 18) with no money to my name, no employment history, no friends, or a divers license. i feel stranded and abandoned and stuck. iâ€™ve been living alone for the last few months and being alone with myself is so hard. 

back home, my mom is very abusive, which is why i moved out so young. i love her, but would rather die than have to move in with her again. 

there are several medications and bridges that could be utilized if i wanted and that scares me. iâ€™ve even thought about who could take my cat; the boy iâ€™ve been seeing has been saying he wants a kitten anyways. 

i just donâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™m broke, completely alone, hungry, and suicidal. 

thank you for reading
