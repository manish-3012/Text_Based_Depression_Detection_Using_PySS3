I am just sick of everythingI'm 18 my life isn't that great, I used to be pretty smart and get on well in school. But then I was told I can't afford to go to the only college that has this course in Ireland. Im pretty disappointed I've wanted to s vet all my life, as a child I was always telling people that ways my dream job. I always loved animals its always been something im interested in. So there is that I can't pick my future.
I am terrible at socializing, I have barely any friends. I just assume people hate me the second they here me or see me. I hate myself So much.there is nobody I hate even as close. I've always seen myself as ugly and I hate just ugh. Its so unfair why to I have to live with myself.
The man I love admittedc he wasn't interested in dating me. He just wants to have sex and stuff.
My family found out I attempted suicide a few times. I hate them. They made me feel bad completely. I wish I didn't survive, I wish I was dead they made me feel so guilty.and when I tell them about any problems they feel bad and it makes me feel worse.
I never had many friends. 
I hate school.
I hate myself 
My life my everything. 
I also have exams this week which im going to fail every single one of.
Im just sick of everything. I'm just going to stay home tomorrow. Pack up my stuff Clear my  room then hang myself. 
Should I leave notes? Im scared in case they end up kinda bitter? I think I should just leave it. Also my family doesn't think I should go to therapy or anything because im not that bad they will just give me drugs and use me for money.
I hate talking about how o feel to people I just can't talk. Im so shy I just can't talk about it to ANYONE.
The whole future just seems so bleak. I feel like im being built tripped into being alive.
I don't feel I have any other options, I hate how people tell me wait your problems will fade, yes but more and more pop up and it never ends.
