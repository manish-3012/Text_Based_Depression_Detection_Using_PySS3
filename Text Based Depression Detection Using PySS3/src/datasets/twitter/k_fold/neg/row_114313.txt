Annoyed that people care about me.I want to die, but I can't because there are people who care about me who won't take it well. The thing is, this doesn't make me feel like dying any less. Now I have to continue living this shell of a life that I hate just to keep them happy. And I don't know how to be okay with that. I don't have any aspirations. I'm just tired.
