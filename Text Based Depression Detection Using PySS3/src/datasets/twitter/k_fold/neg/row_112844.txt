Donâ€™t be afraid to talk about how you feel. To whoever who reads this: you are amazing!When I was 14 years old, I tried to kill myself. It all started when people bullied me at school. I had a few friends back then, but when they turned against me and befriended the bullyâ€™s my thoughts became dark. I did a few suicide attempts. I took all pills I could find in my motherâ€™s apothecary. It was the worst feeling ever, I was in so much pain and I was home alone. This made me think, no one wants to die alone. I was crying and thinking about how my parents would be upset and never be able to process the pain when they find me dead. 

I was slowly dying when my parents came home from work. They saw me laying on the couch, and immediately knew something was wrong. I was sweating and crying. At first I didnâ€™t want to tell them what was going on and pretended to be sick. But when I couldnâ€™t even stand up to go to the bathroom, I couldnâ€™t take it anymore. Everything was hurting. I told them I did something stupid and they knew what I meant. They drove me to the hospital (we couldnâ€™t afford an ambulance at that time).

When I arrived at the hospital, they first told me it was too late. Apparently I took pills to slow down my heartbeat and to lower my blood pressure. I was so scared at that point, and my parents couldnâ€™t stop crying next to my bed. The feeling I had is something absolutely no one  wants to feel. It was heartbreaking, even if I was dying I could still feel my heart aching.

They still tried to make me better and gave me some charcoal mix to empty my stomach. I wasnâ€™t allowed to fall asleep. After a few hours it seemed to work, even if the doctors said I wouldnâ€™t make it. Seeing my parents so happy that I wouldnâ€™t die, made me realise there will always be people that care. 

The moral of my personal story is that you should never give up. Iâ€™m 23 years old now, and donâ€™t get me wrong, there are still days that I think about killing myself. Things will never be perfect. But there are days that will make you realise that whatever makes you sad is not worth taking your own life. I talked to a psychologist about all the bullyâ€™s. I moved far away from that place, I lost about 60 pounds, and made a lot of new real friends. I found a wonderful boyfriend who I love a lot. Iâ€™ve been through a lot of bad times too. But I wonâ€™t give up again, I donâ€™t want to go through all the pain and suffering again. Talking about it really helps to relieve some anxiety and pain. 

If anyone wants to talk about their struggles, I will always be open to help you out! Donâ€™t forget, you are amazing and people care about you!
