I don't see the pointI know that the title is rather melodramatic, and something that's been said a million times, but it's true. I can't really see the point. Why? Well...

A week or so ago, I was raped by my (ex)boyfriend and after that my life just kind of fell apart. I didn't go to the police, didn't get a rape kit done--none of that. And now, it's probably too late. No one cares for me anymore and it's just tearing me apart. 

I guess what I really want is just someone to talk to about this whole mess.
