I can't handle my sick brain anymoreAll my life I've had different conditions. Some diagnosed at different periods. For the record it is psychosis, depression, general anxiety disorder, and autism. 

The first time I tried to take my own life was while I was in grade school. That was when I was sent to the school counselor. They believed that it was just acting out due to by parents divorce. As far as the hallucinations, they just told me to stop lying. They felt I was smart for my age and was making a lot of this up. 

I had another attempt when I was 13. I tried to overdose on sleeping pills. It didn't work and just made me really sick. So much so my dad took me to the doctor. I didn't admit what I had done so there was a lot of discussion of what it could be, but what got me to confess was when the doctor said they'd have to do exploratory surgery to find out what wrong. Looking back, I know now it was a ruse to get me to spill the beans. 

That started my sessions in therapy and getting all these diagnosis. I was never put on any meds but learned to hide it and fake being normal. It was exhausting doing that and when I came home from school, I usually went straight to bed. 

Now I am in my 30s and I am doing doctor visits again. When they started me on meds it felt like I could stop pretending and let my guard down. Only problem is the meds seem to work for a bit, then I start getting brain shivers, and I feel worse. They have never stopped the suicidal thoughts. Not a day goes by where I am not wishing I was dead or planning my demise. 

The thoughts of wishing I was dead have turned to planning and figuring out ways to be successful. I am at the end of my rope. I can't take living like this anymore. It has left me friendless. I am a burden on everyone like my family, co-workers, and mostly my husband. I know the world would be better off without me and I want to make that happen.
