Lost everything..I mean EVERYTHING- I have $300k school loan in default 
- credit card collections
- medical bill collections 
- lost my home
- I had to break up with my girlfriend 
- have no real friends 
- parents are worse off financially than I am
- car getting repoâ€™ed
- my credit is shit
- living in a spare fucking room at parents place
- my business hasnâ€™t made a dime since last June
- have $100 left in my account 
- can barely get out of bed in the morning 
- my physical health is deteriorating 
- my mental health has deteriorated 
- my emotional Heath is non-existent 

Iâ€™m ready to blow my brains out. This is too much for anyone to handle.
