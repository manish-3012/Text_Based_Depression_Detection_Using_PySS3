I want to do it.I'm worthless. I'm fucking worthless. Everyone I know would be better off without me. 

I'm just a stupid broken piece of shit with a stupid broken body. I'm a nuisance to everyone in my life. I'm a waste of flesh and space.

It's time. I was hoping to make it to my 21st but it's time. I'm kind of scared but it'll be better for everyone. I told my closest friends that I love them and I'll write a letter for my boyfriend and parents. My sister doesn't care about me. It'll be better for everyone.
