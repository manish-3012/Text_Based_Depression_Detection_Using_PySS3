My wife told me she doesn't love me any more. I have no reason to live anymore. I am a worthless piece of shit and I can't get anything right. I regret everything about myself and everything I've done. I have a house that I can't stand to be in and the one person that meant more to me in the world than anything could give two fucks less about me. I'm a waste of space and a waste of a human being and the whole world would be better off without me.
