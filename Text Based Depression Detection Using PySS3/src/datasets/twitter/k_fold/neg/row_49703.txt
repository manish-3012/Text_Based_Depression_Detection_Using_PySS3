iâ€™m so tired(f15) it physically hurts now. i feel so fat and that i canâ€™t change anything. everytime i look in a mirror i keep wanting to eat less and less. i tried water fasting for 6 days and lost it so fast but i gained everything back this week (cause of thanksgiving). when i did i got super dizzy and weak, but it was worth it. this week has been such a rollercoaster and i regret everything leading up to now. i feel literal pressure on my chest and head, itâ€™s so weird to describe. i donâ€™t want to be here anymore. i tried once two years ago but didnâ€™t go through with it. i feel so lonely and out of place. i really donâ€™t know what to do any longer. i canâ€™t see my future at all. i want someone to just hold me and comfort me, with sincerity. i want someone to truly understand me. i want god to be real. why canâ€™t he just take me back to him? i donâ€™t know what to even say or do anymore; why canâ€™t i be at peace? i hope i can go through with it this time. iâ€™m sorry for all of this paragraph being super messy, iâ€™m just genuinely hurting and donâ€™t know what else to do. i have nobody to talk to and nobody to go to. all i have is my thoughts.
