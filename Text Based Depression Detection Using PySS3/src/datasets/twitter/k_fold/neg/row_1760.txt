When you are fundamentally incapable of loving or being lovedI donâ€™t know. I'm horribly broken. I can't find happiness in life except by clinging to romantic partners, but I don't have the capacity to have a romantic relationship that isn't abusive and unhealthy.

So what. I guess I don't want to commit suicide because it would hurt my parents and my sibling. My parents made me the way I am, so arguably, who gives a fuck about hurting them. But they're just people doing their best. Their best happens to be awful, but that's not their fault. So do I just live my meaningless, crushingly lonely, pathetic life for the benefit of those I would hurt?

I have to keep going to work every day doing fucking nothing, so I can afford rent, so I can live this shitty meaningless life? For the benefit of others?

I just wish I were worthy of love. I wish I wasn't such a monster.
