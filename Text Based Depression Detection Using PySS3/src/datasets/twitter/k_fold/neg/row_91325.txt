i lie too muchi told my boyfriend i was straight (even though i have been bi and came out to him a very long time ago) just to make him happy. i made plans to go to a sleep over and told him about it. he said i was going to just go and look at my friends butts. ive been struggling with depression and anxiety over who i am and this just made it worse. i only want to make him happy. i told him a few hours later that i lied because i wanted to make him happy. he got very upset and confused. some very hurtful things were said towards me, and i know he shouldnt, but since he means the world to me it just tore me down. i proceeded to harm myself after this, and i told him because i felt very guilty about it. he told me i lie too much and to just leave him alone. i love him so fucking much and my heart breaks every time he does stuff like this. i just want to end my life. im so tired of myself and the things that are going on in my life.
