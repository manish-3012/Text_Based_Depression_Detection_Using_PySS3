haha being trans will be my deathwhat's the point of trying when you'll know you'll never pass? 

a stupid 4'11 petite girl even thinking of wanting to transition to a man?

it's pathetic considering i wouldn't even register as even the shortest cisgender men

i waste hours, days, weeks, months of my life in silence and laying in bed. i could be studying and practicing my art or improving my portfolio as i'm slightly confident i may be able of landing a job. actively improving myself considering i'm in highschool. but.

what's the point? i'll still be me. i'll always be me. i will always have this painful body. much less literally with chronic pain- see: scoliosis apparently existing. 

&amp;#x200B;

it sucks though, really. i'm really jealous of everyone who gets to have even a normal, average body. much less a healthy body. but i'm not entitled to it despite them not "deserving" their bodies. that's just how life is.  (like literally, some of people's common complaints are so superficial and just requires self improvement and some intelligence. sure it sucks but they could at least have hopes.)

and same goes for functional families, having friends, having a lover. after being in the black for so long, i honestly don't care about that anymore.

anyways. it sucks i have to wait 2 more years so i can get a gun. i feel like i would mess up the rope and accidentally face a slow painful choking session. 15 degrees to the mouth, here we go.
