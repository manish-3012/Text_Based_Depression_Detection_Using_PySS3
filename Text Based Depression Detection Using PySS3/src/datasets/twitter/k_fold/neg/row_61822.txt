No sleep for five days, no progression towards being okay, and I want to die.I haven't slept in five days. While some would say that as if they only got a few hours, I wish. I haven't slept at all in five days. Maybe a collective 10-20 minutes over the week, but no actual sleep. I really can't sleep. It's driving me insane. 

I take lithium, htp-5, sam-e, tryptophane (for sleeping), and some other things for balancing mood, but I still want to die. I haven't been able to think about much else, so my SAT next week will be absolute shit and my grades are going to plummet. Everything else will just come along. 

I've been trying to see if I could be put in a mental facility for treatment, but my dad doesn't want me there and will go out of his way to stop me from getting that help. But right now, I think it's necessary if I want to be alive for much longer. 

I don't really care much about life anymore, and even with all the art I make, all the plans I have and whatever else, I just don't find a point in any of it. I don't really care about how I effect people throughout my life, since I know it's going to all end, and there wouldn't have been a purpose for my life a hundred years later. Even if on the odd chance that I were to become a "famous musician" like I want to be, it's my work that takes the credit and its the work that is worth it, not me. 

I just don't want to live. Nothing is appealing to me anymore. Even if I were to get help, I don't know what they'd do. I'm guessing some sort of drug or process to make me forget myself and make me have more of a reason to want to die. 

I don't want to be someone that says "Its thirty years later and I still want to die." I want to do it now and get it over with. I just want to die and I don't want anyone to remember me or remember my art. And I really don't want people to be sad - it's much better that I'm dead than not.
