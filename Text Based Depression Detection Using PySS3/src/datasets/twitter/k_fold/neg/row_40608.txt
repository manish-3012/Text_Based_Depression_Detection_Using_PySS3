I feel like a failure.I'm a teenage boy in my junior year of highschool. And I feel like a huge failure. I am asian and so my parents always set high standards for me. And it worked out well for a bit, I did exceedingly well in school. And it all just feels so empty. I feel like that isn't me anymore. I am extremely depressed and thoughts of suicide float around my mind at all times of day. I don't know if I'll do it tonight or tomorrow, but I feel like I've accepted my fate in that I most likely won't even make it to 18. Everyday I come home, lie to my mom about school and how I'm going to do my homework now. I go upstairs to my room and play video games for 6-7 hours straight. I've been doing this for so long and am barely passing any classes. I've been going to therapy for a couple months, but it hasn't had any real effect on me. Beyond just helping me to hide my depression. He gave me examples of model behavior and how I should behave and I do my best to emulate that. But it doesn't help at all, I just fall into my circle of depression. My work keeps piling up and all I do is play video games. I feel so pathetic and that I'm such a failure. I used to be good at school and do my work, but now I'm lucky if I even start doing any work at all. And I feel like committing suicide now will spare me the failure that I'll see in my parents eyes when I inevitable flunk out of highschool. I don't even know why I'm depressed. Maybe I'm just lazy and hate doing work, so I cover up for it by saying I'm depressed. I just feel like such a failure and I don't want to see what I think of myself reflected in my parent's eyes. I just want to go back to who I was, and do my work and be a good student. But I don't know how.
