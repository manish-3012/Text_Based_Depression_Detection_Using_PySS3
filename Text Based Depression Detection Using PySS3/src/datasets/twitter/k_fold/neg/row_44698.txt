I'm casually suicidal and don't know what to do.I want to die, but I'm afraid to kill myself. I've had periodic flare-ups occasionally over the last few years, usually a few days at a time, where I fantasize about dying (not necessarily suicide, sometimes it's just wishing something would happen that kills me). I've put thought into how I would do it, but I have never really considered doing it because I'm afraid of people walking on eggshells around me in case of a failed attempt, and I don't want to saddle my friends and family with the fallout of a successful attempt. My concern is that my life is actually good right now (I'm young, healthy, and debt-free; I believe I'm underemployed and in sort of a dead-end job but it pays well enough that I live relatively comfortably; I have wonderful parents who are both remarried to wonderful people and haven't had to deal with a death among friends or family in a decade) and yet I fantasize about no longer being alive. One of my red flags is that I recently went on a couple dates with a girl I'd been talking to (I don't have very active love life) that I thought went well and I wanted to pursue further but she was not interested in pursuing it further, which was really no big deal but I've been stuck in the gutter for a week afterwords. My greater point is this: I don't want to be alive anymore, but I want to want to be alive, and I'm afraid that at the first true crisis in my life I'll act on my suicidal urges. However, I know that have been enormously, inordinately, unfairly blessed and I don't want to take resources and attention from those less fortunate who are actual and immediate risk of suicide. What do I do?
