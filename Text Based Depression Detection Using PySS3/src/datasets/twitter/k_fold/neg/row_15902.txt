IcarusSo where to start? Been on here for a few days (also on r/depression).. Sort of therapeutic to read other's situation and the responses they get.

Even with all this nothing has changed, been like this for quite a while now. It's just worse at the moment (3rd times in my short life).

Just like Icarus, my life so far has been revolving around always pushing further, career, passions, etc. If you don't know the story well, Icarus is basically a bird that must keep flying higher and higher and tragically ends up burning in the sun. Just like him, the sun seems in my reach now, I feel attracted to him more than any others times in my life for the sole reason that I've felt this way too many times.. Severe anxiety, always pretending that I'm ok.. Even now I don't think someone has noticed my situation.

Can't sleep, can't give a fuck about anything/anyone, sinking in alcohol, keep on pretending, driving over this fucking bridge everyday and wondering why I shouldn't just give myself to it..

For days now, the questions have remained unanswered which is the only reasons I'm breathing now.. Doubt is my only beacon as it presents the hopes that something might get better. 

Still, with all this it seems everyday brings my closer to my sun and I sort of hope to have enough courage to act because yeah, it takes a hell lot of balls to act.

Can't really figure why I'm posting this here, maybe I just like the idea of anonymously sharing what everybody around me can't see.
If Icarus reaches the sun in the days to come, may he secretly be a phoenix and rise from his ashes.
