Everything is going southGood morning/afternoon/night everyone.

Iâ€™m not going to give any more context. I think anyone is interested in how I feel anymore. I donâ€™t have courage to end it all but itâ€™s my 2nd try to cut myself... I cannot sleep well, I drop my performance in work, Iâ€™m unable of study correctly... 

Iâ€™m not even asking for comfort words I just needed to let it out... or end it all.

This is all, sorry for wasting your time
