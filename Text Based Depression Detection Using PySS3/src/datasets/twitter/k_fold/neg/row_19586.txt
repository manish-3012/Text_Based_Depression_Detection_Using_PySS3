yeah. idk.Hi everyone. Fancy meeting you here.

I think... I think it is time for me to go. I'm a 19 year old, who all his life has waited to get out of his abusive parents house, and now that I am out... I feel... disenchanted with the world.

In high school I was a prodigy. I was smart, 34 on my ACT, track and cross country team captain. I played the violin pretty well too, good grades, everything was great. I worked really hard to be the goody goody and do everything perfectly to one day get the hell away from home.

Here I am, a year after leaving. I got a minor in consumption a month ago, and just got a speeding ticket for going 103 in a 75. I drink regularly, I had a girlfriend who was morbidly depressed and a drug addict--I have since left her--I'm on a cross country team and nobody likes me. I am half the man I used to be. I just have become a piece of shit overall. Average. Below average. Worthless.

What's more, I have reached a point where I don't even really care about what other people think. Nobody is really close to me anymore. I am pretty much alone. I have some friends, but nobody close enough that they wouldn't be able to get over me.

I guess I just... I just want a painless way to leave. To stop having to try so damn hard. I thought life will be easy after I escape home, yet here I am, barely making it through life. I wanted to be a doctor one day. Its a lot of work. I don't have the motivation.

I think the world would just be a little better without me, and even if it wouldn't, I feel like I don't really want to be part of the world.

Idk. Maybe I won't do it. I just want someone to here me. Idk. I just don't know.
