Suicide scares me far less than getting sick.Iâ€™ve had some hypochondriac tendencies in my life, which have mostly gotten under control. Obviously the last few weeks theyâ€™ve gotten worse.

Iâ€™m at another low point (god am I getting sick of low points), and I find it interesting that I find myself, on occasion, utterly petrified of getting sick, near panic attack petrified, yet the thought of taking my own life gives me comfort.

I think the feeling is summed up in the most famous line from my favorite poem, Invictus: â€œI am the master of my fate/ I am the captain of my soul.â€ The one truly comforting thing about suicidal ideation is that I have total control over it. Itâ€™s my choice, I get to decide if and when and how I want to do it. No one and nothing can decide it for me. Dying of an illness offers no such comfort though.

Iâ€™m not slipping off this mortal coil right now, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m in immediate danger. But I am slipping back down a hole I had only just started to climb out of a few weeks ago. Itâ€™s so exhausting.
