Extremely Suicidal    Iâ€™ve been extremely suicidal lately, I donâ€™t know what to do. 
    Iâ€™ll admit that Iâ€™m at fault for some of these issues, but theyâ€™re all leading towards me wanting to die.
    First of all, itâ€™s my appearance. That might seem shallow but it goes way deeper than how it looks. I get asked a bit if Iâ€™m trans, and it really just bothers me to the point that I just want to fucking die. No, Iâ€™m not trans. 100% woman. Many people donâ€™t understand Iâ€™ve had cosmetic surgery because I was beaten pretty badly. Getting called names like tranny is just so disgusting, Iâ€™m so pissed off over it I donâ€™t want to have to face it. Itâ€™s embarrassing.
    Second, itâ€™s my passed and continuously getting used. Some people just want to talk to me because they like what they see (which is nice because at least they donâ€™t think Iâ€™m trans) but I get treated like an object and dumped or talked down on. I canâ€™t really have a good relationship, I guess itâ€™s because of how things were when I was young and that affects me. Iâ€™ve already attempted suicide and was put in the hospital but...thereâ€™s a lot more than this. Not going into too much detail but Iâ€™m just sick of everything. I really hate myself and I hate everything about other people. Iâ€™m so disgusted and just want to kill myself. I wonâ€™t, but, I want to.
