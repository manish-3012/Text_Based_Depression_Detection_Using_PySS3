I wish I had a do overIâ€™m so unhappy. So so unhappy. Iâ€™m stuck in a career field I hate, held down by debt Iâ€™m obligated to pay off, stuck in this town too long, lost my love, and been battling depression all my life.

Unhappiness just generally has led me down bad paths, i feel like Iâ€™m just destined to continue to fuck my life off. 

Iâ€™m ready to just cut my losses. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m miserable. Iâ€™m making others miserable. This is such a terrifying life
