I am one of the worst losers this world has to offerFirst off. I am a piece of shit , that if hell (after this life) exists I deserve to burn there for eternity. Secondly, I have been rude to a lot of people. I've been really rude to my parents because I'm always so depressed and angry . I tried to stop this but always fail. I've been rude to people online too  

I already know I will die forever alone it's a dang guarantee.  Which is good, I dont deserve love , i deserve suffering and lots of it. I've never experienced love from someone else and never will. I am such a piece of shit. I have so many demons in my head. 

I have depression for no fucking reason other then that god / some higher power cursed me. I never have energy, passion , talents , I'm fucking numb inside always aside from anger. I'm so easily agitated and soft. I was always the outcast in life and never fit in. My ugly face is a big reason for this.

Sure please , tell me to go workout, tell me to eat healthy , tell me to try , tell me to go to therapy and try meds , or pyschedelics , or to meditate , or to pur more effort in. I have. I've tried alot. I so want to be dead  but I deserve to suffer.

I deserve to suffer here the rest of my life , being ugly , unloved , very mentally ill , i have many demons , I'm cursed , I'm useless , if there is a God he hates me badly , and everyday I get to see others live in heaven not knowing what it's like to be mentally ill.  Good for them. 

Anxiety , OCD , social anxiety loves to fuck me aswell. Pyschosis/paranoia can come up at any point. I deserve all this suffering. I deserve to suffer more and more and more and more and more. God made my face so ugly just to troll me a bit more. I'm a fucking failure. It's impossible to live a good life when you are me. No one understands. It's all just pretending to understand. I'm in hell already, so no need to be religious for me.
