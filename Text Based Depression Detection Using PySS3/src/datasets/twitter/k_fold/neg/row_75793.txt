I wanted revenge.I wanted to hurt him. I wanted to tell him how his words has pushed me towards putting my head under water.
When he told me that I lack understanding, that I lack empathy. When he said "Fuck right off. Leave me alone" for talking about suicide again. 

I wanted him to feel pain. I wanted him to feel guilty. I wanted him to feel horrible. 

But I didn't do it. Instead I wished him all the best, to release the emotions. 
He probably got pissed that I have said something.
