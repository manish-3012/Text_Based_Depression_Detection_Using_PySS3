My life is falling apartQuarantine sucks.

School is about to come back and the stress is kicking in. My best friend is trying to help me but Iâ€™m dragging her down aswell. My mum and I are arguing most of the time and Iâ€™m starting to consider self-harm as a coping mechanism.

I donâ€™t want to die, but Iâ€™m scared the longer this goes on, the more likely I am to do something stupid and irreversible.
