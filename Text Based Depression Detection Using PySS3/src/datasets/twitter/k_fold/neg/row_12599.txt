I Just Got In Trouble At Work and My Brain won't slow downI literally got told to not use my phone as much, no big deal. Safety concerns, and now my brain is freaking out and telling me I'm gonna get fired (there is literally no reason to think this), and that all hope is lost. I take medication for anxiety but this is bad.
