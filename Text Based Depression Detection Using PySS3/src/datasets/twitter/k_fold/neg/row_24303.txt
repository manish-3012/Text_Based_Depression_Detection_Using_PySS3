I want to survive my attempt?This might be attention seeking behaviour idk sorry if I offend anyone.

I'm planning to kill myself in a few days. I'm choosing a method that has about a 50/50 death rate. And has low impact after. 

I want to survive the attempt. I just want to feel close to death. If I die then great. If I don't then great.

I hope it just blacks me out and I wake up the next day and I patch myself up and get on with it.

Again, sorry if I offend anyone.
