Am I The Asshole for abandoning a person with depresson?I have been friends with a girl (I will call her Bubble) for 5 years and I have always known that she had mental problems, such as deep depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder. Bubble is an amazing, talented and very kind girl, but she has some flaws like self-centeredness and a little coldness (normal, we are flawed humans), but that didn't interfere much in our relationship, which was incredible, but not so reciprocal. Her family is also very toxic and doesn't support her at all, so I was always the only shoulder she had to cry on and she always leaned on me.
A few months ago, Bubble's depression was worse, she tried to commit suicide (but failed) and because of that, she didn't send me any more messages and hardly saw her at school (she hid in the bathroom, in the empty rooms or simply missed classes). and because of that, we got distanced. Until one day, I had a more serious conversation with her and I promised to take her to a psychiatrist and take care of her, it was done .. everything was going very well, she even got a boyfriend and was very happy for her, finally she was showing signs of improvement and did not think about committing suicide so often. Everything was going well, but not with me ..
I never had the courage to talk to her, for fear of serving as a trigger for her, that is, she never knew about my personal problems, but for 2 or 3 years, I have been suffering with anorexia and bulimia, until I was sent to a psychiatric clinic with diagnosis of eating disorders, depression and obsessive behavior. It's been very difficult days for me and I don't see myself fit for anything, even getting out of bed is being discouraging and difficult, but anyway ... I don't leave the house and I don't talk to anyone anymore, and Bubble and I we got distanced again... i thought she would be fine, because she was with her new boyfriend, so she wouldn't be alone .. it wasn't like that.
On Bubble's birthday, she was alone at her house and so, despite my desire to just stay home and sleep, I went and took my handmade gifts. There, she vented with me and told me how much she was sad that we left and that she missed our friendship, she said that I had abandoned her and that I was not fulfilling my promise to take care of her. It was the worst sleepover of my life, I was sad and blaming myself for the rest at night, I could only remember Bubble's crying red face and how lousy I was as a friend .. I apologized, but I didnâ€™t tell her why I distanced myself, because I was afraid ..
A few months later, I had my birthday ... she didn't send me any messages, nor a "Happy Birthday", nothing! But after a while, she comes to talk to me again, about the same subject as before, that I had abandoned her, etc.
I was pretty bad about it all and instead of answering her messages, I just ignored it.
We haven't talked in over 5 months and I feel like an idiot, so.. Am I the asshole for having abandoned her? And what could I do now? Please, help me
