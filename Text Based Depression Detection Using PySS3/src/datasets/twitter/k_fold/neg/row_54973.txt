Need helpI don't know what to do anymore. It's been 2 years since I've talked to anyone. I don't think I have the guts to actually kill myself but at the same time I feel like I need to. I've never had any real friends my entire life and the friends that I used to have are no longer close to me. I have grown distant from everyone and I have no way of connecting to people. My family has not spoken to me in a really long time and I don't have that one person i can talk to in my life and I don't see any way out of it. I just want one real life friend i can go out with or watch a movie with or just talk with. I live half way across the world from my family and I've been away since I was 16 (I know it's too young) to attend university. The culture in America is very different and I long for some company. I think that's the reason why I cannot connect to people. I have always been an introvert but I try to talk and make friends with people in my class but nobody wants to really hang out with me. They're just "classmate friends" you can say. College students are much older than me on average and there is no one my age that I can talk to or connect to. Chemical Engineering classes are filled with a bunch of people years older than me. I have finals in a few days and I think I'm going to end my life. I feel like people have looked past me because I'm "smart" but that doesn't mean anything I don't long for someone I can get along with... I'm sorry.
