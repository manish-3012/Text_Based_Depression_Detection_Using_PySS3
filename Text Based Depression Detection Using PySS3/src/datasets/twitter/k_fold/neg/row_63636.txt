Why not?Could anyone explain to be why I should not commit suicide. I've endured depression for five years now. I've tried multiple medications and psychotherapy to no avail. I understand there is a possibility that this will end. But why do I want to continue to struggle for the next possible few years? 

I've just been expelled from school from not being able to attend. So, graduation is at least another year and a half away if I muster motivation and go with adult education.  I then would have to continue to live with my family where my father doesn't work nor do anything so the strain is all put on my mother were she puts blame onto me and my brother. I have my grandmother and sister who make fun of me for not attending school (in fact I hear my grandmother badmouthing me to other family members on the phone right now). 

Even if I could muster that motivation to finish school and deal with my family then what would come after that? I see working minimum wage and probably becoming even more miserable. I see myself continuing to be a burden to my loved ones and others. 

So, could anyone explain to be how suicide is not the only ethical and viable option at this point?
