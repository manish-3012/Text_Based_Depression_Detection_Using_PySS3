Should I die?Iâ€™m your not so average girl.Im 14 years old and want to die sometimes?I started to realize that I mean nothing in life and that itâ€™s not worth really living.Everything ends one day.I become distant in a weird way like if im watching my body do stuff on its own like a movie kinda.I have been depressed before and suicidal when I was in 5th grade.But now I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m depressed I just want to die since nothing really matters.I have no reason to be sad but I donâ€™t see a reason as to keep living.I have never had anybody to rely on and Iâ€™m not close to people.I donâ€™t know who I am.I forgotten since I kept my mask on to long to figure which is the real me.I so bored of life and I want something exciting.But thatâ€™s were it goes wrong since I keep having weird fantasies of killing people.Is there something wrong with me?I even imagined blowing up schools.I know that if i went to a physicologist then I probably de diagnosed with all of things but I donâ€™t know.I have strict parents that were never there for me almost all my life.I was bullied over and over in elementary and middle school.I donâ€™t look hot like highschool girls nor do I dress right.Bkt Iâ€™m not sad Iâ€™m just bored of the world and if I keep living I thing I might hurt myself or someone in the long run.Should I just end it all?And be honest cuz I know a lot of people who would care.
