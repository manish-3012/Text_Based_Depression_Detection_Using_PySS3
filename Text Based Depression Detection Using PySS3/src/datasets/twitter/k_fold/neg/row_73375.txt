Fuck people once again.Here I am 21 year old virgin, poor and going to college, and trying to find a part-time job. Throughout the life I was mocked, bullied both physically and verbally. I haven't had any true friends, only people to talk for some time but they never cared for me. I had one girlfriend for 1 week when I was 19 and I didn't even like her. So I don't know what is love. But then fucking assholish people tell me when I whine about not having friends or girlfriend to love me that I am not entitled to having friends and girlfriend, therefore I am not entitled to happy life? What a fucked up world to live in. I just can't take it anymore. I wan't to really ask every girl I find attractive out and ask people to hang out with me that is the only way I can make my life worth living. I also will try to be as much hard working as I can (working at part-time job if I find it this summer and studying the hardest subject of my course which exam is going to be held throughout september). I hope my life turns out to be good but if it doesn't well I am afraid my life is not going to last long.
