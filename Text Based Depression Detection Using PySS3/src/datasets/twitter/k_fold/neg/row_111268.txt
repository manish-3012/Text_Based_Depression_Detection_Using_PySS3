The goodbyes feel different.I posted this on another thread, too, but lots of you on here have helped me, too. So I wanted to tell you this, too. 


The goodbyes feel different this time, because I'm the only one that knows this time, it's not a "see you later". It's a goodbye.
I'm moving next week, and I have no intentions of surviving the spring.
I wanted to thank everyone on here who has been so supportive of my situation, and has tried to help me. I'm sorry I'm not the strong person you told me I could be, but a lot of you brought me great comfort and, at times, even made me smile. For that, I thank you all so much.
I don't think I'll be telling anyone in my real life what my real intentions were. A note isn't me. I'm thinking of ways to make it look accidental. My friends and family might be able to move on more quickly if they just think I was drunk and stupid one night, and got too close to the edge of a cliff or something like that. I've tried as hard as I can to act happy around them lately, tell them I love them, hug and cuddle them as much as possible. I truly love them so much. I want them to remember that about me.
I'm sitting surrounded by piles of unpacked clothes. This room is a disaster.
I guess the reason I'm saying all this on here is because I wanted to apologize. My friends and family will never see this, but I want them, and all of you to know, that I really, truly am so sorry that it has to be this way. I'm sorry all of your loving words have fallen to deaf ears. I'm sorry for how much I am about to hurt some people I vowed I'd do anything to protect.
I'm sorry I'm the only person I'll never learn how to love.
