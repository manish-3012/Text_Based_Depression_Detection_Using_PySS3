I don't think I'll make it through the monthShit's gotten to the point where I'm starting to go insane. Last night I hallucinated so badly that I wasn't sure what was real and what wasn't. I'm constantly paranoid and I'm still not sure if I'm dissociating/hallucinating or not.

Almost nothing entertains me anymore. When something does entertain me, it can't hold my attention. I can't read books or play video games because i dissociate the story and completely forget everything about it. For example, I've played 53 hours of Fallout 3 and I've dissociated it to the point where I remember about 3 hours of it.

I feel like I'm fucking going insane, and I can't fucking take this anymore.
