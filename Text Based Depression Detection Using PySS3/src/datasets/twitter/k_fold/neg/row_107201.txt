Should I kill myself if I can't get over my ex?Hey all.

So title. I've been stuck on my ex since December 2018. She left because I fucked it all up. She was the most beautiful girl to me and I think she still is. I think about her everyday, and she's often the first thought on my mind when I wake up. 

would it make sense to kill myself over this? I don't want to be stuck on this girl for 10 years. I don't want to waste my 20s on this girl. (22 since March) And I feel like I'm going to end up doing just that. 

I don't want to be pining for a girl who doesn't even think about me for all of my youth. it hurts.
