Why did I do this?I've made a lot of rash decisions in my life. I joined the Marine Corps. on impulse. Things just seem to have gone down hill from that point on. I finished some training only to get to my job to be told I can't have it. The girl of my dreams just walked out of my life. Rumors are spreading like wildfire about things I've never said. She doesn't even believe me when I say I've never uttered those words. Life just doesn't seem worth all the work right now. I want to die but not necessarily kill myself. Where did I go wrong?
