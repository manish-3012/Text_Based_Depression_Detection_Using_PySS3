I wish I could do itI know I can't kill myself because I'm too scared of a heaven and hell. The possibility of going some place worse than this keeps me here. So I exist, and just hope I won't wake up in the morning, or I'll get killed in an accident, anything. I see news stories of people dying in freak accidents and the loving family/friends left behind and can't help wishing I could have taken their place. It's not fair when someone full of life is taken, while I'll continue to exist for another 50+ years. Anytime someone brings up the future be it weeks, months, or years I never can relate cause all I can think is "I hope I won't be here." 

Sorry for the disjointed rambling... I just wish I could make it stop.
