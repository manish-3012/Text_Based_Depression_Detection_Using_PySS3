Over the last year or so everythingâ€™s been even worse than it already was 

I started to cut and thought i found a community in that but all the good members either got better or needed to stop for their mental health so no one even answers any more (not the sub the sub is very different) and i get thatâ€™s a good thing for them but now iâ€™m even more lost 

A girl I loved for almost 2 years broke up with me out of no where and itâ€™s destroying me

I canâ€™t even want to start moving on because she was the only one who would understand why my arms and legs are covered in massive scars 

My entire family situation is borderline abusive but thatâ€™s probably just me being over dramatic. Whatever it still sucks

and the one extracurricular i had that helped me cope has turned into a shit show. 

I just am okay with doing something to finally end it all. Iâ€™ve been here before and had reasons not to, but now I donâ€™t have a reason not too. And i just want to do it
