Never thought it would come to this.I got out of a horrible 5 year relationship and never thought I would find anyone again. Well I started a new job and found what I thought to be was the love of my life as we worked togethee. He was perfect we did everything together I even moved in with him it was perfect. But everything started falling apart see I have alot of medical conditions that require me to be hospitalized quiet often iv had 3 brain surgeries so far in the pass year. So I could tell as he would visit me the less and less interested he became mind you when I was healthy everything was amazing.so things start to get tense and I realized he started talking to his ex to make the story short he kicked me out and broke up with me he said I was to negative witch its kind of hard to be positive when your constantly sick. And of course two days after he broke up with me I was hospitalized for a week. So here I am I have absolutely no one to talk to as he was my life I gave everything to make him happy and no job because we worked together very closely so thats over aswell and no friends I have no one to talk to or how to even meet new people. Im to the point that I dont even want to talk to anyone and I cant be a normal 21 year old and go party it off because the only thing I have to look forward to is another upcoming brain surgery inba couple weeks that I have to go through alone. I dont know what to do anymore. Ifeel like there is no way out and my depression is just getting to the point that I cant handle it.
