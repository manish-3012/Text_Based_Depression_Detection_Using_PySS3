Everyone I care about told me I'm better off dead.My best friend of 15 years and my mother both just told me to kill myself. That if how i expressed my feelings to them, then why i am i here? I cant answer this question. I promised myself I wouldn't take more xanax than i felt like i needed to get through the night.

I just took 60mg of xanax. My entire months prescription. I know it wont kill me... I just don't care... I want the option. I want to take these four Lortabs i stole from my dead grandmother and just end it. Dead on the floor. nobody would find out till the morning.... I know its not right to do... But I offer nothing to society,  I just sit at home, sleep 20 hours of the day, read reddit, masturbate, and aggrivate people on facebook. I would be way way better dead. Hardly anyone would miss me.

I have no friends. I lost access to my car for a few days, and all my friends( i pay for everything, food, drugs, pills, gas) decided I couldn't borrow their car...



I just feel done


This isn't a throwaway account, but i'd appricate if the police did not show up at my door.
