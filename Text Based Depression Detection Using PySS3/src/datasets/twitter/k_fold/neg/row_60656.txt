Feeling incredibly guiltyWhile my suicidal thoughts aren't outright aggressive, they are constantly there. Any inconvenience I face or any unwanted emotions end up with me hearing a voice in my head that its better to be gone. I've only seriously threatened to hurt myself once, but other than that I would never avoid any harm coming my way, I'd welcome it.
I feel really guilty about it because no matter how I look at it, my situation isn't nearly as bad as I feel it is. My life is honestly super ok. There are people close to me who have said many times they wouldn't want me gone. I don't understand why I can't internalise it. I don't care about myself and I don't see a difference between staying alive and being gone anymore.
