I constantly want to hurt myself, and the only person who is stopping me from ending it all is starting to suffer with depression themselves again(I made this account so I don't create a throwaway every couple days) I constantly want to cut and burn myself, I lasted 4 months cut myself 3 times and then lasted another 2 months but now all my problems are coming back and I can't handle any of it, it's coming to hard and too fast, the only reason I haven't cut myself tonight is I can't find my razor so I'm leaning towards a surgical knife, I want to end it all and the person who stopped me multiple times is now depressed themselves again, I don't know what to do, this is the time I can't talk about any of my problems because I don't want to put that on them when they are at this state
