Feeling conflicted scared and alone. I guess Iâ€™m look for some advice or input.For a few years iv always had the idea in the back of my head that not being around would be the for the best. but I never really thought about doing it until yesterday. I had a low point and I really considered it and it really sacred me and made me realize that I want to live but then I was reminded of why I got to that point in the first place and the cycle started all over again and Iâ€™m right back to where I was. I know this sub might not be the place for this but I figured it might help to hear from people who are going though something similar.
