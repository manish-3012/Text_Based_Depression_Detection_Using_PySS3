I'm lonely and I just might end itIf I can't find someone to cuddle with soon then I'm sorry but I can't take it anymore. I'm done and I might do it tonight or tomorrow. I'm suffering too much to be able to deal with this thing called life. Screw life. I need someone to comfort me and I can't do it alone. I'm serious. I'm going to do it.
