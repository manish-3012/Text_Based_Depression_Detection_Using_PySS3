Coward or a subconscious desire to live?I want to die. I've wanted to die for as long as I remember... I've been raped and beaten for as long as I   can remember too. Lessons taught in early childhood has enabled me to continuously put myself in situations for me to be harmed over and over again. 
I have mental illness that makes it impossible for me to live normally. I've been conditioned to never let it show. 
I want to die. I do not want to live. The thought of tomorrow cripples me with fear and disgust. 
I've tried many times to kill myself and it never takes. I always survive or here recently don't even try anymore. To die I mean. 
Is it that I want to live? Am I ment to live? Or am I a coward? Am I unsuccessful because I want to continue on in my miserable prison aka shit life?
