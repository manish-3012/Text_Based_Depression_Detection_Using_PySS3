I have no clue what else to doSorry for the wall of text and stuff.
I'm 22 and still living in my mom's basement. I've had social anxiety that started when I was 10 that just continued to get worse. I dropped out of high school because I couldn't deal with all the people there anymore. I tried going to an alternative school when I was 20 to try to finish my schooling but had the same issues even though there was only 5 other people there. I stopped going to drivers Ed because I sat in the car before class the second day crying from how stressed and anxious I was. I have no job and no job experience. I have no friends. I have no hobbies. I have no talents. I have nothing. My mom is suffering due to me. She's in her 60s and on her feet all day at work trying to make enough money. We live in a house she can't afford so that I can have a room. She buy food she can't afford so that I can eat. She buy clothes she can't afford so I can wear something. I'm just a leach. She's behind in almost all her bills and exhausted everyday because of me. I've tried putting out resumes to places, but most don't even look at it since it's so blank. I've only had one place want an interview. I could sleep at all that night worrying over it. When I got there, I wasn't even able to answer any questions. I take pills that don't help since we can't afford the ones my doctor think might. My glasses barely work because we don't have the money to get a new prescription. I've tried getting disability and was declined because it wasn't serious enough. I've tried welfare but was declined because I live with a parent. I'm just so done with it all. I'm done trying to get better. I'm done trying to help my mom out. I'm seriously thinking of selling everything I own, giving my mom the money and just killing myself. Atleast that way she'll finally be able to take a much deserved break.
