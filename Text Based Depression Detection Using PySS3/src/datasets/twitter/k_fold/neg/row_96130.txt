I'm really depressed and not over my ex, and dissatisfied with my life and the idea of love in generalPretty much the title.  I was very much "in love" with someone for years.  We never got our shit together and worked it out.  We actually bring out the worst in each other now, and so it was an arguably very good thing that I ended it.

I still miss him.  Every day.  I think about him all the time.  It makes me very angry at myself and unhappy.  I'm angry that I loved him and didn't let him go.  I feel ashamed that it's been several months since and I still feel this sad about not being his partner.  But of course, when we attempt to be friends or talk to each other, I'm reminded of everything that he's done to hurt me and I end up getting pissed off again.  It's ridiculous and I'm smarter than this.

I also have been hit like a truck by the idea that there isn't any "one" person out there for everyone and that we're just all going around settling for a potentially compatible partner, but otherwise relationships are all just meaningless and the romantic fantasy of finding the "right" person is bullshit and we should all just fuck as many people as we can (if you want a partner) until we find some asshole that seems slightly less assholish and decide "hey, now it's time to get married and have kids.  But if I find someone better, I'll just skip out and start a relationship with them, because there's 7 billion people on this planet and there's a lot of people I could be with."  I guess that's comforting to most people, but to me it just makes me suicidal and feel like life isn't worth living.  I want to kill myself.  I don't want to do this anymore.  I don't even know how to feel excited about meeting someone romantically now.  I feel completely numb.  Or worse, I feel fake when I try to reciprocate when really inside I just miss how it felt when I loved my ex and either think of him or feel nothing at all.  I keep faking it and trying to seem normal for the people who care about me, but I just can't deal with this amount of pain anymore.  My "relationship" with this person who loved me was a complete lie.  It's been like that every time.  I'm 26, so I've had a few shots at it and I'm pretty much at the ultimatum that if this is really what the world is like, then I'm going to make sure that I die as soon as I reasonably can.  I'm tired of having to work so hard at therapy and medications and meditation and hippie bullshit to improve myself and change myself and "feel better" - I'm just fucking tired.

This isn't who I wanted to be.  I was always so optimistic and faithful.  Now I'm cynical, jaded, and sometimes heartless.  After being so hurt so many times by men either abusing or running away from me, acting like sociopaths, I'm now the one that runs away and feels nothing.  I hate myself.  

I don't want sex anymore.  I don't want a relationship anymore.  I don't want to play that game. I always sucked at it.  I'm done.  I don't believe in love anymore and I don't want to live in a world without it.

And as a final note, I feel like the next person who says to me "you have to love yourself before you can expect others to love you" is going to send me right over the edge into killing myself right now in this goddamn moment because I am so sick of all the cliches, new age crap, and blanket advice that really exist just to turn around someone's sadness into a [Just-World Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis) judgement on them.  Fuck it.
