I am too much of a coward to kill myself.I have been so sad majority of my life that now I don't feel anything at all. I am such a burden in my mom's life so much I just want her to live her own life as well so she can stop worrying about me. I don't know what happiness  feels like nor do I know what excitement feels like. I've felt like this since the 7th grade and I had one failed suicide  attempt in the tenth grade. She doesn't know about it. 

My mom has gone through so so much in her life and because of that she hasn't been the nicest to me. One time I told how I wish she would stop saying the things she says to me because they make me feel worthless and sometimes I just want to die. She offered me rat poison and told me to do it. I was so tempted to do it but I didn't which I regret now.


I'm 20 years old now and I still can't do it. I am so afraid  of the possibility of pain and me disappointing my family that I've putting it off. What do I do?
