I'm full of rage and hatred towards myself and others.I hate myself and who've I become. I have this hatred inside of me that won't disappear. I used to be so happy and caring until my life went to shit. All of my life I've been suppressing my anger towards people who've done me wrong, to the people who've bullied and treated me like shit. I have a girlfriend who I adore and love but we always have this fights about stupid things and I can't take it anymore of her constant verbal and mental abuse when I've done something so trivial. I know she loves me in her way but she has problems and I'm the one she's punishing. I've been cutting myself and punching my head to the point where I have lumps in my head. Why is life so fucked up for people  who never received love they deserve. Why are we even here when can't even love each other and just treat people like garbage. I have a family history of depression and I know I have and I'm afraid I won't beat it.  
It's a bit ironic working as a customer service agent being sincere and empathetic towards others are my specialty, comforting people I don't know about issues they've made themselves but I can't even comfort myself.
