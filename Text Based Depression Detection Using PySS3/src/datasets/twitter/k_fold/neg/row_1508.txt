Can I talk to someone?Hello, I know I posted here 4 days ago, but for some reason I canâ€™t access the comments on my post, so I decided to post again. Well, as the title implies, I would highly appreciate it if someone with an open mind is willing to talk to me. I would like to talk about some personal issues I have, including the question I asked in my previous post, which is how to commit suicide. I really hope someone will be kind enough to spare some time to talk to me because a lot of stuff thatâ€™s happening in my life is driving me crazy already. Thank you.
