America is so fucking stupid and I want to jump off a bridge or shoot myself right now.I cannot believe that I donâ€™t live in a democracy, the type of government that my citizens have defended. I woke up today and I found out that I can no longer sue Equifax if they have an arbitration agreement. Ok, so someone else could use my name birthdate and social security number thatâ€™s out there and take out a risky loan and not pay it back, and if I want to take out a mortgage, I will get denied from the bank because of too many risky loans that I never even took out in the first place. This is making me so angry, I just want to take a gun and shoot myself. I am literally going to do this now. I cannot live with a life like this. I fucking hate America and my government right now. And the worst part is that my fucking fellow citizens donâ€™t care. They voted for this shit storm. And I heard the phrase "Oh, if you care that much, then why don't you run for office?" Well because I will fucking lose thatâ€™s why. I don't have a law degree, and my public speaking skills are not the best compared to other politicians. Even in the very basic lowest level of politics I will still be beaten. And I also hear, "Oh, well if you hate America so much, why don't you move out?" I wish, but at this point dying would make more sense than moving. I had a tough time finding work to begin with, and I still have to live with my parents because no one wants me as a roommate, so moving to another country and finding a decent job and friends would be pain on a whole different level on top of the pain I am going through. And thatâ€™s reality. This is a reality I don't want to live in, so I guess it's goodbye world. Have fun being flooded from climate change or whatever. I'm done with this fucking mess.
