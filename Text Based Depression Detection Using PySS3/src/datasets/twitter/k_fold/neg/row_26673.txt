So I've woken up this morning and all I can think about is killing myselfJust abit of background info. I'm 23 have been suffering with depression since I was 16. Have tried to kill myself twice before. Both resulting in spending days with a drip in my arm at the hospital. Recently I've been off work taking time to get my shit together , just got myself an awesome flat. But still I feel like I'm not belonging to this world. I've tried talking to family and friends even doctors yet I always go through the same routine. Pretending everything is ok and I'm feeling better, so then everyone feels at ease with me. Any way today I've woken up just lay here in bed for the past 5 hours and cried. Now all I want to do is end it all.
