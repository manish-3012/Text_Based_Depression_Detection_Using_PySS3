It's not so easyI'm starting to wake up and I can't get back to sleep. I start thinking of all the reasons I hate being in my body, and I can't control the clawing of my face or punching the wall. I just want to let my body know that I hate it. I want to know what I did to be placed in a body that I feel like I'm being tortured in. I have to go around all day and no one knows. Everyone just thinks I'm some teenage girl that's moody, but I'm a boy that is angry in his skin. 

I have to come home and my parents don't know or understand. I get angry and they don't understand why I'm yelling at them and I feel like such a douchebag but my anger is overwhelming and I can't control it. I'll be teased so much at school because people won't understand that I'm just trying to be me.

 I then think of how easy it would be to just march upstairs and down a bottle of painkillers that belong to my dad. I wouldn't have to deal with the torture of my body or of people not accepting or the fact that I will never have the true body I was meant to be in. 

I then sink back into my skin and try to fall asleep. The same thoughts are like a broken record in my head and it's all I can think about. I feel like jumping up and running out into the living room where my parents are sitting and telling them everything. But then I think, no. Don't do that. Then I fall asleep.
