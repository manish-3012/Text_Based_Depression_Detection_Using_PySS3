My fiance betrayed me in the worst possible way at the worst possible timeAfter work today, I'm taking my motorcycle, leaving my gear behind, and crashing into a wall at 150+ mph. 

I just can't deal with life any longer after she's betrayed me the way she did - she permanently destroyed my life's plan, career, everything.
