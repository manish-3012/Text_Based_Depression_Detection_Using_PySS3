I'm hurtingMorning everyone, 

I've been sitting here staring at the computer for the last 10 minutes. I'm unsure of how to go about this post.

I think I really want to say some things and then I remember there's next to no point if any... I pretend that cause I'm posting something it should matter but when push comes to shove I know it doesn't matter. 

This weekend I'm going to take what's left of my life away. I feel like I'm rotting here. 

All I seem to do is remember things, memories good and bad. I can't focus on any kind of living future. I detest who I am I wish I was strong enough to cope with things in a healthy way. I've never been that kind of person. I'm super sensitive, triggered so easy these days. I take most things the wrong way. I don't understand why I was put into this world I don't belong anywhere. I know I'm ill , I'm not in denial. I also know right from wrong I know that killing myself most people would consider it to be wrong. It's just I see it that I'm protecting others keeping me out of their way. I'm not dangerous or violent or anything of the sort I'm an emotional wreck though.  

I've had enough, I'm hurting and I want it to stop.  I'm not sure what to do with my last couple days either. I've already sorted a suicide note, the house is cleaned, my nails are painted, taken my social media off. I live alone, I have no job I literally stay indoors unless I need to go out. My only hobby is League of Legends.

I'm going to head back to The Fields Of Justice \- I'm not sure why I posted this.

Take care of yourselves, Love Amber x
