always having to fight for peoples attentionno one actually cares.. even if they say that they do. it's all a big lie. my existence is always being ignored and i literally have to fight for anyones attention. the world goes on around me; everyone around me seems to be making connections and i'm sitting here barely existing and being blatantly ignored. why should i even continue ? it's exhausting and i'm not doing it anymore. obviously no one cares. if they did then why would i be getting ignored all of the damn time ? why would i have to fight for everyones attention ? even people in my family ? no one fuckin cares.
