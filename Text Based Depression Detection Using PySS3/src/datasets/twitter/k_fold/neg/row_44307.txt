Help?Hi... I've created an account just to post here... I feel like committing suicide and I'm hoping someone can help talk me out of it?
I feel like I don't matter to anyone and part of me says... fuck them all! I matter to myself and that's enough! But is it? I don't know. 
Pretty much all my friends have partner and I don't... I'm 28, my best friend has chosen her boyfriend over me, my family seem to only be superficially interested. I don't know if I have it in me to try and prove them wrong?
And I could! I so could! I've just finished a degree in Mental Health Nursing, I've got my first job, just waiting on the start date. Can I hold on? I don't know. 
Do you ever just feel so insignificant to everyone? Like their lives wouldn't change if you weren't here? How do I go on from that?
Last night I had a vision of myself jumping out my 2nd floor window. I prepared to look out my window and told myself if there was a red car there that I would jump. There was. I didn't. I don't know why. Maybe I want to live after all?
I don't know. Help?
