I ran out of ideas, I can't keep doing thisThe last year of my life has been one unfortunate series of events after another. The love of my life left me and I couldn't get out of bed for weeks, I made some progress ... Got a new career, finally moved on and repaired a lot of the damage she did to my life.

Then I met her, a girl so completely perfect for me and she was even into me. 

The last three months have been an absolute trainwreck, she decided that she needed a useless boy-toy boyfriend instead of one "She could see herself marrying and being with forever" because she didn't want to grow up.

They live together now, a matter of a few hundred yards from my house and she barely talks to me now. My friends don't want to help me, my family doesn't have the time to deal with me... And I can barely summon up the will to go into work any more.

A found myself a few nights ago sat at my desk with about 2 dozen pills and a bottle of vodka... And I told myself I either find a way to fix this soon or I'm just going to give up. The girl I'm madly in love with says she wants to be there for me, as a friend, and briefly she does a good job of picking me up.

But she gave up and now I feel like I should to.

I've been cutting and I plan on getting a few packs of sleeping pills on my way home.

A year is too long to spend hating yourself, I'm done being a burden to everyone around me.
