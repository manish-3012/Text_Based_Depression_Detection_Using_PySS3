Too big of a coward anywaysGot dumped from a 3 year relationship out of the blue with no real explanation. This was like September. I'm so pathetic that I'm still upset about it. I planned on marrying this girl and starting a life and my entire world was fucking destroyed. I had depression before i dated her and she made all that go away. Now instead of hating myself cause im a piece of shit, i now have myself cause i let her go and because im a piece of shit. so what the fucks the point anymore. Why can't i just end it? And dont give me the "Theres other fish in the sea" bullshit.
