What's wrong with me?So. It's been a rough day. And my boyfriend was refusing to call me. He finally did and his first words were "what the fuck is wrong with you?"  As soon as he said that, I just lost all courage to tell him I was suicidal. I toned it down to depression and he was still irritated with me. But it got me thinking. What is wrong with me? I can't provide mentally for my family. I can't hold myself together. Something's wrong with me. I'm too weak.
