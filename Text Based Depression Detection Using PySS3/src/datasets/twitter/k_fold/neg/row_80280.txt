I donâ€™t want to cut a veinBut I kind of do, I just want to cut my wrist so bad. Iâ€™m trying to find numbing for it but I canâ€™t get any help with it. Iâ€™m not planning on killing myself. I just want to do this so much, itâ€™s all I think about. I canâ€™t do the cut though, the pain is stopping me and Iâ€™m getting more and more frustrated over this. I need to find a way to numb the skin. No one is helping me and I know itâ€™s because they donâ€™t want me to cut myself but this is all I want, this is all I think about. Please help me with this, I need something to numb the pain
