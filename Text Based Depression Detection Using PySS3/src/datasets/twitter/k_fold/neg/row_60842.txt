I just can't stop crying.I don't even know where to start with this. Basically I was paying my taxes like any normal citizen until 2017, where I just had trouble keeping track of things and just... got so disorganized with my records I just stopped. I filed an extension, missed that. Rinse and repeat for 2 more years. Each year the shame and anxiety keeps compounding. Only my boyfriend and a close friend knows about it.  


Now I'm trying to fix it, but I don't know how I'm going to do it. I don't know if I'll even be able to pay people to help me with the IRS. All my savings are gone, I'm due unemployment checks but my state's office is a mess, and I can't even get the government stimulus check because I didn't file for a few years and that's a prerequisite. Now it's tax day, I'm trying to at least get my tax guy to file an extension for 2019 but he hasn't yet, and I'm having panic attacks daily. I try to do anything and my body just quits on me because of how anxious and hopeless I am and I just can't stop sobbing.  


The research I'm reading about back taxes is that you can negotiate payment plans for the IRS, but I don't even have any money I can spend and also keep myself afloat?? I keep reading for stories of people who have gone through this and I keep finding nothing, only advertisements. That doesn't give me any hope.  


I don't WANT to kill myself but I keep thinking about it, because I just don't know how to stop crying and screaming into pillows every moment I'm not at work.
