At a lossDepressed and suicidal. Went into behavioral health for 2 assessments in which I was clear that I am suicidal. They canâ€™t get me in to see someone for four weeks. So then tried to make an appointment with a doctor-they canâ€™t get me in until four weeks, but just for an interview. They told me to call back in 2 weeks for an actual exam because they are so backlogged the computer canâ€™t start booking appointments that far out. Iâ€™m sitting here terrified with no where to go. Iâ€™m thankful I donâ€™t have a gun because I know I would end it now. Maybe I should go to ER? I have no where to turn and no social support.
