I feel like a ghost in my own bodyI feel like a ghost, with a living body. The shadow of what once used to be alive, possessing a helathy and functioning body. But death has already claimed me. I feel the cold, the emptiness, the lack of a will to live, or even a survival instinct. I have repeating patterns memorized and made habits, actions that make me look alive. I mimick emotions to hide how I really am already dead inside. I pretend to be excited about things I used to like, to care about those I once called family.

The truth is, I hate them all. I hate everyone and everything. I despise the people I meet daily, and I wish I could destroy everything around me. I already feel like a spirit, a demon, stuck between planes of existence, I might as well start acting like one.

But I lack the power. I can barely manage to get out of my bed every morning, only doing it to prevent further annoyance. What drives me is the hatred of being inconvenienced, and being late from stuff is the greatest inconvenince of all.

I walk fast, and people are in the way. So I push them aside, no matter who they are; old people, young children, couples that walk side by side, I don't care. They're in the way, and I'm going through them if necessary.

I want to kill someone. I dont care who, be it me, or someone else. I want to feel in control, just once. I don't want to continue things are, but I'm forced to, stuck in the path, and I have no way out of it.
