Do you think that humans have a genetic "Suicide Gene".My father-in-law was a detective for many years and investigated dozens of suicides.  He said that in one of his "sensitivity training" classes that the instructor said that humans may have a genetic "Suicide Gene".   

In other words, when faced with a harsh environment (pain, no money, loneliness, chronic illness, etc.), we may be predisposed to end it all under the "Survival of the Fittest" doctrine.  

No other creature, as far as I know commits suicide in record numbers like humans and it can't just be depression.

Have you ever heard of this theory?
