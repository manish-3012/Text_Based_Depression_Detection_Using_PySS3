I don't knowI don't know anything, nothing makes me happy at all, everything just feels like a slow march off a pier, i have people who care about me like my parents and a few close friends but for some reason it doesn't comfort me. I just feel like falling down and dying everyday. It hasn't gone to the point that i have decided to kill myself but the thought has crossed my mind, i thought it'd be wise to talk to someone before it gets so dark. I'm not very good at articulating all my problems into something as coherent as the other posts here. I'm 15.
