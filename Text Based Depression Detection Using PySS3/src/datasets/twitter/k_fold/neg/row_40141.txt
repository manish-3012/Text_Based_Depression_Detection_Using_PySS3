I don't think I'm suicidal?I live a fairly privileged life, I have a lot going on for me, academically speaking, and I'd say I have a fairly good social life, nothing much to complain about...except one relationship that really screwed me up, and it'll probably stay that way forever. 

But putting that aside, there are times where I feel I have no use in the world. And I feel things would be so much better without me...I was going through a rough phase a few months ago, and I started playing the guitar with the hope that it would make me feel better. But weirdly enough, a lot of the songs I play and listen (don't get me wrong, I love those songs) just make me feel worse...and the thing is I can't stop. Playing it makes me feel good, but worse at the same time, if that makes sense? I don't know how to describe.

And there are times where I really wanna cry, for no reason whatsoever. I WANT to, but I just fucking can't. I want so badly to feel those tears roll down my cheeks, but they just wouldn't come out. These moments feel so static, and I feel stuck in this world, for no good reason. The only thing I can ever do to make myself feel better is sleep, but what kind of existence is that right? And it makes me feel so fucking guilty to feel this way, cuz I can't fucking figure out why (maybe baggage from that fucked up relationship? I thought I was over it, but maybe not). There are so many people who have so many real problems, like why the fuck should I feel this way. I feel like such a fake, but I feel helpless cuz there's nothing I can do about it...

I probably would never do anything to myself, cuz I know I've got people who care about me and I wouldn't want to hurt them and cause them pain...but sometimes I wonder...they'll probably just forget about me in a month, maybe 2 max. Then life goes on right?
