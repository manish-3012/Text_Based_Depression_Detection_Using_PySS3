Thoughts of Suicide Make Me HappyNot that I'm a masochist, I've just been dying to bail for the past few years. These thoughts make me feel so sweet I'd probably make a full recovery if I felt like this normally, bliss really. I'm only here in obligation to some, and it's *so* hard to stay for them sometimes. I nearly feel like crying with joy when I get close to committing, I don't belong here.
