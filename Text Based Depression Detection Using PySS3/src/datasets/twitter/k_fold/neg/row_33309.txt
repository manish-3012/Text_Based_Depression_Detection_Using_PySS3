one of my best friends attempted suicidebut didn't succeed, her boyfriend got to her in time and stopped it. she came over and told me yesterday. her family has her on intense suicide watch. it just broke me. i saw it coming, i saw how depressed she had gotten, i just didn't know what to do. luckily shes doing okay now but it just made my depression so much worse. my brother is dying, i hate my job, i just feel so lost and broken. i wish i could just run away and go somewhere beautiful and try to enjoy life but my health problems require a steady, well paying job and im stuck here, miserable as hell.
