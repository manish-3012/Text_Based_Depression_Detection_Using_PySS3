what is even the point anymoreeven if i go through it all will i feel any better ? will i distract myself form myself long enough to die of natural causes ? or will it drag me down in to that pit like it did last time, as i am now am i even strong enough ? if i couldent do it then with a clear mind and fire in my heart, how do i stand for it now with barely any fight left in me and my fire barly embers, i`ll be honest im not sure if it will make me happyer, when i think about it and put it in my own mind, i cant help but feel lost and like nothing will change, at the end of the day im still me, and me is everything i never wanted to be, a failure in my own eyes, sure im living a lie now, but would it be any difrent if i did it all ? trading one lie for another ? i know what i am and i hate myself for it, i cant take any prid in this, it would be like taking prid in the scars i etched in my leg, reminders of what ive done of what i am, and what im not, it never seems to end, sure i can do it all i can live my lfe, it will always be in the back of my mind screaming at me, beging me to end it, to finish it all, to finaly put an end to it so it can all be over, there is a part of me ive lost to all this that  i will never get back, i have to remind myself that the person in the miror is actualy me, because i dont even see my own face as my own anymore, not even my name, not the one i was given or the one i chose, none of them feel like me, i dont know if i can do this, i truly dont, i know you will say that i should, but what ive seen of myself and my own jorney, all i feel like doing is runing and hiding away
