Considering checking myself into a Psych hospital because I don't know what else to do...other than the obvious. I can't take this anymore. I can't function normally. I am just barely getting by, hanging on by a thread, gritting my teeth and trying not to do anything insane. I am finishing college, and I work a custodial job-today as I cleaned the showers, I found myself daydreaming and  wishing I could turn the shower on, dig the razor I always have with me out of my purse, and slitting my wrists, and just watching the blood mix with the water. No one would find me for hours as the bathroom is shut down for cleaning. It was such a nice thought. I wish I had the courage to go through with it. But small things hold me back every time I think about it. So I am stuck living in this hellish in-between, trying to act normal but inside-total chaos, total pain, total rage, total fear, total exhaustion, total obsession with death. I cant do this anymore. Talking with understanding people is a quick fix but often just makes it worse after because people have lives and cant always be there for you. I am just soo fucking tired, and sad. I am sad at the end of the day, when it's 2am and I am just sitting here struggling to finish a simple assignment while everyone else is sleeping. I dont want to do this anymore. I want to either really seriously get better, or finally find the courage to end it. I am SO sick of this, it has been two years now. So my question is-does anyone have advice on how that all works? Is there insurance costs? How do you check in? What is life like there?
