I'm just so alone. You know?Oh gosh my third post here. It gets harder and harder every time. I always feel as though I have something new to bitch about on here. Like today, it kinda sunk in for the 5000th time that I am mostly alone. I like being alone though, don't get me wrong, I'm very selective of the people I talk to (usually people I don't see often since I can't stand being around the same people all the time) but I just hate being lonely. No one talks to me or seems to enjoy it. I'm a huge outsider from my family and partially want to cut them off (although I can't legally yet but I have definitely thought of running away) since they're very judgmental and vocal about the things they dislike that I enjoy. And they know it. 
I can't really connect with people at school. It's too surreal and I usually feel so dizzy there it's hard for me to focus on people. I could disappear and no one would notice. People just don't care. Neither do my teachers. I dropped from being a high honour student to C- and less and no one seems to have noticed. They just get mad. Like I'm a puppet or a dog that needs training and it's perfectly acceptable to be upset at me but give no praise? The person I am and I know I'll become makes me sick but I can't change anything while living in this life. It's not even that I want help. I don't want suggestions from any adults at school, home or whatever because we all know it's just them making the decisions. They just want me to believe I'm making the decisions. I want to make them and know I've made them by myself. I'm not an idiot. So basically, to sum up this entire rant, I'm a bitter, angsty teen and I'm either going to kill myself (soon) or save up and run away to a far away place.
