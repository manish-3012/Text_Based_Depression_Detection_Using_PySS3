Back at itSo, Iâ€™m not as dire as many people here, but I figured at least having it down somewhere will help get my thoughts off it.

Throughout my (relatively short) life Iâ€™ve lost 3 good friends to suicide, a sister to cancer and a girlfriend to another bloke, and for the most part I blamed myself for not being a good enough friend to help them, not being with my sister at the end and not being good enough to keep my girlfriend with me. Needless to say, this sent me into a pretty shit place for a while, prior to today I had 1 attempt at my own life through sculling a bottle of Ritalin, fortunately it didnâ€™t do shit but make my head fucked for a week. Since then Iâ€™ve had professional help, went to a clinic for 2 weeks and was (what I considered) recovered for a good year or 2. However, I had quite a miserable couple of weeks where I feel nothing but a nagging â€œyouâ€™re wasting lifeâ€ feeling. To cut out what happened particularly today in which caused this Iâ€™m just going to jump to me driving back home.
I was driving, was more upset than Iâ€™ve been in a while and figured â€œlife ainâ€™t gonna changeâ€ made sure no one was around, gassed it to him play a game of chicken with a tree, only thing that stopped me was the fact ik meeting my best friends girlfriend in 2 days and didnâ€™t want to ruin that for him. Long story short I spun out and was in a small ditch on the side of the road luckily without dents (parents would have killed me). Iâ€™m feeling better right now but Iâ€™m not going to be driving for a little bit (my own choice) but yeah, the rest of the trip was me screaming at myself about how stupid that was and all that shit.

Anyway, I think thatâ€™s about it. Thanks to anyone who reads this.
I feel a little better for writing this so Iâ€™m glad I did.
