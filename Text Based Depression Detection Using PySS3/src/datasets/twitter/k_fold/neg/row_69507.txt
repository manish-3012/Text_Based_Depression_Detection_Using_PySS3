My friends didnâ€™t invite meFor the past couple of months, I have been improving. In October 2018, I tried to hang myself but the pole that was holding the belt loosened and fell. Ever since then I have tried to be better and get back on track.

I donâ€™t go out with people often. I hang out with my friends occasionally, but mostly at school. For reference, we have had the same friend group for 5 YEARS. We know everything about each other and talk everyday at school.

And guess what.

5 days ago, it was my friendâ€™s birthday. I had gotten him a gift card for Xbox because thatâ€™s all he spends his money on. I gave it to him in the morning at school and he thanked me.

I asked my other friend if he would be on Xbox tonight. His response: Iâ€™m going to a party tonight sorry. I said okay and that was that.

Cut to that night, I get a  Snapchat notification from my friend from his story. Turns out that they all went out to dinner.

Guess who didnâ€™t get invited.

They know I have been struggling with anxiety. I have never dated a single girl, hell, even talking to one could give me an anxiety attack.

And yet they do this. I know you guys will tell me to talk to them about it, but I would literally meltdown from anxiety. They are the only friends Iâ€™ve ever had. Iâ€™m dead serious.Along with a lot of issues at home, Iâ€™m at my breaking point. Iâ€™m not a downer at all, when Iâ€™m at school I act pretty normal, just quiet. I just canâ€™t see why it was me that wasnâ€™t there.

I canâ€™t take much more.
