My time is coming to an endMy life fell apart in the most horrible way it possibly could. Ive been with my wife for 8 years
Married for 4. Married on halloween. We do an open relationship. I love my wife to extraordinary levels if she comes home to me she can do whatever she wants. She asked to see a certain guy and i let her. About 2 weeks later she tells me she doesnt love me no more. My world since has fallen apart way more than i can imagine. Now i just want to die and move on so i can no longer bare this evil awful pain.
