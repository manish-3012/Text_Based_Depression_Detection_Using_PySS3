Maybe I'll do it today.I've been feeling a little better these past few days. the weeks before were pure hell. I finally manage to start doing stuff again like laundry , dishes, fuck, even leisure stuff. I start feeling better about my situation. Maybe it's not so bad? I can be just like other girls and it won't be a problem. Having the wrong organs is a fucking nightmare but hey, I can't control it so might as well continue on like others like me. 

Anyway, I was hanging out with my roommates when we started watching an anime they recommended and I was feeling really good being able to participate in a social thing, as simple as it is. We go separate ways and I want watch the next episode because it ended on a cliffhanger as usual. Not even 3 minutes in, they drop the hard T, "tranny" and make it into a fucking joke. I thought I was past caring. Why is a stupid show affecting me like this? Why is Japan and anime so fucked about trans people? They write their "trap" characters and just fucking invalidate any struggle or truth to being trans. Then the fans start feeling the same way and it's just... I'm done. I'm done being called a man or tranny or fucking trap. I'm done hearing those things in anime where they totally disregard any respect for trans people. Call me stupid I don't care. The hate in this world is too much . 

I know where the bleach and ammonia is. I think I'll make a nice noxious cocktail to end my pathetic existence . Sorry for anyone who wasted their time reading this, this dumb tranny just needed to get it out and it not be in a diary no one will read until after I'm dead.

I'm sorry I'm so stupid, I'm sorry I'm so weak, I'm sorry for shaking while writing this,  I'm sorry I was born like this, I'm sorry for existing, I just want all this darkness to die with me. No one will miss my horrible self. Sorry again for wasting your time, I guess I'll just get the stuff together and be done with it
