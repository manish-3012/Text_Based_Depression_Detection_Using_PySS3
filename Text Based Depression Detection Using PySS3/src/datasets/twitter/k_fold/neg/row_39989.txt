I'm so tired of being sadI'm posting this from an account nobody knows, because I don't want anybody to know this. 

I suffer from bipolar type 2 and I can't deal with this depression anymore.  All the changes thst have happened since the pandemic and the quarantine have been tough for me to deal with. I'm trying to keep myself together but I'm falling apart.

I don't want to be sad anymore. I have this aching feeling in my chest that won't go away. I try so hard to be a good wife, mom and friend but everyone expects me to be so happy and friendly and a lot of days I just can't.  

I don't want to live like this anymore.
