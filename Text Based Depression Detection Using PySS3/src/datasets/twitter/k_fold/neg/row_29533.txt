It's my faultI've made it through a lot and I'm really fucking done. At 17 I've been raped, molested by a close family member, survived 2 previous suicide attempts, and destroyed my college chances with drugs and alcohol. I have no one to talk to right now. My ex girlfriend of over two years left me because I was too depressing and since then I've faced nothing but rejection. Someone give me something to live for because I'm drawing a blank. I just want to start over.
