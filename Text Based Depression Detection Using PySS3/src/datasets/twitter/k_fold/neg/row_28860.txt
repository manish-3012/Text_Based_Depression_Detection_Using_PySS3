I just don't know anymoreSo I've been thinking about it for a long time, suicide I mean. It started in high school, as I've heard it often does, but I always shook it off I never felt TOO depressed for TOO long. But lately its been everyday. I find myself thinking of new scenarios and new ways to do it without even realizing I was doing it. I always chicken out of getting help in some way, I've always been too embarrassed, I'm sure that sounds silly but its true. Thats why I'm here, its not as big a deal as seeing a professional or worrying the people I care about or something.
I don't know how it compares to what usually comes down here but no more run around. I think about it almost every day, sometimes more times then others. Those time's are from periods where I just feel down, I feel angry, depressed and hopeless for seemingly no reason. I have gone as far as preparing to do it at the worst of times. Doctors have given me 3 different medications, but none of them actually made me feel any better. I'm looking for advise, because I have no idea what to do.
