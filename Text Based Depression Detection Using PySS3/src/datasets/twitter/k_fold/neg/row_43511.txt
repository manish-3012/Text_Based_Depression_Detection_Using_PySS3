life is crashing down around me. worst I've felt in yearsgod, where the fuck do I start?
im 15, have 5 diagnosed mental illnesses, am an ex drug addict, and i really want to kill myself tonight. last night i asked my girlfriend if she wanted to do anything on valentines day. she said no. she hasn't texted me since. she refused to talk to me in the class we have together. i took her to new york city on sunday for an esports event, and she said she really enjoyed it. i don't fucking know what the fuck i did wrong. she's a lifelong friend, and she's the only reason why i haven't tried to kill myself again. it seems like our relationship is destroyed. i won't be able to live with that. i really want to be dead. i didn't deserve her. she's pretty, athletic, and really, incredibly smart. im horrendously ugly, severely mental ill, and as practically intelligent as a box of hair.

she was the only person ive ever trusted. i grew up with an abusive parent, and haven't been able to get close to anyone besides her. i normally freak the fuck out whenever someone touches me, but i can cuddle with her just fine. she fucking broke my trust. im not gonna trust anyone on this god forsaken planet. it only ends with me getting really, really hurt. 

my grades are shit. i haven't won an overwatch tournament in months. all of the friendships i have are shallow. my dad is too preoccupied with my other siblings. i am such a fucking failure. im really close to relapsing right now. life isn't fucking worth living for me anymore.
