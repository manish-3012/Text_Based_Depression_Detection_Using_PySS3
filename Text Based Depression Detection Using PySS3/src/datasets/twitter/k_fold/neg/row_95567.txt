20, Male; Hating Myself: The Cycle of LifeI feel like my life is generally pretty alright (in a broad sense). I know that isn't typical of a person with thoughts of suicide, but maybe today is just one of my better days.

And having a decent life is also a part of why I want to end it some days, if that makes any sense. I'll try to explain.

When things do start to pile up and drag me down (which happens almost cyclically, though I haven't yet identified any trigger of sorts), I usually turn to other friends who have similar issues or I look online for help. What often happens is that I witness people feeling the same way that I do, only over much worse (I feel almost objectively) circumstances. It's then that I start to feel bad for feeling bad, y'know? "His problems are so much harder and more painful than mine, yet here he is still," would be something I say to myself often. Then I start to feel like a villain, almost, because I'm contemplating suicide over what seem like trivial matters by comparison.

My point, I suppose, is that I have issues with seeing the good in my life and often feel very depressed over the bad. Then, when I am reminded of the good, I feel even worse for having let it go unnoticed and start to spiral further downward.

I'm not fully certain what I'm looking for. I'll gladly answer any questions about specific details if you think you can help with any of my problems.

For my basic problems, however:

* How can I better see the happiness in life and appreciate it more?
* If I am having troubles appreciating niceties, should I consider being tested for depression or something similar?
* Part of my sadness stems from receiving little to no results from my hard work and efforts (in a few different areas). Is this a sign I should give up or just keep fighting harder?

Thanks, and I hope you're doing okay yourself.
