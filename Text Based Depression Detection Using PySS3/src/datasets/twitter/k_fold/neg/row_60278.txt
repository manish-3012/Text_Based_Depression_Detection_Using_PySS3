Apple iPhone Siri.Apple iPhone 11. I got my first iPhone after years of shit phones with the iPhone 4s. Now Siri is a press to hold bullshit. 

I canâ€™t tell you how badly Iâ€™m fantasizing about stabbing someone in charge of Siri and iPhone design. 

Human bullshit pierces our daily lives everyday and shootings are more rampant. Coincidence?
