Been overwhelmed with work, which leads to suicidal thoughts, need adviceHi,

I would like some advice on a situation that I am currently in. I am 21 years old, I am finishing my junior year semester of college in a few days, and in the past two weeks I have joined a web development team.

I joined the team through a hackathon and decided to tag along as a front end developer, despite my age and limited coding experience. I was excited for the opportunity because this was my first time working on a dev team. I thought of this as experience for my career, so I have put my all to wanting to do this project. The team leader even seem to like my enthusiasm and what I could provide for the team that they made me lead front end dev for the front end team.

So I have been working with them, and I have felt that I do not have the best communication with them. I work with two other devs and I try to split the work between each other.

Overall, I have been getting stressed over the week. I feel that we arenâ€™t progressing. Iâ€™m not getting any of my work done for college, such as a final project. And due to the crisis Iâ€™m in, my mental health has been deteriorating. I have felt less motivated, I feel terribly stressed with panic attacks when I wake up or go to sleep, and I have been getting suicidal thoughts.

Today, I received a message from one of the dev members saying they were quitting the team. I have not told anyone else yet but it would mean that I would have to do extra work for the deadline on progress coming up. Iâ€™ve also have not completed a project for college that is due on Monday and I have to submit homework and a final exam that is due this week.

I canâ€™t quit because I feel that people are counting me to complete the tasks. But I also donâ€™t want to fail my semester because I have already dropped out of two courses due to stress related circumstances.

All I ask is what should I do? I have no access to any mental help so I need some advice.
