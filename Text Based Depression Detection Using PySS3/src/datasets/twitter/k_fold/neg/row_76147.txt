Cymbalta/Duloxetine suicidal thoughtsAnybody experienced an increase/onset of suicidal thoughts taking this medication? 

Iâ€™ve been on duloxetine before and it didnâ€™t cause this, although the suicidal thoughts arenâ€™t new. It worked quite well until I stopped taking it. Psychiatrist has restarted me on 60 a day again but Iâ€™ve spent the last 18 hours in an absolute state, serious suicidal ideation and planning, totally ruined the day for my dad who has no idea whatâ€™s going on with me. Iâ€™m not risking taking it again just yet but has anyone else experienced this?
