No one loves me..Sure you might say people love me but it simply isn't true.  I have this urge to just end it... end it so people can look back and think about what they did to me and stopped what they were doing. My relationship is a mess, my girlfriend doesn't ever want to see me again, and how is that a girlfriend if they don't ever want to see you? I'm failing classes and my parents are the worst when it comes to that. I don't feel like living on this planet. No one loves me, my girlfriend prefers to see other guys and not me. I just want to sleep forever. Being dead won't make me feel mad or sad and depressed. it'll just be like sleeping. I don't know.. I've already tried it once but I was scared. I wish something could just happen to me and end it for me
