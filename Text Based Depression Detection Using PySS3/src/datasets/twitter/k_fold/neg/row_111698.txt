If you make enough suicide attempts, people stop caring.Thatâ€™s what I feel has happened to me. Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t have the right to say â€œIâ€™m sadâ€ anymore because I either get ignored or eye rolls. 

Iâ€™ve come up with a pretty fool-proof way to strangle myself while I am unconscious, and I have decided to have another go at trying to die (this is my fifth attempt, my first I put a gun to head and chickened out, second I stranded myself in the wilderness, third I tried to mix pills, and fourth I basically drank poison).

I didnâ€™t think it mattered, being supported. 

Maybe itâ€™s seeing friends cut me out of their lives one by one. Maybe itâ€™s family looking annoyed and just saying â€œIâ€™m sorry you feel like this.â€ Maybe itâ€™s my marriage partner flat-out saying nothing when I tell him I want to die. Maybe itâ€™s my mental condition that causes me constant grief and pain, then shoots me up to mania so I feel like I have no control of my life. Maybe itâ€™s because Iâ€™m spending my life savings just sitting at home jobless, I donâ€™t contribute to society, I should be allowed to be euthanized. 

Thanks for listening like usual r/suicidewatch, I appreciate it, no one else wants to. Though you have my gratitude, I hope I never post here again, because I will finally be successful.
