I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreI broke apart a razor for the first time in 2 years. I wanna cut so badly. No body can explain whatâ€™s going on with me. Everythingâ€™s so much worse out of nowhere, my PTSD, my depression, everything. My own girlfriend says she doesnâ€™t think I can be helped. I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m lost Iâ€™m confused I wanna cut and down some pills. Iâ€™m feeling exactly like I did before when it was bad. 

Edit: I canâ€™t take pretending to be happy for her and everyone else anymore. itâ€™s too hard to pretend
