how do I get over the past?I just cried all night. I can't get over my past. my last 30yrs has been a total waste, I have never been happy, never had a normal childhood, never went to a prom, never went to college and had a regular adulthood life. more i think about life, i get sad, i feel sad thinking about people. i'm such a soft person sometimes
