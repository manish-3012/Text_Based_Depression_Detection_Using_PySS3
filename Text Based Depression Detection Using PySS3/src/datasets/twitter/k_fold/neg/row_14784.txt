I am a laughing stockMy life is just full of embarrassments. I myself am a embarrassment. I just don't want to continue anymore. Life is fucked up. Everyone around me laughs at me. I got so many things wrong with me that it's crazy. I'm scared of literally everything and everyone. I want a way out. I want real friends. I want a genuine person to talk to. I want a genuine family. I know everyone has there own demons but my issues just like one after another and just doesn't end. I don't want to continue anymore.
