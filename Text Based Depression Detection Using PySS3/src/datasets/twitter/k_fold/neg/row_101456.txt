Isnâ€™t it freeing?Isnâ€™t it freeing to not care about whether to live or die? All it takes then is just a few extra steps, a sudden burst of courage to overcome primal instinct to survive, and then itâ€™s all over! 
No more pain, sadness, tears. Regardless of background of life, all are equal in death! Itâ€™s something that you could never hope to see in humanity in life 

I just want to live in it all over again, being hit over and over as a kid man, that would be awesome, Iâ€™m sure yâ€™all have experienced something similar, maybe after death if hell exists it can just be me being hit over and over again, man. That would be fucking sick 

Anyhow, maybe just, not everyone was supposed to exist you know? People die all the time, fucked over from the beginning, and I did my best to help where I could but, you know 
Maybe there is no recovering, no redemption 
It definitely becomes the reality for some 
It may be the reality for me 
I mean why not? 
People all over do it all the time
It must be fucking trending
