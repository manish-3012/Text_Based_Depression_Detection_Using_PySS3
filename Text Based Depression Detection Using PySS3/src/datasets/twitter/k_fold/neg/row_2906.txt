Iâ€™m stuckI canâ€™t get professional help and I feel like I canâ€™t talk to my friend because she doesnâ€™t deserve me constantly bothering her and wanting to talk with her.  So the next best thing is dying.  Iâ€™ve been scared to die ever since my last attempt.  But Iâ€™m just done.  I fucking give up.  I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore.
