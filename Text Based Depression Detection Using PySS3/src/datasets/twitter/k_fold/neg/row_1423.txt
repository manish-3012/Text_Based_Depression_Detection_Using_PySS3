i am fakeeveryday i act happy because i did not want my mom worrying about me killing myself anymore. she forced me on anti depressants but i feel worse. i donâ€™t talk to my boyfriend about any of this because i can see that he struggles himself. I also feel like people only care about me superficially. iâ€™m always begging people including my parents to care but they â€˜actâ€™ like they care when itâ€™s beneficial to them, like around other people. i was raped when i was 15 and ever since then i have felt like nothing about my body is mine and iâ€™ve thrown away sex to a few terrible guys because i thought it would make me feel something and instead it did the opposite. i hate how much i hurt. it burns how much i hurt. i can be happy when iâ€™m having fun with my best friend who is my boyfriend but i even feel insecure about that all the time for many reasons. i used to like being by myself but now im always so sad that it makes me panic when iâ€™m by myself. i wish i could crawl out of my skin. i donâ€™t know how to go on. iâ€™ve tried to get help but there is no one without judgement in the world.
