Not sure which option to choose today. Its my birthday and I want to make a decision. I have three options today.

 The first would be going to sleep at 11am like I usually do(messed up sleeping schedule, its currently 6am), waking up at 7pm and continuing to live with constant anxiety, panic attacks and depression. 

The second option would be  getting the fuck over my fears and calling an ambulance to take me away to hospital and tell them i'm suicidal and need help. 

The third would be killing myself. 

If I killed myself there would be no more of this shit. Even if I reached out for help and by some miracle got better, there is *always* a chance of relapse. Its not fair.
