Anybody else just too afraid of commitment to end it?I've truly wanted to opt out of everything for the last 15+ years (I'm turning 30 this month) and I've always known that I would die by my own hand someday, sooner or later. And I still want that.

But the problem is that I'm SO scared of commitment. I don't even have a phone with a monthly plan, I use tracfone because I don't want to sign and promise to pay every month. Same with everything else. I've never had a car payment, only cheap cars paid for upfront. I've never taken out a loan or anything like that. Would never consider going to college and committing to that debt. Never been in a relationship like "oh, we'll be together forever!" 'cus forever is scary. I would never even consider having kids, that is the biggest and most long term commitment imaginable.

So despite the fact that I truly know in my heart that I don't want to be here anymore, and haven't wanted to be here for a very long time, I just can't make the commitment that pulling the trigger entails. And it makes me really mad. 

I don't want to do it anymore. Why the hell can't I just make the leap?
