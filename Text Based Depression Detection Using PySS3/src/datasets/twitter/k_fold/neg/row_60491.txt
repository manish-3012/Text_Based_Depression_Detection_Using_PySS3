I wish I was away from my familyI donâ€™t have a good relationship with my parents, especially with my father. I do get along very well with my sister but I feel jealous of her. Iâ€™ve always felt like my parents prefer her. Grandma also lives with us and I feel like she also prefers her.
I feel like an outcast. I feel like I donâ€™t fit in with them. Iâ€™m different and I feel like they donâ€™t see the good in me.
Iâ€™m very depressed about this and I wish I could just move out and live on my own but I feel like this wouldnâ€™t solve things, would it?
I feel a lot more confident when Iâ€™m away from my family. 
Iâ€™m 24 and currently jobless because I lost my job a few weeks ago due to depression.

Can anyone offer advice?
I donâ€™t know what to do. 
This whole situation makes me feel hopeless and like Iâ€™ll never be able to fix things.
