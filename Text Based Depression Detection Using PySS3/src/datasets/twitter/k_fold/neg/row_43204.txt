Might as well get it over and done withI know my life can't get any better. It used to be that I would get these thoughts when I was in bed and in the morning everything would be better but now I wake up with a feeling of dread. Its been over a year since I had one day where I didn't fantasize about ending my life. Sure some people would be sad to see me go but I would be forgotten in a short time. Life moves on sometimes its just not worth living.

I wish you all the best just know that if there had to be someone who had a meaningless existence it was me. Goodbye
