Anyone with intense family problems?preferably someone who's dealt with them for a long time/from a young age. I'm under 18, its 12:30 am and i've only felt this awful once in my life. Really I'll talk to anyone, but if you've experienced family problems, you might help me make a little more sense of what im going through right now. thanks guys, i really appreciate it.
