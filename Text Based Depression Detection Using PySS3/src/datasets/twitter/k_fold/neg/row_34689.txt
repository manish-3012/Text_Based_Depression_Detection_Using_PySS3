The silent treatmentI've been in a long distance relationship for around 3 years now. Everything was perfect. But when we argue he gives me the silent treatment for hours, sometimes days. It's hard to fucking handle and I really don't think he understands what it does to me, I finally broke tonight.  You live fucking 16 hours away, in another fucking country, and you think the silent treatment is the best fucking idea when texting and calls is all we fucking have?

I texted my best friend an hour ago, still no response. I want to tell her how much she means to me before I do anything. I want to say thank you for always putting up with my shit. She's been my best friend for longer than I can remember. Part of me really hopes this fails so maybe I can finally get help. Maybe everything will stop hurting maybe life wont be so emotionally fucking painful everyday.

I sent him my final message tonight, and I already know he wont bother replying. I should have realized months ago this would happen. 

No need to set a date like everyone else. I've already reached my expiration. 

xoxo.
