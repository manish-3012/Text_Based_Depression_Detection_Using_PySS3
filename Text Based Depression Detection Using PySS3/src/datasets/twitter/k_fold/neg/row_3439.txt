If I can't live to my aspirations, I don't want to exist simply to exist.If I can't even get the first basic steps to make the changes I'd like in the world, how can I truly live know I failed at such high aspirations? A good job and good money make me want to end it. I've seen way to many sucked into it, thinking they'll eventually get to their dream.

I try so hard just to start is off, it seems so simple written down. I've dealt with the reality before, but every obstacle I beat and break down, another appears and I don't believe I can do it anymore. If I can't do it, then what's the point? I can't live simply to continue living, knowing what I could have accomplished, what benefit I could have created.

The only thing stopping me right now from slamming my car at 80mpg into a concrete barrier is the idea that I could somehow survive a cripple. I crave and fear that easy solution to kill myself, if these was a pill I could take I would take it. If I had a gun and a bullet I would have died long ago.
