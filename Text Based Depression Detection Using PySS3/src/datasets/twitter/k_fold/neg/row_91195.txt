The thought has been crossing my mind every second for over 2 days, help.Sometimes I feel like the only way to stop the pain and heartache is to just end the shit for good. Although I love life and I love the people in my life - thereâ€™s always that one thing that I canâ€™t seem to shake. And for me that was my past relationship. We broke up around November after a pregnancy scare after almost 2 years. She basically stated she was unsure if sheâ€™d ever want kids with me, etc. I gave up at that point, couldnâ€™t let myself continue to be treated that way any longer. Found out sheâ€™s pregnant, back with her ex, has moved on without me. Spent 3 months hoping sheâ€™d come back only to find out sheâ€™s back with her ex. She says the baby isnâ€™t mine, but itâ€™s still a thought in my mind. I quit my job because I couldnâ€™t bare to see her face again. Everything seems so lonely and cold &amp; this is the darkest place Iâ€™ve ever been in life. Never thought I could feel this low &amp; how someone who used to tell me they love me could treat me the way she has treated me - like dirt beneath her shoe and discarded of like a piece of trash. 

Everything seems so hopeless and itâ€™s taking its toll on me. I just want the pain and the thoughts to stop for good, but they havenâ€™t at all.
