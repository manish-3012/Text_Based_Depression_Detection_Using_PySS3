a problemso once upon a time i wasn't diagnosed with any mental illnesses, and i'm still not
but i felt like in order for people to take u seriously you had to have one,
so i self diagnosed myself with what matched my symptoms and joined a discord cult
and i felt happy in it but there were vent channels so i vented and then they asked if i was diagnosed with anything
um, obviously not
but i just said what i thought i had 
and i made the group my reason to live because the people there were very nice
until later the next day i got banned
and the cult leader said i was banned for faking everything
huh i guess karma exists
but they said to stop with the crocodile tears and there were like 23k people in the cult
so um, reason to live taken, 23k people hate me, what the absolute hell.
 thats suicide reason number one
