I feel like dying but then again, I don'tHello there

I've had some issues for a long time now, and I can't help but feel like wanting to die. There isn't much of a reason to it, but the desire keeps increasing. I've seen a therapist, got concluded that everything was okay. 

Even though I have been through some stuff, the visuals of the past events keep playing over and over again inside of my mind and it's starting to drive me mad. 

I was asked why I felt unhappy, and I couldn't think of anything and was told to just be happy. 

I'm scared for what the future holds sometimes. I feel unloved, useless and worthless, while I know I am not. I've started to feel really low again since yesterday, and I feel trapped inside my own mind. I don't know what else to do, so I decided to go on Reddit. I guess this felt like my only option. 

I know that this post is probably as confusing as I am, sorry.
