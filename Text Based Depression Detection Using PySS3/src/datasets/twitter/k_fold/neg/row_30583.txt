Today is the day.Today I am going to finally go through with taking my life, and for the first time I am actually really relieved and happy. I am going to have a wonderful day at school, and come home and finally not suffer anymore. I will thank everyone I can think of and then I am going to thank myself, and finally, I will be free.
