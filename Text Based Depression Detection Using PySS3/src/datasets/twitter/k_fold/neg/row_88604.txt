I bought a pack of cigarettesI flipped one to the other side. I will smoke that one last, after I do I will kill myself. I have tried everything to help myself but every time I get close something comes and ruins everything. My only hope up until today was microdosing lsd, but today because of my lack of money and lsd plugs I realised that is not an option. I don't smoke a lot so the pack will probably last a week, enough time to write a note.
