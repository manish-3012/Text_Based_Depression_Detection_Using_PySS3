I honestly don't believe I'll ever be happy.I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I'm about to kill myself, but I really don't see the point of continuing.

I've wasted my entire young adult life (17-25) being depressed. I went to an excellent expensive school, but I was too depressed to actually take advantage of what made it good and expensive. I put a huge financial burden on my family for nothing, and it tore my family apart. I'm at a joke of a job, and I don't know how I can possibly set out on a successful career. I keep getting depressed, and I can't job search, and I sure couldn't live up to my potential as a highly intelligent person.

I haven't been able to make friends. Sure, I've got acquaintances, but barely any friends. The few that I do have are put through hell with all of my mood swings and drama. I've got all sorts of emotional issues that get in the way of friendships. My entire being is a knot of defense mechanisms. I turn on people and passionately hate them when they aren't there for me when I need them. I've been like this for years, and I don't know if I can change. I can see how my behavior is unhealthy, but I really think the "emotional protection" it's giving me is necessary.

My core beliefs are so cynical. Having people you can depend on makes you weak. Love is weakness. The cynicism is getting worse. With every relationship I tear down, I'm that much more hesitant to trust someone.

At this point, I don't think I'll ever have a fulfilling career. I'll never have a successful romantic relationship because I have such a hard time getting close to people and I don't really love myself. I'll never be comfortable with a group of friends.

The only reason I have for living is that killing myself would hurt my family, but I'm such an emotional drain on them that I'd be saving them decades of frustration.

I just want to have hope that one day I'll be happy.
