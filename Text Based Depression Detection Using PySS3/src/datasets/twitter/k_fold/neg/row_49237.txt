Half-assed attempts. I have failed twice now.I can barely call them â€œsuicide attemptsâ€. I always go through with it half way and then get scared. 

The first time, I made a deep cut in my wrist. It opened up so much and I was bleeding a lot. I couldnâ€™t even make another cut. I was taken to the ER and stayed 2 days as they performed surgery to fix the tendons I cut through. 

My second attempt was yesterday. I have prescribed sleeping pills and was trying to take them all in one go. I did not just down them all, I took them one by one. Each one I took, I hesitated thinking hard about what I was doing. I ended up only taking half before my partner caught me and took me to the hospital. I could stand and talk, the only effect it had was I was sleepy. Imagine me, a dumbass, dragged to the ER, even though I was totally fine. I heard the doctors say if I had taken 50+ it would have been lethal. Well my psych only gives me 28 at a time. Well now I know to save them if I ever try again. 

I feel dumb. I canâ€™t find ways to kill myself. I am too scared of everything. Itâ€™s more effective to jump off a building or in front of a train but 1. Iâ€™m scared shitless, 2. I donâ€™t want to traumatise strangers.
