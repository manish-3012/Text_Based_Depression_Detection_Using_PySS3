This feels like the end and Iâ€™m in need of a friendThese feels nothing like I wanted it to. Everythingâ€™s built up and Iâ€™m at the edge. Itâ€™s all coming crashing down and as far as Iâ€™m concerned it just means Iâ€™ll be jumping soon. Tired of it all. Canâ€™t handle the loneliness and ldrs suck they really do. I love her, but I wish I could see her. Parts of me have been deteriorating for so long. I think Iâ€™m finally gone as a person. Now itâ€™s time to leave this body and go wherever we go when we die.
