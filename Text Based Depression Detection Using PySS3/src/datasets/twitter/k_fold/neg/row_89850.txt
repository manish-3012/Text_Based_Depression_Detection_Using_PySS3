how do i tell my family and friends?hi, i'm new to this subreddit so i hope i'm doing this right. i'm really glad it exists. i'm not sure if anyone will actually see this but i need to get this out anyway.

this is really difficult for me to type out but i don't know how to tell my family and friends about my recent suicidal tendencies. i have to juggle life between school and work and lately it's just been getting to me, and lately my antidepressants haven't been working; it feels like i'm just taking them to avoid the withdrawal effects. i think these have all contributed to my recent suicidal thoughts. nearly every day now i've been contemplating suicide and even how i would go through with it, but i don't know how to tell the people i care about. i've had a therapist before and she's helped me with depression and anxiety stuff but i barely ever talked about suicide.

so, tldr, how do i tell my friends or family about this? how do i reach for them to help? i don't want to feel like a burden to them but i just need help. sorry if this was jumbled and confusing, i just don't know how to get this out properly.
