Looking for Some Help/Advice- Suicidal MotherHi all,

First of all, sorry if this is in the wrong place, I can't seem to find a fitting sub for this.

Yesterday evening I found out that my mother has been to her GP, and been referred to her local hospital crisis team after attempting to kill herself by driving into oncoming traffic (fortunately she swerved before any impact).

This is not the first I knew of my mothers suicidal thoughts. She had told me a year before that she had the same, and had been to her doctor on my advice to get medication (which I have seen) and also promised to speak to anyone of these thoughts continued, even if it was not me, given she did not want to worry me, as I was also going through a rough patch at the time.

I'm mostly looking for advice on what I can do, and what I should do to help. I live 3.5 hours away from my mother, so while I want to be around more at this time, I don't want her thinking I'm only visiting due to her mental state, in case this makes things worse. On the other hand she is isolated where she loves, the rest of out small family having moved away. Should I try tospend more time with her? Should I be calling daily to check on her? Should I have people look in on her? Is there anything more I can do to help, and to make sure she is safe? 

Thanks all.
