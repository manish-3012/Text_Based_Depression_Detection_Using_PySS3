I knowI know it's an imbalance of chemicals telling me this is the worst. Because really I know it's not the worst.

The worst is way behind me.

I know.

But still here I am.

Wondering why I've meant nothing to the people in my life.

Nothing but a prop.

A whipping post

I know.

It's not my fault.

I know I deserve better.

I know.

I know

I know.

And it never happens. I talk. I givw. I work. I ponder. I'm curious. I think of creative ways to solve my boring ordinary problems

I know there's worse out there.

I know.

But do I have to? Do I have to keep doing this?

I know I'd never see my best friends daughter grow up. But there's so much pain. I can't bare to watch the innocence drain from another little girl. Replaced with pain and hardship and despair.

I know I'd miss out on the food I have tried.

That I'll never finish a painting.

I'll never see the Oakland raiders win another Superbowl.

I'll never see Fiji or Chile or France or Spain. 

I know.

But is it worth it? It doesn't feel worth it if I have to keep come back here.

Please don't make me.
