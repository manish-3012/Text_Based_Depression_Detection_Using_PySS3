Death is the only thing which makes sense to me.I hate myself, I hate almost everybody. Don't have any friends, nobody to talk to. I despise my family. I'm utterly useless and there is always some fucked up shit in my head. So I better off dead I guess. I want to go to Japan in spring and kill myself there, far from everybody I know. If as the last will I write that I want my body to be cremated and my ashes trashed. Will they do it? Would be kinda lame to be shipped back to my country and be buried.
