I wish to be at homeMy eternal home. The home where I can be at rest forever. Where I am no longer human and apart or eternity. To my home it may take me 50 more times to finally surpass this survival instinct but when I do, Best believe I'll be more than happy to be with you forever. I know you wanted the best for me life and I understand that but when it's time just know that I'll be at peace . I want you to be happy life and even if this supposable heat death comes then you can join me. I'll always be with you life and in the end I'm sure you have went to billions of years of suffering . I want your suffering to end to. To my soul, my mind, my body, you rest well and to me, let it be and let death take care of you. Trust it and be one with it. And last to my Mom don't be sad whenever I depart from this world. You did the best you could and I love you pookie always and forever â¤ï¸
