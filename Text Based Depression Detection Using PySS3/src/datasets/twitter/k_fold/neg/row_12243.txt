throwaway because I don't want people knowing I'm down. Just really down. I even wrote a poem.
I keep thinking of my ex. Its been 6 months. I should be over it. I'm not. There was rape involved, court, blah blah blah. I want him back. :(  

How lady like I would look,
In my dress and heels
Hair all done
makeup quiet run
.
You would be the gentleman
Walking with your pipe
And all your friends
Out where we used to go for fun
.
Then you would find me,
As prim and cold as could be
with a braided collar around my neck
hanging from our favorite tree
.
The note would be in my purse
Because thatâ€™s where you would look first
And you would find out
That you are the reason for this
