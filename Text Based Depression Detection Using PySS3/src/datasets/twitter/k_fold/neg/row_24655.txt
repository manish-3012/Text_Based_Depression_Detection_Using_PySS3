Iâ€™ve finally reached my breaking point and Iâ€™m ready to be done hereIâ€™ve always been depressed. Iâ€™ve always had anxiety. Iâ€™ve tried meds and therapy and just pushing through it. Iâ€™ve tried surrounding myself with people, isolating myself, drinking, getting sober, switching jobs, reinventing myself, and nothing changes. All I ever feel is anger or worry or nothing. And at some point I lost whatever drive I had in me that gave me the energy to push forward, to just keep moving and everything I had in my life is now gone. 

Iâ€™m 34, barely employed (demoted to consulting by the company Iâ€™ve been with for over 10 years because theyâ€™re broke), broke, heavily in debt, abysmal credit with judgements piling up by the day, living with my boyfriend and his family, friendless, no education beyond an Associates degree, about to lose my license from a pending DWI case, car has been repoed. I have nothing and I want nothing but to not be here anymore. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide several times, but I always wake up. Hopefully tonight is the time I donâ€™t.
