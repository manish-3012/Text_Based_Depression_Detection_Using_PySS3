Strong, random, urge to kill myself.I'm not sure what's going on. The logical side of me thinks I need to end it. 

I've been great. I started dating someone who appreciates me and I appreciate him and it's a dream come true. I did not believe in soul mates before him. 

I've been adventuring. Trying new things. Getting into music again.

I need help. I thought I was okay. Them randomly I want to end it. Out of the blue. What the fuck.
