What used to keep me here makes me want to leaveFor the longest time there were only two reasons keeping me here:
1: my mother would be heartbroken
2: what if my life is everything I ever wanted in the future.

Ignoring point 1 and focusing on point 2, I always imagined things like how if I died Iâ€™d never,
â€¢get a drivers licence
â€¢loose my v card
â€¢get a girlfriend
â€¢get married
â€¢come out to my dad
â€¢graduate
â€¢go to college
â€¢try alcohol 
And all this other stuff that people look forward to in life. But then it hit me recently, I donâ€™t really care. I canâ€™t imagine any of this anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m looking in on my pathetic life from an outside ghostly perspective. I feel like Iâ€™m just destined to die young, to kill myself.
