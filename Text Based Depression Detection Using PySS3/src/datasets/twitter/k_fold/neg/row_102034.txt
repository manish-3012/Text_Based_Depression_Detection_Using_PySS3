I literally have no one...I've had really bad depression along with suicidal ideation since I was around 10 years old. Im 19 now. It's just getting unbearable. I have no one in my life I can come to for anything, I literally work, go home to my apartment and sleep until I have to work again. It's my own fault, I have Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum which basically makes me socially inept. Like, I can talk to people at work if it's necessary otherwise I don't talk unless someone speaks to me first. I guess I'm just stubborn but it's just extremely hard for me to open up, I just don't see the point in conversing with people when I don't matter to them at the end of the day. So I basically dug myself in a hole because I refuse to open up to anyone, and left myself with nothing. I just  don't see myself in this world much longer. I really feel like I'm incapable of living. I've been through so much fucked up shit all my life  and I just really don't want to do this shit anymore. I don't even know how to explain everything, there's so much more too it than that but I just don't even know what to say. Everythings just so pointless though, there's no reason for me to be here. Only reason I'm still here is because I haven't found a reliable suicide method, as soon as I do though I won't hesitate to kill myself.
