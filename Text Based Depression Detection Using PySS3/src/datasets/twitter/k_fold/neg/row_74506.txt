Iâ€™m not trying hard enoughI literally just woke up and my mom is just saying all of these unmotivated things, then when she left I just started crying. Itâ€™s been a while since Iâ€™ve cried I was honestly getting worried. My mom told me I wasnâ€™t trying hard enough bc I wasnâ€™t seeing my study skills teacher on Zoom. But only if she knew how big my mental block is.

I am homeschooled so this is my job, I have 8 missing assignments in each class and my plan is to get 4 assignments done everyday. (I only have 4 assignments each class each month). My mom telling me the Im not trying hard enough is making me realize that I literally canâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™m so tried I literally just want to sleep but unfortunately my sleep schedule is flipped.

What Iâ€™m trying to say is that I donâ€™t want to die, but that really seems like my only option. You can tell me to suck it up and do the work but my mindset is already so messy I canâ€™t really do anything. I tried going to my friends but they canâ€™t help either bc they canâ€™t focus. Why is this so hard?

Update: she just came into the bathroom telling me how I woke up almost at 2pm (I woke up at 11:30pm) and how my dog peed on the floor.... if I was a sleep, and you took my dog out of my room, why didnâ€™t you take my damn dog out?? Then you tell me â€œitâ€™s not my jobâ€ or â€œIâ€™m home sickâ€ maâ€™am Iâ€™m sick too but Iâ€™m still trying. Just open the door... I donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s so hard ab that. This isnâ€™t the worst thing but this definitely ticked me off.
