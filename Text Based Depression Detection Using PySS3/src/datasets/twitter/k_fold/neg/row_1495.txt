Does it still "count"...?Do suicidal thoughts still "count" or "matter" (should be worried about seriously) when they still freak you out? (rather than feeling apathetic toward them / numb toward the abomination that is killing yourself)

Two days ago, I had gone and locked myself in the restroom at home because I was crying and didn't want my parents to see. 

I ended up sitting on the ground trying to calm down. Then I looked up and saw a bottle of bleach.

I thought about opening it up, how the grooves of the cap would feel on my palm, how it would be hard to open because it was a bit old and hadn't been used much at all. Then the smell of bleach. Smelling nothing but bleach. The smell burning my nose. The smell clinging in my nostrils like a parasite. How I was my own parasite, leeching off myself, gaining nothing. 

Then the thought of getting my hands and knees from how I was sitting right at that moment, hooking my finger around the handle and dragging the bottle toward me. 

Then I snapped out of it and cried for a good while longer.

**It should be noted** that I didn't know at the time that I'd have to drink quite a bit of bleach to kill myself.
