I want a failed suicide.I know this seems weird, but bear with me. I've been having thoughts of suicide, namely swallowing all of my antidepressants, gassing or drowning myself. You know, something more uncomfortable than painful. Except, I'm scared of death and death just means nothing rather than relief. Nobody fucking understands, not even people in my family who have had depression - my mum told me that because her childhood was worse, I shouldn't be feeling this way. She denies ever saying that.

I'm in a sixth form college, but I've been missing days just merely trying to survive the day. My mum says I'll be forced to leave college and be put on benefits if things carry on as they are. She just tells me I just need to look at the good stuff in my life (except nothing positive has happened to me during the 6 months of my depression) and carry on regardless. Even though I can barely get up in a morning.

I feel like an empty shell and I just want a failed suicide attempt so people finally understand how I feel without them suffering loss and without me losing my life. I'm so fucking done and I'm such a fat, lazy, autistic coward for not just doing it already...
