I hate the people in my life because they don't want me to die.I've been fighting for nine years, how can this be a temporary problem??? I recently relapsed in self harming, also started abusing cough syrup and prescription meds. I haven't had a sober night for 3 weeks and nobody knows. Instead I put on this performance for them of recovery and hope. The only reason I haven't followed through with my plans is because I know how much it fucking hurts to lose someone. I don't want to put anybody through that pain, and I know I matter to people. I hate those people. So after my recent hospitalization I've been faking so much that I'm getting better. Because maybe then they'll stop caring, I won't matter, and I can finally do what will make me happy. But part of me just want to show them what I'm turning into and maybe they'll understand why I feel this way. Even the greatest fighter can only take so many hits before they go down, and I think this year is one too many.
