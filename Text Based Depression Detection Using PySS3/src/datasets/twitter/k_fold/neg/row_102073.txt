Fool proof way to kill yourselfI know this topic might seem controversial but why? Because we are raised to think so.
Life is just so overrated, technically itâ€™s just activity you do while waiting for death.

I hate the fact the it seem like it has to be a secret, that if someone do the right thing, such as answering this questions and help someone get out of their misery could be illegal.

Why is it? Nobody really f**king care. People call the cops, they throw you in a stupid center and move on. Go on with their life, feeling like ( Yeah today I got to â€œsave someoneâ€) when really they just worsened their misery to boost their ego. When you really think about it... who feels better after stopping someone from doing what maybe best for them, the world and everyone who are â€œobligedâ€ to pretend they care. Like family who will anyway get over it. Like the list of a dog. Well it certainly is not the â€œvictimâ€.

So I ask you, please give me advice, you can pretend itâ€™s the title of a movie, like you are talking about a book, you can use subtile way to point me out. No one can do sh*t to you if you donâ€™t say it obviously, Iâ€™ve check the law, you can just get away with it and know that you, for real, have done the right thing.

Iâ€™m so lonely, these thoughts have been 
yo-yoing in my head since teenage years. My fatherâ€™s have been out of my life, he was in jail, called me and always said â€œsweetie as soon as I get out, we are going to be togetherâ€ when he did, about two years ago I was 25. He have been in there for 24 years. 
I was happy to show him how the world changed, smart phones, laptops, electric car, he had missed so much. I help him creat a profile for online dating and how to pick up girls. 
Then, he started dodging my very few calls, I figured he need to find himself and didnâ€™t want to insist. He stopped texting me and answer my text... for fu*k sake IM THE ONE WHO TAUGHT HIM TO TEXT. 
I donâ€™t understand, itâ€™s not like he had any child support to pay, any responsibility to take... I was 25... All he had to do is chill, go to the movie sometime or just go to a park. I never asked anything from him... no event time. Despite, I canâ€™t even find a way to hate him. How can you miss something you never had.

As a kid, I got raped by my babysitterâ€™s partner, several times, I only got out of this when my mom got married and we moved in an other town. I was to young to even remember his name now
I finally built the courage to tell my mother, I was 26. She was playing a game on her phone and didnâ€™t even look at me.. she said you are lying I never left you alone with any men. 

I could go on, but who really cares. 

I know hanging once self is not likely to work, one would probably end up with disabilities.

I do not own and know where to find a gun. Plus I read most people chocks at the very last second and injured themselves, once again end up disabled for ever.

Medicine would be painful and most probably end up with vomiting what ever drug the person uses.

Cutting your wrist... I failed twice before. 

Jumping off a bridge, well the government already made it impossible in my province, every bridges are secured.

Same for most buildings plus it is not guaranteed to be successful, once again I do not want to be disabled.
