Today I told my mom....that I wanted to kill myself, she asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital, I said no, they would just sit there and listen to me bitch and moan about my problems.  They would try to stabilize my mood to send me back into the world just for my problems to keep being there, and ultimately for my "mood" to return.  

And here is the irony of it, none of my problems would be fixed, they would actually fester worse under psychiatric care.  I'd lose my job because of my stay and absence in the hospital.  I'd have to pay for my probable extended stay, and have no money to pay.  Everything would be a metaphorical rotten wound the doctors would try to close because they don't know how to fix it, maybe it would stop the bleeding but all it would accomplish is dying slowly.


I don't want to have people who don't even listen to me moan about my problems who don't even like me. I've tried, I've had so called therapists on this page try to help me on other profiles when I said I can't afford therapy, just grow to ignore my messages, and never after a period, at most, a week in length.
