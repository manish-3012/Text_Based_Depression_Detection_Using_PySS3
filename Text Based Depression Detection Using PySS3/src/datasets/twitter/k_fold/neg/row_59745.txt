I'm at my lowest point.I'm 16, I have normal friends and normal school life, but with my family home life. The shit I see, I'm not gonna bring myself to type it all down. But tonight, what just happened to me, I've been crying for hours. I had to runaway from my house for about two hours to wait and now I'm laying in bed just wanting to die, I've honestly wanted to stop living for a while. I have a hard time remember a lot of certain points in my life. I believe that I have a shit ton of repressed memories and I can only recall not extremely fucked up parts. I know this another one of them. Killing myself I want to happen. But I am an evolutionist which frightens me when I think of afterlife, its so weird. I don't believe there is heaven or hell, so what the duck is there? I've had conversations before with people who think it could be a infinite unconsciousness, like if you accidentally fall and hit your head on something  and get knocked out. But I don't even have a clue. If I knew what it was I would do it no hesitation. I am just so mentally scarred, I can't stop thinking about this and I'm tired of the thought.
