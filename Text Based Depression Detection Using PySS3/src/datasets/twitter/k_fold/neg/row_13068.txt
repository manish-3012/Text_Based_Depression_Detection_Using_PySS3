School making me want to end it.So much emphasis on getting a degree. Dropped out with a decent GPA and grades. Don't want to set foot in another classroom. If I want to learn something I'd read a book on the subject then apply to jobs. But that's not how things work do they? Just a waste of time and money sitting in a classroom.
