It's been years since anyone that's not my immediate family has greeted me on my birthday.Title makes me seem more shallow than I am, but i just really value my friends, man. I make sure to jot down the special people in my life's birthdays so i can greet them or at least make them feel loved. At this point, I'm not afraid of the idea of suicide anymore. I welcome it, whenever it comes to mind. I'm down on my luck, the third wheel everywhere, and I am very tired. I hope i don't wake up tomorrow.
