Being at peace with it. How true is that?You hear often that those who close to suicide are usually not outwardly depressed at all because they've reached a sense of peace with their decision. No more throwing fits from past suicide ideations where you just wanted to be heard about how much you want to no longer be alive, how you've been handed this raw deal of a life, etc. How true is it that people reach this more subdued acceptance before they really end their life?
