Logic isnt working anymoreI have spent most of my life listening to the tiny little voice of logic in the back of my head. When the bid voice that shouts of how horrible things are, I would listen to the little voice of logic say you know that's a lie. I would fight against the darkness with everything I had. Everyday of my life has been a battle. I am in constant physical pain. I have had many surgeries and am at a point now where doctors just ignore me.

 My life is falling apart. In the last two years everything has gone to shit. Financially I have screwed everything up. My husband resents me even though he won't admit it. We are in so much debt we are going to lose everything. I blame myself for everything. I am the one that has put us in this position. 

In the past I would have held on to the love from him to get me through but that it gone. I would have used the logic of knowing my children need me, but lately my being around them just causes them pain. All they see is someone broken. I have no happiness. I have nothing. The logic is gone And how is that fair to them? They deserve better. They deserve more. I am in so much pain.
