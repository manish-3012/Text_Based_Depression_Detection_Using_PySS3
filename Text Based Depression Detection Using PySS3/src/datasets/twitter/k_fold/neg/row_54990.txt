I regret making it to 15.I didnâ€™t plan to ever make it to age 15, but I turned 15 a couple months ago. And I wish I never did.

Iâ€™ve been so numb for so many years. I donâ€™t cry anymore. I donâ€™t feel anything, only if I hurt myself physically. Iâ€™m so out of it all the time and Iâ€™ve been dissociating. I donâ€™t feel real anymore. Nothing feels real. I keep feeling like Iâ€™m dreaming, and then I suddenly snap out of it and just look around at my surroundings and realize this is real. The disappointment I feel every time realizing that Iâ€™m actually alive and my reality is real is too much for me to handle, so I just force myself to sleep, no matter what time it is. But I hate waking up. I canâ€™t keep living like this. I wonâ€™t be able to. I need treatment. Iâ€™ve been begging my mom for well over a year to take me to a doctor so I can get on medication/get a therapist, but she wonâ€™t. I donâ€™t know what to do. I have no other adults in my life to ask. Iâ€™ve never went to a public school either so Iâ€™ve never had a guidance counselor or anything. I donâ€™t have anybody to talk to. I feel like my mom wonâ€™t realize how bad my mental health is until itâ€™s too late. Iâ€™m just stuck and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it much longer.

I don't WANT to die this young but sometimes it feels necessary.
