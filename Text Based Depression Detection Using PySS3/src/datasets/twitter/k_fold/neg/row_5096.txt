I really don't know what to do.I've just been sad. Everybody says that it gets better, but it doesn't. One reason that i'm sad is because of this girl i've been talking to. Idk if I should say her name so I won't. I've known her since 3rd grade. We've always been good friends. And i've always had feelings for her. About 7 years now. She's perfect, I couldn't even imagine a nicer, more perfect person. And lately we have been getting really close. Like really really close. And by "lately" I mean the past year or so. And a couple of months ago, she randomly blocked me on every single social media there is. she hasn't been talking to me at all irl either. But about a month ago she added me on snapchat again. We had a normal conversation, but I just had to ask her what happened and why she did what she did. So I asked her. And what happens, she ignores me and blocks me again. And now I feel like i've lost her forever. I basically never see her but I just can't let go of my feelings for her. I've tried contacting her friends but they won't help me. My friends aren't helpful either. I've been talking to a couple of people online and everybody just says it gets better, but it doesn't. It gets worse in my opinion. Like i said in the beginning, I really don't know what to do. Feels like ending it all is the only option. Yea that's all I had to say, doubt anyone will care though. Sorry if there are a couple of spelling or grammar mistakes, i'm from sweden and writing this on my phone so that's probably why.
