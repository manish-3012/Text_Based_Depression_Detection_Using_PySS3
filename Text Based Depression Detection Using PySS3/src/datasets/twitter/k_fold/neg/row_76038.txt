Only making posts so I can get the rush from the notification soundI'm so deprived of social contact that anything is like a drug. It's still not enough, but at least when I say I'm gonna kill myself I get messages. I really hope my end is soon, as soon as I find a good rope I'll hang myself.

Inb4: yes I'm in therapy, yes I'm on medicine, no they don't help, no I'm not going to the emergency room, yes I have hobbies, no they don't help either, there are things I "enjoy" but that won't save my life, I don't have friends, there's no opportunity to make friends, I'll probably did friendless.
