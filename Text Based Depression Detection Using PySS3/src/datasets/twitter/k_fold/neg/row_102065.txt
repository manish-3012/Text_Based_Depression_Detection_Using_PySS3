Picked out a date. I feel freed by itI guess this should be prefaced with a little explanation. I'll be 23 in four days, lurked here for a good year looking for the gumption to follow through. Still a pathetic virgin at this date and haven't had a girl in six years, really no hope of that changing. I've picked out April 30 as a numerically important date, despite it screwing my own mother's birthday a week later. Only looking for opinions on 9mm handgun vs .30-30 rifle. Thanks
