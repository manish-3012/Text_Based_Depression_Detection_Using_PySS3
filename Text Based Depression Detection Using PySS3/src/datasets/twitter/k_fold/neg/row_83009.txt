I'm afraid the bad thoughts are returning.I used to have depression and suicidal thoughts. It was horrible. After months of counselling and antidepressants I got better. For the first time in years I felt happy almost all of the time, if something bad happened I would think "oh its OK this will pass" as opposed to "easiest option is to end it all. Let's do that".
I've currently been going through some issues like struggling with uni work, having no money, having relationship problems, feeling super lonely because I feel like I have no one to talk to about any of this.
Things keep getting worse and worse and more and more bad thoughts keep coming like "no one talks to you anymore so they wouldn't care if you died" or "there's no way out of these problems so you should just end everything" and it's all getting too much. I've let down everyone around me. I have no one anymore. 
I've spent all day crying. At this point I'm convinced the only way to sort out the majority of my issues is to just kill myself. Which is not how I want to think, I thought I'd gotten past all of this but apparently not.
I feel stuck and I don't know what to do.
