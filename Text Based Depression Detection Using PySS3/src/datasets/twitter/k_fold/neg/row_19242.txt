I think I'm going to kill myself in a weekunlike a lot of stories i've seen, this is not a random mood drop where nothing makes sense. this is a well thought out, month long plan in which i've tried my hardest to have good days and find a reason.

nothing makes me feel solid, no matter what, i feel like water. i feel as if i've lost everything, including myself, and maybe it all started with grief but it's morphed into this large unenjoyment of life. i can't breathe, existing hurts and it's not even that i don't have friends. i have a lot of people that worry and care for me, perhaps it's selfish to take myself away from those people but it's also selfish to assume i'm not struggling too. i suppose this makes me an awful friend and person, i just lie to them everyday. i won't even be here for the things i promise.

i want to live, yet i find not a single reason to. so i guess i'm just looking for that here, i'm too afraid to tell any of my friends what i've been planning and i feel immensely guilty for promising future things while knowing i don't think i'll even have that. i don't need a reason for life, i need a reason for MY life. i'm so tired of everything, i don't even know what day it is anymore. the only company i have is online, i'm failing my classes when i'm homeschooled and i have no passions or hobbies. i don't know what i want to do in the future, i don't think i want to do anything at all, everything is so overwhelming

i want to promise those reading that it can get better, if it's a certain event that's bringing you down you can escape it and get better. you can get help, and it's hypocritical of me to say that i guess but i do worry for you too. i'm on here to tell somebody, i want to be saved, but i can't do it myself.
