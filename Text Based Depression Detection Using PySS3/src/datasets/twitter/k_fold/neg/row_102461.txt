Here I am back almost 5 months later, and I want to die again but have no way of killing myself.I don't feel like typing much so I'm going to try and keep it short. I'm not supposed to have electronics but my loving grandparents gave me a tablet to borrow. Anyways I requested to follow a funny meme account last night on Instagra when everybody thought I was in bed, and turns out that it was my brothers account. Well when he got the notification he came down and saw me using it but I didn't see him. I don't know when but he ended up telling my grandparents (who knew about it) and my parents. I'm not home now and have a story to tell my parents. My grandparents told me about it and want the tablet back so I don't get in trouble. I wish I could just live here like I've asked before, and with all the other shit happening in my life that I don't feel like getting into, I just want to run infront of a semi.
