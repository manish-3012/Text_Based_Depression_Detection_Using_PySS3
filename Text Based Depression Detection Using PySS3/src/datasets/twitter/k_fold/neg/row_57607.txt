Sing me to sleepI haven't slept for more than two hours a night for five days. I want to go to bed, close my eyes and be able to fall asleep. But I can't.    
Alcohol doesn't work. Sleeping pills don't work. Nothing really works.    
Some time ago (1 year) I tried to kill myself. It wasn't a great idea, not even good one. But it helped - for a short period of time.    
I live a normal life. I have a family, friends and a girlfriend, whom I love from the bottom of my sad heart. I'll be a qualified lawyer in a few years.    
But I still don't really care about losing everything including myself.    
I took about 1,5g of tramadol and a small pile (5-7) of sleeping pills. High tolerance to opioids usually protects me from serious consequences, so there's a reasonable chance, that I won't die.    
I hope, I'll fall asleep soon.
