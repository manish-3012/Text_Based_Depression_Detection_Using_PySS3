I tried to kill myself tonight and couldnâ€™t do it.I had a fight with my family tonight and it didnâ€™t go well, theyâ€™re not at fault in any way but it sent me over the edge. I got in my car around 8pm and started driving with no place in mind. I drove for almost an hour across the Montana state line and found a lookout over a cliff, it was so dark but with my car lights on and the water beneath it, it felt beautiful. I sat there on my hood for what felt like hours, I screamed, I cried, and I spoke into the atmosphere of questions and things I didnâ€™t know I had felt up until than. I realized something horrible and dark in all that beauty. When I asked what I should do, why do I feel like this, what comes next, I got nothing. Absolutely nothing. Iâ€™ve never been religious but today was really the day I realized there was no god or gods, there are just people and earth. We are all on this rock in space and are completely and utterly alone. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is me, and the only thing keeping me alive is me. Thereâ€™s never been anything else. Iâ€™m home now, alone, still feeling vulnerable and empty, but now it feels I donâ€™t know, maybe calmer? I know I definitely still need to get help, and maybe even check myself in to a hospital, but I think I have an entirely new perspective on death and suicide. Iâ€™ve tried so many times in the past, my whole teen years were spent swallowing pills and cutting myself, it was all so chaotic and desperate. Itâ€™s different now but Iâ€™m still scared. I wonder if Iâ€™ll ever stop feeling this way. I could have done it. It could have been today, and it could be tomorrow for all I know. I just know one day Iâ€™ll go through with it, to end these horrible feelings, but now I accept it. I accept it fully.
