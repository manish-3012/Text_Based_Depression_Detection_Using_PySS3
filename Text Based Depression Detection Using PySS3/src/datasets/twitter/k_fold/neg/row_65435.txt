Iâ€™m lostIâ€™m a female approaching my 22nd birthday. I live with my boyfriend and I love him so much... but itâ€™s not enough anymore. Iâ€™m losing this battle to depression and I canâ€™t help it. Iâ€™ve read and read and read all about things to make it better but everything is bland to me. I donâ€™t connect with anything anymore. He doesnâ€™t understand and I feel like iâ€™m holding him back from happiness. I donâ€™t want to be a burden anymore. I want to be free from my mind. As I grow older the worse I get... I canâ€™t take it anymore. I donâ€™t even have friends to talk to. Ive called the Suicide hotline every single time I came close and they managed to talk me out of it but Iâ€™m tired of hearing the same old tune. Iâ€™ve called enough times to be immune to the usual tune. Iâ€™m running out of ways to keep this going anymore.
