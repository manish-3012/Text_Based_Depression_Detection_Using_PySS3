Something stupid21m Hey, i guess I am just at a loss. I keep getting really down every few weeks, i pick myself up but my depression keeps coming back. I feel like I am just wasting everyones time. Ive failed every exam Ive ever sat, i have zero motivation to do anything, ive done so many embarassing stupid things ive lost count, i have 1 friend and the type of relationship that is, is not the type where we talk about each other's woes.  All i do is sit in my room play games and watch anime or binge watch shows. I have nothibg worth while in my life to keep me going. 
I am so anxious about talking to people, my anxiety really annoys me. My life just sucks, I have found the best way to end it but i can not go through with it as I couldn't bare to hurt my mum or dad like that. But I want to just go away and not have to worry about work or anything ever again.

I just can't imagine myself having a future . Im pretty damn lonely and filled with constant fear of everything.
