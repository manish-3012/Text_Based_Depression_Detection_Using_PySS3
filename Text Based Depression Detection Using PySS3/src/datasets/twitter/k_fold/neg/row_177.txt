I feel like i'm just living because of other people, not because I have a will to live.The thought of killing myself gives me peace. All I want to do is end my life, but I can't do that because I love my parents and family, and killing myself is so selfish. I feel like the only reason I haven't killed myslef is because I don't want to hurt the people that care about me. But I feel so unhappy and like my life is going nowhere, cause I'd love most of all to be dead. I feel numb, and every meaningless task just adds to the dull lie that I live with everyday. My life has no meaning, I don't want to live, but I can't end it cause I don't want to hurt my family. I feel like I'm in an empathetic paradox
