You MatterJust wanted to say to everyone that this is an amazing community and each and every one of you is an amazing human being! Whether you have been here awhile or just joined, you all are amazing! And for those of you going through terrible things, I'm so sorry, if you need someone to talk to, then let me know! And for those of you that have helped others on this sub, you are amazing and I appreciate you immensely! I may not need any help, but I only wish my cousin had met someone as awesome as you!
