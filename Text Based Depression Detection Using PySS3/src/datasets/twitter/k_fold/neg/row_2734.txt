The only future that sounds pleasant is one where Iâ€™m deadi canâ€™t imagine ever really enjoying life. i know there are some people who say â€œoh, if i had this and this, iâ€™d be happy.â€ and i really think that some people who are depressed and suicidal can recover and live happy lives. but iâ€™m not one of those people... because nothing could ever or will ever make me happy

iâ€™ve been depressed my whole life, despite having caring parents and no â€œtrauma.â€ my brain just canâ€™t fucking integrate with society and think that life is worth living. there is NOTHING i want to do in life. i donâ€™t want a job because no job is appealing. i donâ€™t want a significant other or friends because i canâ€™t form relationships (iâ€™m selfish, socially awkward, care too much about what others think). there is nothing i want to do, truly. not even play a new game or go watch a new movie or eat food or travel. nothing is worth it!

iâ€™ve tried therapy. iâ€™ve tried antidepressants. nothing makes my brain think â€œhey, life is worth living.â€ 

iâ€™m just not meant to live. a future where iâ€™m dead, lost in the void of nothingness sounds soo goood. i wonâ€™t have to worry about what people think of me anymore!! i wonâ€™t have to worry about planning for the future!! 

i wonâ€™t have to worry about a single fucking thing because nothing will matter anymore!! that is the one thought that makes me happy.
