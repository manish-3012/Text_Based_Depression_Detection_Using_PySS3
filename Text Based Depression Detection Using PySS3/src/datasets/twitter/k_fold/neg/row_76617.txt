The noose in my drawerHi. I am deeply convinced that I have to die. I'm bad at the core and it's a belief that's deeply rooted in me. In the past months I lost all I had tried to build after leaving my toxic home and recovering from it. I don't have much hope anymore. I should have died in this house and all I've done in the past five years was never destined to work out. Lately it's like I'm back there. I have to act on the guilt. I am the toxic one. I'm just beyond getting better. I don't deserve it. I am now resolved to finish the job. I made a noose and I planned the act. I'm just afraid no one will check on my dead body. I don't want my neighbor to find it in two weeks because of the smell. I want to leave a note to a friend with whats left of my money but I'm afraid he'd find it too early and interrupt me.
