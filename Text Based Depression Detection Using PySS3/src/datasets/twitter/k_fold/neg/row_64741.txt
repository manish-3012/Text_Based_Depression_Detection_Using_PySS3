Life is a burdenThere's nothing I enjoy about being alive. Every day is worst than the last one. I used to be hopeful about the future but I've been let down so many times by the events that unfolded, that I don't care anymore. Nothing ever gets better even if I push myself to make the changes. Most of the times when faced with a decision I always make retarded choices and sadly I can't go back in time to fix them. I'm only 20 years old and already too tired to keep going. My only friend used to be my dog but I left him for a stupid trip overseas. I have been suicidal ever since I was 12 years old and it never got better after that. I'm ready to buy some coal to burn and die of carbon monoxide poisoning.
