slowly giving upi know no one will read this but i guess i just need to take this out of my chest.

i've been lonely pretty much my entire life, the few friends i've made so far gave upon me and for the past 3 months i had no real connection with anyone.

i live in a very toxic environment and my family is not really a reason to keep fighting for my life anymore.

i've made this account as a last attempt to meet someone but i had almost no success, i tried sending as many messages as possible to as many people as i could and all i got in return was being left on read or superficial talk. i don't know if i'm giving the wrong impression or something, or maybe i'm trying too hard? i guess i'm the kind of person who puts heart and soul into everything i do.

i can't help but thinking that i am the problem and honestly the only solution i can think about is to attempt suicide again.

anyways that's my rant for today i just hope i can go through this night.

all my love, 
L
