Stop telling me to just "Get help". I did, and after 16 years, I assure you: IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK!I honestly have no idea which subreddit fits this post most, but I'm sick of being told to get help after 16 years of actively trying to get help.

- 3 serving social workers from the army, 3 therapists and a psychiatrist, pills, CBT, gym, sleep, proper diet, and even those motivational sleep videos or whatever. -

NOTHING worked, and it only made things worse as I slowly realized that nothing helps, and it made me a lot more hopeless.

I'm sick of seeing people telling others to get help, while assuming they never did.

My entire life was wasted on "help", I have no social skills, am practically selectively mute, and I just wish someone would hold my hand while getting euthanized while telling me it's the best thing for me.

This "get help" idea normalized the current form and ideas of "help" and completely disregards the fact that we barely know how to save the, obviously, the people who already comitted suicide.
