NumbIt's really not that I want to die. But I don't want to live either. Shit just feels pointless again. I mean I've felt like this before, and in the end I'm only seventeen, maybe I will grow out of it or something, but I'm just scared that maybe I won't. Maybe I will feel like this forever. That I will keep waking up just to take a shot, go to school, drink even more and then sleep again. I don't even enjoy cuddling with my dog anymore. That's been the thing that kept me somewhat hopeful the last times, that there was one thing I could feel happy about. But even that is gone. The last feeling I tried to hold onto left me. 
I can pretend that I am feeling shit, that's never been the problem, but it feels like there's only two feelings I really have. Loneliness and numbness. 
It also gets harder to fit in. I feel hated in school. I'm just that weird kid, that tries to be liked, without having any qualities to actually be likable.  

And I hoped that writing this would help, would help me feel less numb, but even though I am literally tearing up, I don't feel the pain. I am still numb. And I want to stop it but I don't know how. I am just lost. And also very drunk, elseway I probably wouldn't be writing this.

I am in therapy btw, and I take antidepressants, so I know I shouldn't be drinking, but ah well. Alcohol works better than both of the above.
