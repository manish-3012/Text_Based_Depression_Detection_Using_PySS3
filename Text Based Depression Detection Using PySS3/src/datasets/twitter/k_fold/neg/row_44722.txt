How don't you kill yourself?Let me start by saying that I don't think I'm suicidal. I think about death a lot and in turn think about suicide. Simply put, I don't see a reason to live. I'm not a special person and I'm not accomplishing amazing things. I'm not an inspiration to anyone and if anything, I'm a detriment to peoples' lives. I'm locked inside working 60+ hours a week, I don't have any close friends, my girlfriend seems like she doesn't want to be with me, and I hate everything about me. So reddit, how don't you kill yourself? How do you face the hardships of life including all of the invasive thoughts and not end it?
