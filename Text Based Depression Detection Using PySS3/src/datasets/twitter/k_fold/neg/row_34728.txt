I don't know if i deserve to be depressed.Unlike many of the people here, I never had anything traumatic happen to me or had something/someone I hold dear taken away from me. I'm from a relatively well off family with parents who love each other and naturally had a normal childhood. I'm currently in my final year at a very prestigious college, and sometimes I wonder if I even deserve to be depressed and have suicidal thoughts.

But the truth is I forgot what happiness feels like. Even if I'm with friends and family, I feel empty and lonely. They listen to me but do not understand me and they tell me they care but it seems all too pretentious and fake. Even when i try to take my mind off things by doing things I typically like, its not enough to fill the void and just amplifies the hollowness. 

I really want to get to the root of my problems but I don't even know where to start because I never had an event that triggered this perpetual sadness. I've been telling myself I've had a bad day but the day turned into a week, a month, a year and now i've been miserable for the past 4 years.
I know I'm pathetic considering people go through living hell and still come out mentally sound. But I simply no longer find joy in living, or in the small banters and the insignificant moments that's supposed to be the silver linings in everyone's miserable lives.
