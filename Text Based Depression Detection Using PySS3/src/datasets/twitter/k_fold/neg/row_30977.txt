Update on PM trolls, self-appointed enforcers, and SW Moderation Practices. If you got a PM that was abusive or critical, please read, thx!Thanks to assistance from the reddit admins and the protective action of our previous warning, we're glad to say that reports of PM trolling have tapered off. We appreciate the help of everyone in the community who made the extra effort to report these PMs and send us their contents.

However, we've also been seeing another disturbing pattern: someone (or some people, although we suspect one person using many accounts) taking it upon themselves to police the sub, without consulting us, by sending people PMs with harsh criticisms of their responses. In the cases that have been reported to us, we've been dismayed to see that the content of these messages contain serious misinterpretations of our guidelines, and are in complete conflict with our moderation philosophy.

If you get a PM that criticizes your responses to our OPs, please be aware that if it doesn't come from /r/SuicideWatch, it's probably giving you wrong and harmful feedback. Please **[send us a modmail with the text of the PM and the account from his the message originated](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch)**, click "report" on the PM, and don't worry about it unless we contact you. Please do ***NOT*** post the account name in this thread or anywhere else. The SW mod team does occasionally give private feedback to commenters who are generally doing well but need clarification on some specific issues, but these notes will always come from the subreddit's mailbox and never from an individual. 

Our sincere thanks to everyone who shares their time, energy, strength, and wisdom supporting our OPs. 

Edit:  Clarified details.
