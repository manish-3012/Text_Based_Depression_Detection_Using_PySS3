Iâ€™m doneI canâ€™t take it anymore, Iâ€™m no good for this world. I just want to take a gun to my head and end it, Iâ€™m so tired. I have nothing but cuts on my body, like anyone would of actually miss me. Iâ€™ve caused so much problem to everyone, and I canâ€™t control it. I canâ€™t control my looks, my OCD, my depression. I canâ€™t, if I had a choice I wouldnâ€™t be born.

Iâ€™m scared of the voices in my head, I feel like I have no control. And if I donâ€™t do what it tells me, something horrible will happen. I feel like Iâ€™m losing my insanity, I started to imagine myself into story or talk to myself. Iâ€™m going crazy arenâ€™t I. Iâ€™m scared I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, all these bad thoughts about hurting my family. What if they come true, Iâ€™m dangerous. I donâ€™t deserve to live.

I hardly eat anymore, all I have is coffee. Iâ€™ve had horrible dreams of people dying or Iâ€™m killing my self. I donâ€™t want to live like this, heck I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Nothings working, nothing will ever work. I use to wish that I would meet the love my life, and they would help fix this. Itâ€™s stupid and wouldnâ€™t help, but I just someone to notice me. Someone to notice how much pain Iâ€™m actually in, at the same Iâ€™m donâ€™t. At the same time I just want something to push me off a edge. Iâ€™m so tired.
