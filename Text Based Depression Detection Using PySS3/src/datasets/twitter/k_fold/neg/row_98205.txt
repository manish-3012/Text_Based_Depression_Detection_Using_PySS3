I went to the dentist office todayAnd I have between 7 and 14 cavities, my dental plan will only cover about 3 of those, I'm almost broke and can barely afford to pay to fix the rest. I brush and floss everyday, I did everything I could to prevent this. I'm probably going to have to pay about 700$ out of pocket at minimum. Meanwhile buying a shotgun would only be a couple hundred. Pretty goddamned tempting.
