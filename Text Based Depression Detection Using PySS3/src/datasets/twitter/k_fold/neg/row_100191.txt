i dont see a reason to live for anymorei dropped out of 8 grade four years ago because of ptsd and anxiety. i cant get my dream job, because i never gratuated. i really regret i dropped out. i cant get dream job now. i feel so embarrased when i tell others i didnt finish high school. they must think im weird. i cant get back on trail im trying but i really cant.
