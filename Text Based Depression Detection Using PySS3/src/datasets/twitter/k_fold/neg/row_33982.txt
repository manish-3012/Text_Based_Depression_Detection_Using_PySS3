Nothing on the inside nothing on the outsideWas in a long term abusive relationship and canâ€™t go back to him without losing my friends and family.  I still love him , mostly because I donâ€™t love myself. We were engaged I thought Iâ€™d know him for the rest of my life.  On the outside no one would know how hard Iâ€™m struggling , on the inside it feels like there is no way out.  I donâ€™t want to feel like this.  I want to be happy and I donâ€™t know how.
