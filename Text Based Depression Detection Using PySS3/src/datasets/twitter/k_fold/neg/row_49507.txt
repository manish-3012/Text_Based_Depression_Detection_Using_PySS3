Writing here instead of doing anything stupidI have OCD. this isnt the reason I want to kill myself but unfortunately it keeps pushing me towards doing so. I work in a school. Well did before corona. My OCD keep taking over and keeps iterating to make my believe I'm worthless and honestly it hurts. I'm 23 and I should be living but the only thing I'm doing is dying. I really want to die but the only thing keep me alive is my empathy for those outside of myself I need to care for. I have friends and people in corps. I love them. Their feelings and I feel for them. I nust...just wish I could exist outside of myself and also help them.
