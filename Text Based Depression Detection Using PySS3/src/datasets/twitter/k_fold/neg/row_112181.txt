Friends all around and all i can do i pop pills...im sick of it. everything. havn't been on my meds for about 4 months. i unno if its that though, i think its christmas and being stuck in a bullshit routine. not doing anything is killing me. im growing apart from my friends it seems while they all get closer. i unno how much the pills r gunna affect me, but i was close to taking a whole bottle of pills last night when i was alone all teary eyed, yet tonight im in a "semi good mood" on the outside yet taking asprin on top of a handful (aprox 9) 20g ciprilex. 
i unno.. blah. i dont really wanna die i just wanna feel different maybe ill get high, if nothing happens its more likely ill end up physically harmming myself.
