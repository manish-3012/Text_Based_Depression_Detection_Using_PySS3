I don't know what to do.What is the point in living if there is nothing but awful things? Why go through the stress and bad things day after day? Why bother dating if there is a chance of being cheated on.

I have been suicidal most of my life. At six I thought about how I could get to the top of my school building in order to jump off of the top of it and end my life.

There's nothing even majorly wrong with my life. I'm rarely bullied, if I try I get straight A's so school is far from a problem. I hear my dad yell at my sister nearly every day, but that yelling is not normally targeted towards me. 

I hate the position I'm in right now. Crying so hard my head starts pounding.

I've been depressed for a while but the actual suicidal thoughts only have been happening frequently recently. And I hate how depression is feminized by society which makes it even harder to tell people about this. 

Reddit, what do I do?

Edit: One part I wanted to add - I've stopped planning what I'm going to do in the future, because I know for a fact I'll end my life before then.
