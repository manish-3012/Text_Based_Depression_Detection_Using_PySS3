No Hope2021 is coming close and a few months ago, I used to feel hopeful looking forward to 2021.

But thatâ€™s no longer the case. I thought things wouldâ€™ve died down by now but things are only worse. I kept saying â€œI just need 2020 to be overâ€ but the truth is, the bad stuff isnâ€™t going away as soon as New Year hits.

Itâ€™ll stay. All of it will stay. People say â€œLife will go back to normal.â€ No, I no longer believe that. I believe that everyone will wear masks and social distance until the day they die. It will be the norm forever.

Iâ€™m not implying Iâ€™m anti-mask but itâ€™s depressing to live in a world where you canâ€™t look at peopleâ€™s faces and see their emotions. Itâ€™s depressing to live in a world where you canâ€™t shake someoneâ€™s hand or hug a loved one.

Even if COVID-19 were to be the least of our problems, the pandemic living will be the normal. I donâ€™t mean â€œweâ€™re more aware of hygieneâ€ type of style, I mean the extreme side.

I want the life of 2019 back. And since thatâ€™s never coming back, Iâ€™m choosing to not live it. Call me a pessimist, whatever. I prefer realist. Anyone who feels hopeful that the world will go back to normal is living an illusion.

Iâ€™ll be turning 20 next month. I will give myself 10 years to live. Why 10 years? So I can get my PhD first. Yeah it sounds dumb to kill myself afterward but I at least wanna leave some legacy behind. The day after my 30th birthday, I will kill myself.
