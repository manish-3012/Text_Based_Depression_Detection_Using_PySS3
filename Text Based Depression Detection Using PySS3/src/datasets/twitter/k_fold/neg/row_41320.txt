i told my momi told my mom that i didnâ€™t want to live anymore. i told her everything. well almost everything. itâ€™s 1 in the morning and sheâ€™s on the other side of the world. she wonâ€™t see it till later. i told her how i was going to kill my self. but i thought about it and realized that if i kill myself it would just burden my mom, dad, and sister. i just wish i could be the person they want me to be. i wish i would fit the standards of beauty. and i wish i wasnâ€™t like this
