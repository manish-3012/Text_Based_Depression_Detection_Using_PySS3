Iâ€™m going to try more help, but it just feels like Iâ€™m too late. Like Iâ€™ve already ruined everything in my life.Iâ€™ve reached out to my universityâ€™s centre for students with disabilities for reference to therapists who specialize in dealing with persons with ADHD and Aspergers Syndrome. Iâ€™m only trying again because I donâ€™t know what to do between this and my planed accidental suicide this summer. I just wish I had someone to talk to, or a shoulder to cry on. Iâ€™m just so alone and terrified Iâ€™ve ruined everything for myself. I didnâ€™t want that much. I just wanted to be able to do what I love. To do something that made me smile. I thought Iâ€™d get better, that Iâ€™d improve and that maybe Iâ€™d get good enough to at least be a measly intern. 

Now Iâ€™m graduating and my thesis is a disaster, my body of design work over the past 6 years is just mediocre. I was supposed to be a feel good story about a kid with disabilities who overcame the odds and found success. I was going to try to help other kids like me, help them believe or o donâ€™t know maybe feel like they deserve something in life. Now I wonâ€™t achieve anything. Iâ€™m just a helpless loser like my father and Iâ€™ll die alone and drunk. I hate being disabled. I wish my parents never advocated for me, never pushed me to try to be more than just a disabled person. Now my parents donâ€™t even care anymore, they just look at me with disgust. 

I hate myself and I hate my life and my future. I just wanted to live a normal life, just doing something I like. Didnâ€™t want to be a superstar or name in lights kinda designer. I just wanted to be able to work in a studio alongside other people because I enjoy that. Now Iâ€™m doomed to miserable dead end jobs and a unfulfilled life. I just want to go to sleep tonight and not wake up, but I know I wonâ€™t be blessed with that. 

Iâ€™m just going to give up and sign my life over to the armed forces. Maybe they can give me something to live for now.
