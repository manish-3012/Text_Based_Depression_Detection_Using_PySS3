The only reason I'm not shooting myself is because I can't shoot twice to be sure.Basically the title. I want to bring up this point to see if I'm not the only one.

I'm not really that suicidal but if I could make sure I wouldn't be able to come back I think i would shoot myself, multiple times. But I don't know if I ever will have the balls for it.

Right now I'm making the best of this existential dread filled life, filled with bad selfish people we all have to go through.

I hope you're doing well.
