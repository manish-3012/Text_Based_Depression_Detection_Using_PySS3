I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold on(16m) I find that life is only getter harder and worse as it goes on I would give so much to go back a year ago and I would have said the same a year ago. I donâ€™t want to kill myself but I see it becoming more and more of an option I just donâ€™t want to live in a word which only gets worse. If things continue the way there going then I would rather not live. Everyone says to just hold on for a bit longer but I feel like thatâ€™s what my life has become. Everyone says it gets better but it hasnâ€™t and it doesnâ€™t seem Like that trend is going to break anytime soon
