calling it quits earlyIm 20 and I dont want to live anymore. I failed my college classes and dont have the motivation to get out of bed anymore. I have no friends and spend all my time alone being depressed. I had so many dreams but thats all they will be, dreams. Im planning on jumping off a siblings 7th floor apartment building but dont want to scar the people living there. I've been reluctant on doing it but I have fallen so deep into this pit that im ready. I dont know why im typing this.
