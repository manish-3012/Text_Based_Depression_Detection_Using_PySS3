I don't feel good inside I haven't felt this bad in a while. My sadness used to come in waves, but they grew less frequent until I hardly felt anything at all. Sometimes I want to talk to someone. Sometimes I want friends. But they never work out, and even online people say I don't belong. Every second I lie. I don't tell them I'm not interested in boys. I say that I am fine. I can't smile with my eyes anymore. I can hardly smile with my mouth. I don't want to wake up everyday feeling so blank. I don't want to be a canvas board, left to be eaten away by dark colours. I just needed to write this out. I just wanted to see my thoughts. Sorry.
