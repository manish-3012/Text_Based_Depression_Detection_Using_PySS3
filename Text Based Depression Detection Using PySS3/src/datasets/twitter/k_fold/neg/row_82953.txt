I want almost nothing from life. But life doesnâ€™t care for me.Literally all I want is a wife who wonâ€™t cheat on me. Enough money to not have to worry about money. And for the people I care about to be happy. 

Why does life want me to suffer? Why have I been made the way I am? I really have to spend 10+ years fixing myself before I am worth anything? 

What is wrong with me? Seriously I donâ€™t know I swear Iâ€™m trying my best idk what Iâ€™m fucking doing I donâ€™t understand anything I just want to make informed decisions.

Why does it seem like everyone knows something I donâ€™t? What do they know that Iâ€™m not getting...
