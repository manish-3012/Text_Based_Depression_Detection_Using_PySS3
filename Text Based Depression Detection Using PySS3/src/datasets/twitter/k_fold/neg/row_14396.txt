Couldn't force myself to end it today...I have been thinking about this a lot, told myself that today is the day... couldn't do it. I wanted to talk to my best friend, my only friend actually, who lost her brother because he commited suicide aswell, so i never could talk to her about it, nor do it because i can't get my mind off her...
