I think Iâ€™m going to do it when my heart is broken one more timeI am well-prepared but still have my doubts about reliability and peacefulness. I think I can only take it this far and put it to an end when Iâ€™m acting on impulse. When a wave of emotional pain is gushing over me, Iâ€˜m not scared of physical pain.
They hurt me once, they hurt me twice. Iâ€™m certain it will happen a third time.
Third timeâ€™s the charm, right?
The third person ruined my life.

They didnâ€™t believe me and called me a manipulator. Iâ€™ll show them that Iâ€˜m in pain. You may hate me, but no one hates me as much as I hate myself.
