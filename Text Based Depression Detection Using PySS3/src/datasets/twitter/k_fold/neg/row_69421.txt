I've realized there's nothing for me in life.I'm going to work my summer job finished then I'm going on a nice vacation alone just to get some time alone. Then I'm going to do it.

I don't even know why I've waited this long. Because I've always known there isn't anything for me in life so why have I continued? This will be much better than having to go on being like I am.

Now I have something to look forward to, can't wait to not exist anymore.
