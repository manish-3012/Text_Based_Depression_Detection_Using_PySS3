I need helpHi. I don't know if this is even the right sub for this.. Sorry. 
My friend, who I actually met here, has proboably done something to himself. We have been talking online for over a year now (kind of a support chat), I live in Finland and he lives in Holland. Last sunday he said he was going to kill himself and said goodbye and that he loves us.. And ofcourse I tried talking to him, to change his mind, but he left. He didn't see the messages I sent him. So I called the police and they said they were going to contact Hollands authorities.. But now I don't know anything. He hasn't seen the messages, he either removed me from he's facebook friends or deleted his whole account, he hasnt had any activity on here. 
So I don't know what to do. He means very much to me.
Thank you if you red this far.
