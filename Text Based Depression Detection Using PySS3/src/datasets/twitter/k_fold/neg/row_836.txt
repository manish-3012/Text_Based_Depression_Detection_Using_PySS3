I'm freaking the fuck out. I can't function as an adult.not that I could function as a kid either, but as I'm becoming older my weirdness is becoming more and more of a problem. 

I'll just quickly say that I developed social phobia in the 7th grade. Since I shied away from everyone, I had no friends (besides my brother's friends who were only my friends because of my brother) all the way through high school. I get to college and run into the same problems. I never admitted it to myself until recently, but I've had severe depression/apathy for a very long time.

I no longer have social phobia, but I can't bring myself to show my personality. I've shown less and less of my personality as the years have gone by to the point that I'm now a complete fucking weirdo. And this isn't just around strangers and acquaintances I'm talking about; this is around my own brother and my cousin who is basically my sister. I can't be myself or show myself to anyone. I've recently tried 'practicing' by myself and trying to figure who I fucking am anymore and I don't like what I see and hear.

I took shrooms about two weeks ago and now instead of bottling everything away in pure apathy, I now care like a normal person. And I just want to die...even though I of course don't actually want to die. I want to be happy and comfortable being myself around people, but since I can't do that and will never be able, I want to die.

And I'm freaking out. I constantly have this terrible feeling in my stomach like I'm about to give a speech to a crowd of over 1000 people (and just giving a short presentation in class is one of my least favorite things in the world)... and it won't go away.

How can I come out of this?
