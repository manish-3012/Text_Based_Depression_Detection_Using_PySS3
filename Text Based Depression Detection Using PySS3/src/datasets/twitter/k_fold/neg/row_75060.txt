Need help dealing with a friendI need help advising a friend. Wife left him suddenly and seems like his whole world collapsed. Docs have him on meds. He's really upset and seems to be getting worse over time. Every conversation is about "ending the pain". I have no experience with this and he's clear across the country and relatively in isolation. I've had him lock up his guns but don't know for sure if he's done it. Any advisement you can provide on what I should be doing/saying would be greatly appreciated.
