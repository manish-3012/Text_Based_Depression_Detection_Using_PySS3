I'm worried about what will happen to my dog, after I kill myself.If you read my previous post you'll know a decent story about me, and why i want to die exactly. but the thing I'm most worried about is weirdly, my dog. My parents hate me already so they would get over my death in a couple of months, my brother is just a kid so he wont understand, and even if he did he hates me too. My friends would be fine, I'd be forgotten in school after a couple of months too, They might not even tell them i was dead. My relatives and cousins and grands would be certainly devastated but they'll eventually learn to cope with it. My do in the other hand, is the most precious little girl i have ever seen in my entire life, i love her more than my parents probably, and i'm afraid she wont get the sam amount of love i give her from my parents when i die, i fear they'll just feed her and lock her up in a little cage. She doesnt deserve such a horrible life, she was rescued from the streets so she already went through bad times and i dont want to make her go through that again, but this time as a prisoner in a garden, but hey. i didnt deserve a horrible life either, but thats what i got, its what people thought was good enough for me, well looks like itsnt, and most definitely i will kill myself at some point, leaving the only thing i love, behind with horrid people to live her life to the fullest she can. Maybe she'll do what i wont be able to.
