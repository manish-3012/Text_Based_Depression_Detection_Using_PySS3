Ever since being my accident, I have heard creepy voices.Long story short, I was hit by a delivery car when I was 9 while riding my motor scooter. The ER visit was terrifying. I had spasms for two hours before they put me under for surgery. I guess it traumatized me or something, because I hear voices when I am alone and donâ€™t have music. I guess Iâ€™m just looking for help.
