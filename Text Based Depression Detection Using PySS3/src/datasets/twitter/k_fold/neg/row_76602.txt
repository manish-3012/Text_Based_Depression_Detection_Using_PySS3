I don't think even my family likes me anymore. I'm so lonely. Not having fun this holiday season.I'm a 20 year old college student. I live in an apartment with two random roommates who don't acknowledge me, and my parents (divorced) &amp; siblings live in the same city I'm going to school in. I was recently diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and I've always had problems with communication, so I don't have too many friends. I have always been close with my brother but recently he has been distancing himself since he began attending a high school several hours away. My parents blow off my texts as well as my other siblings; however, I play in a brass ensemble and we had a holiday concert in town, so I invited my family to come and mentioned catching up, and they said they were up to it. The night came, and none of them showed up. I felt so hurt. So many people I know are catching up with their parents and enjoying the holidays, eating and making use of the break to spend time with their families, and I've been completely alone in my apartment for the past few weeks, save grocery runs and a concert that my family blew off. I want to feel that kind of love. I'm not sure I'm going to make it to the next semester. I feel completely purposeless. I can't stand the silence of my apartment anymore; the isolation is driving me insane. I don't want to live like this.
