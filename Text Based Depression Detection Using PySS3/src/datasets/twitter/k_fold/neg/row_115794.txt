Thank you suicide watch(Yeah I did post this already but I messed up the title and it was eating at me so I had to redo it)
I am an 18 y/o girl with clinical depression who has been browsing r/depression and r/scuicidewatch for a while when I feel particularly down and all I can really think to say is thank all of you. I am by no means better in any way, I am still drowning in depression and suicidal thoughts but you guys really bring me back down to earth. I struggle with feeling lonely and convincing myself that I am utterly and completely alone in the world and I always will be, I can't imagine being able to live a life so alone and isolated. All I can think is that suicide is the only way to escape and free myself. I have lots of panic attacks that include suicidal thoughts and that only make things worse but it really calms me to come here and just read. This is the only place I feel like I can stop hiding things and ignoring my depression. When I was 10 my dad died and then at age 14 my sister died and my life went to hell. I am on anti depressants and I use to see a therapist but my mom won't schedual me a new therapist or refill my medicine. She drinks all the time and that is what drives the nails into my depression and panic attacks. I feel like she doesn't love me, even though she says she does, she won't stop drinking even though I ask her to a lot. I'm moving out of the house in a few months but I don't know how things are going to go, I know things will get better but sometimes it seems it can't. I just feel like I don't have anyone to talk to, talking helps a lot, I'm so confused, I don't know how things could get better, it seems they can only get worse. But anyway, you guys keep doing what you're doing, because it's helping, in little ways, its helping.
