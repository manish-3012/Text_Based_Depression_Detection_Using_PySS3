I'm tired of thisEveryday, I smile so I don't have to explain my pain. I write thing on myself and punch things to cope. I'm tired of living like this. I'm tired of living. I've already tried to take my own life several times before. I'm almost willing to try again. I have nothing to lose. I'm only causing my mother more stress than she's already in. What else can I do?
