I want to kill myself because Iâ€™m an incel and unpopular and Idk how to improve myself because Iâ€™m a loserI know this is easily the biggest most first world problem to ever make someone miserable but itâ€™s making me want to die so much, Iâ€™m 17 and still nobody wants to have sex me, my dad always tells m about how when he was 14 lots of girls slept with him and how he was super popular and it makes me so ashamed since Iâ€™m nothing like he was my age. He had tons of friends and hot girlfriends and partied nearly every weekend and drove this really cool 80s car when he turned 16 (he loves that car so much he has three pictures of it in our house), I donâ€™t even have a car or a license so it just makes me feel worse. I want to die so much and Iâ€™m starting to think it will be worth the pain I cause my dad too since his life is completely fine as it is. 

PS. If you donâ€™t know what an incel is, itâ€™s short for involuntary celibate - someone (almost always male) who craves sex but doesnâ€™t get any. 

Sorry for blabbing I wrote this in one sitting and donâ€™t know how to word this exactly.
