I'm LostI don't feel like I'm in control anymore at all.
Previously I still could control or understand my feelings.
I can't explain how I feel; I feel "lost".

I don't know what to do.
If this doesn't get better I can't know what I will do to myself.
(Sidenote: Asian Religions are welcome, I'm Agnostic though, but I have a feeling that they *could* help).
I'm sorry if I offended anyone.
