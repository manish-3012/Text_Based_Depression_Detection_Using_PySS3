Want to die, too scared to do it myselfI have hated myself my entire adult life, and I can't remember the last time I was actually happy. I've tried therapy, but I'm not strong enough to make the changes I need to like myself.

The worst part is that I'm so ready to die but I'm terrified of killing myself. I don't know what's waiting for me on the other side. If there's a higher power will I be judged for taking my own life even though I don't see any way out?

If someone offered to kill me, or I was presented with a dangerous situation in which I would certainly be killed, I would take it.
