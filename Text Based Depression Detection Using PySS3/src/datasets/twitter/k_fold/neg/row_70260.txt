ProblemsSummary as I wrote an hour long paragraph earlier: fear of hell, rebuttal for Calvinism, fossils but Fermi paradox? Do I deserve god to ask good for forgiveness if I think think god can be evil even though o try my hardest to honk otherwise? Bisexual( one other thing I am too embarrassed to speak about) 13 but porn addicted, nerd but want to fit in, I look great but still insecure about my image, want a gf but too afraid to ask anyone?
