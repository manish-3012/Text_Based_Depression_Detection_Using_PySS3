My story, my suicide.Thank you for giving up some of your time for me. I thank you alot. 

I've already lost my brother to suicide, ever since then my mum has never been the same. I've had this huge amount of pressure piled on top of me. I just recently turned 18. I'm struggling, my mental health is getting worse, I've always been the waste of space in life. I've always tried to 'fit in' but was bullied. It's was all my fault though because I was weak. I've never had a single friend in my life, I'm 18 and I have never been to a nightclub, festival, or even a cinema, I also haven't had a relationship, never held hands with anyone, never kissed anyone nor do I have a job. I'm currently at college doing some computing course which will never give me a good future, I'll be poor and this breaks my heart because I want to help my parents financially. They haven't had the best of lives. 

I'm constantly wondering what it is like to be a normal teenager. What is it like to have some fun? I never have a chance to have some fun anymore. I'm extremely ugly, what I hate about it is I can't control it, I'm just unlucky.  

I guess this is my last goodbye. I'm ready to go now, maybe I'll meet my brother again? Man, this is hard, my mind is travelling at a thousand miles per hour. My tears are falling onto the keyboard. I've got my method sorted out, hopefully it's peaceful for my body.

Lots of love,
Me.
