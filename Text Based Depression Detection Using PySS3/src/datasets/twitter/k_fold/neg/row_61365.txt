Getting real fucking tired of this whole being alive bullshit.Feels like every day is more miserable than the last and so often I find myself driving down the road wishing someone would just forget to stop in time. Or miss a red light. Todayâ€™s the second time Iâ€™ve burst into tears because a driver did what they were supposed to do and actually stopped behind me.

Not like anyone gives a damn anyway, but I just can hardly take this anymore.
