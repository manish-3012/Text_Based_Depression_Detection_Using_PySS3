Suicide as an unemployed person is often completely reasonable and other people insisting that it's not is making me even angrierI can't get a job (ANY JOB) and the constant rejection sends a very clear message to me: I am not worthy of an income allowing me to eat, pay rent, and deal with my health issues. If I am not worthy of the basic necessities of life, how is suicide not a completely reasonable choice? Because it's less convenient to clean up?

I'm always told to not give up and keep pushing and that it gets better. People give advice freely, but never a chance to make an income and support myself. It's as if society is egging me on, just so they can keep telling me I'm not good enough. It's cruel. If I'm not worthy of food, shelter and healthcare then fine - death is the natural consequence of not having those things. It shouldn't be considered extreme to take your own life if you're considered so useless that you don't deserve to live.
