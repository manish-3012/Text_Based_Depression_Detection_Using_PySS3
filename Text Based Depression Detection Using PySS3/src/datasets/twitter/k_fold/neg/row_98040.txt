I just destroyed my own life in preparation to die. I'm terrified of deathMy first year at university was the best thing ever. I was able to be myself, a man. I presented male, I was addressed as such. Life was good. I had to go 'home' for the summer and since the day I started packing my dorm I've been more and more depressed. I was actually doing incredibly well at school, mentally speaking. Returning to this life has destroyed me. I'm in the South, 900+ miles from my few friends. I'm living a lie, my mom's hugely transphobic: I'm pretending to be a woman and somehow not crying every time I'm addressed by my deadname. But I can't do this. My job, my volunteering, adn my cat aren't enough to make me want to stay. I actually packed up and ran away last night, childish as it is.

I made it three hours before my mom caught me, dragged me back home sobbing. Now I can't leave the house without her permission.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm 20 years old, turning 21 in November, but I don't even want to see that birthday. I can't do this. I went from being able to cope pretty well with occasional bad days/weeks to every waking moment being awful, wanting nothing but to die or self-harm, and crying multiple times a day. 

Today I told members of my school's marching band that I'm quitting because I can't afford to come to all the pre-band camp rehearsals, which is true. 

I've proceeded to print out the sheet to drop out of my university and have it filled out. I just have to mail it. I'm terrified and sobbing but I don't know what else to do. I need to destroy my life. I need to destroy myself externally the way I've been destroyed internally in a matter of a week's time. I'm so scared.
