I don't know what is wrong with my head.3 years ago I overdosed as a suicide attempt, lived through it. I was diagnosed with Aspergers. I have been to counsellors on and off for the past 10 years, have tried meds, i worked hard to be independent and fulfill my dream of being a neuroscientist.

About two months ago I started developing cluster headaches after a concussion. I cannot get treatment for them until the concussion is cleared, but first my doctor has to check if I have a brain tumor. My grades have dropped and my independence I worked hard for has been taken away.
I don't know what to do, because nobody seems to understand or listen to me. Counsellors don't help that much. My dream is slipping away and I am afraid.
