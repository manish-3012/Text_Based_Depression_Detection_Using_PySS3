I know someone who's planning, what's the best course of action?They've been talking to me for a few weeks about planning suicide, and soon. I don't want to give away many details, but they've told me their plan, and date. I've tried to get through to them, but I feel powerless, and I highly doubt anything I can say will change their mind. I'm the only one that they've really told about this as well. I've relayed a lot of the information to one of their friends, but I feel like that isn't nearly enough. I called the hotline and all they really said was "Just give them our number". I'm desperate and freaking out, I don't have much time left and I don't know what I can do. Does anyone have advice?
