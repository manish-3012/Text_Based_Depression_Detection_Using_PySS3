The world wants my lifeâ€™s will or It wants me destroyed. I feel like suicide is the only way outTheyâ€™re trying to trap me on the earth. 
Soulless working 9-5 zombie and robot. Theyâ€™re trying to tear me apart piece by piece. They broke my mind. They took my soul. And now they want my will. Brainwashed and evil people are helping. The people around me arenâ€™t human anymore theyâ€™re void and robotic. They talk about me in front of me like Iâ€™m an object. They start create false narratives. Theyâ€™re delusional. I have to get out of here but Iâ€™m being watched. I have no money. The people on the streets want to rape and kill me. What do I do??? How do I get away? I feel like suicide is my only option. All eyes are on me. The whole world knows my cards they tricked me. The world wants to scapegoat me. I canâ€™t trust anyone. Please help
