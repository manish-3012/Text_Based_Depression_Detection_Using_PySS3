Why?Why must I live? If suicide is selfish, then im okay with being that. If suicide isn't, then why am I being stopped? Why must I receive opposition? I have been feeling miserable all week, throwing on a face that I no longer want to wear. I don't really have anything worth living for. I don't feel happiness, and that's all I want. To feel happy. Its been over a year since I was officially diagnosed. I can't handle it. Meds don't help. Therapy doesn't. I want to be done with it all.

Is that too much to ask for?
