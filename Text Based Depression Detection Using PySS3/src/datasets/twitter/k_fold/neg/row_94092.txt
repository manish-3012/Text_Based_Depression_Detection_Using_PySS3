Its almost time to die...You know what my favorite lyric is?

"There's kerosene around, its something to do, set me on fire!!!"

Oh where would I be in life without that beautiful poet Steve Albini. 


You know what that songs about? Its about a kid in a small suburban town who can only do two things for fun, either fuck the girl who will take anyone in the next town over, or burn stuff. So one day, this kid is so bored that he decides to combine them!!! He having sex with this girl, and right out of the blue he just pours it over himself and lights a god damn match.

But hell, who needs that. It would be too painful, and its just glamorizing a human tragedy. Hell, I wouldn't have the guts to do it anyway. I'll probably end up using some boring method like a shotgun out in the woods or some pills. I haven't lived an interesting enough of a life for someone to write a song about me, whether its Albini or that guy with a guitar down the block, no one would want to here such a boring ballad.

Well, thanks for sitting through my ramblings. I may kill myself tonight, my brains smearing across the wall, though knowing me I'll probably just wind up an old depressed stoner, lacking the motivation to do something as simple as ending it all. 

See ya guys. Cheers to another forty years on this planet.
