Journal Entry December 13th 2019Ive been having so many dark thoughts recently i dont know what to do anymore. I will cry randomly throughout the day hoping that something bad will happen to me so i dont have to feel this way anymore. When im with other people i dont feel this way, but once im alone with nobody to distract my mind it lingers around as an option. Perhaps the pain meds are only a short term solution and just made everything worse, or maybe they are the only thing that has kept me alive until now? Sometimes i just hope for a freak accident to happen to me because its better then ending it myself because everyone will question why i did what i did. The burden that would fall upon my family is too much and i can't do that to them. But every day I think about doing it more and more. I dont know how to approach my family about anything because I dont want to inflict mental anguish on them or make them think they did something wrong. Thats simply not the case, as all this has been because of my indecisiveness and lack of purpose in this world.

Thanks for listening, sorry if its not stuctured well. That was the least of my concerns while writing this.

PS: Im not going to go through with anything, but some advice would be nice...
