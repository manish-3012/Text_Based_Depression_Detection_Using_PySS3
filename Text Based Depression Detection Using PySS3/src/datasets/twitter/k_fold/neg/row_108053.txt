I feel like I canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t live with the physical pain and episodes of confusion from a connective tissue disorder and whatever else. I canâ€™t live with the health issues. Itâ€™s too much for my literally autistic self to handle.Iâ€™m tired of having been in crisis for the majority of my 28 years.
