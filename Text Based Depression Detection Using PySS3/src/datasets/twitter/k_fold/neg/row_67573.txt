Realized I havenâ€™t gotten betterMy boyfriend is in another country for a month, and Iâ€™ve come to realize Iâ€™m not less depressed than I used to be. 

Without my boyfriend, I have barely have friends and none are very close to me. My family is the abusive garbage theyâ€™ve always been and I canâ€™t ignore how angry, sad, and anxious they make me without him. My negative thoughts like â€œIâ€™m so worthlessâ€ â€œEverything is so pointlessâ€ keep coming into my head.

Iâ€™ve cried every night for the past 3 nights because I just feel so empty and yet sad. Itâ€™s just me and my thoughts. 

I love technology, art, listening to music, video games, education. I want to work in higher education one day and I also want to be a programmer. Iâ€™m usually so excited about my plans and Iâ€™m usually fine. But without my boyfriend, everything seems so pointless. My dreams seem pointless and far away. 

I feel like Iâ€™ll never escape my negative and bleak home life. 

Iâ€™ve been crying for the past two hours. I feel like nobody cares about me or loves me except for him. Heâ€™s the love of my life. Heâ€™s what keeps me going.

I thought I was doing better but it turns out my boyfriend is just a distraction from my depression and my feelings of worthlessness. 

I keep thinking about my own death and if people would care.

I need a hug. I need a lot of hugs.
