Why shouldnâ€™t I kill myself due to social anxiety?Iâ€™m 21 years old and I have severe social anxiety, undiagnosed of course due to the condition itself. Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend (kissless, hugless virgin) and havenâ€™t made a proper friend in as long as I can remember, neither of which bother me anymore. I have just a couple friends that donâ€™t live in the same town as me and I prefer it that way.

I struggled through high school well aware of my social anxiety, with the mindset that I would be dealing with it forever, but it didnâ€™t bother me like it does now because I made myself believe I would somehow use my intelligence (top of my school) to somehow earn a living without having to interact daily. Since then I dropped out of university because I couldnâ€™t handle the social interaction, and I worked at my parentâ€™s small business that I also had to quit because I couldnâ€™t handle the interaction with fellow employees. Iâ€™ve tried extensively to make money online too but that has only been a waste of money so far and now I have no more to invest. Now Iâ€™m coming to the realization that there are no jobs I can do that donâ€™t involve any interaction at all with others. Iâ€™m expecting to hear that I should just get a job and it will supposedly help my social anxiety due to exposure: Iâ€™ve exposed myself enough to know itâ€™s an immense effort for no reward, I just go right back to avoiding everyone in no time. And counseling, counseling is the biggest joke Iâ€™ve ever heard; if I was insane it may help in some way to help me organize my thoughts, but I am well aware of my options. The way I see it, I have two. I can force myself to live my life with this condition, living in misery as I force myself through social interactions, counseling and a hundred different pills with weird side effects, or I can end my life here which I see to be valid strategy. I just donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth all the effort and suffering Iâ€™d have to go through just to experience the good things in life, that does not make me depressed. Once my parents die I feel I can justify suicide, everyone else that cares should realize itâ€™s my decision. If there was a job available for people allowing zero social interaction my life would be set.
