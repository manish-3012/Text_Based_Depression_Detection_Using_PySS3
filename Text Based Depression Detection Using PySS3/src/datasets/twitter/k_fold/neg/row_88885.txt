How do you find a reason to keep existingThere's the obvious answer of "you don't know what the future could hold", or, "think of the pain it will cause your loved ones", but I'm just so incredibly numb to these answers at this point. That's just not enough to keep me going, considering the unfathomable amount of dread I feel every time I wake up. I feel so isolated, and so disconnected with every interaction I have with people, life doesn't even feel real at this point. But at the same time, the real reason I'm still here, the only real upside, death seems even more terrifying.
