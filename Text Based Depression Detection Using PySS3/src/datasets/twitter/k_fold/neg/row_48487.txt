I'm a veteran of the French army, please help me.Hello, my name is RÃ©my and I'm a current soldier in the French military. I've long held depression with me, and I suffer from traumatic experiances that have happened to me on tour. The November attacks on my home city nearly drove me to suicide, in fact it was Reddit's great American veterans that helped me out. 

I feel like I can't take it anymore, and there's no one to speak to. I'm waking up in the night with a machete over my head it feels like. Please help.

With love,
Remy
