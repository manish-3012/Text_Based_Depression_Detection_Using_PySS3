Doctor Recommends I Go To Emergency Psych ClinicI told my PCP about my recent suicidal thoughts and he recommended I go to an emergency clinic. The thoughts come in go but it has become a daily thing where I want to do it. I'm 24, jobless, my relationship is really rocky now cause I dropped out of a program because of my anxiety, and my parents are in serious debt (about 40k). Things have been hitting me left and right the past few weeks and it's becoming difficult to manage. I've been applying to jobs (applied to like 25 places in a few days) but nothing has been coming back.
