Whatâ€™s the pointIâ€™m just going through the motions of my life, but why? Nothing makes me happy right now. At school, rehearsal, or with friends, all I want is to go home, and once I get home all I do is sleep because itâ€™s the only thing that makes me feel ok.

Iâ€™m going to university next year, and I desperately donâ€™t want to. But I donâ€™t want to get a job either. I just hate the idea of growing up and being responsible for myself. I love musical theatre, but a career in it is impossible. Iâ€™m good at maths, but Iâ€™m terrible at getting work done, and besides what would a degree in maths get me? 

If I could just find one thing that made me happy, I could deal with all the other bullshit. But I canâ€™t. In the past, relationships have given me purpose and kept me going, but theyâ€™ve all ended because Iâ€™m so mentally ill and dependent on them. Plus Iâ€™m ugly as fuck. I just canâ€™t help but feel like Iâ€™ll never be loved.

I doubt this will get any response, I barely even know how reddit works. I just needed to share this and had no other place. Have a good night.
