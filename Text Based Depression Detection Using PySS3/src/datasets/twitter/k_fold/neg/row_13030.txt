Considering ER for suicidal impulsesCan anyone here tell me what happens if you go to the ER due to suicidal thoughts and feelings? I feel awful all the time, I started cutting myself again for the first time since high school, my life is at a low and all I want is to just clock on my earthly time sheet. I don't have insurance, and I have no idea what to do except sob like a bitch while I write this.
