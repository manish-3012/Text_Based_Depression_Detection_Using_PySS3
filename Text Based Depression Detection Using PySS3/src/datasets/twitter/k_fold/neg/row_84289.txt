I fucked up my lifeI pushed away those who loved me when I needed it most. Now I'm homeless, now I'm jobless. I'm down to my last few dollars and can't find work. There's no point in going on. To whoever still cares and sees this I'm sorry. I just can't keep doing this. In the next life I'll try to make sure everything is okay. I'm sorry for everything
