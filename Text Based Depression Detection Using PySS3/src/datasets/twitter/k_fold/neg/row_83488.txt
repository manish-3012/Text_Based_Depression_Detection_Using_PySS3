I'm slippingI've been depressed for so long that I can not even remember the last time I smiled from being joyous rather than just acting . I've attempted suicide in the past and have failed , I've taken pills, read dozens of self help books, eat healthy , meditate, workout , have a career I genuinely enjoy , I can see the ocean from my kitchen , I have a husband and an amazing little girl but I just can't escape the numbness , I have no desire to live , I have no hope that I will ever be ok . I just don't want to hurt my daughter , tonight is the second time this month I have held a blade to my wrist and had to talk myself out of it . Every day I day dream about taking a box cutter to my throat, or when  I'm driving alone Im constantly contemplating driving my car into a wall or off a bridge so it might look like an accident. I would trade this emotional pain for physical pain in a heartbeat. How the fuck are you supposed to live a normal and healthy life knowing that the only thing keeping you from murdering yourself is someone else's well being? How long can that actually work ? How is that even a life ?
