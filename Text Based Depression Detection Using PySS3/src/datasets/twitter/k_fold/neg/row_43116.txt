When you realise no one is thereSo my "friend" and I had both been raped kind of young, and for a while she had problems coming into school. When I moved to her school, she was the only person who would talk to me, and we started hanging out and she came into school almost every day. We both had it in common that we couldn't talk to our families._x000D__x000D_When we went to separate sixthforms we still texted a lot and later, she went to university while I kept dropping out if school. Recently, I was getting help for my issues for the first time (because I was still in contact with the perpetrator) and I eeded to vent to my "friend". She quickly started getting annoyed with me because she said she was content now and didn't want negativity. _x000D__x000D__x000D_She used to vent to me a lot but now when I vent, she doesn't like it. Turns out I was someone who was so weird that she could compare herself to me to feel better about herself - then when she feels better, she doesn't need me anymore. _x000D__x000D_That's what I have always been to my family too. They can say they were "worried" about my health, but what they really mean is I was someone they felt more secure around because I was such a mess they knew it couldn't get any worse than me. If I killed myself, they would say I had so many problems and never care about what I really was like._x000D__x000D_How do I go on?
