ExhaustedFour weeks from graduation, two weeks since I've fallen behind. Two weeks since I've turned in any assignments, have gone to class, have left this room. The thoughts live and breathe here, taking away from the little energy I have left.

His smile helps, but only if he's around. Weed helps, but only to get the impulses out of my head. The downside is I become okay with being bored, just keep scrolling... And scrolling... And scrolling... Not getting anything done, but just continuing the cycle.

I am nearing the bottom of the hole, I can feel it. I'm tired of digging, but too exhausted to pull myself out. It's pitch-black. I've forgotten what the warmth of sunlight on my face feels like.

I am already in the grave. Now I wait until it's time to pull the trigger.
