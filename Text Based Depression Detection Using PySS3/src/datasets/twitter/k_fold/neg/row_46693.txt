I want to die so badIâ€™ve just been in bed for the past 3 weeks, extreme fatigue, weakness and lightheadedness. Think I have hyperthyroidism and my heart had to be monitored.

I donâ€™t have the will to live let alone treat this illness. I get joy when I think death is something that will happen to me but I wish it could happen like now. My heart beating is getting on my nerves like just stop
