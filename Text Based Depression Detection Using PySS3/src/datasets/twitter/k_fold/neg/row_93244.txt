i donâ€™t know anymore :(i really donâ€™t know what to do anymore. iâ€™m too scared to kill myself, but if i could, i would have done it already. i feel so hopeless. my health isnâ€™t great. i skip school all the time, because i hate it, i never feel good and i have no motivation and energy at all. the last couple of weeks, iâ€™ve skipped school all the time and literally been in my room 24/7. the only time i come out of my room is to get food or go to the bathroom. iâ€™ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ptsd in the last few years. mainly because my mom and grandpa passed away and that really fucked me over. now iâ€™m constantly worried to lose more people like my dad, my sister, my boyfriend, my grandma etc. iâ€™m really scared that my constant worry and fear will scare my boyfriend away. heâ€™s the only person i talk to and the only person that genuinely makes me happy sometimes. me not liking my own personality and especially the way i look makes me feel even sadder. i hate myself so much. i feel ugly, stressed, hopeless and depressed. i really have no idea what to do.
