Honestly so tired .I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m a 20yr old scum. I see other scum just existing and killing off our planet and just being so heinous. I myself am no exception. That is why my 2nd sentence is what it is. I live in an ugly city in a trap (with my family bc I canâ€™t keep a job and have my own house) my last relationship before my most recent gf , I probably made him feel like shit bc we moved in together after only like 3 months dating and then I realismzed the housewife role was too much for me and then I realized I think itâ€™s just bc I like girls but Iâ€™ve only been with one and I feel like crap bc I wasnâ€™t able to please her . I was born with a vagina  but Iâ€™m not really a masturbator and sheâ€™s honestly great and I feel like shit I put her what I have . Iâ€™ve tried changing my ways positive thinking / manifesting / etc but Iâ€™ve gotten to such a low point. Yesterday I was at the train tracks and I felt it . It took a lot to not jump in front of it I still think maybe I should have . But the drivers face looked concerned.. idk it made me think and I know suicide is selfish blahblah. BUT EVERYONE AROUND ME IS SELFISH. They talk to me so shitty sometimes and Iâ€™m all for quality over quantity but I literally have one friend .. the world wonâ€™t miss me much .
