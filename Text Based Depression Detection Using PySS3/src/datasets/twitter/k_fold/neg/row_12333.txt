I have no hobbies, nothing is enjoyable, my goals are lofty, I'm not going anywhereTitle pretty much.

I've had a worthless degree for 2 years and have been working for minimum wage for 6. Everything I've applied myself to, I've been "not good enough". I've never had good luck that benefited me, in fact I am convinced I am just somehow unluckier than other people (sounds retarded, I know, I know). I get no satisfaction out of my life, don't look forward to anything, everything has just been one disappointment after another - my 3 year relationship no exception - and I've made no advances since I ended high school. The fact that so many people have it worse than me and I sound like a spoiled kid makes me feel even worse about it. 

I've wanted to kill myself for about 5 years now. I've reached for help before but the 3 psychologists I had didn't care about me and just made money off me via commission. I have no friends, my family can't help me, and my girlfriend makes me want to die even more. I can't go back to seek help again because I have no health insurance and I'm not interested in paying out of pocket. And I just know that no one cares about my problems, the psychologists and pharmacists only care about milking me for their useless drugs.

I'm inching closer and closer to killing myself after each let down, each day that I waste. I'm fucking sick of life, I don't believe in religion or god so I don't look forward to some magical afterlife, and there's nothing to look forward to in life. In the meantime I'll debate what I can buy with $3k and go out with a bang, or if I should give it to my girlfriend so she has an easier time going forward.
