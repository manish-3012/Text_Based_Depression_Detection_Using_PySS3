I don't want to grow up.As if things couldn't get any worse, I had to turn 18 this year. I never wanted to get older, because I haven't been mentally stable in years, and I've never felt responsible enough to handle adult life. Things went from casually struggling in high school to having multiple unwanted responsibilities stacked on top of me simultaneously. I'm not ready for college, I couldn't even get into any. I'm not ready for a job, I've never had one before, and I don't know how I'd pay my taxes. I don't want to vote and be held accountable for how the country turns out afterwards. But if I don't do any of these things, I'll be a failure. I'm trying to get my shit together, but it hasn't been going well. I don't even have a lisence. I'd rather die than live knowing that I'm a burden and a failure. I'm just not strong enough to live in this world. It doesn't help that my severe anxiety cripples me to a point where I can't even walk my dogs outside by myself without getting nervous. I thought that things might get better after high school, but they didn't, and they probably never will. I'm such a fuck-up.
