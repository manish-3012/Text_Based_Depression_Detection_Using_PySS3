Idk fuck lifeI'm not smart at all. Not attractive , depression , ocd , anxiety and crippling social anxiety for 10 + years. Im an extreme loner and too depressed to make any connections with people. I have no passions and have to painfully force myself to do anything. I have to raw dog life because alcohol isnt pleasurable to me , Weed isnt , Magic Mushrooms just gives me pyschosis / paranoia / anxiety at this point. 

Man made medication is poison to me. Therapy might help anxiety a little but I dont go it's too expensive and tough to find a good one. I been unemployed for over a year. I am fucking useless. I just wanna die and be gone forever. All jobs suck. Why go to college if I can't hold down a job. Ineliglbe for military. I already failed with killing myself so fuck. Fuck life
