I couldn't do itI tried hanging myself. I backed just before I lost enough strength to move myself. The feeling of not being able to breathe is terrifying. I don't know what to do now, I thought I could end everything today but now I don't know what to do. I don't have any more methods and I don't want to live anymore. I can't continue like this I don't know what to do anymore.
