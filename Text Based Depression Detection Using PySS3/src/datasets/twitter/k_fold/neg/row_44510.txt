A few last wordsI feel like I've been at this low several times before but it feels different this time around. I've had a personal change of plans and don't feel like going onto the career path I selected for myself. I've tried to open myself up and make new friends. I am head over heels with this girl but I don't think it could ever work out. My anxiety has gotten worse and I feel really trapped and empty. I find no pleasure in anything any more.

I have come to realize something. Everybody sugarcoats their reality. 
We aren't free although we pretend to be. We are all just running around with our pitiful lives until our random, inevitable end. I don't want to live like that. I don't want to believe that the direction of my life is out of my control. This definitely wasn't an easy decision for me. I was in tears last night deciding when to leave a voice mail for the aforementioned friend.

The plan was to commit at 9pm pacific time so although I know this is against subreddit rules, but if somebody could provide some methodology as to how to kill oneself, it would be greatly appreciated. My mind won't be changed and it would prevent any possible mistakes in the process.
