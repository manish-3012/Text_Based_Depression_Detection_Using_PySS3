I guess itâ€™s all coming back nowI was happy for a few days. It was nice to feel something other than sadness, anger or just plain boredom for a change. Last night I had a really bad breakdown again and today I can feel that something is off again. The struggle to enjoy stuff and the overthinking are coming back now. Thatâ€™s alright. I guess I can never really escape this haha.
