Not here to kill myself but if you are and want to talk so do i.First off I hope I'm not breaking any of the rules here but I just wanted to say if any of you people are here and your sad which is most likely the case and want to talk somebody I can be that somebody.
 Ive felt what you're feeling I don't know everybodys story or exactly how they feel but I know what it feels like to want to kill yourself and hopefully I can explain to you what it feels like to have the satisfaction of not doing it.
 anyway a short bio
I'm a 24 year old white guy from California I'll put a picture if requested; some people do like to know who they're talking to.
Sorry I'm not the hot chick of your dreams that's going to fix you but I can be the mediocre guy that would love to help
 and basically if anybody  just wants to chat and somebody to talk to feel free to write 
I don't know if anyone will even respond .
For the people that do I'll probably only be able to get to the first two or three since I'm on my phone 
but I'll try my best. comment or message me.
 We can talk about anything from the way you're feeling to Jimi hendrix learning Sargent peppers in 5 minutes, two days after the album was released because he heard Paul and John were in the audience.
Whatever you want to talk about I'm your man. hit me up =)
PS an ode to my old post, let's not get suicidey in here.
