(Seeking support) I'm a chronically-Ill, broken mess of a person inching towards death, reaching out againFirst, I apologize for the number of times I've posted here.  I've had brief interactions with some great people, but am yet seeking to connect with anyone who can relate, or otherwise wishes to talk with me.  The loneliness component to all this, I suppose, means I'm looking for something that'll 'stick,'  inject some hope back into my daily life.

Regardless, I'm feeling very self-conscious about my efforts to reach out, so won't continue to do so before too long.  Most of what follows is copied from my most recent post on another forum.  

The short of it is, I've been feeling very, *very* stuck lately.  And I feel as though I'm being backed into a corner, out of which the only way is death.  And I'm unsure how to handle that.  

Thoughts of suicide are pretty much inevitable in a long-term illness, I'm sure.. but lately they are loud and making more sense than ever.  

A more-detailed rundown (largely borrowed from my other posts, long read, please bear with me):  

* I've been chronically-ill for 30 years.  
* I live with family, have never lived independently. I still very much feel like the teenager I was when I got sick, except.. older.  That alone makes me a social pariah.  
* I never experienced "real" life beyond my teens, except vicariously through others before they disappeared from my life.  
* I have no higher learning, no marketable skills and am physically not reasonably-employable.  
* I'm a financial burden on my family, and will likely remain so until I'm dead.  
* My illness has taken several bounding leaps for the worse in the last decade, especially in the last couple of years, mostly induced by circumstance.. but it has left me far less capable of distracting myself successfully with long-established "light hobbies" that could fill my time.  
- I am soul-rendingly lonely.  I have only a **small** handful of friends upon which I don't want to keep piling my problems or dismal outlook.  I get the sense that my place in their lives continues to shrink.  
- I have no realistic romantic prospects or hopes. This one bores particularly deep. Not that I would want to use anyone for purely validatory purposes, not at all... but it feels like I'm built or programmed to need to share my life with someone. It's especially cruel, that, given my circumstances.    
* Life has been taking things from me at an increasing pace and nothing is returning to fill the voids. While I get that can be true of anyone anywhere, I am especially powerless to actively fight this or otherwise counteract it.  
* Years of illness and dependence (primarily financial) on others for the bigger things in life have fostered in me nearly zero appreciable ego, mountains of anxiety and uncertainty, and a self-image that may as well not even exist, it's so terrible.  
* If I could wave a magic wand and cure myself completely right this second.. I would STILL be an impossible mess to fix with far too many years behind me to salvage anything even close to what I want out of life.  

The longer part:  

It hurts me, daily, to see life passing before me, life going on around me.. and me being more and more a fixture in my home, a kind of family pet.  Absolutely nothing to look forward to.  I have interests I can't pursue.  I have needs I can't meet, desires I can't even begin to fulfill.  I spend every day feeling as though I'm not enough for this life, not enough for another person, not enough for even myself.  Just.. not enough.  Not nearly enough.  

When my last parent is gone, my 'care' will pass to my siblings (whatever unlucky one(s) draw the short stick, I guess).. and the cycle will continue as the family shrinks.  

Gone are my dreams of having a career, a spouse & kids, home of my own, building or continuing a legacy.  Living a quiet, modest life with someone I love.  Instead I'll be nothing but a footnote on the family tree.  

I am tired of feeling like a burden.  Tired of feeling like I can't begin to measure up to ANY standard society has in place for nearly anything.  I have little-to-no social 'worth' and definitely no financial worth.  I am an anchor, a disappointment, a dreary-reminder of what I could've been.. but am not.  I have been rejected, mocked, ignored, put aside, forgotten, all because of my illness and what it's made of me and my "life."  

The irony in all this (if I'm even using irony correctly here..) is that I KNOW I'm a great fucking person.  I'm smart, I have interests, I have empathy, patience.. I have a lot of things I could list.  But none of those things matter because "Oh, you still live at home?" or "You have no income?" or even worse, "Sick?  Eww...." .. well.. whatever.  I'm sure you get the idea.  No one will care about me purely because of the companionship I can bring to the table.  

Just from a strictly practical standpoint, I don't see the value in my continuing to live.  I don't mean that to sound glib in any way.  Because there's plenty *I* value about life, people and the world.. but nearly all of it is walled off from me.  There's only so much window-shopping I can do before it's time to move on.  I am landlocked and watching everyone fly.  

I feel as though true hope has been removed from my equation and I've been gasping for air ever since, it finally dawning on me that maybe I only have one path forward now, and it's, well.. death.  A life without hope, without love, without *something* I've earned or created in my life that's greater than the literal me that sits in this chair... is just not worth living, pushing through all the pain and misery.  I feel designed to need a partner in life - can't have that.  I feel the need to create and indulge in creative pursuits - nope, can't.  

And on the rare occasion when life has decided to allow me a glimpse?  It's yanked away.  Sometimes to destructive effect.  

Let me be clear:  **I don't want to die.**  Paradoxically, the very idea scares me.  The concept of ending my own life, finding a method to do so, etc. unnerves me and I'm not even sure I could go through with it.  But I can't keep living like this anymore.  *I just fucking CAN'T.*  The senseless suffering is too much, the loneliness is too much, the fractured, stitched-together nature of my very soul is too much.  I don't know how much longer I can continue like this, but I do know the timer is fast shrinking and my reluctance towards ending things myself is diminishing.  

Thank you so much for reading this mess, and please forgive the length, and the semi-reposted nature.  

I'm not even sure what I'm looking for by posting this again, beyond .. I don't know, being heard, companionship.. something.  I don't want pity, and I don't want to waste anyone's time.  Any comments, questions, thoughts, PMs, are welcome at this point.
