Thrilled about committing suicide tonightIâ€™ve been counting down the clock. 

Iâ€™ve cut out a large perece of ceramic wrap that wraps around to the back of my skull. This is followed by two separate cuts that are applied to the facial area. This will limit my breathing. 

I wonâ€™t stop there. I then will take a combination of Xanax, Klonopin, and a sleeping pill to ease the process. 

Once I do that I will take out a small garbage bag and wrap it tightly around my head securely taped to secure no gaps beneath my mouth. 

I then will lay in bed with a belt wrapped around my neck with something holding it down so I begin losing breath while laying peacefully in bed without the fight or flight response that is taken care of with the benzodiazepines. 

I am so grateful I have the privilege to die peacefully. And for all of you reading... I hope good things come your way. I donâ€™t know you but I do know that you deserve to be happy and loved and I hope you do good in life and never reach a point where youâ€™re at the point where I am.
