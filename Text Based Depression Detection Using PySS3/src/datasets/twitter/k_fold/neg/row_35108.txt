Why fucking bother anymore?Iâ€™m just done with everything. Iâ€™m 24 years old and training to be a teacher and above all else, Iâ€™m struggling with depression and anxiety every day. Every day I have to deal with shitty little kids who have no respect for me, be told my lessons are not up to standard no matter how long I stayed up for to plan it and put it together and deal with the fear of failing. Iâ€™ve already had 6 months off due to mental illness and came back, but this is not what I want to do as a career. I also have problems at home to deal with and constantly fearing about money and what Iâ€™m going to do once I finish my training, whether I pass or fail. I always tell myself Iâ€™m a dead man walking and that suicide is the only way out. Iâ€™ve watched videos and perfected my technique in tying a noose and have even been to the hardware store to look for the right rope to do the job. I have even considered booking a flight to San Francisco to go to the Golden Gate Bridge to end my life. Iâ€™ve watched many videos of suicide clips and live-streams to indulge my suicidal fantasies. Iâ€™m on medication for these problems but they only do so much. Every time I hear people jokingly talk of killing themselves and laughing about the subject of suicide, I wish I had a gun on me to blow my head off and teach them a lesson. Iâ€™m not asking for pity or advice, I just want whoever reads this to know that I might not live for much longer and may not see 25. Lifeâ€™s just too fucking hard and I donâ€™t want to do it anymore.
