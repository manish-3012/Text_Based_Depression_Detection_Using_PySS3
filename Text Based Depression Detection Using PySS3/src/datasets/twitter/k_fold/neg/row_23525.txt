Shameful revelation that I probably donâ€™t want to dieSo basically Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of inner work recently and honestly things have started to turn around. I come from a reasonable family with a reasonable back story honestly nothing big. 

The thing is anytime I see anything that reminds me of the possibility of suicide or self harm it just becomes an overvalued idea that I canâ€™t get rid of. Iâ€™m also ashamed to realise that I probably donâ€™t want to die, but just really want to take a good long sleep in the icu and wake up to find everything magically sorted out for me. This shame is honesty getting quite overwhelming and i was just wondering if anyone has any advice at all regarding the shame and this probably romanticized idea of suicide?
