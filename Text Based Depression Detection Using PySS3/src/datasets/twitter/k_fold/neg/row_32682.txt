Goodbye, Dad.It has taken almost 2 years to fully come to fruition and understand that I will never see you again.

I miss the (albeit dark) laughs that got us into trouble. I miss the hours we'd spend chatting about everything and anything under the sun. I miss our coffee dates and walks by the beach. I miss watching wholesome baking shows with you. Heck, I even miss your long rants encompassing life lessons and nagging to wake up on time. 

We made a pact, that if one of us dies - we'll signal the other somehow in the afterlife. That signal never comes and my heart still aches thinking about this, knowing there's no coming back. 

Marriage and kids has never been up on my priority list. But knowing you'll never walk me down the isle, never meet my children and more immediately cannot celebrate life's biggest milestones weighs down heavily. 

I don't like to think back to the dark few months before you passed, but I do still wish I'd told you how much I loved you and appreciated everything you did for me more. That you deserved and needed to take a break from caring for everyone and to take that time out for yourself. You took on the role of a father better than a stepfather should. 

Please, reach out to family and friends if you need help. This has broken me far deeper than I thought possible. 2 years later and I've accepted his death, but I will never stop wondering why and the hurt has yet to fade.
