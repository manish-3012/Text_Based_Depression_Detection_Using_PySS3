That feelingI realized that I wanted to find somewhere semi- anonymous to post because I don't feel close enough to anyone in my life right now to tell them how much I'm hurting. I have people who probably care, at least on some level, but not enough to listen. Or they wouldn't believe it. "But you seem so much better" really means I'm better at hiding it. I know it will pass. But when I look at my life logically, I think suicide is just a shortcut to the inevitable for me. It's always felt like a question of when, not if.
