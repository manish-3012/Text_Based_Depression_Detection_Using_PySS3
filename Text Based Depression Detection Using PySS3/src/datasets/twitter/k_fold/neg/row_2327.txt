Why do people leave nice comments on peoples posts.If people have given a good enough reason to kill themselves (ie. Autism, terrible family situation, abuse) then why the fuck do some people stand up and say "Yo brother, its gonna be alright my dude :))))))). Just take a shower and be the best person u can be lmao". Its called Survivors Bias, its where your life is simple and easy and you come on here to make yourself feel better by commenting on peoples posts. Those people who have been born into a shit situation and unlike you, cannot just "Go outside bro" to fix their problems.
