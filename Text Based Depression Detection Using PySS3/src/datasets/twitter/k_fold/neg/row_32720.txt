I failed, but I want to try again.On June 7th I tried to commit suicide. I drank a bottle of hard liquor (I am a small woman.) 
And took all of my 100 MG antidepressants. 

I was unsuccessful. 

Itâ€™s now almost 3 weeks later and I want to try again. I donâ€™t want to hear why I shouldnâ€™t do it or â€œitâ€™s gonna get better.â€ Iâ€™m really sorry.
I want a painless solution. 

Whatâ€™s the easiest and painless way to commit suicide ? They have taken all my pills and I donâ€™t have fun access . 

Thanks .
