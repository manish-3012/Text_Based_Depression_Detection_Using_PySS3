Everyone thinks I'm happy.I'm always so happy go lucky. As soon as I'm alone I feel like I fall apart. I cry myself to sleep as soon as my boyfriend falls asleep.

I don't want more scars but I keep picturing forcing a knife between my wrist and twisting it until the bones unhinge. These thoughts come to me like waves. I'm usually so happy
