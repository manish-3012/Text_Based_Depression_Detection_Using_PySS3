Not thinking anymore just sounds so peacefulWhenever I get super worked up and anxious I just imagine myself in my car late at night in like the back of a big parking lot with my radio on. I take deep breaths and imagine myself putting a gun to my head and pulling the trigger. Then I just think about how calm the emptiness after that trigger pull would be. It helps calm me down. I wish my thoughts didnâ€™t picture myself dying as my â€œhappy placeâ€ but itâ€™s fine. I will hopefully never actually attempt anything so stupid
