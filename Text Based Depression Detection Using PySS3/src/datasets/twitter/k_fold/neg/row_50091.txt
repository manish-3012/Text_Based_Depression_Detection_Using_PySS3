How can I ever sustain myself being useless?Its a strange title, but describes how I am feeling and the reason why I am so depressed and with suicidal ideation. I am useless, worthless (or at least this is what my mind wants me to believe into) and probably a waste of time and space. OCD makes me paranoid now, as I obsess through everything and mainly about my future. Its strange because I am feeling more depressed than anxious about my future, looks like there is no light in the end of the tunnel. I just want to feel peace again, and stop feeling like a burden to everyone around me...
