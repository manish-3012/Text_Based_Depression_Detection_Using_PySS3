Help, pleaseIm only a senior in highschool and I know I have my whole life ahead of me, but it's getting too hard to take it. My dad is a drug addict who is for the most part out of my life but manages to claw his way in and all my mom and I do it argue about everything. I'm not on track to graduate while all of my friends are going off to ivy league schools.  No real friends left around, I have people that say they care but no matter what I say- they all leave when times get hard for me. I really don't want to go through with this, but I keep getting impulses every night.... please, any help
