Suicide must be beautiful.You put the gun barrel to your temple, it's a bit cold.  You hesitate for a while tears come to your eyes, then you click, heard loud POF! Intense pain for a less than a second - then nothing. Void.   


You would never suffer anymore. Never ever. You don't see all these evil pepole, you aren't lonely anymore. A bliss. 

Time will stop matter.  
No one will bother and pick on you anymore.

Peace that nothing ceases anymore. The end and the new beggining.
