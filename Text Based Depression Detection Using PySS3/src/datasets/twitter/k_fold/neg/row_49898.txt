Iâ€™m doing a little better now, but..I feel like my parents would just berate me if I told them about my problems. My dadâ€™s view of suicide when that topic came up was negative. My mom, she would just call me insane and stupid. Iâ€™m currently talking to someone about it so Iâ€™m not alone entirely, but I wish my parents would understand and support me and we could both understand how to work through this. I want to be the best daughter whoâ€™s confident and a rolemodel to my other youngest ones: the complete opposite of what I am. The situationâ€™s â€œfineâ€ as long as I never tell them, but itâ€™s really not on the inside.

just a vent.
