Selfishness?I understand it can be beautiful and that other people have it worse but.. I canâ€™t stand this anymore, I donâ€™t like anyone, I hate going out, all I do is work and sleep. Im treated like a sick animal by everyone because I tried to open up about it. Am I really that selfish To take my own life so that I donâ€™t have to be a plastic robot with an ego that every other person in this world seems to be?
