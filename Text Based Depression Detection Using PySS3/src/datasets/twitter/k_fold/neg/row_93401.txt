Life's A BitchI broke up with my ex of 5 years about 9 months ago.  After the breakup I stopped living and was just existing.  Wake up, go to work, get home, get wasted, and repeat.  I started wondering why bother if I'm just moving from one binge to another what's the point?  I came to the conclusion that eventually I will go full out *Leaving Las Vegas*, and then my problems would be solved.

About a month ago I finally decided to pull my head out of my ass, and start living my life again.  I cut back on the drinking, started to see my friends and family again, and just improving myself in general.  

After a week of getting things back on track my ex sent me a drunken text.  Nothing spiteful or regretful, but it started a conversation between us.  We spent a few weeks texting which gave me hope that we could work things out.  In the end it didn't work so back in the bottle I went.  This time things were worse the drinking wasn't "doing the job" quick enough. One night I almost put it to an end.  I had it all planned out.  I knew since it was Friday that my old roommate would be out parting, so I was going to drop my dogs off at his house, then drive out to a secluded place and eat a bullet.  I don't remember what stopped me, but something did.  I've thought about it a few times since, but never followed through. 

Last week I decided to get my shit together again.  I made it a whole 5 days without drinking, started exercising, and focusing more on work.  I got blind drunk last night for no real reason, and now I've been hungover and depressed all day.  I keep wondering how it's going to end.  Will it be in a puddle of puke like Jimmy Hendrix?  Will it be slow and drawn out like *Leaving Las Vegas*? Or, will I just say fuck it and eat a bullet one of these nights?

I'm not really sure why I'm posting.  I'm not looking for help or advice.  Just trying to get it out there maybe?
