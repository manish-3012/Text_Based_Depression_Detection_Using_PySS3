"I'M SORRY MY MENTAL ILLNESS OFFENDED YOU"I can't fucking manage what my mom just said to me. She got offended with the fact that I both hate and fear my step-dad out of anxiety. She told me "Step-dad loves you and you shouldn't be afraid of him. We need to be a loving family" When I continued to refuse to eat out of fear towards being in the presence of my step-dad, she got SUPER OFFENDED BY MY ANXIETY. She legit started crying and said "We can't live like this for another 6 years. We need to change" I couldn't help but think *I shouldn't be here, that's what.* I thought I trusted my own mother, but apparently she thinks my opinions and emotions are nothing like my father
