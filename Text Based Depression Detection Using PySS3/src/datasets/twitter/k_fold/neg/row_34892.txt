I am tiredMy wife of 8 years left me right around xmiss 2017. Her and our  two kids now have a happy home with her new boyfriend. They all have the life that they needed for a long time. I have Dysthymia, BPD, and an anxiety disorder. These things pushed my family away but my family was the only thing that kept me grounded and now with out them I have nothing to keep me grounded.  I am so tired of going in and out of in patient mental health care. Tired of meds that numb everything for a few hours. But feels like it is just a pause button on how I really am. My happy times are getting smaller and smaller. I have tried to get back out there, I have read so many books about be happy with your self. But I am just not. Each and every day I think about each time I tried to kill my self and how I went wrong. Each time escalated and tried something new. I go to work come home and go to bed. I try to make friends I try to go out I feel like I have tried all the things people say to do. Everyone says â€œit will take timeâ€ and I have tired but each day I get more and more tired. Each day I give up a lil bit more. I was told two weeks ago that I will have to pay more in child support. I am going to lose my apt then my car and then my job. 

I am so tired. I go to bed each night. Trying to go to sleep and if I can I always home to not wake up. 

I donâ€™t even know why I am typing this here. 

Maybe this is my last attempt to scream out for real help. For answers or help I have not heard. 

Idk
