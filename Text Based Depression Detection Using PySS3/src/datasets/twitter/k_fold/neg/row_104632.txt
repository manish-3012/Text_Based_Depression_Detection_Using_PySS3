I just want to end it right now, the pain is just too much to handle!I have never felt so suicidal like Iâ€™ve done these past few weeks. My life has been so painful. Ever since school started things quickly went downhill. My anxiety came back in full force and my depression is making me feel extremely numb all the time. 

I have talked to a bunch of people I trust here on Reddit and it has definitely helped, Iâ€™m thankful for that, but Itâ€™s not working anymore. 

Combine all this with my parents who are extremely unsupportive and you get the point. My parents blame it on Reddit and are being very mean to me just because Iâ€™m not the happy kid they used to know four god damn years ago.

I want to die so badly!
