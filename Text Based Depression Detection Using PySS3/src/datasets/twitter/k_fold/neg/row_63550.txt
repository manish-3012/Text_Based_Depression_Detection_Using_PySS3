One of those nights.ok this is pretty common for me, in the day time my depression isn't too bad, but at night it becomes unbearable. Every night i sit in my room in the corner of my bed, leaning against the wall hugging my legs to my chest just crying uncontrollably and feeling so empty. It feels like there is no heart in my chest, no organs in my body, no soul inside me. I feel empty and lost and unwanted and useless and i don't know what to do. All i do is cry for hours and hours, and if i'm lucky i will fall asleep crying, but most of the time, i just get so upset that i start shaking and end up cutting or burning my arms just to feel something, anything, other than emptiness. I don't know how to deal with it. I just need to know that it's normal. Is there a way to feel whole again?
