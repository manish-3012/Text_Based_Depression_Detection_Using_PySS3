The difference between usI wasnâ€™t wired like you guys. As a kid I had no self awareness, did whatever I wanted, my parent probably thought I was dumb. Growing up until around I was 12 I was one of the more â€˜outcastâ€™ people, I wasnâ€™t a normal kid. I knew I was weird but I just let it be.

Going into high school I became very self conscious, did everything to blend in, but didnâ€™t see the logic behind any of it. I got into relationships without even having feelings, let alone romantic ones, and became a somewhat normal kid. Iâ€™ve been told by several people that I just copy others personalities. At one point I was almost bullying a kid, just because itâ€™s what was common and normal.

I donâ€™t see things emotionally. Through a string of events, a school councilor found out about a suicide attempt I had, and they essentially got mad at me, like this mess Iâ€™m in was my fault. Theyâ€™re just paid to act. I donâ€™t believe that some random person on the internet knows me enough to know that itâ€™s worth living. I donâ€™t care if they think all life is worth it.

Not sure what the purpose of this post is, really just organizing my thoughts to myself. Have a good day.
