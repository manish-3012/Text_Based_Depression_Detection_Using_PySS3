The signs to look out forWhere I am, it's nearly the end of 10th September, World Suicide Prevention Day. So, I just wanted to say, to anybody who's struggling with thoughts of suicide, or with a loved ones suicide or attempted suicide; you're not alone. Here are some things to look out for in yourself and others to determine suicidal behaviour and thoughts:

**Actual attempts or serious thoughts:** I have thought about suicide a lot in my past, and have two serious attempts to my name. I say serious because I have overdosed and done other stupid things many more times, with the thought of dying not scaring me. If you or somebody you know are known to have attempted suicide or talked about it in the past, they are statistically more likely to try (or try again, if you/they have before), so stay vigilant and don't be afraid to ask them if they're thinking of suicide.

**Risk-Taking behaviour:** Someone thinking about taking their life might actively seek death by taking risks that could harm them, without them doing it themselves. I've taken part in risk-taking behaviour, such as running into a knife fight to try and stop it. Ironically, I did actually stop it and the two parties involved walked away from each-other. That was the second time I've purposely gotten into a fight. I know it's sometimes seen as 'heroic' when one does that, but for me it was a matter of seeing something risky and going headfirst into it. Of course, I'm empathetic too and I really don't like people getting hurt, if it's not me. If you or someone is taking too many risks, it can be a serious sign that they aren't caring for their life.

**Increased drug use:** Drug use is often seen in people with suicidal thoughts. They may have been prescribed medication for a mental health problem or may seek medication for what comes with mental health problems such as insomnia. It's often part of risk-taking, and they may like the 'high' it gives them, getting them out of depression temporarily. For me simply being relieved of anxiety was amazing, then it turned into a habit. That happened with almost any drug I tried thereafter- I liked the temporary high, the buzz, the confidence boosts. It turned me into a different person however, and the more I took drugs the more I pushed away my friends, family, and sanity. In the end, I was more depressed because of lack of money and the toll it took on my life, which gave me more suicidal thoughts. Drug use should be looked out for, and if somebody is addicted, they may have suicidal thoughts; as well as somebody with suicidal thoughts may become addicted. 

**Giving away personal items or saying personal things:** A serious sign to look out for is if somebody offers you their prized possessions, or money. They may be getting rid of their personal affects ready for taking their life. They may say words or phrases that don't seem right and could indicate their thoughts. Things like "I love you, you know that." or "I'll never forget everything you've done for me", in random moments may be worrying signs they are thinking of it. If you get random texts or messages where somebody may be apologising for something or telling you their affection for you; ask if they're okay and if you can call them. Better still- if you can see them. Watch out for them tidying away their stuff or making any secret notes or letters. Will-writing when they're still young, or thinking/talking about their wishes for their funeral or after death. When I was actively suicidal I wrote my note on word and stuck it on a memory stick, which I had ready on my desk along with a folder with some personal notes in and my birth certificate, national insurance, bank details etc. so it would be easier on my family. I also packed up a lot of things in my room and even after the failure, I kept things packed knowing I'd likely try again because it is what I wanted. Watch out for any of that. 

**These are just the most worrying signs,** people thinking of suicide may also talk about it a lot, or completely ignore the topic even if it's brought up. They may have casual feelings toward death like they're not worried by it, which can indicate a certain lust for it- but not always. **They might have a drastic change in behaviour, perhaps they were once optimistic and happy people, but seem 'darker'.** There might be something going on in their lives so never assume somebody is immune to depression or suicidal thoughts. **Extreme calmness is another, big thing to look out for.** Where someone may have been deeply depressed or always talking about ending things or not seeing a way out, they may now be calm and seemingly happy out of nowhere. This is very common when somebody has chosen to end their life, because they feel like everything is temporary. I became very calm and very giddy when I thought my life was to end soon, because I knew I was untouchable and anything that happened would be nothing, very soon. I actually became confident and wanted to see my friends and talk to my family, everything was sorted and I had nothing to worry about.

**Lastly,** if somebody is sleeping a lot more, or a lot less than usual, they may be depressed. This goes for somebody who has a sudden loss of appetite and doesn't seem to want or enjoy food. Or they might be hungry and binge on food. Depression can come in many forms so if you suspect anybody is depressed please reach out. It might not always mean suicidal thoughts but people with depression are more susceptible to them, so if you know somebody with this or other mental illnesses, look out for them and these signs. 

**Stay safe, stay strong, stay here.**
