I keep feeling this overwhelming urge to kill myselfI really donâ€™t want to die. I donâ€™t want to hurt the people I love. I donâ€™t want to go through the pain of suicide. 

But somehow I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself. I canâ€™t stop thinking about how easy it would be if I werenâ€™t here anymore. No longer having to deal with my obsessive thoughts, my emotional issues, my life problems. In the matter of seconds, it could all disappear and I could cease to exist. It sounds so easy.. I wish I could go through with it. 

I feel unlovable, unappreciated, unwanted. I know my family may love me but I canâ€™t shake the thought of what it would be like to disappear forever.
