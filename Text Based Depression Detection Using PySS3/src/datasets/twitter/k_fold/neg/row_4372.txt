My life is being chipped awayEveryday I feel pain and when I tell people I need help they just use situations that Iâ€™m â€œhappyâ€ but Iâ€™m never happy Iâ€™m just putting on a happy face and I know Iâ€™m a terrible person and it doesnâ€™t help that people say Iâ€™m an â€œangelâ€ i just need somewhere where I can be painless somewhere I donâ€™t get bullied punched or being replaced! My entire life I have been someone who Iâ€™m not I thought about suicide in year three but then again I was just â€œsensitive â€œ and when I just spontaneously start crying that is because my â€œeyes hurtâ€ but itâ€™s not I just want to be free free of all this pain . How am I smart when I fail everything ! Like Jesus Christ the sports team give me the wrong medal making me last and apparently Iâ€™m lying ! Why do I even bother with life I jumped of my window ledge and I finally felt free but how am I supposed to say that ? Hi mum I like jumping of buildings ! Like seriously why am I bothering on life 

TL:DR: I want to die
