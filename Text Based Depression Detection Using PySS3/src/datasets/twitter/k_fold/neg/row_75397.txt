I don't want to do it.I haven't had suicidal thoughts like this in a few years. I had a gun in my mouth friday night.   It's been really bad over the past week or so, escalating severely a few days ago.

I have great friends, but I struggle horribly with my romantic life.    I've strongly considered chemical castration in the past as I would rather not feel sexual feelings anymore as I know it is hopeless for me, but the drugs are difficult to come by.  What am I supposed to do at this point?  See another therapist that'll tell me that I'm not depressed anymore and I don't need to seek further treatment?  I'd rather just not exist anymore.
