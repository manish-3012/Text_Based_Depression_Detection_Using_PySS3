A creature and a bottleWell...another night, me and the bottle, not good, not terrible either.

That has been my life for the past 6 years, I sacrificed a lot for nothing. I really didn't think I'll make it to my current age, now I am lost, in pain and considering a permanent solution. The last time I've felt genuinely happy was 2 years ago, now...like any other night, alcohol is my companion.
