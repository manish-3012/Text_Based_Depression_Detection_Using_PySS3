I'm having very serious thoughts of ending my own life in the next couple of days. Part of me doesn't want to. There's just a lot weighing on my chest now, and I don't know if I'm strong enough to handle it.I have no job. I'm a raging alcoholic, I'm living with a friend in PA because there's a warrant for my arrest in my home state NJ, I dropped out of school in May, and I have just had such little will to live for the past month. The only reason I'm even considering staying alive is thinking about what my suicide would do to my girlfriend, and how she would react. I don't want to deny her the life that she wants to have with me, but at the same time there seems to be little to no hope for me, and I feel like I'd be doing her a favor by not having so much faith in a pathetic piece of garbage like me.
