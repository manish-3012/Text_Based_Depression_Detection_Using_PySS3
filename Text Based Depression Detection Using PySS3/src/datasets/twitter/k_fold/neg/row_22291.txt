Hormonal depression kicking my assIâ€™m really struggling with some pretty tough depression, and I think itâ€™s related to my hormone replacement therapy. Depression and suicidal ideation are known side effects of the meds Iâ€™m taking for my Panhypopituitarism, so Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s the cause. I canâ€™t stop taking these medications because they are literally keeping my body functioning. Without them, I could die. I feel so defeated, and I explained this to my endocrinologist. She took note of it, but sheâ€™s didnâ€™t say anything about it. I hate how this feels, and I want to feel better, but I donâ€™t know if there is anything I can do. I went to see a therapist once, and they didnâ€™t really help. I donâ€™t think they really understand the chemical imbalances Iâ€™m dealing with. All I got from them was a â€œchin upâ€ and a pat on the the back. I need help dealing with these side effects. What can I do?
