I hope everyone here has a wonderful day today!I just wanted to say that I hope everyone here has a wonderful day today. Remember that no matter hoe low you feel or how hard it all seems that there was a time when things weren't as bad. Things can always get better. I've been noticing a lot of posts on here lately that are a little disconcerting. A lot of people have resigned to the fact that psychologically or philosophically their existence doesn't matter. However I want to remind you that you affect a lot more people than you realize. You may have even given hope to people in a way you may not have known. If I see you on the street today, I'll make sure to smile. Hopefully it'll make your day brighter. This reddit has helped me in so many ways. Reading all of your stories has given me the hope I need to persevere and to help others who've been in situations like mine. That being said,  have a wonderful morning (or evening depending where you live).
