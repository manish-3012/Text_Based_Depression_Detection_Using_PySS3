No raison d'ÃªtreYep I'm fucked. I'm not normal enough to live in a deceptive, manifold faced society. I am not normal enough to have friends, or to talk about things I enjoy with everyone. I am not normal enough to go every day to the same fucking job doing the same fucking things, saying the same Hi to fucking everyone I don't really know. It is as if a baby is forced to live in this upside down world. I am simply tired of being tired, of having the illusion to fight for an illusion. What progress have I accomplished in my life ever? Growing some fucking extra hair chest and thats it basically... I want to end the wearing search of peace and happy life in this world. It only exists for those who are "mature" who knows how to put aside their childish nature, who knows how to be fake, who knows to sacrifice themselves for temporary happiness and possessions. Its too bad assisted suicide isn't cheap and available legally everywhere. But I bet more lifes would be saved than destroyed.
