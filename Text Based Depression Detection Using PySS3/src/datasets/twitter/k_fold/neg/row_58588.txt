I canâ€™t take this anymoreJust tried to drown in my bathtub. My boyfriend is upset. Angry that he couldnâ€™t be there to help me and angry that I tried to do it in the first place.

I know they all care for me, I just want to stop thinking the way I do. I want to end it. Iâ€™m supposed to see my boyfriend in May for the first time. Weâ€™re long distance.

I donâ€™t want to disappoint him, but I feel like a ticking time bomb.
