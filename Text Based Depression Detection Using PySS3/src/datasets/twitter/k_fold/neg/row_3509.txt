My friend just called me. I'm worried for him.My friend just called.  He sounded drunk and his sentences were very disjointed.  He was talking about how his end was soon.  How he had kids (new to me) and they would be able to have his stuff, but wouldn't have to deal with his anxiety.  He texted me a picture of a shot gun.  


Now this sounds bad, but my friend is also kind of a crass man, whose jokes can be sick and twisted.  He lives many states away from me so I cannot go to him.  He is a very prideful man who enjoys offending people.  He may not sound like a good person, but deep down he is a kind, loyal, brilliant person.


Apparently he has done this before with some of our mutual friends and the next day played it off like he was joking.


I was hoping someone could give me some ideas for how I could help him, or point me to some resources.  He is very likely to reject support due to his pride.


My plan is to call him tomorrow, when he is sober, and try to reason through things.

Please help.
