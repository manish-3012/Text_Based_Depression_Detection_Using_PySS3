Tonight is goodbyeIâ€™m doing it tonight. Iâ€™m buying the pills. As many as I can. I am going to swallow them. I cannot stand it. I donâ€™t feel sane or safe in my own mind. No one actually cares how I feel besides my mom. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, but i think living does more harm than good in my case anyway. I was watching a movie with my boyfriend and I wasnâ€™t watching it, instead I was crying. I donâ€™t think he noticed but I didnâ€™t want him to. Iâ€™m done speaking about suicide. Talking about it. Iâ€™m done being all talk. Itâ€™s time. Maybe this is my fate. Maybe Iâ€™m one of those people meant to commit suicide.

I just wanted to know
how to be happy

Or even if I couldnâ€™t be happy
I wanted to stop hurting everyone around me
Iâ€™m bad

Iâ€™m bad 

Iâ€™m numb
