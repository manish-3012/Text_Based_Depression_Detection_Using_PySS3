I feel so angry and jealousI read an article about a Thai hitman who killed people - many probably innocent who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. People like me - probably lonely virgins teenagers. Perhaps these guys wanted some influence in the world so they joined a Thai gang and regretted it immediately after, but still were killed, beheaded or shot mercilessly by rival gang hitmen like this guy. 

This guy was sentenced for 10 years but only served 3 because he took up Muy Thai fighting as part of a prison rehab program and was really successful. Now he's out - he's a Buddhist - he recalls the faces of the people he murdered and how they screamed to be spared. And he gets along. He has a beautiful girlfriend, he prays that he be forgiven for his mistakes. He *still* hurts people fighting in Muy Thai. His story was heard by millions on the New York Times. 

I never made any mistakes like killing innocent people. But I'm in prison in my bedroom. I'm still lonely to the point of suicide with no girlfriend, no dates, let alone a beautiful person who I love. I still pray because of family tradition. I'm not a journalist which is a dream career of mine nor am I to be found on any award-winning newspaper's front page.

Why does he get to commit the ultimate sin, repent, become just like me, and get along better than me? 


 â€œCould you ever imagine that such a bad person as me would have a chance to have a nice family one day,â€ Chalermpol said. I was never such a awful person not even a bad person but I still can't have a nice family.
