I'm about to commit suicideHello, so I've never made a post.

And this will be my first and last post.

Over the last 14 months I have truly and completely lost everything in my life that had any meaning.

In February, I went through a mental break and tried to hook up with another girl while I was in a relationship. 

It was the dumbest mistake I've ever made! 
And I can't believe I did it. 
Nothing happened but the fact still counts that I was willing to cheat on my girlfriend. 
The girl of my dreams that made every single day worth living.

We made it through for the last 8 months, but August a person post a Facebook status, which effectively ruined my life in every single way shape and form.
I was accused of sexual assault. 
With no merit. 
The police didn't even take the case. 
But the community I live in apsolutely murdered me, I can't leave my house without feeling scared. 
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I'm upto day 5 with literally 0 sleep. 
I've started to micronap. 

Over the last 2 weeks my now ex partner and I parted ways on good terms. 
But I couldn't stop calling her and we got sad every time. 
She called me manipulative and that's she's afraid of me. 

That was really the final straw for me. 
I've never hurt anyone in my life. 
And because I was crying and emotional and angry and sad all at the same time. 
She now won't take a single call. 

I've been on the phone to so many suicide hotlines and they still aren't even slightly deterring me. 
I truly believe that there is nothing left in my life to live for now. 

I got fired, every person I've cried for help with has simply said they'll see me tomorrow or just not answered there phone. 

I just can't do this anymore. 
My life is going no where. 
I have lost my will to live and I have tried so fucking hard to have just the smallest bit of will left but I don't. 

I wish I was stronger but I'm just not.
