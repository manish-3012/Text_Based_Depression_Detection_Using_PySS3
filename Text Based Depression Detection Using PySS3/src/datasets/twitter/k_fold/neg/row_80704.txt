Honestly donâ€™t think I can go on for much longerâ€¦I am fighting a losing battle constantly my life is is in a constant state of disorganization. And the worst part is I hate myself I hate the way I look, everything about myself really. I just wanna find true love but Iâ€™m gay so itâ€™s extra difficult, and I just get way to attached to worthless people. I really think I donâ€™t have much a use here on this earth.
