I've fucked up my life and can't do it anymoreThe only thing keeping me here is how much it would destroy everyone I love's lives. I hate myself to the fucking core. I thought I beat the odds of teen pregnancy but here I am in my early 20s with two kids with different fathers and I lost the love of my life because I fucking sabotage everything. I'm crazy and my brain is working against me every fucking second of every fucking day and the only thing I know how to do is hurt myself. I can't keep living like this, my parents act like everything's okay but I know they must be so disappointed in the life I've ended up with. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.
