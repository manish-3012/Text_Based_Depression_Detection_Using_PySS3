I've decided I'm going to do it tonight. Need someone to talk to.I have enough of this shit. I'm doing it tonight. There's no one that can talk me out of it. I'm so afraid for my family and what they will go through, so I'm going to cover everything in my note. I'm going to say I asked for forgiveness for my religious mother's sake. I'm going to apologize to my father for being such a waste of time and money. I don't know what I'll say to my brother and sister. I'm just so sorry. I'm sorry that I couldn't be better. I'm sorry that I couldn't be stronger. This is the liberation I need right now. People mean the best but all I can do is throw it back in their faces. I'm so sorry.
