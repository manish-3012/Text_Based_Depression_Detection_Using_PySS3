Purgatory of SortsI can't bring myself to actually take my own life, but I'm not able to commit to living either. I feel like a zombie.

I am doing just enough for the wheels of my life to keep turning. Well, that's debatable. I'm unemployed and about to run out of money. There is some hope that I will land a job soon. I am willing to work and continue living so as not to hurt others by my death. But I also resent these others that I am supposedly staying alive for. They can't help me, and they don't have to live with my crazy brain. Not that they don't have their own troubles. But that's the thing. We all have our problems. Why can't I just deal and move on?

I am feeling a great deal of self-hatred as well. I feel shitty, and I feel shitty ABOUT feeling shitty. How could I even contemplate suicide? And do I really care about not hurting others, or is it more that I fear death and what may lie after, if it turns out it's not oblivion?

Anyone else feel like they're living a half-life and wish they could make a decision and commit? Thanks for reading, if you got this far.
