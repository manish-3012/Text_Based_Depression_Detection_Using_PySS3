I don't want to liveI'm a 16-year-old boy from Sweden and I never really wanted to live. I've never seen any meaning in life, everything just feels like its been shit. School has been very difficult for me because I have ADHD and dyslexia so my work in school does not feel worthwhile, if I work my ass off with a task it doesn't feel like I accomplish anything because it doesn't do well. but recently when I tried to apply for a school I got in too the school but not the right program so I don't know if I should go to my dream school or try another school.
