I don't know how to enjoy life anymore.Since the last year, I've been looking forward to going overseas to attend an event in 2020. Been saving up for a bit for it, too. But now I've been putting off getting the plane tickets because every time I see the "purchase" button I just think, *It would be a waste to buy this now when I'm probably gonna die before I go*.

And the same thought circles around my brain every single time I think of something that usually would make me excited. It's like I can't do anything anymoreâ€”I either want to die or want to enjoy something but then remember that I want to die.

It sucks.
