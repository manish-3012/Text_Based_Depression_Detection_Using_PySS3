Iâ€™m not depressed, Iâ€™m not even sad honestly, I just want to dieItâ€™s weird not being sad and still thinking about dying. Iâ€™m not depressed Iâ€™m genuinely in a good point in my life. I just occasionally think whatâ€™s keeping me from pulling the trigger or tying a rope. Honestly if me dying benefited my friends and family Iâ€™d do it in a heartbeat, although since my death would kinda be detrimental Iâ€™ll live. Iâ€™ve written music to help deal with the thoughts. Itâ€™s just weird, I suppose Iâ€™ve finally gone insane. I saw a councilor, a therapist, Iâ€™ve been to a mental hospital. I guess itâ€™s all that time I spent not venting to anyone Iâ€™ve become numb from head to toe. Not a care in the world. Iâ€™m trying other things to find not meaning even fixing my diet, reading, going to it more, and hanging out with people. Still the thoughts remain, still I wanna just jump out a window.
