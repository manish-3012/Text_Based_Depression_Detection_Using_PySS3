Advantageous life and still want to die.I have a decent job for my age with a ton of money saved up from living with my parents rent free. Graduated high school with no issues. My family loves me and treats me right for the most part. I had a lot of friends but now due to isolation I donâ€™t really talk to anyone but a select few friends who I play video games with. Donâ€™t really care for a love life. Yet I still fantasize about dying every day. I donâ€™t see a purpose in life and a wave of loneliness and depression hits me almost nightly. Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where I donâ€™t even cry about anything anymore. I lost my grandma a year ago and we were very close but I hardly even think about her. iâ€™m ashamed to say it like that because I do miss her a lot along with other family members who have passed. Iâ€™m very empathetic half of the time and the other half iâ€™m an asshole. Very wishy-washy and overthink a lot of things. I just want to die.
