I want to jump off a bridge and dieI've had enough of this shit. I don't care about new years or the fact that I'm alone with no friends. I don't care about anything. I'm sick of trying. I don't care if anything gets better, I just don't want to be HERE. I hate my life. There's no joy. I have no future. I'm most probably going to overdose on pills in 2019. Fuck everything.
