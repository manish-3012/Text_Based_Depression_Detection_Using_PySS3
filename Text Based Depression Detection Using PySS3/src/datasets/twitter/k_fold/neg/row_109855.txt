Everything i mess upIt feels like my life is just spiralling downwards. I'm so weak and cry so easily. Perhaps life would be easier if I didn't feel anything at all. Had no emotions. Why do I even exist? How did it get so bad so fast? One day I'm on cloud nine, the next I'm suicidal. Why. The pain and anxiety I feel are so great that the thought of ever being happy terrifies me again, because I know that misery will soon follow.
