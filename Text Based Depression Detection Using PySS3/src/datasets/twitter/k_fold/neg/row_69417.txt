hurt myself in my confusioni don't know what to do.

there's a group of people downstairs. i left right after they came in. i can still hear them talking. i can't stand it. they aren't my friends.

i don't want to live in this house anymore. a year ago, i did. a year ago, i lived somewhere else i didn't want to live anymore. i thought i'd be happy here.

i like the people i live with, but they aren't my friends. i talk to them, as well as i can, but how long is it supposed to take?

can you make someone like you? if you can, what am i doing wrong? if you can't, what am i supposed to do?
i never know what to say. my head feels like a cloud and my chest feels like a cave. i'm not interesting. i'm not funny. then what am i?

i go outside my comfort zone. i talk to people every day, and it's anything but comfortable. when does it start being comfortable?

how did everybody get to be so automatic? i work so hard to form every word. is it like this for anyone else? does it get easier? it's only gotten harder.

i know i need help. i was getting help for a while. i felt good. but "you're not supposed to be medicated all your life."

how else am i supposed to feel good? if i didn't make progress then, how will it ever happen?

i need help. i need someone to help me.

i don't know how this works. i don't know who i am, and i don't know how to be anyone else. it really hurts.

i hate myself for all my self pity. it all goes in circles. i can't find my way out.
