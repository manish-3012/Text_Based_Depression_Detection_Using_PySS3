Prone to suicide. Not even depressed.Iâ€™m not even going to complain about the circumstances of my life. Yeah they suck. And yeah I know what it takes to change them, but I donâ€™t see It as being worth it anymore. I just turned 27 on Sunday. Iâ€™ve broken countless hearts over the years and accumulated immense amounts of guilt thus developing the most disgusting, self-hating image of myself. My daughter turns 5 on the 5th and given the fact that she doesnâ€™t even know me makes it that much easier. Once I buy the shotgun itâ€™s game over. Logging off. I donâ€™t encourage suicide in any way but if you truly feel itâ€™s best to end your life then by all means, go for it. No use in continuing to suffer, but if you have something to live for, something youâ€™re passionate about then keep going with that purpose in mind. Fuck what people think and say about you. Do what makes you happy. I wish you all the best. I get paid Friday. Weâ€™ll see what happens
