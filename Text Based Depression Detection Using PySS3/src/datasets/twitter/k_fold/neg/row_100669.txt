Cut myselfI know this sounds cliche but Iâ€™m in love with this girl 
But when I confessed my feelings she didnâ€™t feel the same way and I have been in depression my entire life and I thought she could save me and I never felt this way about anyone in forever Iâ€™m 19 btw but I guess Iâ€™m always gonna be alone, and thatâ€™s why I cut myself because I feel so empty without her and I tried to distract myself for months but nothing works.
