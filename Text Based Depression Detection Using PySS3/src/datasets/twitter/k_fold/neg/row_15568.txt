I feel like I don't have a purpose to live anymoreMy friends left me, my family doesn't acknowledge me. I tried finding new friends but they leave me after few days because I'm uninteresting (I don't have any interests/hobbies at all). My family just keeps on criticizing me on anything I do. I threw all the advices some people and friends gave me to cope me with this. I want to end my life but at the same time, I don't want to.
