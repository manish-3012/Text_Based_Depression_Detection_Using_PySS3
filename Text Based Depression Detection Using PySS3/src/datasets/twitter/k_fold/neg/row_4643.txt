The only way I'll be loved is if I die.My mom abuses me emotionally and occasionally physically (pretty much all my life) and I have no one else. Even though she hurts me, she's all I have and I want her to just love me. If I died, I think she would cry for me... I hope. Even when she found out I was cutting when she burst into my room, she only got mad at me. If I killed myself, I feel like the crying would be for attention and she would act like she loved me in front of other people, but it would be about me. I would matter for once. Even if she forgets about me soon after. I just want to know what it feels like to be loved by your family.
