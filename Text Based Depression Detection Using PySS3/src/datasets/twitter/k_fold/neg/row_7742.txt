PLEASE help meI made a post on here a couple of days ago, and wanted to give everyone a huge thank you for all their lovely comments and support.. basically my best friend committed suicide a few days ago. We were going to start a beautiful life together, finally take our four year friendship to the next level. As much as I appreciated the advice everyone gave me.. my feelings only seem to be getting worse. I can't sleep, I can't eat. I think about killing myself all the time so I can be with him. This pain is just so unbearable. I seriously think about cutting myself at least ten times a day. I'm in the process of trying to seek some professional help, but don't really have a whole lot of money right now. His funeral was today.. it was awful.. I really need some advice to help me cope with my greif or I'm pretty sure I will kill myself. I fantasize about it quite a lot. I do have his friends and they are supportive.. but this pain is so unbearable.
