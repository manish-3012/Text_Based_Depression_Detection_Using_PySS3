I'm a piece of shit and I should be dead.I'm such a piece of shit. All of my life I was mean to people. I took advantage of people and I just wasn't a good person. I have borderline personality disorder and I've been through trauma, but it is no excuse for how I treated people. I only have two friends, one is because she doesn't have any other friends and the other is because we've been friends for 26 years. If she met me today she wouldn't be my friend. I'm alone and I don't fit into society. Churches don't even want me. I'm trying to be a better person, but it is too late for me there is no hope for me. Even if I do change I still won't have any friends because I have a bad reputation. I'm sitting here looking at a bottle of tylenol and a little over a fifth of alcohol and I'm thinking that I should just take them and be done. It would be better for everyone else if I were gone. I'm fat and I just don't fit in. It really wouldn't matter to anyone if I killed myself, in fact they would say good riddance. I don't matter. I would just be a statistic and not a good one. There are a lot of good people that killed themselves, but it would just be better if I just did it. I should just kill myself so that I can get my karma. I almost died once because I had necrotizing fasciitis and I should've died. I know that I am blessed, I have everything that I need, but I don't deserve it. I don't matter. I'm just taking up space. I'm a psycho. I messed with a lot of good people and I can never take it back. It sucks being such a piece of shit. Nobody will miss me and they will be glad when I'm gone. What is the point of being alive anymore. I want to die and I have it better than a lot of other people and that makes me a bigger piece of shit. I'm deserving of death. Nobody cares if I were dead.
