My best friend killed herself 3 years ago.As a young teen i had stolen my dads car one day when my BFF texted that she was going to OD.  I drove to her house and just sat with her.... with a silent understanding that we will always be there for each other. This was typical for us, when one would fall the other would be there ready to pick up the pieces. Ptsd and bipolar is what connected us. We just.....understood each other.....

3 years ago we both were 18 and still trying to make sense of the pain within ourselves. I started using heavy drugs to numb myself a few months prior. While I was drugged up out of my mind, she was losing her battle that I had sworn to help fight with her.

Then one morning I get the news that she did it. Bullet to the head with a shot gun. We were supposed to be in this together. Supposed to save each other. I was to fucking high to be there when she needed it most. 

It's been 3 years. Im 21 now and have 2 daughters of my own. Im still close with my best friends family...my daughters sleep over with friends mom a lot. But I'm still struggling. We all are. Still dealing with all the God damn pain. Without her here i am so alone. Nobody understands me and there are days I just want to join her in eternal peace. I'm literally fucking sobbing right now......

I miss you so much girly....you always made dark days brighter. So smart, the most beautiful long blonde hair. Boys were head over heels soon as you entered a room. The entire world was smitten by you. Nobody saw that mask. Days that I feel like giving up I know i must push on. You'd beat my ass if I ever gave up. 

Rest in peace, you're forever 18.....
