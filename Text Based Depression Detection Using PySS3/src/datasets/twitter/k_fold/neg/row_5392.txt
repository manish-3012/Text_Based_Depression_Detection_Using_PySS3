documentingJust trying to document this. I don't know.

-Recurring, repeating thoughts of "i want to die" and "kill me" over and over in my head for months. six months plus. I say these things out loud when I'm alone. google says that this isn't intrusive thoughts any more but suicidal ideation. I am working on a bank reconciliation and thinking I want to die. I am feeding my cat and wanting to die. i am out with friends and want to die. I am driving home from work and want to die. I am making a property repair and want to die. I am beating my fiance at videogames and wanting to die. Always in the back of my mind, kill me kill me kill me kill me.

-I had a plan. I moved house and now my plan wouldn't work. I've tried not to make a new plan.

-No one I've tried to talk to has understood. I think my grandma deliberately misheard when I said I was depressed, and said "of course you're stressed". The lady on the suicide line was really dismissive ("why would you want to live in a country that deported you?"). My fiance knows a little and is worried but I don't want to hurt him by telling him everything. Doctor just wants me in and out of her office as fast as possible. Trying to take my meds every day but they're not enough any more. If I told my mom I would just have to support *her* feeling bad about it.

-Sleeping about 4-6 hours a night. Working 40 hours a week at my day job. 20 hours or so at my business. 10 hours on political stuff. Phone with fiance 6-10 hours. More successful than any of my friends. Want to die the whole time.

-showering 3-4 times a week. brushing my teeth maybe every other day. mostly eating free bagels from work, microwave meals, pre packaged smoothies/protein shakes. self care is getting hard.

-need to put the cat in a kennel beforehand so she doesn't eat my face, lol

-Constant skin picking. I have scabs on my face, neck, arms.

-Headaches

-it would be nice to be hit by a truck just a little bit
