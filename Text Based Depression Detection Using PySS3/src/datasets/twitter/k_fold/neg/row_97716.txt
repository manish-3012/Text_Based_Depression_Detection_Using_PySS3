I don't deserve a painless suicide. I deserve to hurt.Title pretty much sums it up. I'm a disgusting coward whose whole life has centered around avoiding pain and conflict. I always play things safe because I'm terrified of risk taking.

 I never invite people out or try to build friendships with acquaintances because I'm afraid of being shot down. I never go on social media because I can't handle the pain of seeing others have dynamic social lives. I dont exercise enough because of how much it hurts. 

Bottom line is I'm a fucking spineless pussy who will never get the body or social skills he wants. I have nothing to offer the world because ive run away from it for so long. I think I should kill myself in the most brutal way possible to make sure that I experience all of the pain that I was too weak to handle in life. 

I had a sheltered upbringing, no abuse or traumatic experiences, my parents pay for me to piss away my time at college so I dont even have financial stress. I have had a laughably easy life and yet I'm still overwhelmed and miserable. Realistically I should have died long ago. 

I'm 20 years old now, an adult child, and I think its too late to fundamentally change myself into a brave person who can go after what he wants. I fled from pain for my entire childhood, I want to experience true pain at least once before I die. Any ideas for a super painful method would be appreciated. Thanks.
