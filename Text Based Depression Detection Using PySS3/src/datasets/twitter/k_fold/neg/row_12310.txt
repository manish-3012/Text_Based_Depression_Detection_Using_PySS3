Considering suicide and not telling anyoneI'm talking with my boyfriend right now. I had waited quite a while for him to finish his football match, it's the most important one apparently ... Thought I could talk to him once it's over, about how I've been feeling, how I need help. But his team lost and he's really sad, and I somehow can't ... bring myself to tell him.

I don't know when will ever be a good time to tell him. It's sure to ruin his day, so I don't think I ever will reach out. Same for everybody else. I don't know how to do this alone
