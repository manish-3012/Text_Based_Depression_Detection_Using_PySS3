I can't take it anymoreI trusted my friend with everything. I hurt her without knowing it. Now she hates me and I'm trying to get over it. I just found out I'm kicked out of my friend group that includes this person and I also found out I make them uncomfortable. I'm devestated someone could be this cruel. I have nothing to live for. I want to walk out on the street and never wake up. The constant wailing and pain is unbearable.
