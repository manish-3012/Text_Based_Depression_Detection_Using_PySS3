I don't know.Thats all I can fucking say anymore. I'm pissing myself off, I can't imagine how he must feel. I sit here all goddamn day just wallowing in every little thing making me miserable, to the point where I feel like I have a very good, well articulated reason for what's upsetting me. I buck up the courage to say something but once I get started its all gone. I just turn into a crying mess of I don't knows. I don't know why I want nothing more than to just be out of my misery but I can't bring myself to do it. I don't know why I insist on being so worthless and self destructive. I don't know what the fucking point is anymore. I don't know why I'm even making this post.
