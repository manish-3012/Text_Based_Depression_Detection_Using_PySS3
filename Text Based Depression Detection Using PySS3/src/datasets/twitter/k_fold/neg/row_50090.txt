Doing it againI tried about two weeks ago. Gonna try again. Feel so fucking trapped in my life. I try to reach out for help and itâ€™s just not there. Wish I was stronger but I just donâ€™t have it anymore. Why does it get better for everyone else except me? Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s my fault somehow - it always is. I try to do better and it doesnâ€™t work out. I beg for Gods help and heâ€™s not there. Thereâ€™s just no way out.
