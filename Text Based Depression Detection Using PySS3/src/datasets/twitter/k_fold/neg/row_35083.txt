It feels like things are coming to an endI want to kill myself before 2020. That leaves me with about two weeks now.  
  
I'm not sure of the specifics yet, but I've begun doing some research. New Year's Eve seems like a nice time to do it... I do plenty of reflection and self-pitying on that day usually. Should help get me in the mood.  
  
A lot of things in my life seem like they are all going wrong at the same time. Almost like I was meant to do it now. I have no support for the rest of the year. Meds don't work. Home is stressful and I am more alone than ever... etc.  
  
I don't think I can go on much longer. I can't make myself enjoy anything anymore. Suicide feels... inevitable. It's like I have no choice in the matter. I am destined to kill myself.
