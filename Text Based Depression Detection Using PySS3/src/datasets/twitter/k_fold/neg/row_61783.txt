Spiraling againBetween my partner still not having a job, the IRS now threatening me because ignored them too long (it's only 300 but I don't have that), my mysterious ailments that I'm half convinced are all in my head, the arguing between my partner and me, and exhaustion, I'm just done.  Can I go crawl into the woods and die?  They'd all be better off without my "getting into a tizzy again."  Things like that being said to me tells me what they really think. 

If I'm nothing but unreasonable and irrational, why the hell do they need me?  They should all find someone better.
