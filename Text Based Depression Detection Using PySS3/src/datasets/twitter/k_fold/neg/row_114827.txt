I just want to say that you all have inspired meAs weird of a topic sentence that is, it remains true.  

Lately i've been slacking off in my classes and I ended up here on reddit and other various sites, doing none other than that. You see, I want to become a psychologist; I feel that I am meant to help people. I was reading these posts and it made me realize that I need to work harder. It reaffirmed everything, and made it "click" I suppose. I've been acting stupid, wasting my time when I should have been working trying to become a better me, so I could help everyone like you. I care for everyone that is experiencing these emotions because I personally went through them. 

I just want to help. 

So as weird as it may sound, thank you. Thanks for reaching out and trying to get help. Thank you for acknowledging that you have a problem that is worth fixing. Thank you for letting me see what is really important at this time in my life.  
I sincerely believe that life is worth living. If you ever need to talk and get something off your chest, you can always PM me.

You may not realize just how significant you are to the world, but you can affect anyone--you affected me.  

Best of Wishes,
K
