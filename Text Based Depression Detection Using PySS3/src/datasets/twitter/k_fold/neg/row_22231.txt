I sincerely wish to die but am too much of a coward to commit suicideI really donâ€™t enjoy life. 

Everyday fucking sucks and I really donâ€™t feel like doing this whole life thing anymore. Iâ€™m 22 and honestly feel Iâ€™ve lived long enough. If I didnâ€™t have my family I would jump out of the window, or just drown in some lake somewhere.

The only reason why I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is I donâ€™t want to make my family sad, so Iâ€™m pretty much left hoping I would get into a car accident or I would get run over by a bus.

Iâ€™m due to start university (again) in September and am not looking forward to it at all.

Real shit, if anybody here would be down to order my killing on deep web or some shit, I would give you the money for it, I have enough money saved up and could transfer the money ASAP.

Thanks for reading.
