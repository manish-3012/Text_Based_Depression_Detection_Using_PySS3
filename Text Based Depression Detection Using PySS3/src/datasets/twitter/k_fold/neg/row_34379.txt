Every nightEvery night I go on the balcony looking at the ground three floors below. I just want to dive head first and get rid of all the stress that I need to deal with everyday.

My girlfriend is so far away and thereâ€™s this girl here that stays with me some nights that just talks to me and sleeps. Thereâ€™s nothing left to keep me going. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m inevitably going to fail at some point and itâ€™ll push me over the edge.
