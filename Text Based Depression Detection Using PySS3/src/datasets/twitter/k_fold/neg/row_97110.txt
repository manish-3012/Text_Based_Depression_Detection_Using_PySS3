Terrified of becoming homeless. I want to die to avoid living on the streets.The long version is here: [You can read it if you'd like.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rcj39/i_19f_feel_like_cinderella_and_fear_being_homeless/)

The short version is that I moved in with my boyfriend a month ago because I was thrown out of my house, and I essentially became Cinderella. I do almost 100% of the house chores (that should be split between 5 people) and it's still not enough. I scrub the bathroom tile on my hands and knees with a toothbrush and nobody cares. My "stepdad in law" calls me lazy and says horrible things about me because I've been having trouble getting a job during the holidays. 

He's been jobless for over a year (he's in his 40s) and spends his time high on pills. He refuses to get a job. He attacked my boyfriend's mom last night for sticking up for me. He left last night, but he'll be back because he always is. She's the stereotypical abused woman that doesn't leave the guy hurting her. 

I'm scared that he'll make her choose between him and me, and I'll end up on the streets. I've been abandoned by everyone even though I tried my best, and I just don't know what to do. 

There's a shotgun in the basement that's been crossing my mind frequently. I'd rather be dead than homeless and I just don't know what's wrong with me that makes everyone throw me away.
