Drowning in the sea seems so good.I was denied by life to live with dignity. Why would someone in such a position should even care to keep alive? It's simply a realization that it's not worth it, it's pathetic to live such a life. 

I just wish I was already in complete peace with going to the sea and drowning myself there in the night.

I've been there. The darkness mixed with the power of the ocean during the night is beautiful.

It could be my end. Taken by the unknown vastness forever, until any remains of myself no longer exists.
