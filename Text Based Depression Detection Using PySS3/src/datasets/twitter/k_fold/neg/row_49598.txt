I don't see the point.I'm 24, hate my life, hate who I am. I'm depressed with who I am and my choices in life.

 I can't get my mind off of death, suicide, or what if I was someone else. I know that other people have had it much worse than I have, but I just don't see the point on trudging through all the shit to have one decent moment in an otherwise cloudy life. No sun rays breaking through the clouds, just gloomy, rainy shit.


At the same time though, I want to die, but I'm also scared of it.
I've been slowly eating less and less on purpose, only have one meal a day now, and been getting a lot of stabbing pains in my heart/lung area and lower abdomen area.


I just want to go, vanish, and be forgotten.
