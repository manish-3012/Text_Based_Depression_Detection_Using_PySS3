Life after death.Just had a quick cry after reading an r/AskReddit thread about what people experienced after dying for a short while and then revived. Nearly all the answers were, well, nothing. They experienced nothing. One person said he felt well rested afterwards, like it was a good long sleep. I cried because it sounds so peaceful. So serene and just...peaceful. I long for it. I long for death. I want all of this pain to cease to exist, just like I will. I cried because I canâ€™t die yet. I cried because I have to stay alive for my ill mother. I cried because I feel guilt for craving something that people should fear. I cried because I canâ€™t wait for my â€œlifeâ€ after death. Nothing. Absolute bliss.
