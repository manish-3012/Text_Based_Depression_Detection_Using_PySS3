All i have to sayPlease God, let me meet her. All i want is to find that perfect girl i know exists. Shes sweet and shy and my age, and likes all the things I do, and might even be on reddit. The girl who won't secretly think i'm a loser, the girl i can cuddle with even just online and spend nights talking to and laughing and sharing happiness, the girl who can reciprocate the love I put in, the girl i can make feel safe and secure unconditionally and can fill this gaping empty void in my heart. Please just let me find this person. I'll change everything about me if thats what it takes. Please, I just can't take the loneliness anymore.
