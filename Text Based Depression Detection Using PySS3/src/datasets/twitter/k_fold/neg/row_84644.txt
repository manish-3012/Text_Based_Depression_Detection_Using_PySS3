I hate my life and myselfYou might be thinking I want to kill my self because a friend or family member died or I have no one or I am a failure in life. Well none those apply to me. I am a teenager in high school and have a lot of friends and two happily married wealthy parents that love each other and me (hopefully). The reason I hate myself is I am always lonely inside. I can go hang out with friends and go to school and put on this fake cool druggie look. But itâ€™s not me. I use drugs alone to have fun and connect with myself. Because the real me is fucked in the head I am extremely emotional and wouldnâ€™t be liked by anyone. I love being by myself because I feel like I donâ€™t have to censor myself or try to please someone. I can just be me and do whatever the fuck I want and donâ€™t have to attempt to make small talk. Whenever I go to school or am around friends and family I get super anxious and canâ€™t relax. I have to smoke myself to sleep every night because my brain is flooded with stuff that happened that day. I feel like I let down my parents every day since I have shitty grades they caught me with drugs and the only thing I was good at I quit. I really want to meet just one person as fucked up as me and someone who really is like me. Iâ€™ve had a lot of friends over the years but none of them I have been really able to open up to. I com template suicide all the time now and the only thing that is stopping me is knowing it would hurt my parents. I donâ€™t want you to feel bad for me just want to share my life so it can help someone else out.
