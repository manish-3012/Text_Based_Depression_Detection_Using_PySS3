im done, i canâ€™t do this anymorei donâ€™t even know if this is â€œteen angstâ€ anymore 

im honestly sick and tired of this loneliness and heartache. i have friends, i have people around me who somewhat care about me, why canâ€™t i just get that into my head and go live a happy fucking life? 

i feel empty, but not calm. itâ€™s like iâ€™m trapped. i feel like i built my whole personality so that people would like it, yet still they dont. 

i donâ€™t know who i am. i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m doing. i donâ€™t know when itâ€™s going to end and thatâ€™s terrifying
