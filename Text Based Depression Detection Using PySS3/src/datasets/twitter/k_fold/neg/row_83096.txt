My normally ambitious husband wants to commit suicide and Iâ€™m lost at what to do.My husband has always prided himself on his ability to provide for his family. Heâ€™s now been out of work for three months, drinking heavily, and his talk has turned to â€œnot being around.â€ He told me I should find someone else because he is unlovable. I am genuinely afraid of leaving him home alone tomorrow. What, if any, are my next steps? How can I get help for someone who refuses to see thereâ€™s a problem?
