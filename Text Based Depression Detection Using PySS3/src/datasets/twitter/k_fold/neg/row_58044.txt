A downward spiral of self-hatred. [Long Post]Hey Reddit.

So, I understand that there's a number of posts on here. Despite that, I'll deposit my thoughts here. I've recently moved from a place of comfort to somewhere that has posed some challenges. I'm a 19 year old college student, and I'm struggling to keep everything together. I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember, and I thought for awhile that I had defeated it. Last year, I was hospitalized because I got overly intoxicated and downed an entire bottle of Ativan.  Whether I meant to attempt suicide or not, I'm not sure. That happening is one of the reasons I moved, to try and start over. Things were going OK for awhile, I was lonely, but managed to make some friends via a club at my school. Well. I managed to mess that up. I drink to self medicate, and because well, I just like it. Well, we had a social event for the club, and afterwards, most of us went back to one member's house and drank/hung out. I drank in excess and proceeded to be a complete asshole. I was forgiven by my club, but not by myself. Some time passed from that, and que my next fuck up. One of my classmates had invited me to a party one evening, and me being bored and lonely, happily accepted the invitation. Well, again. I became overly drunk, and had to call the person I'm dating to come and pick me up. I spewed in his Jeep, and I foggily remember punching myself in the head because I had fallen. Woke up on his couch, he drove me to my car and we parted ways. I texted him apologizing, and offering to clean his vehicle and whatever else needed it. Got a reply that said things were fine. Well. Fuck. My own self deprecation messed that up, too. I hate myself so much. I hate my brain, it dips in and out of these highs and lows. I've been diagnosed with MDD in the past. I want to kill myself, because it seems that no matter what I do, I mess it up. But, there's still a small flame in me that believes I can do something with my life. I'm trying to find things as an outlet. I started training in BJJ and MMA last week. I found an old bottle of Wellbutrin, I took one tonight and I'm going to see if that helps. Honestly, I don't know what to do with myself. Besides social matters, I'm struggling with coming out to my hyper-conservative parents. They honestly shouldn't even be married, they hate eachother. But that's a completely separate issue. Thing three...I've taken on a lot of difficult classes this semester, and I'm struggling to keep up. On top of that, my mother is pressuring me to teach myself calculus. I don't have the time to with 15 fucking credit hours. 

That's all I really have to say. It's a giant wall of text, a ramble, and I'm sorry. 

TLDR; 
Multiple things bothering me:
-self medicating leads to ruining social connections
-too many credit hours
-MDD
-Family issues.
-Low self-worth
