I want to die but cant kill myself because i made a promise that i wouldntI hate my life so much. I'm never happy, when I smile I'm taking it, I'm socially awkward which means women hate me which in turn means I'm forever alone. I have no job anymore and can't find another which means I'm broke. My family, friends and basically everybody who meets me hates my guts and I have nothing to live for. I don't ever break a promise that I make but I'm not sure I can keep this promise, life is just so hard and painful and I'm tired of trying so hard to make things right only and hearing people tell me that things will get better when they know and I know that it never will. I just want to end things and sleep forever. Everybody will be better off with me in the ground.
