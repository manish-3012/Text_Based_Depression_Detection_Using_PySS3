I feel pinned in a corner with no other option at this point.I am so upset right now I can barely type. I am so tired of explaining my situation and I am so tired of living. 

I am a Canadian girl and I moved to Sweden six months ago to be with my boyfriend. We were long distance for two years. I gave up all my friends, my family, my job, my house, my entire life, just for him. Things didn't turn out too well and it kind of got abusive. I also lost my passport which was an Irish passport so that was my only proof that I can work and live freely in Sweden, I am not allowed to find work. I cannot do anything about my situation in that regards, I have been in contact with my embassy etc. (please don't offer advice about this.)

Anyways so my situation with my boyfriend turned ugly and I ended up going to stay with my boyfriends grandmother since she is very well off and I can't work. He asked me if I wanted to try doing our relationship while we lived apart. I agreed. Well today he has decided that I don't treat him well enough and that he wants to break up with me. 

I feel pushed to my absolute extreme limits as a human being. He is my only friend here and basically the only person I have spent time with in over half a year. And now he doesn't want to see me anymore. Now I'm literally stuck in a country where I have no friends and no family, I can't even afford food never mind actually being able to afford my passport to go home, I have absolutely zero people to talk to and all I want is to go back to my country and see all my friends who are worried about me. 

I live five minutes from a train station and it's taking every fiber of my existence to not stroll over there and wait for a train to pass by. I would love to vent verbally but I barely have Skype credit left and no phone. 

Can anyone please offer some words I haven't heard yet, I just want to be okay. All these guides online on how to survive a breakup require you to have friends and family and hobbies and things to do to help you. I have none of that. Please help me. I don't know if I can even stand this pain for another hour.
