What is that feeling when you feel like you are jumping out of your skin?Has anyone else experienced this? It's like a periodic combination of a cringe, electric shock and a chill. It happens every few seconds. It mostly happens when I get insomnia, but it can also happen for no apparent reason. I also feel hot and cold at the same time. I have been to the doctor and they look at me like I am an idiot when I describe this  sensation.  

When it comes it is pure hell. Does anyone have any  idea what this is and how to fix it?
