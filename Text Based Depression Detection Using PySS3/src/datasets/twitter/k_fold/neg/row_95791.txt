ISO a guaranteed way to kill yourself, while making it look like an accident.Clearly I'm suicidal, but like many others on here, worry about the emotional damage that will occur after I'm gone. There's another subreddit post listing all the thoughts that go through someone's mind when they're suicidal. All thoughts I share myself.

I've had low grade depression all my life, low self esteem and the inability to make friends, all which have caused trouble in my nearly 13 year marriage. A marriage that is potentially ended with her actively looking for apartments with a goal of moving out by the 1st.

The short of it is I took alot of the things she said defensively as if she was attacking me and she put up with it for longer than she should have. She is the most amazing woman I've ever met, beautiful on the inside and out. I'd beg her to stay, but done that before and it's selfish. I love her too much to potentially cause her more pain...

Which leads to my dilemma, I want to find a way to kill myself that would look like an accident to lessen the emotional fallout after my death, for my wife, mother, grandmother and other family. Not wanting to be alive is something I've struggled with all my life and now that I've  screwed up the most wonderful thing in the world there's really no point in living. 

Most ways have risks that it won't be successful, resulting in permanent, debilitating conditions, like taking pills, poisoning, jumping off a building/bridge/etc., using a gun (something I'd never do), vehicle accident, etc.

How does one successful do this without it looking like an actually suicide?
