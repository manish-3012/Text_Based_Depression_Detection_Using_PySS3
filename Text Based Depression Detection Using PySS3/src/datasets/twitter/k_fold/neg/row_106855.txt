Is it weird to have a long-term suicide "goal"?My main problem is I can't make myself happy, so I get happiness from women. It doesn't even have to be sexual, I'm just happiest when I have a girl to be sweet to and spend the night with. I know the obvious solution is to rely on myself for happiness, but I can't. I'm insecure, I hate myself, I hate looking in the mirror. I can't like myself because I can't see any reason to.

I'm not complaining that women should just love me, or that I deserve anything, or any of that bullshit. It makes sense. Women aren't going to be attracted to me because I'm not attractive. If a girl could have any guy in the world, why would she settle for me? She's not going to ignore the millions of other more attractive (physically and emotionally) guys for me. If you're offered $1 million, $100k, and a dead battery, you'd choose the million or the 100k if you're just feeling modest. But under no circumstances would you choose the dead battery. That's just how it works.

I think I may also be depressed. Again, I know the obvious answer is to talk to someone. I did when I was younger, and the whole time I just felt like a bitch. Like how fucking weak and low do I have to be to pay someone to listen to me bitch about everything and make my problems their problems?

Another problem with that is it could make everything much worse. Basically I have a hobby that I really truly love. It's my passion. I won't go into detail, but think of something you love. Something you could think about all day and that makes you happy just doing. Cars, soap making, art, carpentry, whatever. Then imagine having someone step in and say you can have absolutely no contact or affiliation with any of that for the good of yourself and others around you. You can't so much as help a friend do it, or join a club and just watch people do it. That would be heartbreaking. Taking away the only thing that I can enjoy very well could make everything worse. Even if I explained that to a therapist and they agreed not to do anything that would end that hobby, just being there and talking to them could result in having it taken.

So that's some background. I think about killing myself a lot, but I don't think I could do it if I planned it. I would need an immediate, reactionary method. Something where I could decide to do it and it be done before I can change my mind. Normally acts of passion are just that. But I think it would be for the best in the big picture. Thinking about it now, I can see the good that would come of it. Sure there would be some bad: work would be short one employee, my mom would be sad, I have a lot of stuff that would need to be sorted through, etc. But all of that would be temporary. Within two weeks or a month, everything would be back to normal.

Those temporary downsides are dwarfed by the permanent benefits of me being gone forever. My parents could retire early. They could brag about their one hugely successful child without having to bring up the other stupid failure child. Work could find someone who does the job better than me. If I were to ever find a girl who stays with me for some reason, she could find someone better without me holding her back. 

I guess I have a long term goal satisfied by a short term goal? Big picture improved by a little picture? Killing myself in a quick act of passion to improve everything in the long term.
