Iâ€™m a bad person.Iâ€™m having a real terrible fucked up day. Everybody is always mad at me and yelling. I have no idea how to make things right. I canâ€™t do anything to make it all better. 

Iâ€™m so fucking fucked up. I make shit worse. This is why I need to kill nyself. I need to save you all from me. Let me save you from all the stress and anger and annoyance that I cause. Why do I have to stay in constant pain. Thinking and rethinking every single fuckinh thing. I so trapped. I canâ€™t escape me. It hurts. It hurt to stay alive when I do shit like this. I donâ€™t know how to stop people from being mad or annoyed or stop yelling at me. 

I need my thoughts to stop. I need to not think. I need a fucking break from myself. I hate being me. I canâ€™t fucking stand me. I constantly have the urge to claw my skin off. I hate it. I fucking hate it. I canâ€™t keep living like this. I donâ€™t want to be me. I donâ€™t want to be alive.
