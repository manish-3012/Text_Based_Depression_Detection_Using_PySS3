I don't know anymore.I don't know what to do but I'm just done. I've been thinking of so many different ways of how I could just end my life. Consuming a bottle of pills, cutting my wrist till I bleed out, or driving into a pole. People in my life will not have to worry about me anymore. I know I have people who love me and who care about me but dealing with this stress and putting them in position to care about me also just really hurts me. I want help, I need help but scared. I feel like my problems are not as important as the next. I feel like I won't ever be happy again or if I ever was happy. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm just done.
