Iâ€™m going to kill myself tomorrow nightIâ€™ve got it all planned out. Iâ€™m going to buy pills tomorrow (3 for Â£1 in Poundland boiiiis) because Iâ€™m finally old enough to buy them and have just found my ID. Iâ€™m going to the beach, so my family donâ€™t have to find me. Iâ€™ve even written my suicide note. My roomâ€™s still messy but I cba to clean it. Iâ€™ve tried to clean up the rubbish at least. 

If my parents are reading this, Iâ€™ve said it already but it wasnâ€™t your fault. Iâ€™m just a fucking mess and Iâ€™ll always be a mess, and I canâ€™t take it anymore. 

Iâ€™m sorry.
