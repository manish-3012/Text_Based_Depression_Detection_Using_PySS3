I don't know where else to go.I hate basically everything about being alive. Fifteen minutes ago I decided to kill myself. It took about as much effort as deciding to make a sandwich. My wife is bathing, so nobody would be around to see or try stop me. The deciding factor against was the fact that I don't trust myself to be able to cut deeply enough with a kitchen knife to actually die. I don't want to pass out and wake up in a hospital, strapped to a bed, with a bunch of tubes up my nose. If I owned a gun, I would most likely not be making this post.

I don't really know why I am posting here. It won't help and has no possible productive outcome, but here I am.
