I cant stop cryingEverything seems so fucking bleak I just want to die. Or leave or fucking something I cant take it anymore. I have no one. I'm trans with shitty fucking parents. I love my boyfriend to fucking death and in no way do I hold this against him but he has autism. The only way it really effects our relationship is he dosnt know how to help me when I get like this and I could tell him I'm going to jump off a bridge and hell say something along the lines of "I hope your day gets better" it's not his fault but it makes me feel so alone.

 I dated one of his friends before him and once we broke up he got me drunk and sexually assaulted me. A few days ago this ex tagged me in a facebook post calling me a liar and telling my boyfriend to leave me. It was so fucking embarrassing my boyfriend just reported it and stood up for him saying "it's just how he is he has a cold heart" this sent me into a cutting rage where for the first time I cut deep enough to see fat I got butterfly stitches and cleaned them and there healing but my wrist feels like shit my life feels like shit everything feels like shit.

 In order to get a job to get out of here I need my license which my mother wont take me to get. I then have to apply and get drug tested which sucks because I'm battling addiction right now as well as an eating disorder which sucks all the fucking life out of me. It's currently almost four and I've been crying since I woke up including when I was changing my bandages which I had to do myself because I cant get sent away. At this point I dont know whether to take my father's gun to my head or run away. Either way it's better then this. I want to kill myself so fucking badly and I have no one who would care if I'm gone.
