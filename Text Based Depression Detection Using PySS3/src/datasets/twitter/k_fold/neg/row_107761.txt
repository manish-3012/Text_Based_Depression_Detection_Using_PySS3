The woman everything I am doing in my life is for just told me I make her feel like she isn't human.This isn't the first time I've been told this.  I'm a failure to my family. I am unsuccessful in my work life and, even though I'm constantly told how smart I am (140 in proctored IQ test and 34 on my ACT), I can't seem to transfer that into anything worth a damn.  I have been running at a stand still for the last 3 years of my life, can't afford college, free online courses are illegal in my state, and I am apparently an emotional abuser.  I don't deserve the gift of life I have been given.  I try to treat others as I want to be treated, but don't have the wherewithal to follow my own most cherished value.
