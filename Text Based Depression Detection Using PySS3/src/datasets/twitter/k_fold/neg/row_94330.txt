 I woke up this morning to see that the last comment a redditor made to me last night (after a back and forth discussion we were having) is that he's going to go attempt suicide...again. This is a [repost from r/askreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rl0qg/i_woke_up_this_morning_to_see_that_the_last/) as I was then redirected here.

Am I overreacting here?? I went through his history and he seems like a normal legit guy. His comment to me was the last one he made not just to me, but on reddit altogether. Anyone know this guy? I know people troll, but he seemed legitimately depressed. Help!

I don't have a lot of time to be on here right now because I have two important meetings that I have to go to, but I felt like it was important to post this asap. I know reddit is anonymous in a lot/most ways, but maybe someone knows this guy??? Or has some ideas?? I will check back when I can during the afternoon and then later tonight.  Thanks in advance.
