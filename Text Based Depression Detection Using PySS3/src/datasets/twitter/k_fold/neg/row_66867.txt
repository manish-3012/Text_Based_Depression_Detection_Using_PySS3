I will never pass as a woman.I'm a trans woman with the horrible unlucky situation of a passing voice, but a horribly masculine appearance. 

Hrt can't fix Neanderthal brow ridges, but I don't want ffs... I don't want to die. I want to live. I want to see my bf, but I also want to pass, I know I can't because of my brow ridge, I don't know. I feel so fucking horrible. I want to die, but I don't at the same time, I just want to look like a woman, I fucking hate the fact that my voice is a cartoonish mismatch for the monstrosity that is my face

There's no hope, I want to be able to pass with my own genes, but I know I never will... fuck everything, fuck all of it, I want to die but also want to live, I don't want to deal with the eternal pain of being seen as a man but I also want to see my boyfriend so fucking bad, I fucking hate everything and fucking hate my disgusting unlovable masculine appearance, fuck life
