the loneliness is killing mei want nothing to do with the world anymore. i feel like no one cares and no one wants anything to do with me unless im doing something for them. i feel like i will be alone forever. i feel like the constant anger inside of me is going to get me to end up killing myself, and honestly that day is coming up quickly. i dont want to be around here anymore no one wants me here. i just want to be happy, but i never will be.
