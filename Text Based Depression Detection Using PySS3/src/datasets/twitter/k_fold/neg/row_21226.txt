Iâ€™m not going back to school tomorrow.Iâ€™ve told my mom I canâ€™t go back to school. It only makes me want to kill myself a million times more. Iâ€™ve offered to do online school, but she wonâ€™t let me. She says itâ€™ll make me become â€œa weird hermitâ€. I told her if she makes me go back, I will kill myself. She doesnâ€™t believe me. She will tomorrow when Iâ€™m dead. 

She thinks she can just force me, but she canâ€™t. Iâ€™m not going back. She couldâ€™ve had a â€œweird hermitâ€ daughter or a dead daughter. She chose dead daughter. Tomorrow, I will fulfill her wish and I will become her dead daughter. I hope sheâ€™s happy with her decision. 

I probably wonâ€™t respond if you message me or comment. Iâ€™m too exhausted to go on. I cannot think clearly. Everything is a blur. I am hopeless.
