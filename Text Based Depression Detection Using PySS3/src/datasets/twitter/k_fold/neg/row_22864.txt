A reason to live forI think I found one for myself. Well, it is  right here: http://marshallbrain.com/discard1.htm

Most of us can live long enough to replace our lumps of meat with shiny robotic bodies like ones seen in "I, Robot". Because only brains matter, and our imperfect bodies are only dragging us down.

Try to keep going, limping or crawl. Shiny robotic bodies are worth it.

UPDATE: I think I got a bit manic then I wrote this. Well, sorry, but I still think it's a good thing to live for.
