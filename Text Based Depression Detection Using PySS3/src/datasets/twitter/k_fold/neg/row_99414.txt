My buddy, an NRA member, asked me why I don't own a gunMy response was this: "I decided in 4th grade that I would never own a gun. I knew then that if I had one, I would use it on myself." 
He was stunned. We never really talk much about what's bothering us, so this opened up a very awkward conversation between us. 

I have always hated myself. I have always been very critical of myself. Even as a kid, I always thought about suicide. I guess what first got me curious about it was being taught in church that suicide is the ultimate insult to God, but I guess killing someone else, as long as it is justified, is just fine. How in the hell does that make any sense?! 

I am 40 years old now, and I still struggle with my life and the idea of ending it. The last 9 months have been the lowest of my life. 9 months ago I still had hope. Things were getting better at home and at work, but it all came crashing down one piece of my life at a time. Now I have nothing. I wake up and think of killing myself. I go to sleep and dream of dying. My life has been nothing more than starting over time and time again. I'm ready for the game to end.
