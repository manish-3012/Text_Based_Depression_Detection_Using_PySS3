My life is perfect and I still donâ€™t want it.I go to my dream college, I have nearly a 4.0, Iâ€™m financially independent and stable, I have a few really close friends who love and care about me (one who lives here, one long distance) and enough casual friends to fill my time. For all intents and purposes my life is exactly as I always dreamed it and Iâ€™m still not happy. I was abused as a kid, and when I finally left home at 17 and came here (halfway across the country) I was so over the moon about my new life and new â€œfamilyâ€ of friends I built here. Now, though, more and more I find myself fantasizing about ending it because even in the perfect life I dreamed up Iâ€™m still broken and damaged and sad and anxious all the time. I worked so hard to get here but now Iâ€™m just so tired and Iâ€™d rather have nothing and embrace the void than keep trying to have it all when Iâ€™m never gonna be whole.
