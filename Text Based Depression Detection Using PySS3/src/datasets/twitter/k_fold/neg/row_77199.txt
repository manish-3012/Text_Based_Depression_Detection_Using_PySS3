I'm waisting my young yearsI'm only 18 and i'm wasting all the beautiful things. I choose a major that i hate. I failed my first year for a lot of reasons. So i had the opportunity to do something else but i missed it because i was too depressed after failing this year that i didn't realise that i could register for the entrance exam of another major. I'm stuck in this major that i hate. I was so afraid of the future because i failed this year and i'm not sure i won't fail another year in the future. The worst thing is even if i graduate in this major i won't work in this field because i hate it. So i will spend 7 years (if not more) of my life and i won't even work in this field.
