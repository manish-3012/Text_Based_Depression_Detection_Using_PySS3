I feel very stuck. I feel like I should be able to handle this.Itâ€™s hard to say what exactly is getting me down. Itâ€™s definitely 100% related to my current job. I think itâ€™s because I feel so trapped. Iâ€™ve quit jobs that I donâ€™t like in the past, I was rocky financially for a while, but there was nothing holding me there. Now, I have insurance and a way to slowly pay off my debt. Without a job I wonâ€™t have either of those things. I ask people for advice they tell me to keep it- for experience, for resume, for reference, for insurance, for income, etc. But I donâ€™t want to do it. 

Am I just being a petulant child? Thinking about this job makes my stomach twist and turn, giving my cramps and constipation. Doing it is exhausting even though all I do is sit and talk on the phone. I want to quit it right now, but I canâ€™t deal with all the disappointed looks Iâ€™m sure to get.  Plus, what *am* I doing to do? I donâ€™t think this should play into it, but maybe I should call someone, potentially go to the hospital while I *do* have insurance. I currently talk to an therapist but weâ€™ve only covered incidental things, we havenâ€™t gone very deep- mostly my fault.

I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like I should be able to handle this, but my crushing debt and crappy job make me question whether thereâ€™s really anything that would make me happy or satisfy me. I have no goal, school has failed, my national guard â€œcareerâ€ is a total joke- I barely scrape by there. Every bit of â€œadviceâ€ I get from family or friends just infuriates me â€œkeep it a little bit longerâ€ â€œjust work hard on finding another jobâ€ â€œthatâ€™s not so badâ€. I donâ€™t know why this well-meaning advice makes me so anxious and angry but it just seems to multiply how stuck and depressed I feel. 

I take wellbutrin, and Iâ€™ve been keeping up with it, but it doesnâ€™t seem to do much for me. I canâ€™t sleep at night because Iâ€™m thinking about how much I hate my job, then I am exhausted during the day, giving me slim to no energy to try to fight these depressed feelings which build up, creating a cycle that doesnâ€™t seem to stop. I donâ€™t know if this is major depression, SAD, dysthymia, or what, but Iâ€™m tired of it. I couldnâ€™t do anything to myself now, in my parentsâ€™ house, while theyâ€™re home, but. .Iâ€™m not sure in the future. I feel like nobody takes how depressed I am seriously, Iâ€™m not sure I know how seriously to take it. It just doesnâ€™t feel right.
