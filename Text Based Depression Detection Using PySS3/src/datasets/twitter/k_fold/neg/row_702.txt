trustyou broke all of my trust. i poured all my life into you yet all you did was betray me. how am i supposed to trust anyone anymore? when the person u love the most leaves u to rot like this :( things between us felt so real this time but you disappeared. there's nobody in this world that will resonate with me as much as u did. u will be the only one i'll ever love and i mean it unlike u. i'm sorry for everything im so sorry. i felt the way i did because i was so scared. i didn't want you leaving like everybody else did but u did in the end. i hate u so much. u ruined my life yet nobody sides with me. ill never be as pure as i once was in the past. u ruined me. u are a murderer because i am gonna kill myself because of u.
