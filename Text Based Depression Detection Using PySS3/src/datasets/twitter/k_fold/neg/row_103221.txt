It's becoming harder and harder to find any more reasons.After my mom passed away this year, my life changed pretty hard. My father had pretty much changed into a different person, which I don't blame him, I know he is going through a lot. But he got a new girlfriend pretty fast. I lost my job and got another that I am pretty much miserable at and having a hard time finding another. I keep trying to move out but ever time I do something happens and I am back to square one. I try to talk to my father about my problems and even told him at one point about my thoughts of suicide but he pretty much brushed it off. I don't know what to do at this moment anymore.
