How do i stop the pain?I've woken up feeling very low and down. But that's not anything new. I always seem to feel that way. It got real hard for me a early last year and I started self harming. Now I'm addicted to it. I crave it. I crave all of what it offers. And it's stupid. Really stupid. But every day I wake up low I feel about just ending it. I'm such a coward and I'm too scared to actually do it, but I wish I had the strength to end it all. To not have to deal with everything any more. 

How do I make all the hurt and pain and depression so away? How do I stop the voice in my head that tells me how much better off I'll be if I end everything? How do I feel happy?
