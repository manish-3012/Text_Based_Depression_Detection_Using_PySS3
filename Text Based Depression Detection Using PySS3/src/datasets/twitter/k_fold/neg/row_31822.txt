Why wont anyone help me???No one at all cares that I want to die. No one cares that I'm cutting my limbs to pieces. No one cares that I don't ever eat. No one cares that I walk around without life in my eyes. 

I thought maybe if I started doing muscle damage with my self-harm then people would care. But no, they don't. Maybe if I became skeletal, people would see that I need help. Maybe if I landed in the hospital all the time that people would see how much I need help... but no. They all think I'm fine and think I dont need therapy anymore. 

My only option is death. This has been clear to me for a while... its been a few months since my last attempt and I was very close to dying... I was found just a few minutes before it was too late. This time, on Christmas  night? I'm jumping off of the 55th floor of the tallest building in my state. Wish me luck...
