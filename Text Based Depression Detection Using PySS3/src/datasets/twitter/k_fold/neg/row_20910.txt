Trying to find a psychiatrist, not going well at allHey, SW. I've been suicidal off and on for the last few months. I posted here on SW about a week ago, when I thought I was finally going to do it, but some very kind people helped me get through. Now I'm ready to start taking some responsibility for my situation. I told my family, and I've been trying to find a psychiatrist. But it hasn't been going well at all. I've called something like 30 numbers, and about half of them say "this number is no longer in service" or go straight to answering machine. Wtf, psychiatrists are doctors, right? You'd think I was trying to find a new dealer. I finally got someone on the phone, only to be told "Dr. ____ is only taking heroin addicts right now." Dude, WAT. The only other person I've gotten on the phone told me they didn't take insurance. So I don't know what to do. Can someone who has actually successfully navigated this charlie fox give me some advice? Thanks
