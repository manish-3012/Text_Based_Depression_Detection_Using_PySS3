oh how I wish I wasn't ever born..Why. I've been on the edge about life. I don't do drugs or drink, 21yr old male here. Dad died back in October. Still having dreams, flashbacks. Missing him horribly. Its not good or fair.

Graduated, got a job as a software assembler. Can't focus for shit, think ADD is taking me over because all I want to do is browse. I'm not sure what's gonna happen yet but if I end up fired, that's it. We had a meeting yesterday outlining the lack of workflow, basically. I'm so worried. Two managers are gonna have a meeting today about it (one was out yesterday).

My gf. Basically a member of the family. Lost her last night. She said it's not me but the relationship itself is making her feel restricted. That she loves me, still wants to be part of the family, she just wants her life together and wants a chance to travel in the future. She says she can't take me with her though. So, she wants to be able to travel in the future and stuff and I can't come with her. She wants to be best friends though. Still wants to have dinner with the family and stuff. I can't handle it. I couldn't stop crying last night. I don't get it. The last girl I expected this from. My whole life and everything. Friendzoned. I'm only able to cope by holding onto the hope that we'll be together again. But I doubt it. I'm just disappointing myself but that's what's getting me by. 

She's the only girl out there who ever understood me. So I thought. I've never remained friends with an ex before. Until now. 

I've never wanted to end my life more without her, she was the only girl who actually understood me. And now I've got nothing. I wasn't meant to be happy, my life's not worth sharing, I'm a miserable piece of shit. I wanna end it. If I lose this job, I might. No one would miss me.

TL;DR: dad died, gf left me, mental issues preventing focus may cause me to lose my job and fall into massive debt, if this keeps up, I'm out
