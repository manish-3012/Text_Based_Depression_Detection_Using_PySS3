selfishI wish there was something available and effective for those of us feeling so stuck. 

For my entire life I have been incapable of living happily without money. Especially without some path towards a lot of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My circumstances are such that I can only hurt others to make money or deepen my depression by diving into things that do not provide me any long term path or sense of worth.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep telling myself I want to help others, but if there is no clear path towards this, then I fall into the rabbit hole.

&amp;#x200B;

My default state is "I want to die" if I am not constantly buffering it with drugs and busy-work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to join a cult, just for a sense of community without the financial commitment, but this doesn't exist. 

&amp;#x200B;

The lesser of two selfish acts seems to be to carry on, but my mind doesn't agree. I've lost my mind and hate everyone around me except for my mother she is the only one. I want to just overdose on Heroin somewhere nice. I've never done heroin before
