Is it possible to be ironically suicidal?The title of this post poses a question that I have been asking myself time and time again for pretty much years. Is it possible to be suicidal and not actually mean it? I have lost my will to live. The only thing that keeps me going is my girlfriend. Iâ€™m visiting her in person for the first time soon. Weâ€™ve been dating for just over ten months, and three weeks from now Iâ€™m getting on a plane to Connecticut for seven days. This is exciting for me because itâ€™s going to be the first time Iâ€™ve ever been out of California but waiting three weeks is absolute agony.

I feel like I go through an existential crisis almost once a month. Why is it that Iâ€™m alive now, specifically in the United States, specifically in California? And why is it that Iâ€™m never able to find anyone except on the internet? Thatâ€™s the most depressing part. Unless itâ€™s on the internet, I feel like itâ€™s impossible to find a girlfriend. The internet is nice because nobody knows what you look like. But my entire life, not one girl has ever said yes to me. I was so desperate for a fucking girlfriend that during eighth grade I broke a record for most desperate 13-year-old kid in California. I asked out nearly every single girl in my class. By the time I was a sophomore in high school and was removed from public school for threatening to slaughter everyone, I had asked out every single girl at school. I even tried to sneak a kiss from a senior who already had a boyfriend.

Iâ€™m suicidal. But I donâ€™t believe I have the guts to go through with it. I joke about suicide sometimes. I often quote Woody Woodpecker. At the beginning of â€œWacky Bye Baby,â€ Woody Woodpecker laments that heâ€™s an outcast and he wonders to himself, â€œah, whatâ€™s the use? If I had a gun, Iâ€™d shoot myself!â€ and thatâ€™s how I honestly feel. I feel if I wasnâ€™t so much of a pussy, I really would kill myself. Iâ€™d even resort to overdosing if there wasnâ€™t any other option. The closest Iâ€™ve gone to killing myself is on a family vacation, I snapped and told my mom â€œIâ€™m going to sit in the parking lot and wait for a car to run me over,â€ and my mom said â€œgo aheadâ€ because she was sick of me threatening to kill myself. I ended up chickening out.

Iâ€™m one of those people who wants to kill themselves all the way up to getting ahold of a gun and shoving it into my mouth but instead of pulling the trigger Iâ€™ll put the gun down and post on social media saying â€œIâ€™m about to eat a bullet.â€ Iâ€™m also one of those people who would opt to eat an entire bottle of pills instead of the traditional methods of suicide because Iâ€™m afraid it will hurt. One time last year, I was on the verge of killing myself by eating fried eggs three times a day until my friend told me â€œitâ€™s impossible to kill yourself by overeating, youâ€™ll just get really fat and end up with type 2 diabetes.â€

Does anyone else feel like this? Is it possible to be jokingly suicidal?
