I will end up dying, no matter which path I takeMost psychologists don't understand. They tell me that I should change, learn to ignore everyone else's words, ignore all the pain I went through and just focus on myself. That's it.

If I keep bottling things up I'll probably collapse one way or another...

If I try to take my life and end up surviving in the process, chances are some family and friends won't talk to me anymore because they can't deal with my issues.

It would take years of therapy to make me somewhat functional again, and if it somehow works, I'll be either 25-27, and by then, I will have missed a lot of things.

So, no matter what path I take, I'm pretty much doomed...
