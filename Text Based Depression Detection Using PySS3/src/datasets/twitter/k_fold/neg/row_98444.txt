My mind is torturing mei keep replaying this image in my head that he'll show up to my house with flowers and tell me he's sorry and that he wants to get back together but no i know there's 100% chance of that NOT happening. my brain sucks. i wish i could shut it off. i wish i could go back to being the stone cold selfish bitch i was before him. atleast then i wouldn't have to feel like this. 
i don't want to be here
i want to die
