I wake up and feel sick and anxious every day just at the fact Iâ€™m aliveI thought I was transgender and my ex supported me and loved me. Then he dumped me and blocked me on everything. Every time I wake up from sleep I remember Iâ€™m alone and living the same brutal hell so many of my friends are. I tried to add him back on Snapchat and what I thought was gonna happen did indeed happen. He didnâ€™t accept my request he left me on pending for ten hours and told my friend he just wanted to move on. Iâ€™m broken. I have a body that bleeds too. Iâ€™m broken
