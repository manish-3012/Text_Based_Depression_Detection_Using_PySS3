I need real helpI am contemplating suicide now. Its been a rough life for me. I'm 16. I play pro fortnite and today I was kicked from the "Pro League" for something I didnt do and they arent taking remorse on me. Everything has added up though. Fortnite may seem cringey but its my niche and what I like doing and being the best in. It was practically all I had left in my life. My mum died from cancer last year and my dad is an alcoholic. I was physically abused all my life before my parents split up and that mentally damaged me for a long time. I have no IRL friends if I am being real. I have a twitch channel with 350 followers and 7k views and thats it. Thats all I have. I can't genuinely see my will to live anymore. Can anyone help me?

Tl;dr I have lost everything important to me and cant find the will to live. Anyone can help?

Thanks for your time.
