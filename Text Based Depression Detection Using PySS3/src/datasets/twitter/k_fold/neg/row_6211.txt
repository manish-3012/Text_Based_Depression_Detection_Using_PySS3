I'm sad.So, earlier this week I wanted to die. I REALLY wanted to die. People tried to talk me down but it ended up not working. The day after, I felt well enough to finally confess to my crush but I got rejected because he was already with someone. It crushed me. I was only staying alive this long because I thought I had a chance. Somewhere in my mind, I really, actually thought I had a chance. I'm stupid. This wasn't the first time this has happened. I keep falling in love with people 100 times better than me and then get hurt by the inevitable rejection. It's happened my entire life. I've never really been with someone. I ran from my family to get away from an abusive household when I was 18 so there's no comfort there, and nobody ever wants to be near me. There's no future for me, so I'm going to make a note for whoever find my body in the car in my garage and do it. I'm sorry that I'm letting everyone here down but, you guys are just the last in a long chain of disappointed friends and family. Goodbye.
