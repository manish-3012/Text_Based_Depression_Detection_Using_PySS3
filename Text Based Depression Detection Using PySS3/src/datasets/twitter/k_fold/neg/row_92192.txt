Made a suicide note for when I do do itWell, this is it I suppose.... I really tried, but I just couldn't, maybe the way I felt was only temporary or maybe I was gonna stay like this till I eventually died in the future, but I was hurting too much and for so long

I think we all know I won't exactly be missed, after all, I was pretty much just a waste of space, wether I was loved or not  doesn't matter, we both know that I am right. Like I said I really tried to get better, I tried a lot of ways to cope, some good, some not so good, but at the end it happened, and if I could take it all back, I would not.

I kinda hated myself a lot because, well, lest be honest, I was spoiled, I had it all, yet I still felt deppresed daily, who knows, maybe if things had gone different, I wouldn't be laying there dead.

Please, understand that i had my reasons, either way, who knows, maybe in a different time and a different I would have been a better person

Don't worry, I really doubt you'll remember me after some time. Thank you for everything, but this just is not  my time
