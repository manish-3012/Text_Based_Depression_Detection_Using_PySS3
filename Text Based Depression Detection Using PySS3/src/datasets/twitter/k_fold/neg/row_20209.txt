I donâ€™t want to die, but Iâ€™ve realized that I have toI have something to live for. My soon to be brought home puppy. I know itâ€™ll be hard to leave her because I havenâ€™t even met her yet but I already love her.  But I also know that what lies ahead of me outweighs any hope that I have. I wonâ€™t last. Itâ€™s a fate that I cannot avoid. I wish I could live longer but that would mean enduring said thing. And I canâ€™t. I just canâ€™t. I wonâ€™t be able to handle the pressure. Turns out I have less months to live until I leave then I thought I did, if I go by my twisted logic. I know I could make it past this obstacle and grow older and live a normal life if I really wanted to. But do I? Nope. My only reasons to live are pathetic as hell. I canâ€™t keep being ignorant and assume that itâ€™ll be okay. I know it wonâ€™t. And I know thereâ€™s only one way out. Maybe Iâ€™m just being dramatic. Who knows any more.
