So done with life.I'm just tired. If all I'm feeling is nothing but regret, failure and depression overall, then is there a point? I know I can find myself sometime in the future, but with what I feel now I just don't even care - I'd rather not move on. 

I'm scared to hurt myself - I don't want to, but I'm considering it. I especially don't want to bring my family down, that's the thought keeping me alive right now, but I fear that this thought will fade away - I love them.

I just fucking hate life.
