I want to make some online friends to keep me mentally stable.Okay so here's the thing. Recently I have been getting like a lot of depression and anxiety because I'm really lonely right now.
And all of this will fade off in a month when my college starts again and I start hanging out with my friends.
But for now I really need some friends. If you're looking someone to talk to. Please pm. Thanks
