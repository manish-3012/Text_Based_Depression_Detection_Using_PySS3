I don't want to get up. I want this to end and I think i'm going to commit later.Its 10am and i'm usually out of bed by now. I woke up feeling like today is the day. My dad was out all night with another woman he's been seeing, even though my parents still live together. My 6 year old sister got out of bed screaming. Its the same thing every day.  

I've had generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks since before I can remember, as early as preschool. Its gotten worse as i've gotten older and many of my fears have came true, which leads me to believe that I can predict the future rather than have an anxiety disorder. The physical symptoms are too much to bear any longer. Mainly nausea and the feeling of collapsing. I can barely leave my home. 

Mental illness is in my dads side of the family. Personality disorders, anxiety and psychosis disorders. 

My dad just got home. I can hear him pretending everything is normal. I can hear my sister making animal noises and periodically screaming for no reason. I look at the walls and see shadows or lights moving. What the hell is this from? I look outside and see my bustling neighborhood beginning their day, taking their dogs out, parents taking their children out for the day.. And I know my day will be the same as always. Sitting in bed sobbing and gambling with my life. 

I can't do it anymore.
