No future &amp; no one caresIf I died I don't think anyone would care. Really. No one would care. Pretty sure half the people at my school hate me and don't even get me started about my self-harm. I just feel like I have no future, I can't do anything useful and no one likes me. If I had enough courage to kill myself I'd already be dead by now, I just want to crawl up in a corner and die, what's the point of living anyway.
