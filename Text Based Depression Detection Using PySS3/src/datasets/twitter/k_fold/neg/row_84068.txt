Passively Suicidal.Things are generally okay, as they have been this year. Perhaps the best theyâ€™ve been in a while.

But despite this, I am still suicidal if only passively. Especially before and after bed.

I feel calm. Ready for sleep or slowly waking up, and my first and last thoughts are always, â€œI should kill myself. I should kill myself. Kill myself. Kill myself. Kill myselfâ€, over and over.

I donâ€™t feel depressed per say, or maybe not in the way Iâ€™m used to. But the thoughts are still always there. Always in the back of my mind.
