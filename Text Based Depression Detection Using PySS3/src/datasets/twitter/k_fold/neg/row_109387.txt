Just shitty jumbled up thoughts I'm not sure how to articulate the way I feel anymore. There's just so many things that ended up going wrong. Ever since I started struggling with depression since middle school, I was always told that it gets better. It's been some time since then now, and things have just gotten worse. I feel SO bad for my mom the most. I don't want her to blame herself. I don't see how she'd get over my death easily.  I don't want to kill my self. I don't understand why I can't stop thinking about it. Will I ever be able to get back to normal? My boyfriend says that he never thinks about suicide and that it's not normal to feel this way. I just don't understand what it is I have to do to stop thinking about it. To stop fantasizing about it. Now that I'm old enough to purchase a fire arm, I've been considering it quite a lot. But if I do, when my emotions swing low again I'm scared I'll kill myself it. Which, ultimately, I know I would regret. I feel so weak, and useless , and worthless.
