Feeling that feeling againI won't post my life story and the length of the abuse. I don't have the energy, but I'll let you know that it's tremendously bad. Deep seeded abuse and family shit. Feeling unloved and alone. I've tried so many things and kept positive for so long. But I feel like I can only take so much and I'm being pushed to the edge. Im 25 and I am just about done being able to do this. So many years of this shit. I don't want to live if it feels like this.
