Everything any everybody is boring. But what I canâ€™t comprehend, is not boring. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ll most likely commit suicide soon
What is stopping me from committing suicide? I actually donâ€™t have any reason not to commit suicide. I should. Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m scarred, or donâ€™t want to, itâ€™s just that I havenâ€™t.

I donâ€™t want to die. I want to never have existed. There is no more reason for me to continue. People are fun sometimes but, after some time, they are boring. Iâ€™m boring. Life is boring. I want to know if heaven or hell exist, because those donâ€™t sound boring. I want to know how much fun I can have.

There really is noting stopping me. I have nobody. They all died. Iâ€™m not even joking. So why? Iâ€™m looking for the answer. How to kill myself, without actually killing yourself? 

The world would be identical if I never existed, everybody who died would have died, everybody who lives would live. I am nothing, I have no purpose to anybody, and Iâ€™m not the reason for literally anything. Youâ€™ll read this, and scroll away, and forget in about 3 minutes. Or youâ€™ll read this, message, then scroll away and forget in 5 minutes.

What Iâ€™m saying is, can anybody find me a reason to live? Because life, is boring. And nothing is fun. People get boring, I am boring, Iâ€™m bored. What can cure my boredom besides suicide?
