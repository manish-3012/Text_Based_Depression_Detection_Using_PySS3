I have been thinking about ending my life on a regular basis for maybe the last year.Itâ€™s not something Iâ€™ve tried to do, or explored in physical way of any sort. I think about it, usually after waking up in pain, or when Iâ€™ve had another irrational upset. Background on me is I am married, with a 6 month old child, and Iâ€™ve been on and off light work for the past 5 years. Iâ€™ve had a back surgery that either hasnâ€™t worked as well as hoped for or Iâ€™m simply at the time frame of needing a repeat fusion. 

Iâ€™m 30, and got my first surgery in my early 20s. I had pain for several years before that, and it made me a very angry adolescent. After the surgery I had a few good years and thought things were looking up. But over the past 4 years Iâ€™ve experienced a gradual loss of improvement following the surgery. 

Iâ€™ve lost the ability to do what I used to, get up early and pack in a full day. I have a strict amount of opiate medication I limit myself to, because it only works so much and being high with increased dosages is not a solution to my ever-present pain. Iâ€™ve been a reduced dosage for about a year now, and was tapering down from previous years when a bad pain management doctor had me on 6-7 times the dose I take today. 

My partner is immeasurably supportive and is what keeps me tethered. Our child is what makes me realize I may not measure up as a parent in the long run. And, the long days of being a stay at home parent to a newborn with worsening pain is wearing me down. I feel like Iâ€™m drifting from what used to keep me grounded and from my partner too. My pain has been a constant solitude and makes me feel like Iâ€™m just passing through life, not really living it. Having given up drinking/partying years ago and not living near family has made my isolation more real too. 

I tire of opening up about my pain because the only people who truly understand it are my mother and partner, but they can only relate to a small extent. I bottle up my pain as best as I can because I want to be angry at the whole world and at everyone who is healthy and fit. I get so frustrated at the obstacles in my path and obsess over little things that donâ€™t really matter. It makes me tired of being me, physically and mentally. 

As for my thoughts of ending my life: I think my partner and child deserve someone better than me. I truly believe there is an upper limit to how happy and positive an influence I will ever be, and how fair it would be for my partner to have to take care of me as my condition worsens. I fantasize about leaving one night and disappearing to die, so my toxic mentality doesnâ€™t ruin the optimistic future my partner and child deserve. I find myself fantasizing that I donâ€™t wake up when I am anesthetized during my regular outpatient procedures. 

My partner would be better off without me, they have done so well in spite of my limitations in their career and in the life they built for us. My child would be better off not being punished with my bitterness and anger and inability to keep up with a fast growing child as I weaken and suffer more over time. 

I donâ€™t know if that really covers my whole mindset. I only admitted it to myself in a concrete way this weekend and was relieved to hear myself say that I want to end my life out loud. It explained so much of my anger the last few months. As hard as it would be on my family and friends, I know I only bring them down and itâ€™s hard to not feed in to that. Iâ€™ve never truly wrestled with how to deal with this type of thought process and mentality. 

FWIW I am sure I wonâ€™t attempt anything final in the near future. But I do know there is an arbitrary and undefined checklist of things that would need to be realized before I go through with it, sorta like the straw breaking the camelâ€™s back.
