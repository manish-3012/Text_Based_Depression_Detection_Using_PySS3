Me and my friend are (might) going to do a joint suicide. We have a gun and a way out.We canâ€™t do life anymore, neither of us can. With the amount of luck weâ€™ve both received itâ€™s the only option really. I donâ€™t want it but it is the only way. Iâ€™m locked up by psychiatrists, constantly watched by my local pd aswell as the school. I can only hope I can go and try save his life in the process. I have reasons for this action aswell as him but idk. Life is good but to painful
