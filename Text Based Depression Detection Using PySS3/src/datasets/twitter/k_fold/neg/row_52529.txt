It never goes awayDepression is a dark shape just out of my peripheral vision.  Even on the best days, it reminds me with a fleeting glimpse that:

&amp;#x200B;

1)  You've tried half of the popular SSRIs and SSNRIs and they help but also have severe side effects

2)  When I take them and they start working, I want to quit b/c of the side effects. Can't live with or without.

3)  It's pointless explaining anything to therapists, 1 in 10 understands, if you have insurance and can afford them, and you may never get to meet that 10th one

4)  Suicidal ideation is my constant companion.  Eventually, on a bad day, I'm going to slip. Hopefully when I'm 93 ! 

&amp;#x200B;

What keeps me going must be just the sheer will to live.  The life force is still fighting, even if I've given up.  Once that goes, people go off the edge.
