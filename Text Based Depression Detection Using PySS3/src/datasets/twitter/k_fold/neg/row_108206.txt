I don't knowI've had depression probably since around 10-11, i had a lot of trauma in my childhood that didn't really hit me until then. So, I've dealt with depressive episodes and anxiety attacks a lot. 

Its been about five years since then and I thought I was doing better. But every now and then it all just seems to hit me again randomly and I end up in my room, in the dark, crying and shaking and just... its not a good time. I'm going through one of these I guess episodes again and then to add onto that, my boyfriend did something that really, really hurt me and it isn't the first time and I just don't know what to do. I'm so hurt and I can't stop crying and almost screaming. I just want to sleep and stay asleep for awhile
