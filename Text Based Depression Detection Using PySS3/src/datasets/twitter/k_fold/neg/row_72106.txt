The only reason I'm not killing myself tonight is because my husband's business would go under.I've accepted that everyone who cares about me would be better off without me but I think my husband would have a hard time continuing his business and then he would be incredibly in debt. That's not fair to him.

I plan on getting life insurance soon so I can move on.
