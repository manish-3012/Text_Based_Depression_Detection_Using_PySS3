I'm not going to do the deed, but god I want to so badly...I am just venting out my frustrations here. I am currently feeling very down and have thoughts of just leaving work now, going to my dad's house, getting one of my guns (my dad has them for this reason / because my wife is nuts) driving far away, go out in the woods somewhere and just end this suffering.

That is the thought that is going through my head right now, like the literal bullet that I want to... 

However, I am a fucking coward. I fear death, or more over I fear what comes next. What if by committing this deed I damning my self to eternal damnation and suffering? What if there is a Hell? What if by trying to end suffering in this life I just make things worse and suffer for all eternity? That is one reason I cannot go through the deed. The fear of the unknown, and although I am an Agnostic, my Catholic upbringing tugs at the back of my mind.

That and I cannot hurt my family, friends and most of all my dogs... My innocent sweet dogs who would miss their daddy. I couldn't imagine their pain, or causing pain to others.

My best friend killed himself a few years ago. He got drunk while on a lay over abroad coming home from a war zone... and ran in to traffic and became a hood-ornament. His family suffers immensly to this day because of his actions, and my friends and I suffer too from it. I see his family a few times a year, and I can tell it shattered them. I cannot do that to the people I love. But man I want my pain to stop.

Now what is causing me pain? 

Well on the outside you'd think I have a great life. I am middle class, have a great (albeit boring) career for someone my age (30), have a supportive family, have a wife etc... yet I am in a bit of debt, and my wife is bat shit crazy and manipulative as hell. And she tries to alienate me from friends and family. I want to leave and am trying to, but it is ugly, messy, and I am afraid she will harm herself, our dogs, or me... I mean I was never this suicidally depressed since I was a teen. This all came about in recent years. I see a shrink and am on meds and such, but that can only do so much. I need a change, I need things to just work...

And if I check myself in to a mental institute I lose my job... which puts me in to more debt and issues ,which in turn makes me life worse. 

Stuck in a horrible Catch 22 of my own making. Sigh...
