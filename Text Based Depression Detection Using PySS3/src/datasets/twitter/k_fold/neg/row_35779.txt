I've seen enough of life now to know that this isn't how I want to liveI said that when my family where gone, I'd kill myself because I didn't want them to have to go through the pain. 

I'm 24 now, &amp; they're all dead. No friends. No one. I've seen enough of life to know that I can't live like this anymore. 

It's fucked up. I look at other people my age, working, happy people with family &amp; friends around them. Why couldn't I have been like that?

Can't go back. Can't go forward. Don't have to go home, but can't stay here.
