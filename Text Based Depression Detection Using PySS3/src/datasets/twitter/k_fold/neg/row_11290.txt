one thing holding me back.i have lived a pretty good life and iâ€™ve always been really really close with my family. they are the only reason i donâ€™t. especially my dad, i couldnâ€™t imagine the pain i would cause for him and my mother. I also think about my younger cousins and how they look up to me. however, idk what to do anymore. things are getting too much for me and some days i think that even tho i could hurt them i could do it.
