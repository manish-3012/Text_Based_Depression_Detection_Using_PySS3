Itâ€™s my birthday &amp; Iâ€™m realizing where I stand.Itâ€™s my Birthday today as of midnight EST. &amp; maybe itâ€™s an overreaction but for my group of friends, we would stay up till midnight and wish them a happy birthday. 

I havenâ€™t gotten a single one. Which you know itâ€™s 1 in the morning get some sleep you idiot but itâ€™s been happening the past 3-4 years now. We have â€œplans to hang out tonightâ€ But honestly I just feel like staying inside drinking and overdosing on muscle relaxers.

I canâ€™t sleep, I have no appetite I feel like my life is stagnating and I have no way out like Iâ€™m in quicksand and just watching myself drown. 

It really sucks to be the Person no one considers. 

Iâ€™ve suffered with anxiety and depression for over 20+ years + other mental illnesses and never felt comfortable with a counselor or a therapist.

It just feels like death would be the sweetest embrace Iâ€™ve felt in life ironically and the best way to change the cards I was dealt. 

I struggle so much with suicidal ideology and just the temptation that itâ€™s not even a struggle anymore itâ€™s more of a when are you gonna do it type of thing now.

This is a bunch of text dump.

Tl:Dr itâ€™s my birthday people donâ€™t care about me. I see no point in living I have no future and want to die
