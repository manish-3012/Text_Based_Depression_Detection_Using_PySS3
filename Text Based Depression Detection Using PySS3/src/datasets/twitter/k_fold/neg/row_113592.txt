I need practical help/guidanceI have a legitimate problem that ruined my life, its more like a dilemma / limbo where I have to either  accept defeat and that I will always be a sub human or end my life now....I am more or less de facto a stateless person (without citizenship ) even though I am a white European kid.... I just turned 22 yesterday......this problem started when I was 18......I am a well educated kid who had early success as an entrepreneur in my teen years...I was somebody before turning to no body in the past 4 years......... I need someone to tell me what to do....  I feel that my early success in life is a sign that I reached the end of my life cycle...I need help....I have no family or friends or any social circle for the past 4 years..  I suffer in silence to keep my dignity .... I went to the united nations and various other NGOs but none could help....I am not venting out, I actually need help
