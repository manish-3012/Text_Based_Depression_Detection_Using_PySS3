really long post. not suicidal just really lonely and indifferent.. not sure what to do..hi, i'm not really sure what i'd like you all to say. i really suck at explaining myself accurately but i'll try to paint a good enough picture so that hopefully someone will write something that makes something click in me.. ok. my 'problem' is that i'm not interested in anything. nothing. 


about myself:

- i'm a 21 year old female

- i guess i'm pretty introverted. i'd love to find a few close friends (even one would be more than enough) to go 'partying' with and get drunk and 'go wild' (when i put it in quatation marks, i mean that although i like the idea of being rowdy and silly like that, i like it for the act itself, not to get attention from other people which is what most people seem to do... i always feel like everyone is surrounded by people but absolutely alone.. and all i want to do is have a few friends.. even one would do that i can occasionally be 'partners' with.. i don't know if that makes sense)

- i'm intelligent but am not knowledgeable about much- mainly attribute this to not being interested in absolutely anything.

- i'm not smart enough for the smart kids but too smart for the dumb ones... by smart i mean i pick up things really quickly.

- i really hope it doesn't seem like i'm full of myself. i don't think i have low self esteem but i'm definitely some sort of depressed.. i'm 21, finishing university dec of this year. have no friends ( kept in touch with a few of my floor mates from first year but i despise them all.. yet i keep in touch because without them i'd actually be completely alone.) i've felt this way (alone with friends that i don't really like or connect with) all my life. i wasn't really aware of it until grade 9. i cry all the time- 2 times a week when i'm good, 2 times a day when it's a bad week. i don't really know why i'm crying, it just feels like an overwhelming amount of pressure (physical pressure on my mind.. like my world is closing in.. but i don't feel anxious or anything like a panic attack, it just feels like if i give up and 'let go' during those moments i'll permanently cross a line into serious depression- i want to stress that i rarely feel anxious or nervous or anything like that)

- i have loving parents who take care of me financially. i live 5 hours away from them and i wish it was more. i love them to death but i began dreaming of what i would do if they died and i was absolutely alone in the world when i was around 7 or 8 years old. i would never ever ever do anything to make this happen and i would feel horrible if anything ever happened to them. these 'day dreams' have also occurred less and less as i grew older since i now technically am no longer 'linked' to them. (sorry for using so many quotation marks.. i have a horrible vocabulary and can't think of the right word to express what i'm trying to say)

- my dad was never home when we were younger which didn't impact me negatively but i now realize that the only real relationship i've ever had was with my mother (since i've never really had any friends and never had any close friends) and she (i love her to death but) loved me more than my sister (twin fraternal sister who never really liked me because my mom never paid attention to her when i was around and always went out of her way to verbally abuse me at school untill a few years ago when we both went to different colleges.. we're 'close' now) and always believed that i would grow up to be some sort of genious because i was really smart when i was younger. 

- i'm attractive and don't really have any self image issues

- i spent my childhood being the mediator between my mom and sister, my mom and my dad, my dad and my sister and my mom and her issues. i was never bitter about it and volunteered to help because i honestly felt that i could help my family but now i wish i could go back and let them all fuck themselves over because i lost out on any form of socializing and am seriously fucking depressed while they're still withering in their shitty lives. eugh. sorry about the sudden change in narrative but as much as i want to look forward and fix this neutrality i'm living in, i can't help but get bursts of rage towards my younger self and how much belief i had in my mother and family's sanity. 


i don't know what else to say. i am utterly indifferent about everything and everyone yet absolutely overwhelmed by loneliness. i want to be with people (or a person) but don' t know who, what i want to do, what i'm interested in.. etc. i want a hobby but i've tried drawing but i get bored, tried going to class but i lose interest because i pick up on the gist of the course really quickly but am too lazy to actually do any of the readings... is everyone like this? my entire life people have told me i'm smart but i'm positive everyone is like this. 


tl;dr: i'm not interested in anything and have tried to find things but seriously don't care about anything. i spend my day sleeping, wasting time on the internet, sometimes exercising, rarely reading, watching stupid shit on the internet, doing the bare minimum to pass my courses.. thats about it.


i've rambled long enough.. i know most people who answer (if any do, which is fine if no one does, there's not really much to say) would likely say things like "take it one step at a time" or "you can get out of this, life is worth living", which come from a well meaning place but i've tried getting a routine and it does work, in a way. it works at getting you out of the shitty mind set but all it's like i wake up from this dream like state that i'm in and am surrounded by shallow and mentally disturbed people. i'm so sorry if i sound full of myself or like i'm better than most people because i really don't think i am. i just know that the reason why i always go back to this state of nothingness is because when i try to 'live in the real world' i hate it. i hate everyone, i hate the indifference of most people and their neuroses. i'm not nervous all the time. i'm not self conscious all the time. i'm not worried people are talking about me because i don't talk about people behind their back. i try not to lie and i don't cheat or treat people horribly. i get back to people when i say i would and i actually listen when it's 'not my turn to talk'. BUT i'm not so sensitive that i don't understand sarcasm (i'm actually very sarcastic), i'm not uptight and prudish. as i mentioned above, if i ever ended up finding people i actually like (if i ever figure out what it is that i like) i want to 'party' and get drunk and make mistakes and do things i 'regret' and stupid shit. 


i know this is really long and even though i will be checking this religiously for the next while to see if/what anyone posts, i understand if no one says anything that helps because 'knowing that there are others like me' doesn't really help. and i can't trust that i will ever find anyone that i get along with because i'm 21 years old and have yet to meet anyone who is in anyway like me. 


i'm sorry if i didn't represent myself properly. i feel like i sound like a huge bitch but i really hope i'm not. this loneliness is eating me up inside and i really can't take it anymore. this week was just a really bad one so i thought i would post on here instead of wait for this mood to go away again..


again, thanks for anyone who read this all the way through
