Constant anxietyI had my first anxiety attack when i was 15. My entire body went numb. I had a hard time breathing. It was the most scared i had ever been at the time.

For a while I had been coping fine. I felt a little more normal around 19.

I am 23 now going through a lot of changes and gaining responsibilities at work I never asked for. Iâ€™m also not getting paid more for these responsibilities.
I feel like I am stuck where I donâ€™t belong. But at the same time I feel like I donâ€™t belong anywhere.
I fantasize going to sleep and not waking up. 
I donâ€™t like these thoughts but I canâ€™t shake them. 
I have quit talking to my family and just about all of my friends. 
I get drunk almost every night. Searching for something but not sure what exactly.
I want to move away from where I am now.
Somewhere thats always warm. 

Anyone else with anxiety have any advice on how to feel like a normal human?
