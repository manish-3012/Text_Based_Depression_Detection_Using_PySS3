Everything is fucked and I'm ready to quit.I ruined my relationship. My boyfriend hates me. He's going to leave me and I can't live without him. I have zero friends. My family couldn't care less. I never get what I want, I suck at college, none of my hobbies are fun anymore, and there's really no reason to stick around. It's never going to get better so what's the point?
