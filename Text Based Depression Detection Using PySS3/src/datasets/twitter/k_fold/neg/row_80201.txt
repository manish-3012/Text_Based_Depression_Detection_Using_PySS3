I think I'm ready nowApologies, this will probably be a long one. To be honest, I don't even know why I'm writing this.

On the night of the 29th, potentially close to midnight or early morning on the 30th, I (21F) plan to take an OD of paracetamol. I've already taken it all out of the packets and have it ready to go so it won't take too long or make too much noise (I still live with my parents). I plan to take 20 x 500mg of regular paracetamol and 12 x 665mg of extended release paracetamol, so hopefully just under 18g is enough. I also plan to take 8 x 10mg of cetirizine as I read that it has anti-emetic properties and can cause drowsiness. There's also a pack of ibuprofen in my room incase I want something extra.

I've tried a few months ago, I ended up taking around 14g of modified release paracetamol. About 8 hours after, I threw up 3-4 times and ended up nauseous and with a throbbing headache for a few days. From there I was fine except for being a bit pale and losing my appetite for the next couple weeks. I still don't know why it didn't work, especially since I never sought out any medical help. I knew it would hurt, and it did, but I still don't regret trying. The only thing I regret was making it out. When I hear all these stories of people surviving, they always say they immediately regretted it. I guess I kind of take that as further proof that I'm not meant to be here.

I'm not scared of dying anymore, I think that I'm finally ready. Actually, I feel like this is long overdue. I don't think I was ever meant to make it this far anyway. I've wanted to die for 8-9 years now, and I think it would have been better if I had done it years ago. I don't think I was ever meant to be happy. Everyone else seems so happy and I always just kept hope that one day that would be me but I really don't think that happiness is out there for me anymore. I really don't think I can do another year of this. The only future I can see for myself is one I don't want. I just keep picturing myself middle aged and coming home from a deadend job to an empty house (because my parents will be gone by that time and I don't have any siblings), going to bed and waking up alone, and then just doing it all over again. I can't live like that.

What probably pushed me over the edge was a recent breakup, it was my first relationship. It ended a month ago, though we were only together for just under a year. I loved him so much. I never knew I could be that happy until him. I don't think i'll ever be that happy again, he was so special and there's nobody else like that. And now it's just over. I hate myself so much, I hate that I wasn't good enough for him. I feel so worthless and so ugly. I'm so stupid for ever thinking that something good could ever happen to me. I ended up cutting off all my friends (i did tell them what happened tho) to deal with things on my own. Eventually I tried to reach out to my best friend again, someone who I had been friends with for almost 17 years now, and she ignored my message for 10 days. She must have known this is when I needed someone the most and she just didn't care. I'm not going to kill myself over a failed relationship, but I just feel so alone right now, everybody just leaves me so what's even the point. I don't have anything to keep me here anymore. I've just finished uni so even study isn't a reason to stay.  I will never fit in anywhere I go. Literally nothing makes me happy anymore, all I do is spend almost all of almost every day in bed crying while watching streams.

One thing I wonder is if I should send my ex a message. He says he still cares about me and my wellbeing but I don't know how true that is. I just want to tell him that none of this is his fault. The last thing I would want is for him to blame himself for any part of it. It was something that was always bound to happen and this was completely my decision. I'm just scared that sending that message might come across as me trying to manipulate him or that he might call emergency services. So I'm not sure what i'll do about that yet. Maybe i'll schedule a message to send after I'm gone so that if something happens and it doesn't work I can cancel it.
