Giving upI lost all my hope in life and in the people around me. Iâ€™m so emotional and sad and everyone hates me for it. When I get upset people get mad and question me. When Iâ€™m happy people question me. What the fuck. My mom is always mad and itâ€™s hard being a single mom with 3 demanding girls but I just wish she would reach out. My dad just cares about one thing, which isnâ€™t me. I just wanna let go, I wanna be gone. What the heck is wrong with me Iâ€™m not normal
