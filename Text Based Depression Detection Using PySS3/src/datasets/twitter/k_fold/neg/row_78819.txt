i feel like iâ€™m doneI really thought it would get better but it didnâ€™t. I wanted to kill myself in 7th grade, actually trying to make a noose to hang myself multiple times. Iâ€™m a full on coward though. Iâ€™ve tried to stop eating but i have no self control. Iâ€™ve wanted to purge yet i donâ€™t have the guts to make myself throw up. At this point just looking at myself in the mirror will make me want to cry and i donâ€™t know why. Today i overslept and i started breaking down and crying about it. I have track tryouts tomorrow but the past two months iâ€™ve spent half to all of the day in bed almost every single day. I feel weak and heavy. Iâ€™m not even tired anymore but if i get in bed i canâ€™t get out, like when you wake up in the morning with barely any sleep. Iâ€™ve stopped going on runs, doing digital art, now i stopped doing traditional art. I have poor social skills and poorer social judgement. I lost two close friends because they wanted me to share a problem. I shared but they wonâ€™t talk to me anymore. I have a friend though but she hates the way i dress, i love a leather jacket i have but if i wore it to school sheâ€™d make fun of it. I love my friend and none of how i feel is her fault. i do miss how i would be happy to show off my style, which i thought was nice, now i donâ€™t even feel the need to get dressed in the morning now that i know itâ€™s ugly . My brother always talks about how mentally healthy i am and said â€œshe only hates herself sometimesâ€ but every day i think of killing myself. If i even started to talk about how i feel the way he does heâ€™d probably start comparing it to how he feels and his problems. Making it seem okay. Im failing school. Iâ€™m tired of spending everyday in bed with a hollow feeling thatâ€™s painful at the same time. Tired of feeling so worthless and disgusting and ugly. Yet i donâ€™t have the guts to kill myself. Iâ€™m so selfish i literally have everything yet i wanna die. I have a good family and a good friend. I have the best pet in the world. Sheâ€™s the reason iâ€™m living at this point. I love my cat and if she died i wouldnâ€™t know what to do, i sobbed because she wasnâ€™t in my room one day. I love her so much, yet she hates me too. Iâ€™m so stupid for posting this here or at all but I wanna let it all out even if i know iâ€™m going to regret this. I just want it to stop.
