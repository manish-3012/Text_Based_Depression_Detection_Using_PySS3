Types of medication?Therapies don't work. I'm literally about to end it if I can't find a way to feel something other than sadness and pain. I can't cope with my abusive mother anymore. Cops came here tonight, I wish they fucking took my mom away. She deserves to fucking rot. (sorry). Should I go on medications? Im scared they'll change me, make me worse/feel worse. I don't want those side affects like seizures. Any medication recommendations?
