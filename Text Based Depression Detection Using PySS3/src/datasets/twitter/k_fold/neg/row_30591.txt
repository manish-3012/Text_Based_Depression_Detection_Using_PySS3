Don't make the biggest mistake of your family's lifeWell at least your 33 and still have a woman and a son to come home to at least that will keep hope alive. Try being 33 and have no girlfriend no kids. And watching your father die and have to take care of his family your immediate family. With no help everything you have from your dead end job and it's still not enough. Can you imagine going home to them a complete failure? You should be grateful for what you have, If I was in your spot I would kill for it at least I have a son who can reach high-performance goals then I ever did. Killing yourself would be the dumbest thing ever for you, you could be sitting on the next big baseball player, the next president, the next valedictorian. Your life isn't about you it's about your family. The one you made please don't forget it. I would literally kill to be in your spot. Don't take it for granted.
