An old friend...I had a friend for a few months. He and I became the closest I had ever been with anybody. It wasnâ€™t a romantic relationship or anything, although at points I felt like it should be. He told me he didnâ€™t want that kind of relationship with me, probably because I was too young  and too immature for him. 

A little while later I found my self longing to be in a deeper relationship with him, not even necessarily romantic. Just more connected. But I felt like he didnâ€™t want that, so I got really upset. I cut myself a few times, even though he told me that if he caught me cutting again he would tell my parents. 

Then I saw him a few days later and he discovered that I had been cutting. I felt really... I donâ€™t know, dramatic? I wanted to push his buttons. So I told him that I did it because I was thinking about being with him and I cut myself because he had made it clear that he didnâ€™t want that. After all this was revealed, he told me that he shouldnâ€™t talk to me anymore. 

He told my parents everything I had told him, and then left, never to reenter my life. My parents said that they convinced him to talk to me again, but he never did. He was supposed to go to a show I was helping out with, and I waited for him to show up the whole time. He never came. From that point on Iâ€™ve been crushed. I feel like I ruined things and Iâ€™m worthless and he doesnâ€™t care about me and never did. Like he was just trying to be nice. I tried to contact him a little while ago, explaining myself, but he never replied. 

I was really mad at him for a while, but now I just hate myself. I feel like I should just kill myself so he never has to worry about being bothered by me again. I really donâ€™t mean anything to anyone. I should just die, right?
