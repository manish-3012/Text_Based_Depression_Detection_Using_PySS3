I hate that I canâ€™t bring myself to doing itIâ€™ve been wanting to end it for well over 5 years for now but Iâ€™ve made no progress to doing so or to improve my mental health. I have so many reasons to hate myself and very few to stick around but Iâ€™ve yet to throw myself off a bridge or die from helium like I desperately want to. These feelings only get stronger with each year and theyâ€™re about to get much worse. I donâ€™t even want help anymore, the idea of living a happy life isnâ€™t anywhere as appealing as dying for me. Even if stopped having suicidal thoughts and was finally able to live to my full potential, I donâ€™t have much to offer or motivation so it would be a boring, dead-end life anyway. Iâ€™m just angry at myself for living with these feelings instead of finally going through with them.
