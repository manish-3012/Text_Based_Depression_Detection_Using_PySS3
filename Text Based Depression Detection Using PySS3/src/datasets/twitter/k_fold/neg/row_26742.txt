Iâ€™ve got absolutely no reason left to keep fightingI was trying really really hard to get better but it doesnâ€™t matter anymore. Nothing I do means anything. Nobody can see how hard Iâ€™m trying and I just keep hurting people. Iâ€™ve been doing this most of my life. Iâ€™m tired. Nothing ever changes, it doesnâ€™t matter what I do or donâ€™t do. 
But now my parents told me I make them miserable so thereâ€™s no reason for me to be here. Thatâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™ve had to keep going, that I didnâ€™t want to hurt and burden my parents. But I have been anyway. If theyâ€™re miserable with me alive why shouldnâ€™t I be dead? Whatâ€™s it matter
