what makes you think that by commiting suicide you will find the peace that you long for?what makes think that? There are a lot of near death experiences that clearly show that people who commit suicide will eventually go to hell. Oh "i dont believe in hell" you shall say! well it doesnt matter, it is still a HUGE possibility. To be franc, two things stop me from doing it and i want it so desperately: fear of the pain that will come along the process of suicide, and the afterlife ; because by doing it you have basically rejected any form of god's grace and mercy. We are basically flawed to begin with if we consider such a thing; some people see the beauty in life and the beauty in other in other people. Fear is the enemy... Man, fuck fear, fear is the root cause of all evil if you ask me. Fuck it
