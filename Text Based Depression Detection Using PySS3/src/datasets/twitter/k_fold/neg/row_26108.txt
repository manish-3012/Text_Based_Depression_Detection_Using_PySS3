When did all go wrong?So I'm 17 yrs old. When I was 3 my mom died in a car accident so I've been living with my narcissistic father and my brother (the only sane one). Now dont get me wrong...I hated myself ever since I could remember myself. I started self harming when I was 10 (without having any idea that it was a thing). I am also bulimic. One of my closest friend and cousin tried to commit suicide and then blamed me for it. (She is older than me) However I never wanted to die....I had...dreams and ambitions...until this year...I sleep all day(19 hours a day). I dont study(i used to write 19/20 now im like 15/20 or even lower). I cant focus. I feel fat and Since I'm also unattractive (regardless of weight) I feel so disgusted that I hate taking baths cause I have to see my naked body. My dad called me a burden (I go to a private school that is super expensive so he kinda throw away his money) and says that I will die alone. A year ago my then boyfriend sexually harassed me and now I dont feel comfortable around males and I also dislike being touched. The person who is the closest to me is my best friend but i feel like I burden her with my problems.
I want to die...I really do...but I am scared that I will fail and I also feel guilty. Im giving up on trying...I am so lazy and stupid (my classmates also think im dumb since they are making fun of me for my lack of knowledge) 
One of the worst realizations I had in life is that I am not very smart...not a "protagonist" in any way. I just cease to exist. Life will only gets worst
I cant wait to grow and have to pay bills and fuck everything up....
Hail to reality... thanks for waking me up I guess
