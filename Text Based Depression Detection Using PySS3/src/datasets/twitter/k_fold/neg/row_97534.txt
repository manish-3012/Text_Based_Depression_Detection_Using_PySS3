i give upthe title really says it all. I give up. I quit. I surrender. I don't see any point in staying here..in this evil, corrupt, sad sad place. there is almost no hope for humanity so why bother continuing my suffering?? the only reason I'm here is for my mother. I really can't leave her, but I'm lost on what else to do. I would fix the world if I could, but I can't, so for that I say goodnight.
