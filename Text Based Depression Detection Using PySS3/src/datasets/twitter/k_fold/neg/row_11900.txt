Over it..I did something bad, something stupid, and it ended up hurting someone who was really good. This person always accepted me and loved me for who I was. And all I can give them in return is pain.  This has been the straw the broke the camels back so to speak. I've been depressed for most of my life. Had suicidal thoughts for most of my life but never acted on it. I used to cut myself, but that just doesn't really seem to do it anymore. 

I'm not posting on here to be stopped, and if this post gets deleted at some point I will understand that. I've always believed that people have the right to choose for themselves whether they live or die. I don't believe all people were meant to live. If we were then why would we feel like shit 24/7. The reason I am posting this is because while I have the motivation I don't have the means. And the internet..in all it's infinite knowledge, doesn't seem to have a how-to off yourself site. 

I know this is not the purpose of r/suicidewatch, but if anyone know's of any forums or sites that they could direct me to? I have never been more at peace than I am right now that I have made this decision. I always told myself that the moment I could look in the mirror and say "I"m going to kill myself" without crying would be the moment I would do it. Well that moment has come and it's amazing how peaceful and right it feels.
