I don't know why I haven't. I think I might soon.I'm in so much pain all the time.  My whole body aches and burns and it never goes away.

My only close friend, who lives on pretty much the other side of the world, tells me I just need to find the right antidepressant.  I've tried pretty much all of them to no effect and now I have neurological problems from taking medications for years.

I'm disabled and can't do any meaningful work.  Never could.  Never will.  I live in an apartment with my little brother who calls me lazy all the time because I basically live in a pile of trash and just sit on the couch and groan in pain all day.

Last time I tried, I found out afterwards that the method wasn't deadly and just ended up sleeping all day.

My family doesn't care and seems to be actively encouraging my death.  Last time I spoke to my parents, they were asking me what happens to my money when I die (I'd make sure to give it all to my only friend).
