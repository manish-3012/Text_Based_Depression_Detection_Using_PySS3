am i gonna be alone forever?hi f16 here. 

i feel like iâ€™m not meant to be here. everything in my life just gets worse and worse. i canâ€™t trust anyone, i have no real friends, i must be hideous because iâ€™m the nicest, most caring person but i canâ€™t find love, i gave up on school in september. i donâ€™t have any family. no siblings, my dad is an abusive alcoholic , my mom lives in another country and doesnâ€™t call me anymore. i have no life all i do is sit at home, sleep, rarely eat &amp; play gta. i feel brain dead!!

iâ€™ve attempted to kill myself 4 times since i was 10 &amp; i feel like i wonâ€™t last much longer. life isnâ€™t for everyone i guess someone help me please i just need to feel like someone cares about me because atm no one does &amp; it hurts so much. maybe thereâ€™s something wrong with me... 

best of luck finding happiness you guys
