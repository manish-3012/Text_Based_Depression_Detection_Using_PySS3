im at the end of my line.I'm done fucking up. I'm done making life tough for other people.I'm done living in a house that feels like hell. These voices in my head get louder and louder. The mood swings get worse and worse. I'm done living with myself. I'm a real shit person. As soon as a problem goes away, one pops up because I was acting impulsively to release pain. I should have just kept everything to myself.
