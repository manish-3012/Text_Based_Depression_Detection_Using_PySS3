Iâ€™m extremely worried for someone elseThis might be kind of long but Iâ€™m afraid my ex boyfriend is going to commit suicide. We recently broke up but have been staying in contact for the last couple weeks. 

For the duration of our relationship Iâ€™ve known that heâ€™s struggled with mental health issues, mainly depression. We were together 3 years and I have known when he goes into deep episodes and what his behavior is usually like. His only type of self medication is through smoking weed. Recently, itâ€™s been getting a lot worse and heâ€™s making threats and Iâ€™m not sure how to handle them. Iâ€™m afraid to call a welfare check because what if that makes the situation worse? Iâ€™ve tried talking to his mom but she only speaks Spanish and doesnâ€™t think itâ€™s a mental health problem. Also, they are a family of immigrants and mental health concerns might just bring shame to his family. 


Last Friday he said things to me via text that say â€œ... another reason Iâ€™ll die alone, soonâ€ so I asked soon? And he said â€œyeah, gonna be successful this timeâ€ 

We talked in person on Friday and I asked him if he has a plan and he kept saying â€œdonâ€™t worry about itâ€ and hinted at that he would just want to drive away so nobody would know. 

Things were fine and then now yesterday he started saying things again. 

He said â€œI think thereâ€™s no going back from where my mental health is and I donâ€™t see myself getting better or anything help get betterâ€

â€œItâ€™s fine, it would be better if I just wasnâ€™t hereâ€ 


â€œIts true. I wouldnt have to struggle with anything, i wouldn't have to worry about fucking my life up, i wouldn't have to worry abouy hurting the ones close to me, i wouldnt have to worry about anytbingâ€ 


â€œIts fine, the people im more concern about hurting is [brother] and my mom. Everyone else will forget and even better some will never knowâ€ 

â€œBut nah its fine, you gotta focus on work. Im being serious with this too rn. Not gonna respond. Have a goodnight [OP]â€ 

And then he didnâ€™t respond to me for the rest of the night. Iâ€™m not sure what to do and he wonâ€™t accept any type of mental health services and Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to lose him forever.
