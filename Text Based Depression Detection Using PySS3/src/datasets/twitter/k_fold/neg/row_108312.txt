Do you believe that some of us were meant/fated to leave the world this way?As much as I wish it werenâ€™t true, sometimes I canâ€™t help but wonder if I was meant to go this way.  Iâ€™m a little better now than I was a year or so ago, but Iâ€™m still curious about this.  

I also know someone who had to make this decision and I feel helpless thinking there was nothing I could do for him, even though I donâ€™t barely know him.  I donâ€™t know his situation exactly, but in some cases is it not enough, no matter how much support we get?  I tend to feel like that sometimes.
