Breakdowns and stimmingI found out my mom is still using, addiction is a disease. She just lies and lies and lies. I'm not even allowed to be angry because then my grandpa scolds me.

I usually don't have breakdowns but everything was loud and so much and I was thinking and my mind was so fast. Once I started crying and hyperventilating, I started thinking even more. I thought about my life and my friends and the future and my ex and my worth.

And then all the suicidal thoughts flooded my mind, I wanna be shot, I want to be stabbed in the head, I wanna swallow pills, I want to die. I started pulling my hair, pulling and pulling, and I wanted to scream. I stayed silent the entire time. I want to die. I want to die so badly. I felt the urge so badly, I got my pills out and I don't know how I turned that around. I didn't take them, but things might change.

All my senses were flooded and there were just so many thoughts running through my mind. I hate everything and want all my friends gone, they all make me worried and anxious and scared. I don't know what people think and it makes me terrified. I don't know how to fix myself, I want so badly to be normal. But I can't be normal, it's not fucking possible. I feel like the only solution is suicide. And I know I can do things, but how long will I have to feel so absolutely miserable? It's so unfair and I can't stand this loneliness.

If I killed myself, my family may hurt, but that won't be my problem once I'm gone, they can go absolutely ape shit if they want. I should feel bad, I do, but wow do I want to die.
