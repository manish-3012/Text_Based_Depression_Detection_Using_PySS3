Sorry for the double post...Well ... 

It is another 201 for me.

Voluntary commitment. 

I have to either sign myself in or I get 302ed.

:'( They saw my face and the decision was made for me.

I knew it was coming...and I will be probably going back down to the same hospital as before.

I am too numb to cry. I will miss my son's 5th birthday. Hopefully I will be able to call them.

I am scared.

This REALLY sucks.
