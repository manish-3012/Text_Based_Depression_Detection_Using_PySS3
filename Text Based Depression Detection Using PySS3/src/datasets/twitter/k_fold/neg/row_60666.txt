Need advice to save my boyfriendMy boyfriend has been really depressed lately and dealing with the lose of his dad 2 years ago. He told me last night he's had a gun to his head several times in the last week or so. I asked him to lock up his guns and he said no but he's worried he's getting closer to following through.

Do I keep an eye on him or push to remove the guns? 

I want to ask him to leave his office door open for a bit considering he's been doing all this while I'm 10 feet away. I cant stop thinking about all of this.
