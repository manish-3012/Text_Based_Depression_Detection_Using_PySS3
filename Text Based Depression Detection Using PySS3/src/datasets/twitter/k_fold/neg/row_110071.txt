Girl I have known for a year is depressed and keeps talking about killing herself. She lives with her 6 year old son and recently lost her job. Any advice?I'll try keep this brief. 
I met a girl around my age (30) about a year ago. It started off as FWB, we went on trips together, spent a lot of time 'together' etc etc. It was all good fun. We became really good friends and still are. We toyed with the idea of being a couple but we both want completely different things in life and I just don't see a future for us. Like I said, we're still good friends but she wants more I guess. 
She had recently split up with her son's father before I met her, so there was a little bit of awkwardness there, but nothing we couldn't handle. He has generally been a dick to her this whole time, making her feel alienated from his side of the family. (however, I only ever get her side of the story so I don't know 100% if what she tells me is true.) 
Anyway.. she lost her job around 3 months ago, she doesn't have any family to turn to, she only has a few friends and now she is talking about suicide.
I lost a very very good friend of mine to suicide 2 months ago to the day so this is really starting to bug me out. I dunno if she is serious however I don't want to wait to find out.
I wish I could explain the situation better but I'm at work typing this in a hurry. I don't really know what to do. I've told her to seek help but she's not into that. I spoke to a helpline, they told me they can't help unless she seeks help herself. 
Anyone got any words of advice?
