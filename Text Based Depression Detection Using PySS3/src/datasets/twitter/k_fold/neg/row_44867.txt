My life, my deathI wrote ya'll a book today, and then deleted it. 

I struggle with wanting to end my life a lot. 

I've swallowed a brigades worth of pills before and somehow woke up. 

There was this one time I was trying to quit cigarettes. I had tried a thousand times before. And I was on this smoking cessation app a lot which included a community message board thing. And one ladys comment really stuck with me. 

She posted this. 

God I really wish I could just go out and smoke one sweet cigarette on the porch. But then again, no, I don't. 

This was so powerful for me. And it translates into whatever the fuck you want it to. 

If you have that craving to end your life, that's so fucking okay, just know that after that craving, comes the craving to not do that. 

From somebody who's tried to end it all, 

From somebody who understands, 

I just wanted to share that, 

And I love you all.
