Another 'What's the point of living?' postI posted this to TrueAtheism, but I see that this is the more appropriate sub.

So I've been looking around to find a place to post about things I've been thinking about and found that this place seems helpful. I've also found an almost exact copy of the things I've been feeling.
So I'm not going to copy and paste the entire text, here is the link. https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1ffghk/whats_the_point_of_living/
The only reason that the reponses given in the link above applies to me is that I don't have the freedom said. I'll explain. I was born Muslim, raised by strict Muslim parents. After reading some articles and documents I'm not really meant to read, I've come to the conclusion that the God I used to believe in does not exist or is just not useful. I was overwhelmed for many weeks with this type of thinking, and even more so since I can't talk to anyone about it or I'll probably get thrown out of the house.
I feel very similar to the OP of the thread linked above. If I decide not to kill myself, I'll have to be Muslim or I'll get kicked out of the family and pretty much left with nothing. Now obviously I could just do that, but either decision seems like a bad idea. Being Muslim means I'll be living a fake life for the rest of my life, since being married and moving out of the house must mean that I am Muslim since my parents won't have it any other way or they will be worried that they will go to hell. If I'm not Muslim, I'll basically be a lonely hobo. Family that's different to you, is still family. I don't think I'd be able to fill the void.
I have a few years left of college that I plan on finishing since I don't need to pretend I'm Muslim there. I plan on killing myself once I graduate. I'm interested to hear what people will have to say. And sorry if my English is a bit muddled, I'll try to clarify anything.
