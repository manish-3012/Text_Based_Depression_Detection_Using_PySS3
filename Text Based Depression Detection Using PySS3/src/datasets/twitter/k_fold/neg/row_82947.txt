It's been years....But right in this moment, death has never been so welcoming. My world is shattering right now, and I no longer have the strength to try to hold it together. I wish my heart and soul would hurry up and die, since dead things cant feel right? I haven't felt pain like this in a very very long time. And the worst emotions are the ones that seem to take over your entire body. I want to scream. Rip my hair out. Tear my skin open. I want to die. I want to just cease to exist. The idea of nothingness and silence has never called to me so loudly..... I try to look forward. And all I can see is years and years and years of the same shit. I dont want it.
But I cant stand the thought of leaving my son. Or him not understanding. Or him ever having to feel this pain.
So no. I cant die just yet I dont think. But I need the inside of me to burn, until there's nothing left. I just need this pain to go away.
