What do you do to keep yourself distracted?From the fact that you want to off yourself. I find myself in this shitty situation again, like I just want to jump out of my skin and end it all. That pointless empty feeling. Yet at the same time I want that part of my brain to just shut the fuck up and never come back. God damn it, I have a long 4 hour drive tonight, I just might drive off a bridge, or in to a pole. Just fucking end it right there. It's so far up north it be days before anyone knew.
