I'm on hold with the suicide hotline for more than 45 minutes. I have lots of bottles of pills ready to go. Please help me.Climate change, the rich rule us all, I will work for most of my day and most of my life for money that is 90% spent on rent for a place I will be barely at that I do not own? What reasons are there to live? I am 26 years old.
