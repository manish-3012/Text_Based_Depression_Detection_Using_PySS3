F17. I just want to start life overI feel like a slut. I used to crave men and boys attention so much. It boosted whatever little self esteem I had. I feel disgusting now. My last sexual "relationship" online was just before I turned 17, this year. I had such strong feelings for this guy and then he dropped me like a used toy. I've never had a boyfriend yet it hurt like a real break up. I'm a virgin but I still feel so dirty knowing that I've exposed myself like this, since I was 15. I feel like such a naive, insecure idiot.

I don't want to kill myself. I just want to die. I'm too much of a coward but someday I might just break and finally do it. I randomly get the urge to drown myself when I feel low. I hate that feeling.

My anxiety and over thinking, gets so bad that I get into these derealisation episodes where nothing feels real. I end up with this nihilistic view of the world. My vision becomes so distorted that it's an active struggle to not to get hit by incoming traffic. I'd be happy if I did get hit but not if I was left alive with injuries. I don't know why I'm like this. I keep telling myself that shit can and will get better but my impulsive brain disagrees. Maybe I should see a therapist.

My good days are great and my bad days are so fucking bad
