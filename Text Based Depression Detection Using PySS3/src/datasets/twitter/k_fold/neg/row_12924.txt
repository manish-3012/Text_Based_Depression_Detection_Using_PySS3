How am I supposed to want to live in this world?I don't want to spend ~70 years making someone else money. I don't want to die at work. I don't want to bust my ass just to pay bills my whole life. And, most of all, I don't want to be just an account number.

I don't hate myself, I hate this world. I don't want to live in it, even if that means not living at all. What on earth is the point? All I can do is try to survive in the face of such soullessness. Why should I have to fight to survive every day? Why should I have to actively choose not to kill myself EVERY FUCKING DAY? It's harder every hour. 

I hate that just talking about this is so taboo. I talk to my boyfriend and he has no idea how to handle it, so we end up fighting and that just makes it worse. But if I went through with it he'd be broken, along with my parents.

Why am I so useless? No matter what I do. I slave away for 50 hours a week, but still my electricity was off all weekend because I couldn't eat *and* pay the power company. I haven't had running water in a year and a half. I can't possibly work any harder.

I don't know what to do. I am so tempted to just buy a bunch of liquor and drink that til I die one way or another. Or maybe a bunch of heroin or something. At least that way I can go out happy.

God, everything is so hard. I just want to be done.
