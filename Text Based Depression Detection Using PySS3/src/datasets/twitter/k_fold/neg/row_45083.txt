My friend has attempted a few times alreadyMy friend (20m) has been telling me for weeks that he's suicidally depressed and I've always stayed up til whatever hour hearing him out and trying to convince him that it's not the only way out. Tonight I was messaging him and he just told me that he has actually attempted a few times in the past few weeks and I just burst into tears. He hasn't had the best experience growing up, his dad left when he was 14, he's had several friends die over the years, at least two were to suicide. I can't relate with such experiences so it's hard to comfort him and try to convince him that life is worth living and his emotional pain might ease one day, I care about him so much, what should I say to him??
