Physical pain and mental illness donâ€™t mix well.Iâ€™m 30.  Iâ€™m a woman.  I went from working two jobs and my family farm to having 3 spinal surgeries in 10 months and disabled.  Had to move in with my now fiancÃ© to be closer to the doctors.  So Iâ€™m alone 11-13 hours a day while he works.  Heâ€™s asleep within 5-6 hours of getting home.  So I am alone 90% of my day.  

I have bipolar II.  I was diagnosed at 21.  On meds for years that worked great.  Now I have no insurance, which means no psych help.  The â€œpovertyâ€ coverage I have through the hospital that covered my surgeries doesnâ€™t cover psych care.  The primary care docs it does cover say mental health meds of any kind arenâ€™t in their scope of practice.  

I can barely dress myself.  I can barely bathe myself.  Most of the time I need help.  I canâ€™t even buy myself a soda if I want it.  My mom or fiancÃ© have to buy it for me.  I havenâ€™t worked in a year.  SSA says I could find some kind of work if the neurosurgeon would release me.  Which he wonâ€™t.  

I donâ€™t see any point in living really.  Iâ€™m a constant burden both physically and financially.  The only reason I havenâ€™t done it yet is because it would be more of a burden unless I could engineer an auto accident with a big truck or something.  That would cover funeral costs at least.  

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m bothering to post here.  I guess I just needed to get whatâ€™s in my head onto paper so to speak.
