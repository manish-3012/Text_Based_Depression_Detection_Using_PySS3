Everyone's fucking abandoning meI have nowhere else to turn. I have one or two friends that I can talk to maybe but other than that I'm alone. I wish I succeeded in my attempt last night because it's sure as hell better than being alive now. I'm going to die alone. The one thing I was scared of. I can't fucking deal with this anymore
