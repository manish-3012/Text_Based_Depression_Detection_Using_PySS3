Mistakes they say, EY? Meaningless. The soul will prevail any biological disposition. OCD, BDP, DPD, all undying but undefining. Disorders don't scratch the soul like society crawls into us all. Death, unconsciousness, nothing with ruin us. They want us to suffer, it can love but it can hate. Evil.With karma, with illness. It doesn't hate you, she will realise. It will see you. The soul is matter; matter doesn't die. If you're suffering, she understands you, but they don't. I'm sorry.
