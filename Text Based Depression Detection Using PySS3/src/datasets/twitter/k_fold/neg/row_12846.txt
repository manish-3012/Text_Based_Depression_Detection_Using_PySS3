Chronic pain is killing my will to liveIm chronically ill with debilitating migraines. I work to get health insurance that keeps me healthy enough to keep working for health insurance. Im in pain almost everyday. I dont want to wake up anymore. I have a wonderful boyfriend and amazing life with him but i cant stop feeling guilty. I put him through so much. With insurance i still have thousands in medical debt and cant afford to save for anything or pay down my school debt. I dont know what to do anymore. I dont want to be alive anymore.
