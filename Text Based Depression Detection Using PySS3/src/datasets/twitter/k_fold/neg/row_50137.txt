I don't know what to do...Hi... I'm not sure how this works. I haven't been on reddit very long and I tend to screw up anything I do, so if I'm doing this wrong, I'm sorry... I just don't know what else to do and maybe if I get this off my chest I'll feel better for a little while..
So yeah... I've been wanting to end my life and have been self harming off and on for about 6 years now.. It started as me just feeling like a reject because I was a tomboy who liked pokemon and bugs in a class of popular, stuck up people. I got picked on and put down so much. But now it's cause I feel like a hopeless failure.. All I do is cling to my boyfriend, panic, and cause problems... My boyfriend is sweet.. But he gets fustrated and ends up yelling at me if I get scared and wanna hurt myself... I feel like a failure though cause I cling and cling to him... I don't mean to... I just can't help it... I end up crying if I don't talk to him for a day or if he falls asleep while afk... He falls asleep often and I dunno... I just get scared... And I don't know what to do... I feel like a hopeless failure...
