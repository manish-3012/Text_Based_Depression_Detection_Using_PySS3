I have a plan and a date. Calm and anxious at the same time about it thoughIts all I can think about. Planning on after Thanksgiving so then at least I won't ruin that holiday. 

I don't know, makes everything thing else seem less important now that I have a plan. I'm scared to die of course (which is where the anxiety comes from) but this shit sucks and will continue on sucking. I don't care of anyone cares about me, I guess that's the problem. They'll either get over it or die eventually themselves. Eventually, it doesn't matter.
