Best solution for my dogs.....Most nights I feel like I need to be hospitilized due to whats going on in my life......I have two kids but can make my wife who left me take them.  My problem is my dogs.  Due to how my life has been with no friends and such dogs have always had more value to me than human life which is hard to explain.    If something happened to me my kids may have issues following but my dogs....They would think I abandoned them since they wouldnt understand.   I just dont know how to go about this.    I had a thought of maybe offering money for a person or family to take my dogs in....I could say I have a terminal disease and dont have long but would be afraid of people looking for a quick buck.   Any suggestions on what I can do?   To be clear I am definitely suicidal but open to hospitalization if I can plan for my dogs.....
