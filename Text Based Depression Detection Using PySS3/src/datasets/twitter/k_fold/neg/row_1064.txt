"What are your goals and dreams?""You can do anything you want. You can be anything you want."

That's not true. What I wanted was to be with her. What I wanted to be was happy-- with her. I messed it all up. It's all my fault, and I probably deserve this. I've talked to people about this, and I'm honestly worried I'm going to hurt myself... but apparently admitting myself would be giving up. I'm trying to be strong. I'm trying not to give up, but I can't do it anymore. I'm sick. I want to get off this fucked up ride we call "life".
