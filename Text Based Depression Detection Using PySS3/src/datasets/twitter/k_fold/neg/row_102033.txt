The world is fucked. There should be no reason for this subreddit. No reason to feel this much pain. . .I feel like a psychopath, a sociopath, like I have depression and ADD. I'm too afraid to kill myself, and I'm too afraid to keep living. I've never even thought about living in the now. My entire life has been about the future and college. Because I need to get out of here. Idk if I can make it. I have nothing to lose. I can honestly say I love nobody. I've never felt love. I've felt hate. So much hate.
