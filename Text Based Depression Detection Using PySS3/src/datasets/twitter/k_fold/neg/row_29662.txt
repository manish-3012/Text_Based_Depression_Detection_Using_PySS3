I created my own prisonI donâ€™t want to be here. Every time I start to feel okay I end up misstepping and going down this thought pattern. I have so much to be happy about but even if the things I own get nicer itâ€™s still a prison. Iâ€™m never going to be able to get over my anxiety and fears. Iâ€™m going to be stuck day after day going between my room and work never able to form any meaningful connections. I canâ€™t drive. I canâ€™t handle other people. Theyâ€™re going to hurt me and I only have places like reddit to feel like Iâ€™m talking to someone. Iâ€™m always going to be that five year old girl who was ruined before she could understand what happened to her. I donâ€™t think my brother will care too much. I hope he takes care of my cat. Iâ€™ll really miss him but I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore.
