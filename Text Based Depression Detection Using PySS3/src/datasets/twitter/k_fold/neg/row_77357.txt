Losing HopeI am losing hope... grades are slipping, don't have many friends, feel alone even when I am around my few good friends, spend most of my time alone nowadays. Ever since I started high school my grades have dropped rapidly, I went from a A/B+ student to a C/D student. I hate school and want to become homeschooled or some other form of schooling, I am an outcast, a "weirdo" and I hate it, I fucking hate it. I can't handle stress very well, I get angry, frustrated, just lock myself away for a while until I hope things get better, but they never do. I am not feeling alright and sometimes I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up.
