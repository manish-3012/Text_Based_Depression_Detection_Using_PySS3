Typo in a suicide noteImagine how humiliating it would be to have a spelling or grammatical error in a suicide note! Would anyone out there be willing to help me proofread?

Not that I should have to explain myself, but if it makes anyone more willing to help me, my passing will help a lot of people I love, and I am very happy and at peace with my decision. I just want my goodbye letter to be the best it can be.

Please help!! Consider it the last wish of a terminally ill person:)
