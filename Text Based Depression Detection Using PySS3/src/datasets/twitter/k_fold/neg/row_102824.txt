No takingMonths ago i started to make a playlist of music that would lead me to it. I donâ€™t really have anything to love and there is nothing that i am loved by. Im just a grey object. Im just so tired of being nice to people when all i get is negative feedback. Im tired of being used and taken advantage of, Iâ€™m tired of being the person that i put out to be. 

Im done. yeah being that kind person gets you far, but Iâ€™ve found out that its been holding me back even more.

My gun is loaded and im ready for it to take me away because im tired of being me. I cant change who i am.
