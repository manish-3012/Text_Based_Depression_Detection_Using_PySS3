Relapsing...Ive been seriously getting the urge to cut again. My depression keeps coming back in waves each day. Its like im fine, then something happens, and boom. I wanna cut myself, lay in bed and cry and starve to death, or just sit in the bath tub for 2 hours again and just cry it out or think about not existing.
Im struggling so much lately...
I feel like such a shitty human and so worthless. I feel guilty.
