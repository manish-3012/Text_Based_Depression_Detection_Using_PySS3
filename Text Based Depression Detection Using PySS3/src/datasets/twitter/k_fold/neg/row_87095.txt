Am I suicidal?There was one night I absolutely was. I was on the top floor of a hotel and went on a walk to get away from the stairwells and knives, taking my dog because I couldnâ€™t risk her getting lost by stepping in front of a car, and texted suicide support as soon as I got back. I felt like trash, and it was worsened because the reasons I wanted to stop living were because of homework and selfish matters, not because I felt like my family would be better off without me, and the biggest reason I kept going was because the final season of my favorite show isnâ€™t aired yet and I want to see it. I felt so guilty because I couldnâ€™t even be selfless in something like this. 

But now... I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™ve never been in a space so dark again where it seemed like my only hope and seemed inevitable, with no logic telling me otherwise, but I still spend so much time of the day thinking about how I would, looking over second-flooring railings and thinking if it would kill me, and just thinking about the topic in general- but I havenâ€™t again felt like I wanted to actually do it, although maybe I just got better at denying my own thoughts. I donâ€™t know if that counts as suicidal... does it?

For those of you curious, Iâ€™m taking the first step in getting help tomorrow, but I want to know if this is suicidal or not.
