I don't mean anything to anybody everI'm not important. What I wish is to be someone's #1, for someone to chase me and tell me I fucking matter when I'm mad and leave, or to be cared about. But nobody does. Nobody ever will.

So tonight might be the night. If not tonight, then definitely tomorrow. I need to do it. Nobody fucking cares. Everybody has someone, except for me.
