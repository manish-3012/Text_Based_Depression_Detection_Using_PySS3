i don't know what to do with myselfi'm so disgusting, weird and perverted. i can't understand why i have a best friend because i treat her like shit and we never hang out. i just dump my feelings onto her when i feel like it, we used to be so good for each other. i constantly lie to my parents and i lie to my psychiatrist. i downplay the severity of my depression and i just force a smile and move on. i've been fake smiling for so long that i am beginning to feel completely plastic. also sick.. i see no way out of this except to die maybe.. but my parents love me so much.

i've low key been wishing that they die in a car accident or in a burglary, i hate myself for this, but i want to be free to end my life.
