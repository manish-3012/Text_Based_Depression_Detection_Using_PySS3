No one's going to read this unless its Hot.There's a four level parking complex nearby, and I feel that I'm ready to jump. I'm a college student who feels like there's nothing more to life because I don't have a stupid piece of paper. My teachers are apathetic to those who are struggling mentally due to Covid, I'm honestly ready to just go. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years and even dreams of people celebrating knowing they don't have to deal with me anymore. My mind tells me no one likes me, they pretend to like me and who I am, yet I feel like a lie. I may not do it today, but I may soon because I'm terrified of dying, but I just want to go. I know no one will read this, I'm just a worthless existence that doesn't matter on this website.
