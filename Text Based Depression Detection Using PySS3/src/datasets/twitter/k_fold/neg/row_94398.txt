Prolonged Suicidal Episode?I'm going to be brief. For that last month or so (I guess since NY) ive had this thought in my head. If I had to kill myself quickly, I would take it.

My teachers have caught me several times running my pencil across my wrist when I blank out and I am completely unaware of this.

Does my body *want* to die? I feel that if dying was painless, I would've done it by now.

If anybody is going to mention my friends/family I would leave behind, I know. It's just that in this weird state, death is the only thing I could think of.

I just ask for help or understanding people. Should I confront my parents? Go to a doctor? Talk to a counselor/therapist?
