It's all just a cycleIt really is just a cycle... Im depressed, also suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and anxiety,  and i fight hard enough to "beat it" and now life is well I have a pregnant wife sleeping next to me, a job waiting for me tomorrow but somehow I've spiraled all the way back down again and I just figured out that no one ever "beats" mental illnesses... They just creep back into your life and it becomes worst then ever before ! So if this shit show going on in my pathetic life just keeps haunting me till the end of my days then why would I bother "fighting" to get better ? Why can't I just impale myself and just slip away ? Because it never leaves you, you'll feel like shit forever so what's the fucking point ?
