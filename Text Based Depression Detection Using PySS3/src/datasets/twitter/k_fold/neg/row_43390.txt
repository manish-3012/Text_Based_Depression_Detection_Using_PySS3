I can't... It's so stressful...I just can'tI just want it to end. I'm sick if being cold, stressed out and feeling overwhelmed and empty. 

I want to cut myself really badly but I can't. I can't cope right now it feels like there's something stuck in my throat and in panicking. There's nothing to be panicked about but I am. 

Why is life so awful? What's wrong with me? Why can't I just have a normal happy childhood? What happened.

You dont need to reply to my bullshit, it was just a vent sorry for wasting your time.
