My intrusive thoughts have pushed me to the edge.I suffer from intrusive thoughts. Theyâ€™ve gotten really bad recently and they get worse and worse and more disturbing. I donâ€™t think I can take it anymore. Really Iâ€™m just ready to either slash my arms or swallow a bunch of pills cause I canâ€™t get rid of them cause theyâ€™re so scary that I am afraid of them.
