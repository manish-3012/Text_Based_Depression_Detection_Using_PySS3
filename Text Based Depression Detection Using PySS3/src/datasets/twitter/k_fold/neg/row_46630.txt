I'm a fucking failure...I'm not good at anything. I have no social skills (aside from formal work type social conversations). I'm not good at athletics. I never have.

I'm just lucky that I got into engineering. Its just luck. I was just lucky that community college ---&gt; state school transferring is a thing.

But throughout high school I've been an entire failure, but I come to college with optimism and I've gone nowhere. My grades are only subpar.

I try to work on projects and stuff but just have no motivation or drive. I have no schedule and just waste my time playing video games and jacking off. I don't have any courage to ask a girl out nor do I have friends.

Out of the only two hobbies I have, video games and cars, the first one is toxic and detrimental to my success, while for the second one I have no money. I want to make money, but...

I go to career fairs quite bold and have a good conversation with recruiters, but nothing...

Sigh... What is life for me even?
