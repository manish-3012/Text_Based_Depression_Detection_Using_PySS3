my attention isnt good enoughmy friend who blocked me wasnt on the internet for a whiel and her other friend basically checked up on her publicly and she said that she appreciates it alot because "noone's ever checked up on her like this before" which is not true because i checked up on her everyday (like i hope you're okay, i hope youre gonna have a nice day" and stuff) and she's not the first person who did something like that to me so i think that noone appreciates my attention because they realize that its not really worth much as i dont have many people to talk to?
