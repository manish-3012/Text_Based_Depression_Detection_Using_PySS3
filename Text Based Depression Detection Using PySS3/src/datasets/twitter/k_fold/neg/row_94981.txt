HelpI have the second day of my job tonight at 10 pm and I want to die before then. I really donâ€™t want to go. My anxiety is absolutely horrible. I need relief. I will either go in the woods to hang myself so I canâ€™t be saved or I will drive to a bridge. Is a 175 foot drop into water enough to die? Itâ€™s the highest bridge near me. Itâ€™s around a 3 hour drive. Iâ€™m scared of heights. Iâ€™m terrified and shaking.
