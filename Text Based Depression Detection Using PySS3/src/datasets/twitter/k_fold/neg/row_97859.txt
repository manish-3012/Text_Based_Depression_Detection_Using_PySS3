Im gonna f*cking do itIm gonna kill myself. Im going to slit my wrists and hang myself. I already self harm and I have Jack shit to live for. So here is my fucking note.

"I have tried and tried to find a reason to keep living and yet here I am. Everything I try I get wrong. Suicide is just whats best for my mental health. I won't self harm anymore, I won't have to deal with suicidal thoughts anymore, and my dysphoria will f innaly stop. Here I am, giving up. I gave it my final decision 10:10 monday January 20th 2020. Goodbye."
