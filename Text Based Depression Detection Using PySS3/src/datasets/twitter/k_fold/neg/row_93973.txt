My dads thinking about suicideI was talking to my mother down stairs and she was asking me how to look at the search History in my dads tablet. At first, I was thinking she was 'suspecting' him of doing something, which doesn't sound like my mom nor my dad. I then seen her show me Google searches that popped up about him wanting to kill himself on Christmas and other suicide search queries.

I didn't show her how to look at the History. But I'm now really concerned. I've never been close with my dad, but seeing those search results made my heart drop. As I type this my eyes are getting all watery and I've not cried since I can remember. I'm just scared, I don't want my dad to do anything impulsive, but I can't say anything to him either.

I know I have Googled similar things in the past and I'm alive and well. So I'm hoping his searches are for similar, small depression reasons.

I don't even know what I'm asking for in this post, to be honest. Do I act different to him? Normal? Happier? Do I say anything, does my mom?
