My StoryI doubt you remember this post but, it was this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fxpzs/i_have_no_friends_only_strangers_who_i_slightly/) when I was feeling very depressed and suicidal and I told my best friend "sometimes it feels like I hardly know you". She jokingly said "I know", which sent me over the edge. I thought if I don't know her who do I know? Well, I found out the night after she was joking. 
A little bit after that I sent myself to the hospital. I just checked myself in. I realized I needed help and wanted it. When I got there I was introduced to a nice women, a patient who really introduced me to everyone and got me settled in. I enjoyed my time in the hospital and I enjoyed the company of everyone in there. When I left, I left a better happier person, though I feel guilty of putting all of my friends through my shit.
