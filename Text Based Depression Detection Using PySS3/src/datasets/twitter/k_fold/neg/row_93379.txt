31 years old, failure at everything, why continue?I'm 31. Still live at home. I fucked up and missed 2 deadlines for my job. I am a complete and total failure, a worthless piece of shit taking up someone else's air. 

I'll never have anyone that loves me, besides for my mother and grand parents. I'll never have a family. I'll always be alone. I'll always be nothing but a fucking failure. If there is one thing I have a great talent for, it's fucking up everything I ever attempt to do.

I know the place I want to go to do it. I just need to decide on the method. I'm not ready quite yet, but knowing I have it all planned out will help a lot.
