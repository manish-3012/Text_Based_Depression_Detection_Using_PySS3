I'm afraid I'll commit suicide.I'm 18 and I never thought I'd live this long. I always thought I'd kill myself before I turned 18. Because of that, I didn't really plan my life. Why plan for something that you don't think you'll get to live? So now I should move out of my mother's house and find an apartment to live in, and a job obviously. And I don't know how to do that, or any of the things that's expected from me. And honestly, I don't even have the will to do any of that. I'm depressed. I can't imagine my life getting better, or me ever being happy. I'm still alive because of my boyfriend but now even him is acting weird and that makes me feel worse.

God, I want to die.
