I feel so selfishMy 2 best friends are in an awesome relationship. I will never find what they have, I will die alone, so y not just end the hurting now. I dont want to but I've tried so many ways to find happiness alone and it doesnt help because theres that constant reminder of what I will never have someone. Ik theres "plenty of people put there" and "I'll find someone someday". Idc. I feel like I ruin the vibe and put too much on my friends...
Idk..
I'm thinking abt taking a bunch of my sleeping pills but from what I've read they make u throw up a ton
Idk
