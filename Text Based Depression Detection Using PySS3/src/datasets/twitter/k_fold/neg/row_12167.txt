People are monstersAnd I'm upset that I didn't succeed in my attempt. I'm not looking forward to anything. 
And I'm an adult in the shady cruel adult world where people mess you up too.
I really had nothing and anything that held me knead taken from me. 
I'm well aware that most people are garbage and become  that way...
I've learned to let some people go.
