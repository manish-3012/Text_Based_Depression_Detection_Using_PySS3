I'm going for a walk.I never thought I'd actually attempt suicide. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but never acted upon them. It was like I was a different person.
I was ready to die that night, when I thought I lost everything for the second time. The first time I lost everything, living was so awful, it's hard to put in words. It was all my fault. I wanted to be punished, and death was the only suitable punishment. 
I cried until I couldn't cry, and then I would cry more. I didn't have anyone, but I didn't deserve that. In so much pain, I was already as good as dead. 
Even in my darkest abyss, however, there is a light. I survived, and fought for a second chance. This time around, the light was gone. I had lost something important to me. My fault again. 
As soon as I realized, my soul had left. My thoughts left my mind, and I lost my voice.
It was about 9:30 PM, below freezing. I opened the door, with my brother asking where I was off to. 
"I'm going for a walk," I managed to say. 
Only wearing shorts, a t-shirt, a light jacket, and sneakers, I just started walking. Wasn't going anywhere, just walking. I was hoping to freeze to death, or get hit by a car. I fell a few times because of the ice and snow, but I kept walking. 
I was outside for an hour. There was no turning back now. I didn't even know where I was. As I was ready to inflict more pain on myself, I got a phone call. From my mother. She noticed I was out for a while. Listening to her voice, sobbing, I snapped out of it. I didn't want to die, nobody does. I was just terrified of living in guilt. I was terrified of living like I did when I lost everything. But I didn't lose everything. 
After the call, I had to get back home. I didn't realize how dark, scary, and cold it was. Instead of walking, I ran. Following my own footsteps, I ran the whole way back home. Felt like Forest Gump. I was exhausted.
In the lights of my house, I notice my hands were a deep blue. Everything hurt. I looked in the mirror, I looked like someone else. 
When my mother called, my phone was at 1%. If it wasn't on, I would be dead today.


Sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense, I left out a lot of details. I just wanted to put this somewhere. I'm sorry for anyone who has go to through things like this, and I hope they make it out alive.
