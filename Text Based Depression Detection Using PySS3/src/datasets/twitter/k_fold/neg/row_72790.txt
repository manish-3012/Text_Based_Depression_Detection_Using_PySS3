Starting to feel better sometimes but nothing has changed-- so instead of feeling like shit all the time, I now feel like a leaf growing in shit sometimes. What am I supposed to do with this?For instance, I had a series of panic attacks from 1am-5am today. It is now 9am and I have spent the last hour or so giving and receiving love to and from people on here. I am feeling better and can sleep peacefully but it feels so odd because now I am feeling nice sometimes while everything around me continues to burn. Why does this not feel good?... it just makes me feel all wrong because now my inner state somethings does not match the shitty outer conditions and it feels abnormal and alien. I know I will wake up to the same things and unchanging situations that have driven me to this point in the first place.

Is this what healing should feel like?????? Is this me getting better?? It feels alien.. I have been drowning for so long that breathing, even for a few hours, feels unnatural.
