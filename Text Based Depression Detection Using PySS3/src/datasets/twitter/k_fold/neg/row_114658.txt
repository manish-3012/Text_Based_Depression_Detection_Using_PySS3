I don't feel like fighting anymoreI don't know where to start. I've had severe depression since I was eleven or twelve. I was homeschooled in a highly religious family, but I deconverted when I was sixteen. Three years after, about nine months ago, I had saved up some money and moved away from my family and the bible belt. My homeschooling background and a spat of failed grades from a particularly dark time while I was doing dual credit at community meant I wouldn't be able to get the sort of scholarships that would let me study at college without extreme debt, but I hoped that I could build a new life for myself and then go.

I was wrong, and for all these years I've been promising myself things would change with my circumstances, that I'd find a way up and out. They haven't, and I really don't believe they will, now. I've tried a lot of things, and the net result is that I'm at my wits end.

I fought through everything going on internally, and tried to get past my external challenges to build something better, and I've consistently failed. The conventional wisdom is that you try and try again because you only need to succeed once, but I don't believe I will, I've seen no evidence that it will ever happen. Broken, incompetent, or stupid, whatever I am won't even let me build a decent life, nevermind one the ambitious part of me would ever accept as something worth having.

I am done. I don't want to hold this back anymore. I've gone on long enough to know that I wasn't going to accomplish anything meaningful.
