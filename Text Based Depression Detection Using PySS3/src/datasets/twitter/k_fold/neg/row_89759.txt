Does anyone know what is wrong with me?For about three years now I have been having suicidal thoughts, I have never self harmed or attempted anything but I see suicide as a inevitability, not exactly soon but I feel like I am literally just waiting for a good reason to do it. 
For starters I just want to clarify that I have a completely good life and nothing has ever happened to me that I believe would trigger this frame of mind.
After reading about what it is like to be depressed, I don't believe I am (although I could be wrong). I literally just see no meaning in life, I don't hate myself (although I do sometimes get locked into that train of thought) or see the world as a downright horrible place (Although its negative aspects are all I seem to thing about). Also both my grandfather and aunt killed themselves from depression. I have had trouble sleeping for years now. I know it sounds like I am to sound like I have depression but I genuinely don't feel like I am. 
To make it easier to understand I will say it like this, lets say there is a book, I acknowledge why other people like this book and can even see some things in it that I find good but overall I just don't like the book and find it really boring and although I am okay with it there is no chance in hell I am reading all the way to the end.
I have already went to a therapist with my Mom (The only one who knows) and I was told that I over think, I am also kind of annoyed that if they gave this diagnoses that would at least tell me away to stop it but I guess they thought I am just going to grow out of it I am only 16, so I guess it could be hormones.
Long story short (After telling the long story), I see life as not worth it and the only place that I truly like is inside my imagination. Does anyone know what this is? Please?
