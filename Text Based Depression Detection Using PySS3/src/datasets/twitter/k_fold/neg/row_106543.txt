Reading about people missing human touch makes me so fucking madYou're only just realising how fucking privileged you were to have friends who'd hug you, parents who'd hold you, lovers who'd kiss you. Some of us never ever got to experience that. When it's all over, you'll be able to go back to that.

I won't.

I won't ever know what any of that is like.

Hopefully I'm just able to kill myself asap now. Hopefully I don't fucking fail this time. With the mancubus' blessings.
