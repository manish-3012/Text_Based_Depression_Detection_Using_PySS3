Recently had an attempt on my lifeI tried to hang myself at age 13 on May 5th. I can't stop thinking about what it had felt like to feel the overwhelming urge to take a breath even though I couldn't. There was no light or recap of my life, my vision slowly faded until I couldn't see, breath, or hear. The thoughts are hard to shake and I find myself throughout the day going over every second of what happened. I cant stop thinking about what it had felt like and Idont know what to do.
