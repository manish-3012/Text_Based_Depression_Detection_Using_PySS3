I wish I knew what was wrong with my personality.Every close friend I make seems to go off me after knowing me for a few months. Sometimes it takes less than a month. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with my personality; Iâ€™ve stopped being clingy and Iâ€™m not confrontational. My most successful friendships are with people I only know casually. Iâ€™m so hurt and feel so alone. I am happy in my own company but it hurts knowing that thereâ€™s something inherently wrong with me that makes people want to distance themselves from me. Im so sad and frustrated. I just want to be like other people. Thereâ€™s no point in even trying anymore.
