DatesSo, I've made it very clear to myself since I was about 13 that I'd definitely be dead before I'm 20. But I think I'm gonna shorten that down to the end of this year, which is not actually that far off but oh well.  


Of course, I've attempted multiple times before, and I probably will do so before this deadline. But its good to have plans methinks.
