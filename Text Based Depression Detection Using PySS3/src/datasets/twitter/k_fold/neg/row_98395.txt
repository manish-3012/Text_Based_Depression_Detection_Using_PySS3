Thank YouLast night I opened up about something I did when I was in was in one of the lowest points in my life.  Itâ€™s something that Iâ€™m deeply ashamed of and if I could take it back, I would.   

I was planning to take my own life so that I could protect my family from this shame, rather than have their lives stained by this shame too.   My family would mourn a son and brother who had so much potential in his life.

To my surprise, a lot of you reached out and the now deleted thread blew up with people offering me advice, comfort, and sympathy.   I want to thank you all for your words, I was able to read most of them before the post was removed and the account was suspended.  If they werenâ€™t after me before, Iâ€™m certain they are now.

I read through my note and thought about all of the people I mentioned, and how many times I told someone I loved them or was grateful for their friendship.   I talked about special memories shared together or qualities I admired about them.   I wanted them to all know how very sorry I was and how much I know how badly theyâ€™re hurting. 

I had been drinking quite a bit that night went to bed after I had written the note, and I thought about my poor mother.   I thought about all of the love and affection she had and still does give me.  I thought about how warm and safe I always felt when she held me as a child.  I know itâ€™s weird to say, but as an adult I still feel the same sense of safety when she hugs me.    I thought about all of the pain sheâ€™ll feel in her heart if I left this world.  I wish I hadnâ€™t ruined my life to the point where Iâ€™m I feel like thereâ€™s a binary choice of equally ruinous outcomes.   

When I woke up this morning, I thought about some of the small things Iâ€™ll miss.  Iâ€™ll miss the feeling of carpet on my bare feet and the warmth of the blanket I always use during the winter.  

Everything feels a little unreal today, like Iâ€™ve already died and Iâ€™m grieving for the life I once had.  It still feels like everything is over, that thereâ€™s no use in thinking about a future I wonâ€™t see.  I still feel like I need to leave this world while Iâ€™m still the hardworking and irreverent man that so many see me as.     I still feel like if I left this world, I could could protect my loved ones even if it meant breaking their hearts.  I feel like Iâ€™m running out of time to come to a decision.  Iâ€™m scared about whatâ€™s going to happen next.  

Everyone, thank you for all of your kind words.  I know that I donâ€™t deserve them, but I am grateful for them.
