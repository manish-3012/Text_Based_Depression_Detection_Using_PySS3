There's only one reason I haven't killed myself yet, and it's not a very good one. (CW: rape)When I was 17, I was raped.  He was my boyfriend at the time.  He'd done something, asked if it was ok if he slept with someone else on his upcoming 18th birthday, or something like that, and it had disgusted me.  I didn't want to have sex with him that night, but "no" was not an answer he liked to hear.  Previously, when I'd said "no", he just got me drunk, but that night he just kept pushing and pushing until I gave in, because I felt like I had to.

I had a history of being abused before that.  My family was not a good one.  He knew this.  He had also systematically isolated me from all of my friends.  He knew there was nobody else in my life, and he knew that gave him power.
I cried the whole way through, and even though he didn't "finish", because "it really started feeling like I was raping you, and I'm not a rapist", that didn't erase the previous... fifteen or so minutes, if I remember correctly.  He didn't stop for me.  He stopped for his own self-image.

To this day, he is the only person I have had sex with, willingly or otherwise, and that's the only reason I haven't killed myself yet.  I don't want to die knowing he was the only person ever to have fucked me, it feels like he's winning.  Especially since it's been over half a decade since it happened, and I've still not been able to be with someone else.

I feel like that's slowly becoming less and less of a concern though.  Nobody would want me now anyway.  I have no life in me, there's nothing about me that would attract another person.  I recently realised, after spending several months without any of my friends contacting me, that I could literally have already been rotting and nobody would have noticed.

I don't know why I've not done it.  Maybe I'm scared of the pain of failure.
