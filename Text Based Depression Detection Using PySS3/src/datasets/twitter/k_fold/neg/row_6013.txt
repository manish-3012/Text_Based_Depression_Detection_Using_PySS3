What are you meant to do when faced with a truth you can't handle?I did some thinking today and I came upon a realization that honestly makes me want to go ahead with my suicide plan. 

To others it would be entirely inconsequential and unimportant, but for me, it's so much more. I based my whole life and whole plan on the one thing I thought I knew only to have it also taken away from me. The one thing that kept me sane all these years is now gone because of this fucking curse. I can't even pretend it's still there anymore, it just wouldn't be the same. It's gone. That's the truth. 

Now I just feel like an empty carcass, more than I have in most of my life. The only reasonable thing to do with something that's empty is to throw it away, right?
