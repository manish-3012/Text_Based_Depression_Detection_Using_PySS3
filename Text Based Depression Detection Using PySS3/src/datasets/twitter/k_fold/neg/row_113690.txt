I just don't have the energy to live anymoreI know suicide would hurt my family, but I don't feel capable of supporting or loving myself in any way. I'm alone in a big city, the person who I was planning to marry abruptly ended it and completely destroyed my self confidence, and honestly I don't really know or think saying anything more is worth it. I've been trying so hard to stand on my own two feet, but I honestly am useless.
