I canâ€™t do thisIâ€™m on the edge of losing my job at a startup because of my mental illness. Customer service game has drastically changed and of course they fell into the metrics game to see how much you are worth numbers wise, which is extremely disappointing for a startup to get to that stage.. but my mental illness has been keeping me from secretly working from home to try and heal because Iâ€™m not getting better while Iâ€™m there, now my coworker/friend has told me that they are looking into seriously letting me go because of it, Iâ€™ve asked them for help several times and I keep just falling more and more behind, but they donâ€™t believe me because I donâ€™t close enough tickets a week, but I am always at the max tickets everyday. So now Iâ€™m feel like im going to get let go, I know itâ€™s all my fault, im just so pathetic and helpless, Iâ€™m trying to get into a different field of work which is graphic design but Iâ€™m not good nor do I have the experience to get a job. So Iâ€™m trapped, I either just keep jumping to customer service job until I die or I just end my life now. Iâ€™ve planned it out, and Iâ€™m ready to just end it all. I canâ€™t get out of this hole and I canâ€™t move home, I canâ€™t afford it, Iâ€™m in a lease Iâ€™m so fucking trapped with debt I want to cry, I want to die so bad, Iâ€™m so fucking lost, thereâ€™s no fucking help, because nothing is just given, and I donâ€™t think I can keep doing this, 5 years is long enough, Iâ€™m just ready to overdose or just kill myself in my car. I need help but there is none, I canâ€™t do this I canâ€™t Iâ€™m 27 and Iâ€™m ready to fucking die.

Life doesnâ€™t get better, I want to die or someone to kill me because I donâ€™t fucking belong here
