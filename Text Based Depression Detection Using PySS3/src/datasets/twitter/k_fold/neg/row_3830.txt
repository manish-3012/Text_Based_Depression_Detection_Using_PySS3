I had a vivid nightmare last night of killing myself.This nightmare was very strong. It detailed me using a method with a moderately high success rate, and that I had easy access to. In the dream, it was late at night. I attempted it in the dorm bathroom. I felt psychosomatic pain from the violent nature of the method. And that pain lasted for a few minutes after I woke up.

So I'm afraid. I'm afraid that I will actually attempt. My dream showed me just how easy it would be. It showed me how much it would physically hurt, so I might be numb to the pain if I actually tried. And it messed me up enough so as to make going through today so much harder, giving me a stronger feeling of having nothing left.
