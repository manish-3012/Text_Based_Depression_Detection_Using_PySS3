Iâ€™m thinking on going out on the train tracks get wasted and kill myselfIâ€™ve fucked up my life to the point I donâ€™t know where to start to fix it.  I was born premature and have been fucked up by a range of disabilities my whole life. None in particular are bad by themselves but together itâ€™s always set me apart from everyone. Iâ€™m not disabled enough to mix in with the disabled crowd but I feel like I never fit in with everyone else and they kind of resent me. I had friends in school but they seem to have gone their seperate ways after school and never kept in contact with me and I feel like they donâ€™t want me to call them up, even if I could I canâ€™t drive anywhere.

I could go on a long spiel about how women hate me and all want chads but to be perfectly honest I had a fair amount of shots with women but lacked the confidence to take it any further. I know Iâ€™m ugly as fuck but there is someone for everyone you know.

My mum kicked me out of the house cause I got in a fight with her ex and around the same time I dropped out of uni. I wish I could blame it all on her but the thought of being who I am in a work space frightened me out of my field. Iâ€™m interested in film but Iâ€™m nearly 23 and lack the drive to push myself to begin all over in a new field.

Iâ€™m working with my dad with what amounts to really a scam company that while technically legal still feels like Iâ€™m leeching off society.

Iâ€™ve let my life get beyond all fucked up and now there really is no turning back. Iâ€™m gonna end it. Iâ€™ve scouted  an entry point onto the tracks and fantasised about killing myself there before. Itâ€™s night and everyoneâ€™s asleep. I canâ€™t bring myself to write a suicide note so this is it. I hope my brother and my sister push on without me and become the people they aspire to be.
