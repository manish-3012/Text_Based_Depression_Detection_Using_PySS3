I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t
So Iâ€™ve been struggling a lot these past year, Iâ€™ve been bullied because of my weight and my parents would sometimes add on to that. I started self harming (which I immediately regretted) and my mum found out. I havenâ€™t been to a therapist cause I didnâ€™t want my school to find out. I started feeling better in 2019 but now quarantine has got me into this hole again. I want to kill myself but Iâ€™m not going to cause that will be selfish for the people that love me and myself because I have a life ahead of me. Itâ€™s just this pain I feel is eating me up inside but nobody understands. I donâ€™t want to call the suicide prevention hotlines or speak to someone for something Iâ€™m going to get over. Itâ€™s just these thoughts at the back of my head thatâ€™s bugging me. Iâ€™m like those funny people that are super sad lol. But I know Iâ€™m going to be fine.
