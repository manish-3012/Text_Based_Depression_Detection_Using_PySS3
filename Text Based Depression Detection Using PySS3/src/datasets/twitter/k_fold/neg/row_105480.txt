My Suicide NoteTo anyone who may care,

My name is XXXXX XXXXXXX and I have decided to take my own life.  I am XX years old and a retired Military Officer.  I served in numerous military combat operations over the past years.
My wife is XXXXX XXXXXXX who resides in our house located at XXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX.  Home telephone number is XXX-XXX-XXXX.
I am just tired of dealing with whatever mental illness I seem to have and there doesnâ€™t appear to be any cure.  I think it is severe depression, PTSD, and maybe something else.  I donâ€™t know.  All I know is that my thoughts, emotions, feelings, and whatever else it is that makes us who we are seems to be broken beyond repair.  I have lived in mental anguish for years.  I donâ€™t know why my brain functioning has turned to mush but it has.  It pretty much sucks.  Yes, I was able to function in society.  From what I read, it was called something like, High Functioning Depression.  I could function but in the back of my mind there was always the voice telling me that I was worthless, a failure, and a loser.  And, yes, I feel like all those things.
The last thing I seemed to be able to successfully accomplish was graduating from college.  But that was way back in the late 70â€™s.  Sometime after that, I started to have feelings of depression.  I am not sure why, but they were very real.  I fought with them for many years.  I even went to a civilian psychiatrist for help.  Why a civilian doctor?  Because, regardless of what is said and put out, the military secretly looks down upon anyone who asks for any help for things such as alcoholism, drug addiction, and mental health.  There are stigmas attached to all these things.  However, mental illness is considered the worst.  You are considered a crazy.  You are considered weak. And you are considered a liability to the service. I was there.  I saw what happened to others and I was not going to let that happen to me.  So, I kept it a secret.  Also, I was ashamed of being mentally ill.
Over the past few months as feelings of worthlessness increased, I tried to look back on my life and reflect.  Unfortunately, it only solidified the case for suicide.  I was and am a loser.  I guess someone has to be!  I failed at marriage.  I failed in my military career.  I failed as a husband.  I failed as a father.  I failed at trying to start several businesses.  I failed at saving money. I failed at just about everything I ever tried.  Ultimately, I failed as an adult. And, finally, I failed at being mentally healthy.  I couldnâ€™t even keep my own thoughts healthy.  All of this adds up to the definition of a loser.  
While in the military, I was told by others, â€œOh, we told a bunch of XXXXX storiesâ€.  I heard that from the places I worked as well.  I guess they thought those stories were funny.  I took them to be â€œhe is an odd and strange guy who really doesnâ€™t fit in with usâ€.  I also, on many occasions, felt mocked by my own family, wife and children.  Many times, I was told that I was a dinosaur, stupid, and useless and that I needed to change the way I thought.  Anyway, this all reinforced my worthlessness in this life.
I was always told that I had to accept what people did and said.  Why? Especially if I didnâ€™t agree!  Why did I always have to be the one to accept change and what was happening?  Why was no one accepting of me and what I thought?  Obviously because I am one of lifeâ€™s losers.
I went to the Veteranâ€™s Administration for help.  They tried.  I went to their Cognitive Behavior Therapy training.  I actually did not think that was worth it.  All it seemed to me was a program that says â€œDonâ€™t think those bad thoughts.  Think these good thoughtsâ€.  Something akin to â€œHey Mister gloomy pants, letâ€™s turn that frown upside down.â€  I took the medicines they gave me â€“ Zoloft, Paxil Lorazepam, Trazadone, Venlafaxine, and finally Wellbutrin.  The only one that ever seemed to provide any type of relief was the Lorazepam.  And that was the one they wanted to take away from me.  Why would any health care provider take the one and only medication that caused any form of relief?  Good question.  I never got a good answer except they decided it was bad for me.  I guess feeling like crap and now wanting to kill myself wasnâ€™t bad for me.  Just perspective, I guess.
Another thing that bothered me was the inequity and inherent unfairness in our society.  People who are rich do what they want outside the rule of law.  Donâ€™t even try to tell me otherwise.  It is an insult to anyone with a brain.  From that shithead President Donald Trump, through Senator McConnel (pure satanic evil), down through the rich assholes I continued to meet.  They did terrible things to others.  Cheated them out of their life saving yet they slept well at night.  In hindsight and in light of our societyâ€™s rewards, I should have become a ruthless asshole when I was younger and then maybe I wouldnâ€™t be where I am today.  Good guys are not rewarded.  Assholes are.  Donâ€™t try to deny it. Look around. the facts are there.  Only poor people actually pay for their crimes.  Rich people treat others like shit.  Just start to observe the way people who drive very expensive cars like Mercedes, BMWs, Audis, etc.  They drive like crap.  They cut corners.  They donâ€™t stop at Stop signs, etc.  Just the never-ending unfairness wore me down.
Then one day, I knew my life was never going to get any better.  Zero chance.  I had no hope of ever improving my life.  I would always drive second hand cars, live in houses that needed lots of work, I would always be surrounded by tons of crap that was dragged home from thrift stores, garage sales, flea markets, and on and on.  The yard was full.  The garage was full.  I had four storage units that were full.  I slept surrounded with junk piled literally up to the ceiling.  I live in chaotic squalor.  It wore me down.  I was never again going to get a good paying job.  I would never have any money to buy a single nice thing.  All my furniture was second hand.  Even my clothes and linens on the bed were second hand.  Any trip outside the house to a shopping center, watching television, or even just driving down the highway was a harsh slap in the face as I looked at all the newer and nicer cars pass men the highway.  Stores presented so many things that I would never own.  Shows on television showed people living great lives that I never would.  Reminders everywhere I looked were signs of other peopleâ€™s success and happiness that I would never have.  Every day I struggled but to no avail.  I was a worthless loser and so this is what I deserved.
I thought I had lived a good life in the sense of following the rules, giving onto others, being kind to others, etc. I tried to be a good person.  Donâ€™t waste your time. Nice guys finish last.  All you have to do is look around to confirm it.  And, if that is so, this was my reward!  Great!  That makes me feel like a loser.
You know, there is no cure for mental illness.  Sometimes they can keep the symptoms under control but in the end, you are still sick.  Mental illness doesnâ€™t even have the dignity of a physical illness, injury, or disease.  Doctors are not even sure why it happens.  If you have cancer, a terrible illness, at least people understand what that is and have sympathy.  Mental illness?  No, you are just crazy.  You should have been stronger.  You should have gotten your shit together. You are just a useless weak person.
It finally wore me down and here I am.  It won. I lost.
I donâ€™t believe in God.  I donâ€™t believe in reincarnation.  I believe that this is just it. Now that I am on the other side, I know the answer. Nothing.  You are just dead.
I apologize to my wife and kids.  I hope they never suffer like I have.  None of this was their fault in any way.  They may miss me but they should move on because I was not worthy of their love. Hopefully, the insurance money will be a help to them.  Donâ€™t look to me as any example except as in what not to do with your life.
Other family is my brother in New Jersey.  We never got along very well so I doubt he will miss me for long.  As for friends. I only had a very few and none lived close by.  They will be unhappy at the news but it will pass as they concentrate on their families.  And that is how it will be for most people.  I am a very small blip on a very large the radar.
I do think the VA needs to come up with a better system s does the civilian world.  For starters, locking a guy up in a psychiatric facility for a minimum of 72 hours isnâ€™t going to help his/her situation in life which is already bad.  Now youâ€™ve just added a record to their file.  That should help them if they recover and try to assimilate back into society! (That was sarcasm, in case you missed it). I tried calling both civilian and veteran crisis hotlines.  They are pretty useless.  They just want to stop you from committing suicide.  They donâ€™t do anything to help you fix your life.  They just tell you to seek professional help.  I could have gotten that from Ann Landers. So, when they have you full of medicines and numb, you still have all the painful issues that have plagued your life but now, I guess, you donâ€™t care.
Now I am here.  It is over.  I will never feel anything again.  The crippling feelings of inadequacy. The pain of being hopeless.  The embarrassment of being mentally ill.  The shame of being weak.  It is over, and I am finally at peace. Or at least dead and not able to feel anything.
