I feel so sick, alone, and sad. I just want it to end.These past years have been awful and this week just got so much worse. One of my best friends hate me and there's nothing i can do to fix it. I've tried i really have but they won't listen they said they don't wanna hear my excuses. Even if it's just me trying to apologize.. I don't think they will ever wanna be friends with me again. One of my friends said that they are here for me but i don't wanna bother them with my problems plus they are close with the friend that hates me...  I feel so sick too, its been hard trying to bring myself to eat. I wanna talk to my friends I wanna reach out to them but i feel bad... I don't wanna seem weak in front of them or for them to tell me to stop being so negative and depressing.I feel so alone and like it's just gonna get worse. Like nothing is ever going to get better. I just wanna end it. But i can't... Im just scared.. But sometimes I think it would be better if i just did.. That the people in my life would be so much happier if I was just gone. I just wish i wasn't such a mistake to everyone. I wish... I had the strength to just do it and make everyone's life better...
