After two years, I finally thought I'd gotten better. Now it's backI'm a twenty year old guy. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 12-13 and cut since 13, though there are incidents of self harm as far back as 10. I started college and went through a break up in fall '13 and that kicked off a downward spiral of depression that ended up with me dropping out of school and staying in my room 24/7 except to go out to buy smokes. I moved back this past summer and have been trying to turn my life around. 3-4 months ago I experienced what felt like the lowest point of the depression, due to a culmination of circumstances. I started having horrible episodes (medically, I don't know what they are) where I would slide down a mental slope which ended up with feeling extremely suicidal, worthless, helpless, and sobbing with absolutely no external trigger. That period created a lot of change in myself and I became a more positive, go with the flow type person.

I'd say I had about a month or two of generally happy, free-spirited living. And now it's all coming back: the feelings of worthlessness, the thoughts of suicide that invade my head multiple times a day. The urge to cut myself came back. I feel like such a waste of human life and such a burden and annoyance to everyone. Like nobody wants me around. The mental breakdowns are back. I can't go a day without almost bursting into tears, and it seems to come and go as it pleases. I want it all to stop but it feels like I'll never get better. There's so much I wish I could explain about my life to better paint my situation. I've never felt more alone and out of place in this world.
