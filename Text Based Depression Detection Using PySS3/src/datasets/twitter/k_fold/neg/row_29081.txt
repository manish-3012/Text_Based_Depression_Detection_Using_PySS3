Tired, and things don't seem bright anymore...I used to care for my future. I'm 27 and I'm married and I have pets. My life isn't terrible. I had a best friend who always pushed me and helped me do better. In 2017 he shot himself 2 days after Christmas and never talked to me. It has tipped my life over completely.

 Everyday I think about him. I wonder why he did it, why he was so quiet, did he have some kind of breakdown? I feel like one day I might have one of those break downs. I can visually see that I have become broken. I'm in classes thanks to the GI Bill..but that almost seems to come with a price. A price that I HAVE to stay in school because it pays you a housing allowance. Any job I've had, I've been terrible at and ultimately end up quitting. 

You see I don't understand why I'm in so much pain. Yes I know people care about me. Yes the future is unknown and we don't know what I could miss out on. I just can't ever seem to just be good at anything. I try really hard to do my best, then depression sets in, maybe a dash of ADD, possibly some bipolar? Idk. My psychaitrist doesn't seem to think any of that is a possibility. She also never sees or hears the real hurt from me. I just want to put in a place where I can be monitored and have some constant help. I cannot seem to help myself. I have been failing my classes, and because I just can't get myself to sit down and think. I don't know how to stop everything and I just want everything to stop. 

Look I'm not gonna sit here and say that I want to kill myself. I don't. I just so badly want everything to stop. I want the world to stop. I want everything to be black. I wish someone could just induce a coma for me or something. I just do not want to be here any more. What on Earth can I even do to get out of this? How could I even be a productive person with a good job? I can't see the next steps maybe..idk. I just want it to stop.
