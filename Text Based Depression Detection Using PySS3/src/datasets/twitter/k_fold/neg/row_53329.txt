Cant take it anymoreBeen thrown out of my house, always had a rocky relationship with my mum and step-dad. I'm a druggy, have kicked it before but recently had a relapse, now I can't stop. I have no friends, no girlfriend, no money. I'm constantly stressed out. I feel like no one likes me. I've tried to kill myself before and failed. I'm ready to try again, I really can't live like this anymore.
