29 years of suffering &amp; im just tiredI just bought a house with a garage and the other day I realized what I could do in it.. if you know what I mean. I am so ugly and fat and just always suffering in my head. I thought getting older was supposed to be easier but so far I just get fatter and uglier (despite constant moving and calorie counting) and more annoying and I have these episodes where I think I am worth something to somebody, but then I snap out of it and realize people just pity me. Im the sad girl whoâ€™s awkward and not lovable and annoying. Why not just stop the suffering now?
