Suicidal thoughts are increasing and I feel trappedMy job is making me feel completely miserable. I have a superior who has been abusing their power and creating a hostile environment. As a result, most other people I work with directly dislike me as well. Iâ€™m so scared to go into work on Monday. 

And I canâ€™t quit because I have bills to pay, but I canâ€™t seem to find another job either. 

Iâ€™ve been there for a year and I find my suicidal thoughts growing more and more frequent. Iâ€™m taking a cocktail of medication and going to therapy, but it doesnâ€™t seem to help. I just donâ€™t see any other way out but death. I just want all the pain to stop. I donâ€™t feel like I can last until I find another job. And not having found a suicidal method yet terrifies me.
