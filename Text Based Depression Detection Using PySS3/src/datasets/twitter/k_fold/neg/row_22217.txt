Things that are wrong with me and my lifeI am very depressed and my life is a complete disaster.

I hate everything about myself and my life, yet I have no sunshine left inside of me to begin to change things. I don't believe I can be changed or helped. I'm very hopeless.

BODY IMAGE

I hate how I look. I am overweight and feel disgusting in myself. I barely have any clothes that fit, and I just feel so gross. My hair is always looking bad too. I used to be skinny, until I suffered mental illness and have gained an insane amount of weight. It is so embarrassing and hard to deal with.

EATING

I don't feel like eating. Or looking after myself. I want to eat chocolate here and there, and thats it. I don't feel like I can nourish my body with healthy foods, like a normal person.

EXERCISE

I don't exercise. I'm super unfit and weak. I hate that I am like this. I have no energy, motivation and my medications make me overheat from just existing and breathing.

WORK/CAREER

I hate my dead - end, pointless job. I am nothing to anyone, and not experienced in anything useful, I'm replaceable and shit at my shit job anyway. I hate working this job and dread waking up.

STUDY

I'm finishing a course in admin. Admin. Its so ridiculously boring and painful to endure. I hate it with a passion, but it was a requirement for my workplace. I want to study something meaningful. But that costs money that I don't have, time I don't have - and self belief I don't have.

RELATIONSHIPS

My partner hates seeing me so depressed. I'm making him depressed too. Plus I have no other friends apart from him. My family are distant and I'm lonely. I push everyone away though, to protect them from me.

Things I've tried:

\- Therapy with numerous therapists

\- Lots of medications

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I don't even want to wake up anymore.
