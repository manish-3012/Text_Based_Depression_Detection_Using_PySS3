Need to do something this week. I don't know what, but something needs to happen.I've posted here before, and I'm typically hit with "report to CPS or your school". They don't care. Family doesn't care. I don't have friends. I need something to happen. I either need to run away, or, and I am really hoping there *are* other options, kill myself. Don't know what to do. My mom's a narcissist who is literally *waiting* for me to kill myself so she can say, "I tried everything. She was just not able to be fixed."  


I can't really successfully runaway because when I told my mom that, she laughed and said that she'd just have police track me down within an hour. The only other option that I can *think* of is killing myself, but I'm too scared to do so. It's obviously not just this one issue. I have so many issues that I will not deal with. I will *not* be locked in quarantine with these people. I'm tired of having to act calm when reporting to CPS. CPS doesn't care. They send me home. The whole world is telling me to kill myself, and yet I haven't been able to do it, yet. Now, with this info, and me saying that it is *not* possible to "get help!! People love you", what are my options?
