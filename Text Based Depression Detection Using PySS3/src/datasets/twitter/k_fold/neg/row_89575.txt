I was advised to kill myself. So I'm about to go do so.I'm beyond helping. I was told basically that I can not get a job because I'm too negative that I will be broke for the rest of my life and was told that I needed to change my attitude, when I said I couldn't change my attitude they told me that I should just kill myself then because my life wouldn't be going anywhere anyway. So I will do just that. After I'm done typing this I'm gonna go off and end my life. No point in continuing to live a life of pointlessness. It's over. Goodbye shitty world.
