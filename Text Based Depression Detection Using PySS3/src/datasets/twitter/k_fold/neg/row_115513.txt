I just need someone who undertsands..Its so difficult to explain this feeling i have. Somehow i really really wanna die, but i cant. I have a responsibility. I have a family to think about, but sometimes it really wish nobody cared. 

I have this crazy hatred to myself. I noticed that Iâ€™ve started hitting myself in the head without even noticing. If Iâ€™m frustrated about not being able to do this and that for example. Im failing at everything, im one big fucking failure and i dont wanna be like this, but i feel totally out of control. Its so frustrating being unable to control your own life, your feelings, your mood, i cant even control my own actions anymore. Im just a shell forced to live in this cruel world. I feel like nobody and its so terrifying!! I donâ€™t know who I am anymore..  

I wanna talk, i want help, but i dont know what to say or do. I really hope someone sees this... if you are reading then thank you very much for paying attention to me. Maybe you understand, I hope so, I donâ€™t..
