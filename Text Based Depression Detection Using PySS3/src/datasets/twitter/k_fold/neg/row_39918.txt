Someone, anyone, give me a reason to liveIm 15 currently, almost 16, my parents don't seem to care much at all and i just lost all of my friends but one, no clue on what my GCSE grades were but felt like they went horribly, and then on top of all that I am depressed, and have anxiety, and part of that being social anxiety, i can't make new friends, i can't talk to people, there's nothing i can do
