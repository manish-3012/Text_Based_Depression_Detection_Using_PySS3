I want to die.So I just got my wisdom teeth removed and have a bunch of tabs now.

I hate my life I want to die. I want someone to talk to but I have no one.  I dont think I will actually do it. But shit... someone cheer me up please.

All my parents do is yell at eachother and then yell at me for hiding from it I cant stand being here I am so depressed to the point where I have no motivation to get up and get my life together. Fuck guys. I need help but im so scared to ask my parents or family for help. The only person in my family who could help me completely distances himself from us. 

Im sorry guys I know its really immature but these are my true feelings. 
I have no friends I can talk to they all tell me to just man up and get over it but its not that easy so I completely stopped talking to all them deleted my facebook and shit too.

Cheer me up please.

EDIT: Thank you all I am feeling much better it all means very much to me. I just started watching walking dead to help take my minds off things, so gud!
