My mind is foggyDon't waste time reading this boring rant

Why am I brought in this world...(seriously, why?)

And then expected to fix my parents financial condition...

Why are my parents guilt tripping me...

And why do I feel I will destroy their lives if I kill myself...

Why do I still love them...

I'm at my lowest now.. I can't stand the concept of luck in this world. If creator of this world exists, I hate them to death.

I am very underdeveloped, scared individual who day by day, realizes that they can not survive in this. The day will come. The day when my parents collapse and I won't be able to live on my own. 

I am total failure. I hate using this cliche word. But it is objectively true.

So many successful people around me...

The pressure is too high. I can't. The expectations...I can't. Even if you took expectations away, I wouldnt even be able to live by on my own

I just want to cry all day, do nothing, get some disease and vanish with no sound. Just to vanish.

I was born and now I have to experience so much pain before I die. Just why was I born..

I don't even have strength to end my suffering. I can't kill myself and just have to keep on living in this hectic torture machine. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this, I know deep down things are so bad, am I trying to get help? No..I guess...

I scream internally in my heart. I hate every second of my existence. Im furious..I hate my parents who brought me in this piece of shit world and expect me to be happy all the time. I hate them so much. I hate myself more than anyone else hates me.
