Every NightEvery night is terrible. At daytime i am completely numb, just quietly doing my job like an emotionless zombie. Every single night kills me inside. Its funny how I keep reaching out on here but im too anxious to even open any DM's I get. I cant live like this. No, I know I can, I just dont want to anymore. 21 years on earth have been enough for me. Im alone all week and so I will drink like I always do. Im not actively planning something but if I happen to drink too much one of the days and pass away thats fine by me. 

If there is a "better place", why arent we 'allowed' to go there early?
