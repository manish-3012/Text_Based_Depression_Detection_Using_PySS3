I want to dieI posted on another subreddit about this but didn't get any responses and honestly I just really need someone to talk to right now. 

I'm miserable and want to hurt myself (but I'm pregnant so I know I can't). I hate my job and I hate school and it's never going to end. I know school will end eventually but I'm working part time in the place I'm going to work after graduation, and it's in my career field. But I hate working and I'm just miserable and don't know what to do. I can't quit school because I'm already 50k in debt and 1.5 years into a 4 year part time degree, and I can't quit my job because I have to afford living, even if I hate living.
