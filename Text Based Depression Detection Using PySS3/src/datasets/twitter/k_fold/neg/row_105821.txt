I can't stop thinking about the benefits.I've been thinking about suicide for a little while now. I really want to, but I can't stop worrying about the people around me. My friends trust me, my dad believes in me, and many people around me care about me. I just wish my mom won't abuse me verbally and mentally. I'm an Asian 14 year old boy. My mom believes in the "smart Asian" stereotype. If I don't get a 100% right on a test she . I don't have a phone, because she says it will rot my brain to mush. She's Korean, and not so good at English, thus she avoids people as much as possible. I'm not able to invite my friends over, hang out with them, or even text them. I feel so helpless and lost. When I'm studying she tells me to be more active. When I'm outside she tells me to study. When I'm playing video games she tells me I'm wasting my life and I should just die already. I wish my mom would realize that I'm not a genius meant to get a medical degree or something.
