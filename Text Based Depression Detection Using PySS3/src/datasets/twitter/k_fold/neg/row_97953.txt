Hotlines are garbageAll they do is nod along saying things like "that sounds really hard," or "wow, that's sounds terrible." None of them can be fucked to say a word of substance, or treat me like an individual. I'm just another caller bothering the lines. And when I tell them I don't own a gun yet their interest tanks and they just give up on me. I'm so painfully lonely that not even people who join to make conversation bring solace.
