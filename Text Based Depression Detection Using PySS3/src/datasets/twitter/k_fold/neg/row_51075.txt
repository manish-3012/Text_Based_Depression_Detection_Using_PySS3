It's really hard right nowI ran out of my medication and dont have any money until the first and it is making me severely depressed.
The only person I love and care about can't talk to me. His sister broke his leg and I fear I might seem insensitive if I even mention the really really bad thoughts I'm having.
I just don't want to live anymore and I cant wait for me to get money to refill my prescription. I just want to die right now.
I dont know what to do.
