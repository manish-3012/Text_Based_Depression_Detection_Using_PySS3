The reason life sucks:We should have a nice family , a nice place to live at , a loving partner , a nice location to live with nice people , no anxiety , a nice calm job that we'd love , good health , respect , nice free time , a nice hobby , many loving friends with who you could hang out , calmness and peace

Instead of that we are living our lives , fuck this shit

The only reason I stay alive is because I am healthy and I like my body , I feel like I was lucky enough to be at the minority of people born with such somatic advantages that it'd be a shame to suicide , that makes no sense but that's my reason...
