Thank you to everyone!!I wrote on here a little over a month ago on a throwaway account. It was suppose to be the last record of my life, and it should have been but for some reason I'm still here, and I'm glad that I am. I tried to kill myself in late January after posting on this site but failed-again. 

I spent over a month in the hospital, and quite honestly, it is the best thing that ever happened to me. I got the help I desperately needed, met some amazing individuals, got myself on social security with the help of the hospital, got on some meds that are doing wonders, got placed at a great home- finally not in the ghetto (also with the help of my case manager at the hospital.) I have a support system now and I am 40 days sober. Thanks to everyone on this subreddit. Even though I did not listen after my original post, i do see now that people here do care. To everyone in a bad situation...get some help!!! I felt like I was in a hole and the only way out closed in on me, I felt like I was suffocating in that hole...I thought the only way to cure the agonizing pain of that suffocation was suicide. The mental hospital has some amazing people who don't just want to put you on meds and make sure you take them. The mental hospital actually cares about getting you out of a bad situation. Please take the first step and find help if you need it. I promise you things will get better.
