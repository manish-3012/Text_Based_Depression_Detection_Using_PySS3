I'm finally readyAs the title suggests, I've made up my mind at this point. Years I've been hurting, every single night crying until 6am, and living the same miserable life.

I was told things get better, and I tried to let things get better. I put myself out there, I did what everyone said; but it still wasn't enough.

I've always been too afraid to take my own life, the thought terrifies me. But the feeling of wanting to die is so genuine.

I've thought about killing myself almost every second of every day over the course of the past few years, it's no way for a 20 year old to live. 

My parents already think nothing of me and my dad says suicide is for the weak, I guess he was right. But if they had any idea how much pain I was in, they would be happy that I can finally let it all go. I've tried telling them, they don't care, no one does until it's too late. It's the sad truth. 

There's been too many nights I've sat there in my bed with the rope in my hands crying and wishing I'd just do it, that the pain would finally stop; but I've always been too afraid of what's to come.

But now I'm not so scared anymore, I sit here with it, and the same terrified feelings don't overwhelm me. I can't cry anymore, I'm so tired of crying, it hurts to just be awake anymore. Tonight I can finally rest.
