Posting in this Sub, I've Gotta have a Problem, Right?â€¦And I'll leave that there quiet-like for now. But I want to put Richard Cory on the table here. Google him, if you need to. I just cannot stop thinking about himâ€¦ Seriously. This is not for grins. Nor idle chitter-chatter.

Same goes for Anthony Bourdain, who strikes me, after all that's been said, as Richard Cory's real-life incarnation. Both these guys, alphas, gone.

Question is, Why? This nags and nags at me. When life is good and you seemingly have oodles of its fine things at your disposal â€“ wealth, fame, fair health, prime seats at the game â€” why end it all? We've all gotta go sometime. But meanwhile, if the going's good, why hasten your exit? 

Please tell me, whoever might knowâ€¦ *Why?* 'Cos I'm dying here.
