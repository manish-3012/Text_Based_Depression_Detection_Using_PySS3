Nothing is working.I have been on meds for 3 months, seeing a psychologist for 7 months. One suicide attempt. Self harm. Why is nothing fucking working? I'm so sick of people telling me that it gets better with meds and therapy. No it fucking doesn't. Family said they would be there for me when i got out of hopsital. Two weeks later they treat me like shit again. Give me one good reason why I should keep living.
