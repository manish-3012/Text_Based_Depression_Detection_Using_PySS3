PLEASE leave a noteHey, so, idk if a post like this is allowed, I mean, I hope y'all pull through and survive, and all.

But just, if you don't... if you use any method that's not really 100% obviously suicide... *please* leave a note.

It doesn't have to really say anything, it's just so they'll know it's suicide.

Recovering from the suicide of a loved one isn't easy, but if you have no idea whether it's suicide?

There are groups for those who have lost people to suicide, and groups for those who have lost people to violent crime, but nothing that goes 50/50...never once found a single group for those who have lost people to "cause of death: undetermined".

Don't kill yourself, and all. But if you do, *leave a note.*

*Please.*
