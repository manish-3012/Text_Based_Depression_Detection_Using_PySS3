Is my sister going to kill herself?So my sister is 49 years old (14 years older than me) and has been depressed and abusing prescriptions and alcohol. She went to a rehab/mental health facility for about a week and after getting out, seemed to be slowly getting better. However, she's been skipping work again (and has many bills due and no way to pay them.) My parents live very close and have been trying to help but are at their wits' end. Today my mom expressed to her a real fear that she was going to try to kill herself and she was adamant that she would never do anything like that. 
My question is: do we believe her?
