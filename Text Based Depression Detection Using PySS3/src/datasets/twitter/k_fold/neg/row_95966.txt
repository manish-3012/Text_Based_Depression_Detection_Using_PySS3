Iâ€™m not sure what to doI canâ€™t talk to my friends or family anymore because I have nothing to say. I tell them I truly just want to die and not exist anymore but have no true reasoning for it. my life isnâ€™t a complete mess or anything. ok job, good relationship, good friends. but I feel like every time I go off the rails everything is fucked. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore and I guess this is just my way of yelling into the void and telling people that I donâ€™t know that I really feel like Iâ€™m at the end of my rope. I canâ€™t do it anymore and I donâ€™t know what the fuck else to do. I wish I wouldâ€™ve just fully gone though with it one of the past few times I tried. Iâ€™m scared and Iâ€™m lost and nothing is working, no medication, nothing. it just feels like itâ€™s finally time to be the end
