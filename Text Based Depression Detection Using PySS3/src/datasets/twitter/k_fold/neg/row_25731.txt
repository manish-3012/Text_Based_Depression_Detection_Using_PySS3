When the problem is a lack of loveWe've all heard the "get a therapist" and "go with a professional" thing at least once. We know therapists, psychiatrists, etc, are supposed to help us with whatever is making us feel bad. 

But, guys, let's be honest with ourselves. There are times when no professional, drug, or therapy can solve a problem which origin comes from a lack of love. Of caring. Of tenderness. Of, yes, love. 

It's frustrating for many people to see that what is supposed to help them feel better, what's supposed to help them to overcome pretty dark moments, just doesn't work. And I find it horrible that those professionals aren't honest with their pacients. They keep talking shit, they keep prescribing them drugs, they keep promising a bright future that never comes, etc. But they never say "hey, I'm sorry, I can't help you with this. There's nothing I can do to fullfill that empty space you've got". 


So, since they aren't honest, and they won't ever tell you the truth because their opportunity to pay those expensive holidays they want will only exist if you don't find out that they can't help you with your problem; I'm going to tell you what you need to hear:


No therapy, no professional of any kind, no drug of any kind, can replace what you need and you've never had. That thing is love. And it may be hard to hear, I know; but it's the truth. You need to know it. 
And I won't start talking shit about "there's someone waiting for you out there", "you'll find that person, I promise", because it's the same shit professionals do. 

That's all I have to say.
