Thereâ€™s some light at the end of the tunnel but I donâ€™t think that I can reach it.Iâ€™ve lost all myself esteem lately and my dreams of the medical field have been crushed. It feels like Iâ€™ve fallen into a deeper hole. Students in my grade destroyed my self esteem, My parents are arguing a lot , my father gets mad at random points and calls me useless, and my dog is going to have to be put down. The only reason why Iâ€™m not ending it is because of my guitar which is keeping me in here but Iâ€™ve partially given up on that. Why should I not end it?
