Think I may have accidentally overdosed, don't want to go to ERThis morning I took about 14 mg of extended release guanfacine because I was depressed and was having trouble falling asleep. The highest dosage I've heard of being taken was only 7 mg. I just thought maybe if I took more it would work faster. (it was dumb, I know.) I'm currently experiencing a lot of the overdose symptoms (drowziness, dizziness, low heart rate) but I don't want to go to the ER. I already went to the ER in the beginning of march for taking too much cymbalta and then throwing it up, then I had to stay in the mental hospital for 8 days. It was the worst experience of my life.   
I wasn't trying to overdose here, I just wanted to fall asleep and we didn't have any benadryl or melatonin. I'm really scared, what should I do?
