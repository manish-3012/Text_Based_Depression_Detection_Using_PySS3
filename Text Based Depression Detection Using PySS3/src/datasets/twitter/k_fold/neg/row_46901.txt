41 and ready to goI do not matter. No one really cares if I exist or not. I am the kind of person that gets ignored in parties and no one would ever talk to. The few times I tried to take part in volunteer work or group activities resulted in awkward and embarrassment. People just ignored me even when I put up a brave front to interact with people. It may be easier for you to visualize when I tell you I am an Asian living in a very white part of America. 

After spending the last 41 years in misery, I donâ€™t know how to keep going. I notice that many people here are very young, am I the odd one out?

I am all alone with no friends, no partner and the only person who cares about me is my mum and sheâ€™s 9000 miles away. The one time i tried to settle down, i end up with a house that is a money pit and a shithole i canâ€™t get rid of. I am not good at my job and I constantly fear of getting laid off. Then again, I think maybe thatâ€™s good as it will finally push me to end it all. 

I donâ€™t really want to kill myself as I am scared of the pain, but how do you go on when life has no meaning at all? I canâ€™t find a reason for me to keep consuming resources in this overpopulated world.

How does one find meaning? I have been through therapy and itâ€™s all the same cliche. I am not thinking positive, I am selfish and I am not doing enough to improve. 

I am just tired. I really donâ€™t want to live anymore. I also have no one to talk to at all.

What should I do? If you think i am really pathetic and deserve to end it all, whatâ€™s a painless way to go?

I feel that euthanasia should be legal and especially when you are not someone who would be missed and you are not doing it because of some minor issues. It should be legal for people who donâ€™t matter and donâ€™t want to continue anymore.
