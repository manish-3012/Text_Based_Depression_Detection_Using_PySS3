I don't know the best way to help my friend right nowOkay it's a bit of a long story but my best friend and her boyfriend killed himself about 3 months ago, we have both be really bad, and have gotten pretty close cause I feel like she's the only one that loved him as much as me. But recently she has relapsed into self harm after 2 years clean and even more recently in the past couple day has stated many times that she is going to kill herself, I'm doing everything I can think about to help her, I need her in this world so fucking bad and couldnt make it without her. I don't know if there is more I can be doing, I just can't lose her and I don't know where to start. Sorry this was more of a rant I guess, but any advice is appreciated
