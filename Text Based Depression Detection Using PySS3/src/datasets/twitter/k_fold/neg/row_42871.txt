I'm past the end of my ropeI've struggled with depression most of my life. The last ten years have been rather hard between being homeless on and off to watching my dog die to having another run away and never be seen again. I've tried so hard to be strong. Told myself it's a test I can do it. But I can't anymore. I work my ass off to still be poor. My teeth are aweful but I have no money and my insurance is about to run out. I now owe thousands of money to different companies. And now to add the cherry on top I got thrown out. I had been living with my boyfriend for a while and was finally happy. I still had days but I was getting better. This morning he told me he wanted me to leave because he has " a lot going on" and "can't handle" living with me and my issues. I thought we were doing so well. He stopped drinking and we were making plans to move and everything.. So now in my darkest days, days where I've been to stressed I've barely eaten and the person I thought loved me can't handle my issues... I gave up so much and did so much for him. He knew that I came from abusive shitty relationships and this is how he does it.. I can't do this anymore. I try and try and for what. To be deeper in debt with shit health and no insurance. Why keep this game up. Why I don't see much of a reason anymore. I didn't before for my mother but I can't keep living just to make someone else happy..
