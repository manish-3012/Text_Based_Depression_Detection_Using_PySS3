Is anybody out there?Iâ€™ve been in a rather better place lately compared to the beginning of this year. I thought Iâ€™d left my depression behind me at least for the time being. But today is different. 

Today I woke up and everything has that same  gray tint to it. The show I watch no longer has the same comedic output it usually does. After months of building my relationship back up with my family from the previous detachment from them, I canâ€™t stop myself from doing it again. Every word in conversation is a drain on my mind. So I just lock myself in my room all day and hate myself even more at night because itâ€™s another day away from them. 

Iâ€™m falling into a pit of darkness again, and I need help. This time the pit seems deeper, and I donâ€™t know if I can climb out this time. Please anybody.
