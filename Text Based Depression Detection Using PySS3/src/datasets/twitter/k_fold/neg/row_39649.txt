What to say to a suicidal person(message)?Hello,

I have a friend who repeatedly speak about suicide since years. I've already told her multiple times to go to a therapist multiple times but she never done it. Finally after a big sad event(being rejected by a man...) she went on SSRI two days ago. She live with a friend, have family around so she's safe. She messaged me about that "she want to end her life"(nothing out of ordinary compared to her repeated messages about it) and as always I don't what to say, do you have anything I can say to her to "comfort" her?

Thanks, hope I am in the good subreddit.
