Some pushover here???I'm a girl in my mid 20.  I grow up in an abusive situation, always been bullied, always been paranoid. All the people always putted their foot on my head and jumped on hard. I spent my teen years crying my self in my pillow while hoping for the love I wanted to give and receive. But I never received it, I always ended up being used. I always tried to make everyone happy and to please everyone for some approve, for feel worthy for one fucking time. They saw me as a fucking dumb naive and used me for their return, for make them feel better. I have been mentally manipulated in the worst ways.  My only option is to stay alone. I'm fucking scared of people. I would love with all my heart to be able to don't give a fuck, you really don't know how much I want it. But it feels impossible at this point for me. I think I'm going crazy. I improved my self compared to the teen years but the mean of people fucked up my mentality and how I view and value my self. I grow up with no fucking love or support. But it's just past and no one care. I'm stuck. fuck being too sensible, fuck being always caring and assertive, fuck!!! All the people will always take advantage of me, I feel I am just supposed to lived like that. 
 And it doesn't matter how much I try to be "with an attitude", from the time I talk a little with whoever, I result as a fucking dumb naive that will never understand. Fuck my self. There is someone like me?? If so, I love you and I am fucking sorry. Anyway Excuse my English. Fuck my life
