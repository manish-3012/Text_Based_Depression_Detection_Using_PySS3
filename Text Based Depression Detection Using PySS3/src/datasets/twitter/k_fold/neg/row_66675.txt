Iâ€™m becoming more and more sure that Iâ€™ll kill myselfLife was really great but then things just completely changed and now life is just really horrible. I find myself thinking about suicide more often, and I thought about it before during a bad time, but now Iâ€™m just more sure that Iâ€™m gonna do it and Iâ€™m kind of relieved about it. I can imagine myself about to die, and Iâ€™m not as fearful as before. Anyways, Iâ€™m thinking of making a plan soon, and Iâ€™m thinking about hanging or maybe even using hydrogen sulfide (detergent suicide). If anyone knows anything about using hydrogen sulfide and any discomfort associated with it, Iâ€™d appreciate learning about it :)

Iâ€™m so exhausted guys, I just wish I had someone to talk to but I feel like I just get this weird feeling that stops me from talking about it to a specific person. I hope I can end things peacefully. Thanks for reading.
