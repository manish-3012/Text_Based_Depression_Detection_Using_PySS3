21. Female. Chronic depression since I was 10.  Life just isn't getting any better.I've attempted suicide in the past, but I was 'uneducated' on the specifics, I suppose.

I was in the psych ward at the local hospital last winter.  They kept me as long as they legally could.  It didn't help.

I don't have friends.  I'm scared of everything.  I'm never happy.

Constantly a disappointment (and a burden) to my family.  They were fully aware of the time I spent in the hospital, but they didn't seem to care, so I've (in turn) stopped caring about how they'd feel if I die.  Because honestly, they won't.

I've had multiple psychiatrists and therapists during my lifetime.  I've been on medications.  Honestly, nothing helps.

I enjoy nothing.  I don't have dreams.

How does this even happen?
