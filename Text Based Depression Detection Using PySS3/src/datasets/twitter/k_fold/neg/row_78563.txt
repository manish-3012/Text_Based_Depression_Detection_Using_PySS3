I'm about to commit suicide?I can't take it anymore. Nobody listens to me. Nobody takes me serious. Nobody helps me. Nobody likes me. My family and people I don't even know bully me. I'm mentally exhausted. Everything annoys me. I can't get a job because I can't deal with people. I might end up with nowhere to go. I don't see the point in living. I have nothing to live for. My life is miserable. I'm tired of waking up to this everyday. I don't know what else to do. This is my only option.
