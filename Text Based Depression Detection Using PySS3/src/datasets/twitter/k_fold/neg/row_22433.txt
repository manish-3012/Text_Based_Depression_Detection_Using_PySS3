I'm at my breaking pointI'm angry and lonely and feel like no one understands me. I'm at my breaking point and I'm about to lose it. If someone says one more stupid plattitude that everyone says to people experiencing a lot of emotional shit then I'm done. I'm no longer gonna even try to talk about my feelings and open up to anyone. I'm gonna end up doing something really bad. I'm gonna kill myself and that will be the end of it. I thought the whole point of opening up to people was so that you could find someone who's more understanding and and avoid people who are insensitive and who'll make things worse. Whatever dude I'm really close to being done right now.
