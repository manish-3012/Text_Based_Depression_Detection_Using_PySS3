What's the point when we're all going to die with climate change anyway?I come from a Romani background. My people are treated like shit everywhere, and due to my name in my country unless I give that up and give up the way we dress I can't get work. I wish we could go back to our old ways, but those are gone forever. And now the whole world is going to fucking broil to death due to unstoppable and probably abrupt climate change, so why bother?
