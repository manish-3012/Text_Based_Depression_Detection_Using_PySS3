No one wants me hereAll my life I can just remember people replacing and leaving me. I used to have friends in kindergarden, elementary and middle school but looking back now those were not friends either. They just used and mocked me. I was never anybody's first choice, I was always that friend who "had to walk behind the group when the past wasn't big enough" if you know what I mean.

At about 15 years old I was finally cut off by everyone. I feel I maybe had one friend who kind of liked me but she too left me three years ago because she found out about my depression. In 2017 I found two people through an event I thought I had clicked with but we rarely do anything together, maybe every two months and only if I contact them. They won't even respond to my messages most of the time. 

I also truly can't think of a single person in my life who hasn't called me weird yet. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I always try my hardest, I try put an effort in the best I can but after a while I just get ignored. No one even cares to tell me what it is that I'm doing wrong. I'm always there for everyone but no one is there for me

I don't have anyone. 90% of my life for past three to four years have been spent in bed. I feel maybe that's how it's supposed to be. I don't think I'll ever have anyone in my life who really likes me for who I am. Maybe I'm an awful person. I don't want to ruin anyone. I will die alone and no one will miss me. Most of the people I know probably won't even find out
