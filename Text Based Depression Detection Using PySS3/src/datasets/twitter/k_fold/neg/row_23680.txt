ending this pain means ending mei had things under control but recently things have been spiraling downhill at an incredible rate. My back, hip and leg pain from arachnoidits arent getting better any time soon. My fiance had cheated on me, took the car, moved out and now has some old guy for a boyfriend which I walked in on them while making out in the dining room and just destroyed me.Â  I cant sleep. When I do its just nightmares of that moment. My chest hurts all the time and have these awful heart palpatations. I was barely wanting to live when it was just my back pain. Now with this emotional crap too, its completely unbearable. We have a kid togeather so I cant even just wash my hands and be done with it. I have to see her on a weekly basis making it impossible to get her out of my head. I feel like im losing my mind. I dont know what is real anymore. "My only friend, the end"
