Going crazyI know. I know a lot of people are going crazy with whatâ€™s going on, and maybe some will be able to resonate with me. 

Iâ€™m so alone. I canâ€™t leave my house become Iâ€™m a risk if I catch the virus. I have a respiratory condition and a baby. 

Iâ€™m extremely alone, depressed, anxious. No one in or out. I canâ€™t breath, I canâ€™t sleep. I can usually handle my emotions to a certain extent but I really want to hurt myself. 

Iâ€™ve taken up drinking again since this all started and Iâ€™m spiralling out of control. I donâ€™t want to take the time of professionals from people who really really need it but Iâ€™m struggling and so very afraid Iâ€™m going to end it. I am so lost. 

Sorry for wasting your time! :D
