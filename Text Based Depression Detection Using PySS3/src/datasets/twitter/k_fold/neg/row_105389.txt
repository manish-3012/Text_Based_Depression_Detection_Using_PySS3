I think I might Hang myself soonOkay i know no one really gives a shit. We are all here for a reason and thatâ€™s to say something before we die. And I wouldnâ€™t expect you to give a fuck either, because weâ€™re human.

Anyway... so background: 17M &amp; Iâ€™m extremely lonely. And I donâ€™t mean literally, I have friends, quite a few actually, but going out with friends or doing sports or socialising fills nothing in my heart. Also Iâ€™ve fucked up a going-to be relationship by just being a complete dumbass

Also I know my wanna be career (playing rugby professionally) will never come true because i just know Ill never be good enough.

I have BPD and know that even if I got past this moment in life there is never a brighter side. Just more disappointment and loneliness.

You know that feeling of home sickness? Having that feeling 24/7 and never sure what your next action will be is scary. Iâ€™m fucked. I donâ€™t want to live a life being slaved to work for minimum wage job Iâ€™ll hate. I am a bad person, Iâ€™m not fun, Iâ€™m not funny, Iâ€™m not good enough

My best is never enough 


Sorry for the really bad sentencing but I donâ€™t give a fuck 

If youâ€™ve read to here... why are you still here, thereâ€™s no point in pursuading because Iâ€™m going to kill myself 

But thank you 


I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this fucking shit
