I hate my body and and I just want to be free of my self-hatredI'll never find peace unless I got my dream body which is impossible. I just want to feel beautiful. I just want to live the highschool and college-experience like everyone else. I just want to feel comfortable and confident in my body. I couldn't have any of these things but there is one thing I can change. I can kill myself so I no longer suffer from envy, jealousy and self-hatred

I wanted a safe space to share my difficulties with my body so I went to the ugly-subreddit and the bodydysmorphia-subreddit. Unfortunately I found out those two forums are infested with sexists. If you're a guy the femcels go after you and invalidate your experiences and if you're a woman incels go after you doing the same so you'll get downvoted and feel even worse. The mods rarely do anything. 

There is no help for me. I'll never be happy. I'll never stop worrying about my face and body.
