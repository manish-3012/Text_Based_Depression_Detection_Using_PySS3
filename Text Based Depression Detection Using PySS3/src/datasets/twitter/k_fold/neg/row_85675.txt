One of the many who fell throughFirst thing I do when I open my eyes to a new day is ask myself. "Why the fuck am I still here?" It used to be a small and grateful prayer. Now, I can't tell what is real anymore but then again I've never been real and no one seems to understand that. The scars on my arm only take me so far to forget and focus on the pain so that I can feel something. The pain is only temporary and I'm quickly immersed back into the pool of regret and sadness. This shit is not temporary if you've been dealing with this all of your life. These scars are not temporary. They're permanent. I'm one of the many who slipped through the cracks. Deep down, I know that no one cares. But who am I to expect anything more? (Psychiatrist, family, nonexistent friends, close circle? All are laughable. The voice in my head has been quiet so I guess it's better now than later... before it wake up and tries to talk me out of it.  To keep it simple: this life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one.
