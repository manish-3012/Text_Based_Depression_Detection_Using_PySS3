Can anyone help to lower my self hatred?Iâ€™ve hated myself for along time, and recently, as in the past few months, Iâ€™ve been REALLY hating myself to the point of where I want to kill myself. I canâ€™t kill my self though, because I couldnâ€™t hurt my family like that, but if I had a clone of myself I would slaughter that stupid fucker. I just HATE being myself! I get so angry when I look in the mirror, or especially when I screw something up, even if it isnâ€™t my fault! Just today part of my dishwasher broke and I started beating myself up mentally and physically. I want to fucking slam my head through the wall just typing this. I hate everything about me! I take pills for depression and I hate myself for it, I have anxiety and I hate myself for it, i take acid reflux pills and I hate my stupid body for it, there just isnâ€™t anything that I remotely kind of maybe like even just a little bit about myself. I just CANT STAND BEING ME! WHAT DO I DO???
