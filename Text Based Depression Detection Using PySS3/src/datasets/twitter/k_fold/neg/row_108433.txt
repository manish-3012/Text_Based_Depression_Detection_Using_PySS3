Does anyone else feel super haunted by their past?I went out with a friend today and it was fun, but I couldn't help notice all these... Fragments of the past. And now that I'm back alone in my bed I feel like I should just end it all very soon. Every place is a memory, every person. We went to McDonald's to grab a bite and all I could think about was that at the table across us is where I was when I first met my old best friend I lost. It makes me want to cry. It makes me want to die. There's now like 3 people that meant the world to me and now we just don't talk at all anymore and are on bad terms and they ended up treating me like shit or like I don't exist. I'm too scared to get attached to anyone new now. I'm too haunted by the past, it's all I think about. What I used to have. Last summer I had an amazing boyfriend, 2 terrific best friends, life was good for a brief while in my shit existence. Now I don't have anything anymore. I lost everyone. My old boyfriend was an exchange student and he had to move back at the end of summer, my best friend of 7 years treated me like I don't even exist and like nothing more than some sort of therapist for the longest time until I had enough and cut him off, the other one was an even bigger mess and hurt me so much too... I just think about what I had before all the time and I want to die. It's so hard. I can't reach out to anyone because I know there's nothing I can really do. I lash out and I'm angry and not fun to be around, but I also get mistreated by those I love most even if I don't do anything to deserve it. I just want to die. I feel so alone in this world now, I feel so guilty that I can't even appreciate what I still have because all I feel like doing is crying and missing those I was really attached to. I'm so empty and void, I wish someone or something could save me but I don't think it's possible anymore. I can't save myself.
