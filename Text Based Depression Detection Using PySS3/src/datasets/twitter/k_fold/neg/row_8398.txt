Surviving Homelessness $DoritoHusseinI've been homeless in Greensboro, NC since June 2017. I had a mental break down when I lost my job at a plant in NC. I was using amphetamines to survive the isane schedule. I had a slip and fall and blacked out from not eating. A few weeks later I tried to kill myself by crashing on the highway. Fortunately, I was admitted to a behavioral health center. Unfortunately, I was discharged into the streets and lived in car. Eventually the car broke down, I moved into a homeless shelter and got a job with the city. NO ONE would accept my voucher to find my apartment and I tried to jump off the central library last February. I was thrown out the shelter and lost my job because I was hospitalized and lost my bed.

A few months later I was properly diagnosed as having Bipolar II. Stayed with friends, slept under bridges. My use has been in remission since January 2018. Eventually I moved into the salvation army and was able to secure a voucher with my local housing authority. It is a struggle to stay compliant with my meds - but I'm making progress.

NOW, I HAVE TO FIND $35.00 TO SECURE MY APARTMENT AND END THIS FUCKING NITEMARE. IVE BEEN EVERYWHERE AROUND TOWN. PLEASE HELP ME IF YOU CAN. I'm just fucking exhausted and I need a little light at the end of my tunnel.
