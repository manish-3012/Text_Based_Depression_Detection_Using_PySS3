I flip back and forth between being able to change and feeling like this is it.I recently got broken up with by a guy I was dating for a few months. It's been a good 3 weeks and I've been back and forth since then about how I feel about myself and how I feel about my future. 
On the one hand i feel hopeful like it's okay he wasn't for me, i can get my life together and feel good about myself if I just work hard at what I'm not happy about.
On the other hand I feel like I wasn't good enough for him and I'll never be good enough for anyone. I feel like theres something inherently wrong with me that I keep failing at everything and I should just give up completely instead of grasping for day dreams that never amount to anything.

I've been between bingeing and extreme calorie cuts. Between taking care of myself and cutting myself as punishment for failing. It's a roller coaster everyday, hating myself then taking care of myself all within hours of each other.
 Currently jobless, uneducated, and borrowing money from family just to stay a float.
