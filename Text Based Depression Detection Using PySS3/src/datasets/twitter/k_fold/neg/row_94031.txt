I dont even get the point anymore. Idk.Also first off, i still am a bit unsure how to post in this sub so im just going off other posts

Im so incredibly lonely. Its not just quarantine, i just dont really relate to anyone. But really the thing upsetting me is that even if i found someone, feelings fade. Like if i got married, we would eventually grow tired of each other. My parents had their anniversary a few days ago and wanted to bring me and my brother along. Because their romantic relationship means nothing anymore. So there really isnt a point of having a romantic relationship. Ive never seen a single marriage where the couple didnt grow tired of each other or at least lose the romantic aspect of their relationship. Getting friends is hard enough. Usually they grow tired of me or grow distant. And i try very hard. People say i am a pushover towards my friends but i really don't care. Ill be a pushover, i just dont want them to leave. But they do anyways. 
I guess im going to die alone? Not much else i can do.
