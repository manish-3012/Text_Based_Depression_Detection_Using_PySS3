Laying in bed, on day 3Here's a rant that I can't tell anyone personally. I've given up. Nobody cares if im alive or dead. I've been single for 8 years and that's with putting myself out there doing my best.  From going to the gym, library,  taking various courses like cooking or Spanish, going to the bar. Playing sports like soccer. I think my problem is im short,  skinny, not very smart or funny, and don't really look like a man for a 26 year old.  I've had one interested for several weeks,  I liked her a lot and I can tell she liked me to,  before telling her I had herpes and that was the end of that. I had just finished school and was ready to escape and leave everything behind me,  need to get out for a while, but my dad called telling me he has cancer. So I've been living with him trying to do the right thing. I've got no friends left. I don't want to be here but I can't leave. I can't tell my dad because he's dying and that would be selfish of me. So im just laying here ready to leave this world but I have to get up at least until my dad is dead.  I'm not the type for sympathy, I'm not looking for attention but I had to say something since I'm laying here and have nobody to tell. Please save the you'll find someone some day because that's clearly not happening. I've felt this way before and I've fought through it and improved myself but it made no difference. Can I just die now and avoid this misery?
