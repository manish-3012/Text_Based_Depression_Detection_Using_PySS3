I can't take this loneliness anymoreI've been all alone for 2 years now, no friends and completely alienated from family. I am 20, out of school and work so there is no way for me to meet people. All I have is the internet and it's not the same. I hope nobody responds to this so I can take it as a sign that I need to die.
