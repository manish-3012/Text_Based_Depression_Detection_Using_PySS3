Iâ€™ve had it with lifeI donâ€™t know what to do anymore I donâ€™t have any friends, I never felt a hug before or kiss from anyone Iâ€™ve just been thrown around and toyed with my family hates me my parents are dead and Iâ€™m alone living with my aunt whoâ€™s saying sheâ€™s gonna kick me out next year I have anxiety, and have clinical depression Iâ€™m on pills that I take daily but honestly they feel like placebos idk why Iâ€™m wasting my time living if no one needs me all I ever really do is comment or try to help depressed people as I think maybe Iâ€™ll make a friend like that it never works or I fuck it up as I donâ€™t know how to communicate properly and have shitty social skills just got fired from my job because I accidentally tripped and fell on the customers food at McDonaldâ€™s everyone laughed... I donâ€™t know what to do I just wanna be liked I see all these people at school who have friends and talk and laugh I just envy people who have emotional support and love and trust I wish I had someone like that but I just have bad luck Iâ€™ve lying to people and pretending I like what they like so theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™m like them and wanna talk to me more but then they find out I donâ€™t as they question me afterwards and Iâ€™m just dumbfounded and stutter like a bitch I just need a friend whoâ€™ll be there when I need them and hug them and talk and hangout to socially interact with but I donâ€™t think anyone would care enough for me as Iâ€™m asking for too much...this will be official my 4th year with depression... Iâ€™ll leave this for a bit like until tomorrow morning and see what you guys have to say about it and if you guys donâ€™t comment thatâ€™s fine but good night Iâ€™ll be here as I canâ€™t sleep..
