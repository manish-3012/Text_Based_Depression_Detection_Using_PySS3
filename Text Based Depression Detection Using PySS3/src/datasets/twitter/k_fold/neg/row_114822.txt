What actually counts as a Suicide â€œattemptâ€?How far do you have to go before something counts as an attempt? If, say, Iâ€™ve sat there with all of the medication I need to kill myself, and juice to swallow it with, thinking about whether I was actually going to do it, but then backed out, does that count as an attempt? What if Iâ€™ve sat on active railroad tracks, waiting for the train, intending not to move, but then when it actually started approaching, I got up? Took a walk, stood on an overpass, and put one foot up on the fence, but then just kept walking after a while? Does it only count as an attempt if you actually did the thing, but survived anyway? It seems like itâ€™s more than just ideation if thereâ€™s any sort of action taken at all, even without follow-through. 

What about making a detailed and researched plan, with intent to follow through eventually, does returning to that plan and tweaking it count as ideation, or actual behavior?

While obviously Iâ€™m not okay in general, I am genuinely interested in the terminology differences here. Is it maybe just one of those things that is up to each individual to determine whether they felt like it was an attempt or not?
