Money problems make me want to go sometimes.I know i'll never kill myself, but i don't know....i'm 25 and young but i'm sick of being constanly in debt and unable to catch up because one thing after the next happens and both my jobs have had piece of shit bosses including this one where they just fucking flipped the entire script on me. Hired me for a job with one boss, 2 weeks and one small argument with the psycho other boss (who you wouldn't have taken the job if you knew he'd be your boss) and suddenly he's my boss and i'm doing nothing that had to do with the job i actually signed up for. Seriously considering legal council and have already started seeing a councilor but fuck...but then again...i don't have the money. fuck. I'm trying to find a new job and i need to stop smoking pot, but its difficult when you are fucking miserable every winter in chicago. I don't know, it's just getting hard and really fucking me up. I hate money.
