I'd tried reaching out on a different sub but no one really cared.I've been feeling really alone, and I can only open up to people whilst anonymous. My 'friends' have started to drift away from me, and I haven't been invited to anything since Summer. My siblings - alongside with nearby family members of the age - mock me all the time, and I feel like I can't be serious with anyone right now. My girlfriend is in a different state rn, and the cell service ain't that great over there. She's busy anyways. I'm not looking for pity or anything, just feeling awfully lonely, just like probably thousands of others. I don't feel like I have any unique talents or anything. There's nothing that makes me stand out. Feeling a bit one-dimensional and barely anyone takes me seriously. The only things I'm told I'm good at are skiing and writing. I don't know what I'm supposed to do, honestly. I can't remember the last time I woke up happy without wanting to sleep the entire day. I'm told that my feelings/opinions don't count so much that I don't know if I should even bother to continue writing this. Maybe I am just looking for attention, but is it really that bad to complain? I don't know if I should find/make new friends or not, or to just give up entirely.(im also about halfway through high school, in case any of you guys were wondering.)

Hope I didn't waste anyone's time. There is almost nothing worse than making someone think you're dependent on them, and that's what I'm afraid of to be sad infront of people. I'm not exactly suicidal, but I just feel completely useless to everything and everyone. A laughing stock. I'm always the one to be made fun of, and I hate it.
