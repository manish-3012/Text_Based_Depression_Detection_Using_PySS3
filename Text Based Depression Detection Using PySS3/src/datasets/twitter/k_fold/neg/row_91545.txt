Honorable suicide methodHello, I'd like to know what are the most honorable suicide methods, if there are any. I'm in constant pain 24/7 and I feel such desperation that it's almost impossible. I wanted to live, to leave a mark in this world, to make it a better place. I tried to do what it takes to overcome my suffering, to make things right, but it seems that I just wasn't meant for this world. 
Thank you
