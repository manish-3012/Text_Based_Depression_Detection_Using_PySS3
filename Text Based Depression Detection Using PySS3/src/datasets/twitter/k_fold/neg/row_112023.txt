~the gaming dilemma~Sometimes i feel useless, like the kind of guy thatâ€™s just here even if he doesnâ€™t want to, the one that wantâ€™s to d*e or idk just stop existing. I play video games to chill and think about something else, and i get rekt a de times or someone is toxic and i become salty and then i start crying after losing like a shit and feel bad. And i start everything again 10 min after that. Am i stupid or just i should cease my existence.
