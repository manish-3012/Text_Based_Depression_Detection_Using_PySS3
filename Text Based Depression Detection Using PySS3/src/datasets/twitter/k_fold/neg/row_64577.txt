I havent truly been happy in 4 years. 4 years ago, the day I turned 12. I started realizing that I am the one person that gets shunned. Gets made fun of. I'm always the loser. I havent been actually happy in years. Everything is just a distraction. As soon as that distraction ends. Sadness consumes me. I keep up a mask all day, to my friends, my family. I'm just so mentally tired. I just want to lay down and die. Just melt away. Everytime I get made fun of it always plays on my insecurities. If im being honest it hurts a lot more than it should. Even from people I dont know. So I hide away, keep my feelings tucked away and try to never interact with new people. Its like im stuck in a maze. I slowly get confidence back, I show a little bit of myself. Then I get screwed over. Back into my head again. I can never shake my emotions. Never. Sadness and worthlessness are always there. Thats why I will never have a girlfriend. I'm too much of a burden, too awkward, and worthless. No one wants to deal with that. I'm ugly too. And I havent even started with smoking. I was so desperate, that cigs became a habit for me. It made me feel worse. So then the juul came along, then the fda cracked down on the youth vaping shit. I went through withdrawal. That just added to my issues. All that in a span of a year. I really just want to get hit by a fucking train. I'm sick of being the odd one out, sick of my own head, sick of what I look like, and sick of being lonely. I am truly better off dead. I'm only 16, why are there so many more years to go through?
