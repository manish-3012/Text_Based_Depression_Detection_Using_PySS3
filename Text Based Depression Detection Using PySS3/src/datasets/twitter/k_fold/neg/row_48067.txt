IdkI get that itâ€™s just a relationship ending but it feels like itâ€™s pushing my depression close to the limits. I was the asshole, I get it and Iâ€™ve been a horrible partner and have cheated on different people but does that mean I deserve to feel like this? Do I deserve this because Iâ€™ve been an awful person before?
