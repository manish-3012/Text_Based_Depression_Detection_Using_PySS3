I hate the word â€œtrigger.â€I just hate it. 

All the focus on SJWs and misandrists getting â€œtriggeredâ€ has taken away its meaning for me. Itâ€™s not about being shaken into bad feelings, or reliving flashbacks, or anything serious related to mental health. 

I feel so stupid. I feel stupid getting triggered. Because itâ€™s such a stupid word now â€” tainted by waves of people using it as a joke.

I get triggered by suicide. Seeing depictions of suicide, suicidal ideation of suggestions of it sets me off. And because of how society views being triggered, I feel weak, pathetic and *stupid.* 

I got my first proper trigger (that I can remember) when I tried to watch Birdbox. It broke me and I feel so embarrassed about it. I just broke down. And now Iâ€™m watching The Haunting of Hill House. And itâ€™s mentioned, and I feel pathetic. My chest feels tight and Iâ€™m sucked back into suicidal ideation, just like I was when I was at my lowest.

I hate this and I hate how we laugh at triggers. I hate being triggered. I hate having them. I feel stupid.

Yeah, this is a vent post that will probably get deleted.
