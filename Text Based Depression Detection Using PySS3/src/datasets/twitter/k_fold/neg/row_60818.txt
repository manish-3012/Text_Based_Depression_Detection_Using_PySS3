I've messed up everythingI talked to a girl that was mutual friends with my crush to help me with her. Later I confessed to my crush but she lightly rejected me then fully did it by text. We don't talk anymore and I feel bad.  I've forced so much on the mutual friend that she doesn't talk to me nearly as much than before. I'm terrible with girls and I just lost both of them in one day. I sit next to both in one of my classes and it's so weird. It's all my fault. I'm failing a class and about to fail more. I have nobody to talk to and the only plausible way to take myself out is by knife to the throat. Seems like too much for too little.  I want to jump from a building with people I know down below so I can hear them try to ease my pain. Sadly, no tall enough building is around. I just want friends that care for me.  My life just repeats itself from losing friends,  to messing up with my crush, and not being comfortable with talking to people about my feelings.  I was hoping this school would be different,  but it wasn't.  I have no short-term goal to look forward to.  I'm lost and furious and sad and happy (for being able to feel). Give me a reason to keep trudging along. Please,  I'm begging you. I don't want to do it,  but I'm just tired of me and my misfortune everywhere I go.  I try to be me,  mess up,  don't be me,  be sad and don't feel,  then when I do both,  it's even worse than both consequences combined. I have multiple personalities throughout the day,  and I'm so far into the year that I can't just change it. I hate myself.  I become empty when I share but when i share irl, I feel more alive than ever.
