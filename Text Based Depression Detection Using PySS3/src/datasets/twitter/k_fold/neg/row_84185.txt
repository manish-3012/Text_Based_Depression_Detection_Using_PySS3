Loneliness preventing recoveryYes I have friends, but they wonâ€™t text or call and ask how Iâ€™m doing, theyâ€™ll bully me for things out of my control, and they donâ€™t seem all too thrilled when Iâ€™m around. I just need friends around me that will hang out and tell me how cool I am and that I matter to them and not having them is worsening my depression and stopping any recovery I make. I was diagnosed with MDD a few years ago, just Incase that makes any difference
