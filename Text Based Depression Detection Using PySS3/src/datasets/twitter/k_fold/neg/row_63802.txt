The better my life gets the more I realize my brain is just fucked and maybe I should just end it all after allMy childhood was fucked up. My life is fucked up. But things have been imporving! I'm married, I have my own place, I have some wonderful dogs. I'm an artist and I'm actually quite good. I have a decent job that is fairly low stress considering it is retail. But here I am still just as depressed as I was when I was was trapped and abused and scared and in the closet (I'm trans). I try to go outside and drink water and be active and go to therapy. I still feel like shit. Why bother if even when things go well I still feel dead inside. I just want to end my life. End my suffering because I know "suicide is a permenant solution to a temporary problem" BUT HOW DO I FIX MY PROBLEM. I know "Suicide doesn't end the chances of life getting worse, it eliminates the possibility of it ever getting bwtter" but MY LIFE HAS GOTTEN BETTER BUT I DON'T FEEL ANY FUCKING BETTER. Granted my life isn't great. I'm low income and have health issues. I can barely afford my apartment and my husband doesn't pay attention to me. Also I'm too depressed to draw so fuck that I guess. ALSO THANKS FUCKING COVID FOR CANCELING MY SURGERY THAT WAS GONNA MAKE ME FEEL SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT MYSELF
