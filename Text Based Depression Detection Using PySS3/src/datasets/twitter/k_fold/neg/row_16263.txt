I want to die :(I can't stop thinking about it 

I just don't feel like I belong here!

Everyone and everything feels very mundane and I don't like it 

This is stupid because I know a lot of people love me but I don't feel it, nothing feels real they all feel so two dimensional 

I've been self harming for years but nobody would ever believe I harbour all this internal anguish because I'm cursed to be naturally bubbly.. and I don't want anyone to know I'm actually defected like this. If they knew no one would love me! They love me because I'm charming and happy and innocent but that's not who I am at all!! I feel very alien!! I always push away friends and anyone who try to love me, delete my social media, move to a new school, etc. Anything to restart my life whenever I fuck up. It makes me feel so fucking lonely but pretending is difficult and I always show my weakness and when they see me broken and vulnerable they treat me differently and I hate it so much
