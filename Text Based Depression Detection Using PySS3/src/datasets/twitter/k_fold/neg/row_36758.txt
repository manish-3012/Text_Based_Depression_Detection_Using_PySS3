fed up with everythingI had my pre defense on Monday. I presented my research paper to get a BA degree. Before the defense, my academic advisor said everything is fine and if the members of the committee criticise me, I should not worry. After I presented my research, a committee member, who  knows quite a lot about the general area of my research (though not my specific topic), said I should revise my paper. Apparently I got some things wrong. The point is that I sent the parts of my research to my academic advisor and she never mentioned those things which that committee member criticised. It might be that I will have to postpone my BA defense (though I was allowed to defend it). I just can't stop thinking it's my fault though I tried really hard.  also, I feel bad because I'll have to tell my relatives I didn't manage to graduate this year. I know I won't be able to stand their "such a smart girl, what a pity" comments.  a similar thing happened last year. I worked so hard and still had to rewrite my research. I'm good for nothing and I really studied hard.  Though I've started correcting my research, the result will still not be good enough. I can't go on like that.
