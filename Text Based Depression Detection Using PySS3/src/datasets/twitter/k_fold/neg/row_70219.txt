Iâ€™m emotionally devastated in every way possibleEveryone Iâ€™ve ever opened up to or trusted thinks Iâ€™m insane. Then they block me, beg, threaten me to stop talking to them.

I donâ€™t know why I try at anything. Clearly, Iâ€™m such a terrible person. Thatâ€™s why I hurt everyone I love. Thatâ€™s why people who know the â€œrealâ€ me donâ€™t want anything to do with me.

I donâ€™t know what the point in living is if Iâ€™m insane. 

Iâ€™m a burden.
