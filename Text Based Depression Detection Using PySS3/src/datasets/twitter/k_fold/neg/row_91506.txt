Going to finally do it.Iâ€™m finally going to do it Iâ€™m finally going to go through with this. A little info about me. Iâ€™m 24 recently divorced, working and trying to be a good citizen. However Iâ€™m being convicted with 1 count of criminal mischief worth $1,500 for damaging my exâ€™s car during our separation. Iâ€™m also being charged with 1 count of criminal mischief worth $1,500, 1 count of stalking worth one year in jail, and 1 count of 2nd degree trespassing worth 1 year in jail for urinating on my exâ€™s car during the early morning before work. All of these charges are misdemeanor offenses, I donâ€™t want to go to jail. Iâ€™m starting to finally turn my life around and now this has been put on me. I wonâ€™t go to jail. I know this is karmaâ€™s way of getting back at me for all Iâ€™ve done wrong in my long and terrible past, but I canâ€™t do this. I wonâ€™t do it Iâ€™m going to accept my defeat and finally let everyone else win. I know this might be terrible for friends and family that may care but now Iâ€™m screwed and so Iâ€™m going to admit it and just end it all save the court, my attorney, my family, my friends, and my ex wife the trouble of thinking and worrying about me. Itâ€™s time that I finally go and save everyone a huge burden.
