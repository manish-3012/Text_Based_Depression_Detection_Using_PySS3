Getting closer to the edgeI wrote my first first suicide note when i was 5. I am 26 now. A day hasn't gone by since 1996 where I don't think about killing myself at least once. As the years go by the thoughts and the urge to end it all have only become stronger. I dont know where it took a turn for the worse, maybe it was when I quit my job that I hated, a job that paid rather well considering the fact that I never even finished college.Matter of fact I dropped out of community college twice, in one year, I'm sure that's a record somewhere. I quit my job to chase a dream, at least that's what I told myself, I dreamed of being a fighter, but after realizing I was neither good at delivering punishment or receiving it, I decided that wasn't for me. At 26 it's not like I'd be able to do anything with it anyway. I though about giving stand up comedy a shot but with this social anxiety of mines getting on stage alone is a battle itself. What I do know is that I can't live my life the way society wants me to. The thought of waking up 5 days a week to spend 40 hours doing something I absolutely hate makes me want to make down every pill I can find and hope for the best. Which in this scenario is my death. I've lived with my parents now for year and a couple of months, which doesnt help. I wish I could speak to them about these issues but they wouldnt understand, their both emigrants in their 70's from a culture that doesn't really speak on mental health. long story short. they wouldn't understand. I told my mother I had anxiety and now she thinks I have alzheimer's. I don't have any talent and I've failed at most things that I've tried. I've even picked up a "photography" hobby. Pretty much taking pictures with my phone and posting them on instagram. It keeps me busy and I enjoy it but the thoughts of suicide continue to creep in daily. I have a wonderful girlfriend which I love with all my heart, she loves me too. I'm afraid to tell her about these feelings because I'm afraid that it would drive her away. I think about killing myself mostly in the mornings or at night before going to bed. I'm not afraid to die, I've never been afraid to die. As strange as it sounds I look forward to it. and I hate that. My life doesn't look like it's ever going to move forward. I'm not close to anyone in my family, I know once my parents die I'll be all alone. Sadly though, I'm ok with that. I don't remember the last time I was happy. To be honest I'm not sure what that feels like. Sure some good things happen, but when they do I'm overwhelmed by this feeling of dread that something is going to wrong. I can't take a good thing and enjoy it, I'm such a pessimist. I hate the city that I live in, But I can't afford to leave, it's an expensive city so I can't afford to live in it either. I drive for uber full time now, and although theres an opportunity to make pretty good money in it I know I cant do that for the rest of my life, I know that when self driving cars are a thing I'm fucksville. That is if my car lasts that long. I've never been good at school, even with tutoring, so going back to school would just be a waste of money. I know I should pick a career that I love, but I don't even know what that is. I took a test once in school that said I should either become a janitor or a horse trainer, so I have that going for me lol. I'm terrible with money, but that's no one's fault but my own. I don't know what is going to happen to me, and that scares me. My insurence wont cover speaking to a psychiatrist and I obviously cant afford it. I feel like a coward. I'm more willing to kill myself than I am to face my fear of failure. I'm afraid to chase my dreams, I'm afraid of failure. Failure is all I know. I don't know what feeling proud f something means. I don't want to go back to the corporate world, that's a fate worse than death in my opinion. I don't 
know who to speak with. I don't want to bother people with my issues. I just want to be happy, and I have no idea of how to do that. I tried hanging myself when I 12. but as the rope was around my neck I backed out at last minute. I thought that would be the end of suicidal thoughts, but I guess I was wrong. Life seems pointless at the moment. I feel myself getting closer and closer to the edge. I don't know how much I have left in me. I dont want to have these thoughts anymore. I want to be happy. I want to feel real joy. But sadness is what accompanies me the most. I lack purpose in this life. I don't see myself making it to 30 if things don't change. I'm just so so tired of living. I've been tired for a very long time. I don't want to end it, but the way things are going it feels like I don't have a choice.

TL;DR: I've been thinking about killing myself alot more than usual because I suck at everything
