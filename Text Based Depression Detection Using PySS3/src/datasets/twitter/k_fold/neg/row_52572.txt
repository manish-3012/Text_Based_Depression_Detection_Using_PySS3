Nothing ever goes good for me and I'm pretty fucking tired of dealing with this shitSeriously, it feels like I'm cursed and I'll never be able to be happy. My life has been fucked up ever since I was a kid and now no matter what I fucking do, everything just comes crashing down again. It seems so easy for everyone else to fix their life and get their shit together but whenever I try to do something productive, something ALWAYS has to go wrong and it just fucking ruins the small amount of motivation that I had. 

I try saving up to get myself a car and I finally get one, but of course it has transmission issues that started happening only a week after I got it. I try getting an actual job so I don't have to be a leech and burden on my family anymore, then the coronavirus hits and nobody is hiring around me. I try meeting new people and they just ghost me after a few conversations. I try exercising but I have asthma so I can't do shit without having an asthma attack. 

I'm just so fucking TIRED of always losing and I feel like I'm starting to lose my mind. God fucking damn it bro. Why do I have to go through all this shit for? Why do I gotta keep trying only for things to come crashing down back to square one all over again? I've been depressed for so long now and I have been trying with everything I have to get better, but nothing is changing. 

I'm so tired of the constant failure, depression, anxiety, low self esteem, etc. The only escape I have from all of this shit at this point is death. I'm at the top floor of a hotel room now and I could easily open the window and jump out and all of this pain would stop forever. I just wanted to get this all off my chest before I make this decision here. I just want the pain to stop, that's all
