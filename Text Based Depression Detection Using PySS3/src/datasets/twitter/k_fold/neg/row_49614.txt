im so fucking close to ending it allWhen Eminem said "When I'm Gone Just carry on don't mourn" I wish that upon my friends because I am really considering suicide at this point because I hate life and I really don't see the point to it, like, their is no peace in life, always the depression, even on the anti depressants there is only really depression.  I am so fucking tired of everyday having to fake being happy for my mom, my dad, my sister, my school counselors and all of my friends.  I am hurting inside so much and I just want the pain to end I am only fucking 14 and I have been 5150ed from my fucking school in front of all of my friends and teacher and staff taken in restraints to the hospital for hours upon end.  they think that, that probably fucking helps and shit, no it make me even more suicidal, the only permanent way to end the pain is death and cutting is only a temporary solution and if literally fucking anyone sees it they will tell someone trying to get you help which is good intentions but I will always end up going to the hospital,  I just want some peace from this never ending depression, I have tried to hang myself twice before but was stopped by my parents who came home both times, and I tried to OD Adderall (ADHD meds) but didn't take enough, I am so fucking sick and tired of this world, and what it has become, I just want to end my life because I really just don't see a future for me in this wretched thing we call a world, like, fucking for real I just want some emotional peace for once.
