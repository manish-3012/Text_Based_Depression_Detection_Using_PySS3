The love of my life and the one man I depend on is leaving me.I can't keep going. I've been trying so hard to be everything he wants. He thinks I have cheated on him multiple times when I have not and I am at my wits end. He just called me accusing me of sleeping with a guy that goes to our school. He said if it proved to be true he would never speak to me again. I can't keep going. I'm trapped and death is the only way out it seems. I just want this suffering to end but if I die I know he will follow. He told me himself that if I took my life I would also take his. I don't know what to do with that. I'm fucking dying. I can't live. But I also can't die. I'm wasting away. Please help me, the pain is unbearable.
