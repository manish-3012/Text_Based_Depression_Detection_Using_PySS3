I just want it all to be overI've been homeless for 3 months, can't afford to see a doctor, and I want it all to end. My phone doesn't even ring because none of the people I care about will call or even answer when I call. Food doesn't taste good anymore and I don't have the energy to fight this bullshit. Everything is gone. Everything I ever wanted. I hope I never wake up.
