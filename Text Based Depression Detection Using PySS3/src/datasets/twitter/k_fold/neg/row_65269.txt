Idk how to feelI had a pretty good day. Wasnâ€™t even sad. Went to an appointment super early despite being hungover. Didnâ€™t starve myself which is good because Iâ€™m still working on that. Hereâ€™s where my downfall was. I called my ex about an hour ago and HE IGNORED MY CALL. Multiple times. My other friend texted him and he said he blocked me because he canâ€™t stand to be around someone so self destructive. How selfish am I for hating him for not wanting to help me despite him trying so much in the past.... I get where he is coming from and I respect him but damn. Not even the person I thought cared about me the most wants to be associated with me anymore. I was making slight suggestions to my friend about hanging myself with a scarf and I donâ€™t think he knew the gravity of my words. The only reason I donâ€™t do it is because I donâ€™t want to break my parents hearts :( and Iâ€™m so close to getting my masters degree.. but Iâ€™d rather be a shell of a person just to protect their emotions.
