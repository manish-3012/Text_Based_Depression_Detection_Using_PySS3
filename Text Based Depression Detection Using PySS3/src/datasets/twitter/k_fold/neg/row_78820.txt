Lost the only person that was keeping me here.And it was all my fault. She got tired of always arguing with me, she told me I never cared for her, that I was too busy with myself and my shit thoughts. I can't do this without her. Everything else absolutely sucks balls. She got me through these 4 years of dealing with depression and now I fucked it. I started feeling suicidal again every day since June and it just doesn't stop. I don't enjoy shit. I feel dumber and dumber every day. I don't remember things. I'm toxic towards my family and the only person that truly liked me for who I was. Man I really hope I have the power to do this. Should have done it properly the first time, oh well.
