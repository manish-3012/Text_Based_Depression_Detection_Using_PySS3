I donâ€™t know what to doMy niece who is 13 took 18 paracetamols in attempt to take her life. Last month she had self harm cuts on her wrists that I saw when we her sleeve fell down. She was rushed to hospital 2 days ago and got her stomach pumped. She took the 18 paracetamols and went to sleep, maybe hoping she wouldnâ€™t wake up. However she went to school the next day and mustâ€™ve complained about a painful stomach and then she told the teacher, from there she was rushed to hospital and got her stomach pumped. I donâ€™t know how to deal with these type of things or how to go around it? Please give me any advice I would appreciate it. She has me very worried I canâ€™t even sleep itâ€™s now 7 am
