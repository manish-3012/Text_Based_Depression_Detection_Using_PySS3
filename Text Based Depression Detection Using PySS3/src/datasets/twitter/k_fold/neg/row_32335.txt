I really want to sleep and not wake upEvery single night the pain gets more intense and itâ€™s harder for me. I feel suffocated. I cut again last night because i literally felt like i could not breathe i could not see. Nothing feels real anymore. Nothing matters anymore. I just want to go to sleep. This is only thing thatâ€™s helping me bi feel so alone. So lonely. I donâ€™t want anything else but to make the pain stop. Thatâ€™s all i want. For the pain to stop. I have nothing to look forward to but pain.
