I pushed away the only people I stayed alive for.I was afraid of hurting two peopleâ€”my mom and my best friend. 

My mom used to call every Friday. She hasnâ€™t called in weeks. She doesnâ€™t text. So I donâ€™t have to worry about her caring. 

My best friend was another issue. But I think he finally got tired of me feeling sorry for myself. Tonight he called me ugly, and fat, and said I cause all my own issues which could easily be solved. He said no boys would be attracted to me until I lost weight. It ended when he said he no longer wanted to speak to me. 

So I guess I got the reassurance I needed. I can leave and itâ€™ll be okay. In fact, my best friend and I had a falling out years ago, where he said he was able to convince himself he hated me. If he could do that once, surely he could do it again and doesnâ€™t really need me here. 

Iâ€™m allowed to leave and everything will be okay.
