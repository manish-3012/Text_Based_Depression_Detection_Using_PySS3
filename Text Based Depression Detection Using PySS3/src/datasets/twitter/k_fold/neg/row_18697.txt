I'm done.22 years of hating myself has finally done its job. I've always wanted that life, but something in me held me back. I've pondered what it was. Maybe I wasn't smart enough. Maybe I wasn't quick enough. Maybe it's just not me. The doubt was always there. Like a tumor, telling me I couldn't accomplish. I've fantasized about taking a gun and just blowing the doubt out of my brain. But I know it's not rational. It would kill me, what would that accomplish? Nothing. But the older I grow, the deeper I fall. Scouring around my pathetic existance searching for a point has only left me empty. I thought having friends would fill the void. It didn't. I thought weed would heal it. It didn't. I thought convincing myself that I could be whoever I wanted to be would save me. It didn't. I'm just as pathetic as I've always been. I just don't have it in me.
