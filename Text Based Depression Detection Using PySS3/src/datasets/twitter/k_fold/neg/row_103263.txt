Its happening again...This is something I posted 2 years ago:

"I don't know where to start... but perhaps it was 2 years ago, i feel for someone and i tried to deny myself and convince myself I didn't have these feelings for this girl. In the past I ran away because of rejection that heavily impacted me. I know that we all go through this and it is part of life. But I dealt with it by disconnecting from all the people that were connected, its not the best method, but it allowed me to go up and down until 2 years ago.

I cannot run away... not this time. Her sister married my older brother and even on their wedding day we were the groomsman and bridesmaids. They're even having their first child soon, everything felt like... all the pain i felt in the past lead up to this defining turning point. It reassured what I truly felt 2 years ago, it wasn't lingering feelings or trying to find companionship or settling. It was beyond that.

She changed me... I felt more motivated in my life to change to become a better man for her... I was unsuccessful in finding a job in my career path, but i thought if i studied to become a real estate agent, I can work hard. Hopefully build up the courage to confess to her... one day. I started going to the gym and was frustrated at my inability to do the best I could at times. I wanted to change, I wanted to be a better person... Because of her.


Then I found out... she started seeing someone, someone from her work, and its very serious. He seems like a gentle and wonderful person. Calm, easy... but above all that... someone she loves.

Ever since I found out.. just the smallest things she tells me makes me break down heavily. My family has some hints but aren't sure exactly because I refuse to talk. I've started having insomnia, I ... I've even started hallucinating... peoples voices become white noise and I see her. I've become traumatised, I even stopped looking for a job because I know I won't be here soon. Its causing me to hope someone runs a red light and causes me to be in a car accident so the death looks accidental. For me to die from alcohol poisoning. I even asked for any 'god' to just kill me. 

At first she was going to move overseas, with him... I had the thought that when that happens I would drug myself and just die in my sleep from overdose.

She's excited with wanting to move in with him... she's even said he is her soul mate. I've even consoled her because she felt she betrayed him in some matters... even then I told her to stay with him... because she honestly loves him.

I love her... and I want her to be happy. 
I recently heard an analogy where suicide is like being in a burning building. I've wanted to jump for a long time... But i thought i'd run through the burning building... hoping I'll make it through. I thought I could try go through the rest of my life, knowing I will not be capable of these feelings with another, ever again.
I thought I could do it... But... I can't... 
If I could... I'd make everyone forget I ever existed... So I won't cause them pain when I die. I even prayed to god, i'm not religious or anything but I hope if they do exist... that they listened. so that I would take all the pain she suffered, and any sadness she may suffer for my life.   

I'm soon to become an uncle, and I don't think I will see my little niece or nephew grow up. I want her to be happy, I want her to grow more, be loved and to fulfill her dreams. To be married and have kids when shes 32 and grand children, to always have that beautiful smile, that infectious laugh, those deep eyes and the cheeks that red up when shes embarrassed. Soon I won't ever see her ever again.

Even now as I write this, I've broken down three times. I know I cannot go on. So I'm ready.

I'm not scared of death... It'll be quick. What I am scared of... is life.
Life without her." 


2 years and she has not gone yet... she broke up with that person... but she's still going to go...


I really do love her. I've been trying to make peace with myself. .. and part of me... says if i truly love her... let her go to america...

But will I be ok? ... I do not know.

I know... if she leaves... she'll  never return. 

I Write this... incase it really is my last words.

I will always love you,  forever and always. R...

Love. Ecks.
