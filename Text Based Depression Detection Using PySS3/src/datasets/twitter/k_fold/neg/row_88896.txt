Giving UpThree weeks ago my boyfriend (21) of ten months very unexpectedly broke up with me (F/20). He first asked for a break, then after I had a night of panic attacks and fear of becoming suicidal again, he said he had to end it because he couldn't be a "sole support system," loving me was "complicated," and basically said I was damaged and top much for him. He didn't give me the chance to say how I felt because he left me crying and panicking. 

It's been the most difficult three weeks of my life. I can't feel anything but numb, I cry myself to sleep, I wake up panicking and can't sleep through the night. I've tried everything. I've reach out to old and new friends, I was the busiest I've ever been, I go to class, I watch tv, I hooked up with someone, I'm at a new therapist, I'm on my meds, but nothing makes this numbness go away. 

I tried talking to him a few days after it happened and it was like talking to a brick wall. He's back on tinder and he's already seeing someone else and she looks like me. I had a complete breakdown again today and had to leave in the middle of my extracurricular because I spent 20 minutes panicking in the bathroom. 

Earlier I almost did it, but my friend convinced me to be strong and I told her I'd try for a month, but four hours later I'm having another panic attack and I'm back in bed holding the same bottle of my migraine pain killers half wanting to just make the pain stop and the other half hoping if I end up in the hospital it will make him care again. 

I just want him back. He's the only one that can help with this pain and help me get through this. I have no energy left for pretending to be okay and being strong. I just don't want to wake up and deal with this bullshit all over again. It's not getting easier or better, it's getting worse and I just need this feeling to stop. If he can't come stop it I just need to do it myself.
