I Hate Leaning on PeopleI like to think I love people. They interest me in many ways, including myself since I'm one of them. However, it really drains me the idea that I'm leaning on others too much. There's no other way to put it. I have no idea how far I should be at this point in life or how independent, except that most people my age are married and/or working. 

Recently, this leaning on others thing has become more of an issue, because as I get older everyone seems to expect more independence of me, and I get insecure and 'hide' in my room instead of being there and talking, because I'm worried they'll make some snarky but sincere comment that I'm not working hard enough or that I'm a freeloader (I loathe that word). It really does make me feel suicidal at times. Like I would rather be anywhere but there. The shame... 

So what can I do to feel less guilty for leaning on other people? Maybe I should buy my family a gift like champagne or something.
