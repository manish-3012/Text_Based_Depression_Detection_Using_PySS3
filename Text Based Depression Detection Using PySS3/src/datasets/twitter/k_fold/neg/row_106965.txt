My life is garbage. I want to give up.I can't do it anymore. I'm tired of always being the loser of the game, I don't know how many people here feel this same sentiment but I'm a complete loser and my life is garbage. I have nothing.

I'm depressed 

I'm ugly

I'm fat

I have no friends

I'm failing in school

I will likely be going into foster care soon

I can't go outside anymore without panicking because I can't get myself together

There's literally nothing left for me. I tried before and it didn't work out, it never works out for me. You're either born into something good or you're not. Everything is dictated by what you were born into, what you look like, and what you have. I don't have anything, what I got were abusive parents, depression, bullies, and worst of all myself.

I'm the root of all of my problems and it's much too late to fix them now. If I just disappear it won't hurt anymore, I'll finally be free from myself anf this world. I hope you all can find something to keep you here, I hope you all have something.
