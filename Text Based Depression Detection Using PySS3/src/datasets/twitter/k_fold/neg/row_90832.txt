I can't deal with the sadness after breaking up with my 1st girlfirendI broke up with my girlfriend after 6 months of relationship. I'm 17 and we are in the same class. We just weren't good for each other. Too much things that made us different. I tried not to be too sad about it. Five days after breakup I found out that my best friend was kissing with her at the party. It felt like train hit me. Now looking at her, smelling her perfumes and talking to her makes me even more depressed. I miss her, I just want to kiss her again. I want to end my life.
