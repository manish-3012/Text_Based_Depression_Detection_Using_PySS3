Losing myself and feel like ill never feel like myself againDoes anybody else here never feel like themselves anymore bcuz of what u have done in the past, and feel like you will never truly feel like yourself again? These thoughts make me feel like a horrible person and i just want to get back to feeling like myself again, but that was a long time ago and returning back to that state seems so far away, if not unreachable at all. Please help bcuz my thoughts make it worse everyday and i dont know what to do. Just feel like im a fake version of myself and i cant stand it anymore. Thanks
