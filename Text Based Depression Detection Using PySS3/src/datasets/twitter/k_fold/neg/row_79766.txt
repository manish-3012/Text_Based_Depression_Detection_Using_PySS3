always leaveWhy do they always leave after they get what they want? I am more than that. I am so much more. I deserve so much more. I am worth more. Why does everyone always abandon me? Iâ€™m sad. I cry too much. I push people away because of my hurt and wonder why they leave. I feel like itâ€™s never going to end. When will I come out of this hurt finally. When can I see the light?
