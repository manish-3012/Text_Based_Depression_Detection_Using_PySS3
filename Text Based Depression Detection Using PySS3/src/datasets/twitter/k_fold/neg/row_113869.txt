I canâ€™t do it anymore, itâ€™s not fair.I have been depressed up until I moved out for college. That was the best semester of my life and I never smiled so much, I had a few bad nights but overall I felt happy. I found an internship and really saw my life going somewhere. 

Now only a week later; I wonâ€™t get into my major, I have no money, I have no friends and I realized Iâ€™ll be like this forever. 

If you met me you would realize how hard I try, I try to make everyone laugh, I involve everyone, I respect my family, I study for hours yet still canâ€™t pass an exam and I work 40 hours at the internship but itâ€™s not enough to help me get a room for school.

Living out of the house and my job future were the only things to get me out of the bed in the morning. Now there is nothing. I wonâ€™t have enough money to get an apartment and my major didnâ€™t accept me. So now I know I will be depressed everyday but this time I know I canâ€™t make it through.

I have never heard of a kid who doesnâ€™t do drugs  or has no friends but is an idiot. A kid who works 40 hours but still canâ€™t make enough.  A kid that tryâ€™s to help people smile but canâ€™t do it on my own. This isnâ€™t fair.

I am going to bed after I post this and will give my mind time to think
