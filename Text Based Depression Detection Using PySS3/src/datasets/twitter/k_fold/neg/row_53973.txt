StoriesAnyone want to share times when you tried/failed...or when you changed your mind?

I had a plan to do it a few years ago, but before I did, I wanted to apologize to someone I wronged and tell them how special they are. Made an elaborate plan, picked a perfect day (eight months before my planned end). Tried to make them feel as special as possible.

Told myself NOTHING they said would change my mind.

Rookie mistake, I let them change my mind. Said something super sweet. They had NO IDEA what I was planning to do.

I'd hoped they'd want to meet up and I was planning on telling them when we did while touching his chest and saying I HAVE to do it and knowing they'd agree, but they had moved too far away while we weren't talking. But I didn't care at first until I realized they were too busy to care about me anymore.

So the day rolled around...and I could have done it. I had two people who were ragging on me and telling me how horrible I am and how I'm so goshdarn inferior to them because they're old and snobby and my way is always wrong. I am pretty sure my method would work if I tried. I played with it but pulled back on account of feeling one person needed me to make their life better. And not the person who changed my mind.

And now I realize I should've done it that day. That's what I get for letting nonsense change my mind.
