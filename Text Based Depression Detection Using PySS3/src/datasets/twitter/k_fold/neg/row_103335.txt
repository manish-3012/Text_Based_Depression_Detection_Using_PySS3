I wanna end it all but thereâ€™s one little thing holding me hereItâ€™s probably the most stupid thing ever but the man Iâ€™ve loved and dedicated nearly two years of my life to broke up with me yesterday. In addition to that i have all my mental health issues, have no friends to talk to, and thereâ€™s the whole social distancing thing, Iâ€™m completely alone in the world and the only thing stopping me from ending it all is the fact that he an ex gf who committed suicide, and I donâ€™t wanna cause him that pain again. But again, he didnâ€™t think about the pain heâ€™s causing me so is it even worth being worried about how he feels?
