Iâ€™ve almost ended up killing myselfSo... yeah, my 2017 was going not so well as you might have guessed. 
Depression got worse, school performance dropped and I fcked things up with my crush. 

On Sylvester I was invited to a party of a friend and we drank a lot and had fun. Heâ€™s living in a village not too far from here and they are close to some bridges and the highway. 

Just about 10 minutes before the year ended I walked away.

My plan was to go to a bridge and jump as soon as I see a car -or even better- a truck driving underneath it.

However, I was very drunk and I rarely ever am in that village, so I had no plan where I could find the bridges and I ended up being lost.

And my phone died

So I was wandering around, drunk, suicidal at New Year. 

Good. Fucking. Shit.

My friends went to on to search for me as soon as they noticed me being not there and having no idea where I could be. And they found me. That friend that invited me over told me that he even searched at and underneath bridges. We havenâ€™t talked more about my depression, it was only that one statement. 

When we were back at the party, we had some nice other conversations, played karaoke and eventually I kinda blacked out. Like, not fall and vomit, but I canâ€™t remember anything that happened after I sang  some songs. 

Iâ€™m a mess.
