Stuck pixel on a big screenI had dreams of going into space when I was little. Now I fantasize about starting up my VR rig and shooting myself while looking at the stars in Elite Dangerous. I've been stagnant for over 10 years now. People talk about how they change over time but I'm trapped here, if could give my body to anyone else I would. Why can't I grow as a god damn person. I don't think I'm capable of being a healthy person anymore. I want to be able to fall asleep without hating myself.
