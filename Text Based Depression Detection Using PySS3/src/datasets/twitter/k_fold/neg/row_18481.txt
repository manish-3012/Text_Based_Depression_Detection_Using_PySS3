Does anyone else ever feel like they're just waiting for an "acceptable" reason?I'm 23 years old. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I just feel so...tired. And so stressed all the time. I am 100% sure that the only reason that I'm still alive today is because my life is seemingly "perfect" on paper. I am married. Have two loving parents (although they don't love each other). I have thankfully never been abused. I am typically well liked and don't fight with anyone. I finally have a decently paying job with benefits and don't have to beg to take Christmas Day off (used to work at a dog kennel...always got stuck with the shift). For the first time in my life, I have SAVINGS, with more than just $100 in it. 

But...I feel so miserable. I have struggled with depression, anxiety, OCD, and ADD in some form or another since high school. I have crippling social anxiety that makes me constantly worry what everyone thinks of me at all times. I thought I was better after years of therapy and meds, but...after I graduated last May and could no longer go to free therapy sessions, things seemed to have exploded in my brain. Everything I do is amplified. And my new job isn't helping...I have so much more responsibility and so many people depending on me that it's so damn overwhelming I just want to curl up and die. Because of fucking *expectations??*

These are the days I hate myself. When I sit down and really think about how I should be happy. About how my life is nothing to complain about, and thinking about suicide makes me pathetic when nothing has happened to me. I've taken some old Lorazepam that my college psychiatrist prescribed me last year and now I feel...bearable. But there's not much left and there's no more refills and for some reason my psychotic brain is afraid to find someone else to prescribe this stuff again...
