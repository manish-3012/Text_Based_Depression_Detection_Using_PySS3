I feel so bad but I'm so scared of hospitalI'm so scared of how I feel, I have taken my night meds early so I will go to bed early, hopefully so I feel better in the morning.

But I feel so bad, I feel like I should be punished for being so unworthy of living, but i don't want to die. I can't breathe  and my heart hurts.

But I can't call a helpline or go to hospital bc last time I was in it was so bad, and I can't go back to that. I just want this implanon out of my arm so I can go back to being how I used to  be.
