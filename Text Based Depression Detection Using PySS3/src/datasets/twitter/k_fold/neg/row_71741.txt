Iâ€™m really lost right now.Iâ€™m just having a tough time. I am really really depressed, like canâ€™t get out of bed depressed, canâ€™t do things I love depressed, fighting with my fiancÃ© for no reason depressed. I feel so lost and lonely. I feel even embarrassed for posting on here to a bunch of strangers but I feel like I have no one to talk to. Everyone is counting on me to support them and I am failing. I donâ€™t know what to do.
