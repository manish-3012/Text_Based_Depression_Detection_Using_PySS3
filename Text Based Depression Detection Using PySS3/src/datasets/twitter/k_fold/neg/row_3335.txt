I know for a fact my life will end by my own hand. So why do I keep putting it off?I've known since I was a teenager that I'd kill myself. I knew I'd never make it to 40. So why do I keep pushing it, dragging it out? Why am I laying here thinking, "It's no big deal. I'll kill myself before too long" instead of just doing it? 

I'm so angry at the world for not being what I want it to be. And angry at myself for the same thing. I know the solution. I wish I was strong enough to just do it.
