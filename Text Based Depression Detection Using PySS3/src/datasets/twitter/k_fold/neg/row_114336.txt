Best way to do it for my loved onesIâ€™m not saying Iâ€™m going to do it, but I want the option you know? Sounds nihilistic but the option to leave if I so wanted and give up the fight Iâ€™ve been struggling with for my entire life. Again, this isnâ€™t a cry for help. Iâ€™ve gotten professional help, but there no magic answer. I still have bad days, and really bad days. Just the know how and option really help. The thought of leaving my loved ones fucking tears me apart, itâ€™s the reason Iâ€™m still here and getting help. I never had a plan when I was at my lowest, but I thought it was inevitable. Some people arenâ€™t meant for life and I feel Iâ€™m one of those People. All just means to an end. So In the purely hypothetical, what would be the best way for their sake. Last thing Iâ€™d want to be a burden even if it would be the last time. Would I do it at home, away from home, OD I assume is the cleanest and easiest for my Tastes. Do I call the authorities before hand so they my family donâ€™t have to see anything? I have notes of course, about 2 notebooks full, canâ€™t leave without providing an explanation and closure. Maybe I just fall in a ditch somewhere and donâ€™t do anything at all, maybe not knowing us best, idk.
