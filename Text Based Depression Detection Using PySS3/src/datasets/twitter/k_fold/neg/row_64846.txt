clearly here for a reason (25F)I'm done. Really really done with everything. I've been trying to fake happiness and mental stability, but I can't really do it anymore. I'm slipping and I'm more depressed than I've ever been in my life. I know what triggered this current suicidal thought explosion, but it's gotten to the point where these frequent cycles of suicidal thoughts has been increasing in frequency and length. 


I have the means to kill myself, even quickly. I've got a gun. I have a car. I could just drive up into the mountains, drive off the road somewhere that no one will find me and end it. No one will have to clean up the mess. I'll make sure to tie up loose ends and it'll be fine. I'll be free. 


I'm SO CLOSE to doing it. And the scary thing is I'm trying to cry, trying to relieve the tension but my eyes are burning and the tears just won't fall. 


I can't do this anymore.


I don't know how to get better or where to start.
