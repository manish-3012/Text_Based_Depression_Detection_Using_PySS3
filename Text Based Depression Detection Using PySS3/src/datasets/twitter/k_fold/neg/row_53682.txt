I keep stepping in front of traffic...I've stepped in front of speeding traffic several times today. No one has hit me, they all brake. Is that attempted suicide? 

The only thing stopping me doing anything myself is the fear of failing. If i failed I'd be looked down on, moreso than I already am. I don't know what to do anymore.
