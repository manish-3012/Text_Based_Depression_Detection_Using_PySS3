Hey guys and girls, this is my last weekend on EarthHi everyone, I just wanted to leave my story somewhere, before I depart.

Iâ€™m a 37 year old guy going through some tough shit. Two months ago, my wife said she wanted a divorce, and Iâ€™ve been steadily going downhill.  Iâ€™ve been battling depression, anxiety, PTSD from Iraq, and borderline personality disorder.  Iâ€™ve basically been out of work since she told me  she wanted to leave.

Iâ€™ve been trying everything to get better. Inpatient hospital.  Partial hospitalization. Dbt therapy. 6 or 7 different meds.  Nothings working.  

I have no friends, nobody to talk to except my wife. I want to change for her, to be a family again.  She wonâ€™t even give me the CHANCE to prove I can do it.  I donâ€™t blame her, things have been shitty for awhile.

Iâ€™ve made 2 real suicide attempts in the last couple months, but they were very impulsive and the didnâ€™t work.  A few days ago, my wife and I had a fight... I freaked out and was up all night. I had asked her if I should go do it and she told me â€œgo aheadâ€. I kept hearing her say that all night. I went to Walmart and bought a tent, stove, charcoal.  In the morning I hiked into the woods. I got frustrated trying to set up the tent and went to sleep

I know where the stuff is in the woods, and Iâ€™m going back this week to do it.  Iâ€™m too unstable to be around my son, my wife is about to get a restraining order because I text her Non stop.  Iâ€™m going to lose my job because Iâ€™m supposed to be back from FMLA Tuesday, and the thought of being there makes me ill.  

I guess Iâ€™m just done trying. Iâ€™m losing everything in the world thats important to me.  

Thanks for reading, be kind to each other.
