How do I stop the feeling of loneliness?After two panic attacks in a week, I'm feeling a little better finally, but I feel like I'm still generally on a downward trend. 

The feeling of loneliness is killing me. The want for someone to physically be with, the feeling of tangible connection and love. Something. 

I don't know what to do anymore. The days and weeks go by, and everything is the same. A constant downward trend. 

I don't have the confidence or money for counseling. I would be so embarrassed. I'm also not good at attracting or meeting people. 

I'm not entitled to people, but I feel a growing frustration with my situation. 

I'm young, but I feel as if time is really running out.
