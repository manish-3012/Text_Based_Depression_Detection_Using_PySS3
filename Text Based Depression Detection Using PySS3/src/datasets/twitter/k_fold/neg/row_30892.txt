Iâ€™ve stopped cryingSince Iâ€™ve came to the realization that suicide is ultimately the only thing that is going to bring me any peace I have been extremely emotional and all over the place in my head. I put a count down in my phone to the day I have decided and about 3 days ago at the 30 day mark I just randomly realized it was almost here. I felt at peace with my decision. I have accepted that what Iâ€™ve decided is the right move and am ok with it.
