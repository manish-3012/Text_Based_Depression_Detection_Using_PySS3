A popular loner.I was a popular person in school and junior college. I never thought I'd transform to such a terrible person. When I entered senior college I was doing pretty good for a few days but then I started to lose my confidence. I felt like I wasn't good enough. I felt ugly. I stopped talking to people/ people stopped talking to me. Waking up and getting off bed was so hard. I used to sleep for 12 13 hours straight. I cried in class of 60 students none of them bothered to ask. I just needed some to say " it's going to be okay." I feared lights I didn't want to look at myself. There were days when I don't know if I was surviving tomorrow. Indeed I was suicidal. I knew I wasn't going to kill myself but I had these thoughts in my head. But I adapted myself a little into this. But this is really hard to be around people who don't even look at you. It's hard spending entire day without speaking to anyone. I'm still trying to accept I'm really low and no one likes me and nobody cares if I'm alive. It's been two years now and I'm worsening with time.
