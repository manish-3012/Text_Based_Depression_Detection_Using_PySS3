Last night I dreamt that I wanted to liveAnd it was so real. I've never felt something so oddly strong neither in real life or a dream. Now I can't get it out of my head. What if that's how I really feel deep down? Maybe that's why I say "one more day" to myself everyday, clinging to life. But at the same time I don't want to stay alive for not even a second. Is it really the same mind thinking both of the absolute opposite thoughts? Is it the same heart wanting to feel everything &amp; nothing at the same time? I don't know anymore.
