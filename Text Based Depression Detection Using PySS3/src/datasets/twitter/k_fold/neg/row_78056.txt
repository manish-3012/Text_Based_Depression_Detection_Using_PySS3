I contacted the suicide hotline but left because I felt like I was wasting someone's time, who could be helping someone who actually deserved help.I just feel so worthless. It sounds dumb but the person seemed so bored with my problems and showed little interest. I truly feel like I deserve no help. I skipped school today to call, but I just feel terrible now. I feel like I am truly better off dead. Like the quality of this planet would improve if I was gone. I am crying like a toddler at my computer right now. I hate myself.
