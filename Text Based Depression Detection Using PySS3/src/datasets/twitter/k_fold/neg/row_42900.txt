About six months to go for this impoverished senior woman.I figure I have about six months to go before I die.  At that point I will have gone through my small saving from before my husband (age 77) divorced me (age 72) after 50 years of marriage with which I supplement my SS and half my husband's pension.  I can't make it on that.  My total income is $1100.00 total per month.  Rent is $740.  I have a car and insurance to pay for, can't walk well, and am rather rapidly losing the use of my hands.  Oh yes, my medical insurance runs out about then too.  I'm moderately suicidal every night.  During the day, I try to keep busy and  try to help the depressed and suicidal young people on Reddit.  I have no living family and few friends.  I am actually eager to end my life, but I have to wait until I can get enough belongings sold to go to Europe to end my life there with legal dignified suicide.  I would like to hear from other senior citizens who are in the same boat.
