My boyfriend wants to commit suicideI have anxiety and depression and my boyfriend has depression. I have major problems with family and an event kicked off today which my boyfriend takes blame for. He wants to end it all as he has been struggling for months. I have tried everything but I don't know what to do anymore. Has anyone got any advice?
