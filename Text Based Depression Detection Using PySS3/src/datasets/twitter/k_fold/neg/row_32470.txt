I Donâ€™t Ever Want to be the Parent of Someone Whoâ€™s On Reddit Talking About How Much They Hate Their Narcissist Mother.I can see it being that way though. I can see my kids growing up to hate me. Iâ€™m mentally unwell.

They wonâ€™t know how many times I sought out help. Theyâ€™ll only see the times I spazzed out on them when I was overwhelmed.

They wonâ€™t see my loneliness. Theyâ€™ll just think that I purposely try to make their father sad.

They will say how the family doesnâ€™t deal with me for a reason, they wonâ€™t care about the abuse.

I donâ€™t want them to suffer a depressed mother. I grew up with one, it wasnâ€™t fun. Iâ€™d rather them live with the stigma of a dead mom than an abusive depressed mom.

I donâ€™t want to be the mother I see myself becoming. I will kill myself first before Iâ€™m her.
