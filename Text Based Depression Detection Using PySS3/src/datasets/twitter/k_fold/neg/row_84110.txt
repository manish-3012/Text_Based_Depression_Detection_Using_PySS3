47 year old virgin [m]. Is there any hope for me?I'm not sure if this belongs here. I'm not planning to commit suicide right away, but I have been having suicidal thoughts. There's more to it, but the title is a lot of it. I'm just so fucking lonely and can't figure out what to do about it. 

I know this whole subject is a big joke, because of the movie, 40 year old virgin, and the whole "forever alone" thing on reddit, but for me it's not a joke. It's been a misery my whole life. If only it could be as simple as the thing in the movie. In my case, there was some bad shit that happened when I was a kid that I don't want to get into, but anyway, it's complicated. 

Sometimes I'm almost OK with it. I occupy myself with other things. Then for some reason I want it again and I completely suck at dating. Furthermore, I have a deal now where I only want women who are plainly too young for me. I see women my own age and they look like old women. Maybe that makes me a bad person, but I can't help it, that's how it is. I go on dating sites and see them and just say fuck it, I can't go there. Also I don't just want to get laid. I would love to have a girlfriend.

I've had a few younger women who acted for a while like they might be interested in that way, but it never went anywhere. Either they thought better of it, were just messing with me for fun, or I read things into it that might not have been there. 

I have this idea in the back of my mind that one day I will find a prostitute that I'm attracted to, get what sex I can till I max out my credit card, then kill myself. I don't know if I will actually do it, because I think of the people who care about me that I would hurt, but dammit they all fucking have someone and I don't. Or they at least have had someone. 

I feel like all my friends, everyone is living their lives, having relationships, kids, etc., and I'm stuck in amber. 

Thanks for listening.
