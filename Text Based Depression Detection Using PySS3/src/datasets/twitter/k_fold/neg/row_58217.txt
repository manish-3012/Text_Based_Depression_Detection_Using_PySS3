I'm a horrible person and I'll kill myself in an hourSome of you'll say that I'm not that horrible but I actually truly believe that I deserve to die for this.

Basically, my friends ask if we play a game together and call and I always say yes because I only have two friends and am excited to do stuff with them. They don't ask that often anymore tho I always ask if we could call or play in the afternoon when I'm at home and they are usually too. But almost every time they ignore me and if not they say they don't have time. Or that they'll eat and call after that but then don't and stuff like that. So I'm texting them a lot because I'm excited to interact with them. I'm really annoying them and I'm having a lot of mental breakdowns when they ignore me. I'm always threatening to kill myself to get their attention but I'm actually serious now. 

I hope they can forgive me. I hope this text isn't that big of a mess if you've decided to read it. I also really hope that this will make my friends' lives easier because I really like them. :)

Goodbye
