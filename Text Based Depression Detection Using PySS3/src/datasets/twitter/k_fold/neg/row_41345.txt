Life is still shit, but I don't want to die anymore.It's been a long six months. Husband left me due to my PTSD and depression in December. Got on antidepressants at the same time. Tried to commit suicide in March, and twice in the same week in April (I've never been suicidal before). Spent each time in the psych ward. It was fucking hell. I didn't see a way out. I just wanted to die, and wanted my misery to end. My depression had consumed my life. I was trapped in my own miserable hell. I drank whenever I was too depressed to even try to deal with my life that day. Experienced some extremely scary shit which I never would have otherwise. Those situations did something to me. Something finally clicked. Whether it was seeing myself risking my life in some dark places with terrifying people, or what, I don't know.
 
But I finally scared myself enough to care. I haven't drank or taken any medication in almost two weeks. I feel great. My medication fucked with my mind and made me much worse than I was before. If you're on antidepressants and seem worse than you were before, get the fuck off of them. Don't ask, just do it. Fuck all those meds I was on. I don't want to die anymore. And I don't plan on being on any type of medication for my depression again. Life is still shit, but I don't want to die.
