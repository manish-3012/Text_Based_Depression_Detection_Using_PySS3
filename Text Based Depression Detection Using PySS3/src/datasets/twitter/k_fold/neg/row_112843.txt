My husband is missingMy husband has been missing for 2 weeks. I found a note on his computer saying â€˜goodbyeâ€™ to our 3 week old son. The note is not clear whether or not he was going to take his own life or like run away. We found his car a couple days later with receipts from Walmart and Loweâ€™s. He bought bubble wrap trash bags duct tape scissors vodka water bottle and coconut water with cash. His car was locked but no sign of him his cell phone wallet or keys. We surveyed the whole neighborhood and woods looking for him but no sign. Does this sound like he walked a few miles to commit suicide and not be found? Or more like he wanted to disappear and start new life somewhere? Thanks for your help.
