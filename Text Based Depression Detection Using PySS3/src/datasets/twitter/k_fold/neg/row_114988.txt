TonightI can't do this anymore. I've tried seeing the bright side. I've tried telling myself it gets better. As it turns out, I really am the problem. So my solution is to take the problem out of the picture. So tonight will be my not-so-grand finale. I just need to figure out a way to do it and leave a detailed note. I'm sorry to everyone I've hurt over the years. Just know that I didn't mean to bother anyone. I'll do this quietly. I'm sorry.
