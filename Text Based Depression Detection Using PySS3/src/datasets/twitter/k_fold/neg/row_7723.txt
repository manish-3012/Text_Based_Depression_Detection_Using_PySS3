I just can't live anymore. I have to end it all.Where do I begin. First I should explain I am currently failing university. My parents hate me for that, like legitimately, hate me. I had a girlfriend for about a monthly, then found out she was cheating on me, with one of my old friends. I actually really liked this girl. She was cute and funny and smart. Guess it was too good to be true. Furthermore, I recently hid my report card(yes my uni still does report cards) from my parents because they would see just had bad I am, and I didn't want that. Well they found it, and know they hate me. 

I don't even know if this post deserves to be here. Everyone else posts these super touching stories where they barely have enough money to get by. And I am here like "My marks are bad, and my parents are a bit upset." If the mods remove this post, I don't blame them. 

Recently I have had thoughts of just ending it all, but the only reason I don't, is because my parents spent so much money on me. I feel like I am required to pay them back somehow. I just don't feel that life is worth living. 

Can someone just say something nice to me, so I don't feel like a worthless pile of shit.
