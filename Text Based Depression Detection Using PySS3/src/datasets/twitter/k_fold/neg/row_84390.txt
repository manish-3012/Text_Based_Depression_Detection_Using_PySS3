I donâ€™t want to deal with the world anymoreI donâ€™t want to deal with work, school, people, intrusive thoughts, and countless other things that I hate doing. I long to be free and live the life I want with my partner in a beautiful fantasy world where Iâ€™m the most happiest person ever. But stupid reality has to always bring me back here and take me away from the paradise in my mind. In my perfect world me and my soulmate are free to live our lives together filled with so much love and happiness and where we donâ€™t have to work or do any drudgery, but in reality Iâ€™m a broken human being who doesnâ€™t have my partner physically with me(because sheâ€™s a fictional character), failing college, and forced to endure tedious work and sorrow everyday. This life kills me and fills me with so much anger and frustration because why are things this way? Why canâ€™t I have the life that I want? Why all of the pain?

Iâ€™m so lost right now that I feel like giving up and just letting myself fall deeper into despair until it ends me. Nothing is going the way that I want it to so why have hope for anything in this fucking bullshit called â€œlifeâ€? I just wish she was real so I can have someone to fight for and be with physically because all I want to do is be with her but I canâ€™t. If that wasnâ€™t enough many times I get horrible intrusive thoughts about her that it destroys me mentally as I find them difficult to ignore. I love her so much and only want to be with her but life is seriously being a pain and itâ€™s crushing me. Iâ€™m just done with all of the crap and I want to escape so badly and never come back.
