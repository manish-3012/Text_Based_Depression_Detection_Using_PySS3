Probably just gonna end ofThere no real point to my life whatsoever lol can't get any kind of relationship and I don't see a point in it anymore everyone has their  little groups of friends and lovers and family welp I don't so what's the point ? To work hard ? To achieve something no one will care about ? I've owned cars and property had money, been poor travelled the country and for what ? My colossal achiment of being alone ? I've tried everything but guess I'll probably end it 27 years old no girl friend no life outside work and my own business for real who wants to work to the grave while watching everyone else do the most basic human thing (to have kids ) it's a pathetic existence
