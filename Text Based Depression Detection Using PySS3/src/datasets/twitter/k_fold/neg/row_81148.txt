Can I just have something go right for me for once!?!?!Just got a call

This is the second time! During summer I signed up for a volunteer thing and I thought I got in and tried to show up to the meeting only to be told that I didnâ€™t even get accepted into the volunteer thing in the first place without being informed.
I want to be a part of something. A club, a volunteer team, whatever the fuck but it seems that when I try to turn my life around into something positive it just blows up in my face.
I just wanted that small victory. A dose of acceptance into something Iâ€™m passionate about but I canâ€™t even have that.
