What is the point of living? I just want all the pain to go away. I mean who will notice when I'm gone anyways?Okay well I'm new to Reddit so I don't know how to really start but I guess I'll try by explaining my various issues...


The number one issue for my depression is that I hate myself, so in other words, my low self-esteem. I look in the mirror and see the reflection and I'm just disgusted. I'm ugly, fat, stupid, and their is no one who could ever like a person like me.


I've cut for the past four years of my life off and on. It has gotten significantly worse these past two years though. I used to cut maybe once of twice a week, and now its almost everyday.


I think about killing myself everyday. Every morning when I wake-up, if something bad happens during the day, and before I go to bed. Before I fall asleep at night I pray that I won't wake-up in the morning. That all the pain and all the suffering will be over, and I'll be gone. The people in my life will move on and act as if I was never here. No one will care, and everyone's lives will be a lot easier. My parents, my few friends(if you can even call them that), and my boyfriend. I've had multiple attempts aswell. Planned it all out, left suicide notes, ready to do it, but well as you can see, unfortunately I'm still alive.


My number two reason is my mother...

She blames me for ALL the stress in her life... She blames me for things that happen at her office, like if one of her employee's fuck up she'll compare me to them and say that I'm just like them! She calls me stupid, lazy, worthless and that I'll never amount to anything in life. If she doesn't like the clothes that I'm wearing she'll tell me I look like a prostitute... She blames me for her having diabetes(like I'm sorry I fucking shoved sugar down your throat....?!)


The number three reason is that my parents put a lot of restrictions on me. I'm 18 and I'm not allowed to go anywhere. Even if I want to go see a movie or go for coffee with one of my friends I have to ask for permission, which is pointless because they always say no anyways.

I get no independence. I get no life. They suffocate me. I HAVE to work in their office; I am not allowed to get any other job. This is so they can keep an eye on me, and see what I am doing at all times. I am not allowed to take my cell phone to work or keep it in my room when I get home. I forgot to mention that I pay for this phone myself.


My number four reason is my boyfriend. This is also a huge contributor to my issues. I care and love him a lot so don't get me wrong or anything, but I just feel like I'm always doing something wrong in our relationship, or I'm stressing him out with all my "drama". I just feel like he wants to break-up with me. He constantly tells me that this is not the case and that he does not want a break-up. I just feel like he deserves someone better than me. Someone who's smarter, prettier, and will give him everything he wants/needs in a relationship.

Then theirs the whole thing where he has this close friend who's a girl whom he hangs out with quite a bit and it just really pisses me off. Yes, I understand he needs his friends and that you can have friends of the opposite sex without being attracted to them. I mean all of my friends are guys so I'm really not trying to be a hypocrite here. Its just that he makes me feel like she's more important than me. It feels like he chooses her over me. When she's around its like I don't even exist. He will totally ignore me, and he even puts me down in front of her... It hurts a lot when he does this. Its just like what's the point of even being in a relationship if your going to make me feel bad about myself? :'(

I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I don't know where I'm going or what is going to happen to me. I'm really scared...

At night I just sit out on my roof and imagine jumping off. How easy it would be. How all the pain would go away... Just end it all.
