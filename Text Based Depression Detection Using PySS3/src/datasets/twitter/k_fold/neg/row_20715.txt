Iâ€™m going to end my pain next monthIâ€™ve tried so hard, but living the past 3-4 years with this depression I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I really have tried. 

I had an 8 month relationship which ended in July. Thatâ€™s not the reason, it was actually a nice â€˜distractionâ€™ from my depression, almost like a beautiful dream but when it ended I crashed back down to reality. 

I feel guilty because so many people would do anything for aspects of my life - a few months away from graduating with a psychology degree, not having to worry about anything financially, lucky enough to go on luxurious holidays with my family every year. Fortunate enough to have been able to see a private therapist for the past few months. Heck my football team Liverpool looks like they will win the Premier League for the first time in my life. 

But even  all of thatâ€™s not enough to stop me feeling like this. Iâ€™m too far gone, too depressed, too lonely. Iâ€™m 22 and I am so fucking lonely. 

I canâ€™t end my life now because it would ruin ever future Christmas for my family. So at the end of next month Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™m finally ending the pain, Iâ€™ve also planned a backup date in February. Itâ€™s a decision I canâ€™t be talked out of. 

So yeah. Nobody knows and I guess I just wanted somebody to know. This community is truly beautiful. And Iâ€™m so sorry.
