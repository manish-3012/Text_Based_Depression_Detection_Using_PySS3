I don't know how much longer I haveI can feel it getting close every day I get more cold nothing brings me joy or happiness anymore honestly even masturbating doesn't even change my mood I just don't know how much longer I have I don't even think it scares me anymore I just feel like I'm waiting for it to happen or the opportunity to present itself and I will finally be done with this shitty life
