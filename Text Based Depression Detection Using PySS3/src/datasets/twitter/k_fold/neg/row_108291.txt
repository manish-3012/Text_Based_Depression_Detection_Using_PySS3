20 years old and have struggled with suicidal thoughts all my life, but they're worse recentlyHi all. This is my first time posting anything of the sort. So apologies if I dont explain myself well, I've never been very good at describing my feelings. 

I've thought about suicide pretty regularly from a young age. As young as about 6th grade, and the thoughts never really stopped (although there are certainly times when they're better or worse). In 8th grade I started cutting myself, and in 9th grade I continued. That year, I was also taken advantage of sexually by a guy 6 years older, who was my first kiss and blackmailed me with nudes to get me to give him a handjob. Luckily it never went further from that. My mother found out about this older guy after reading through my facebook messages, and sent me to therapy. I was really upset to be in therapy, and refused to talk to the therapist. After a few sessions, my parents didn't want to continue paying if I wasn't going to be receptive so I stopped going. My suicidal thoughts continued throughout the rest of high school. At the end of high school, I started seeing a therapist again. However, I found myself unable to open up to her, and just ended up lying about my wellbeing. That was a few years ago. Recently, I've been worse than ever though.

I just started my junior year at college, and went through a really messy breakup. Our relationship was toxic: we fought a lot, he was overly jealous, and I started a habit of lying to him out of fear of his jealousy, which only made things worse. We initially broke up in April. At this time, I was having really bad anxiety and talked to my doctor about it. I got prescribed Lexapro. It helped for a while, but I stopped taking it a few months ago after I found my depression and sadness coming back. 

Over the summer, my ex continued to try and get me back, and I entertained him because I did really miss him. Ultimately though, I decided that I could not re-enter that toxic relationship. We had a talk about this about a month ago where I told him definitively that I could never date him again. I thought taking the questioning about it would make it easier for us to move on from each other. When we were talking and I was explaining this, he told me he would kill himself that night if I didn't agree to take him back. I stuck to my guns and said no, but I told him I was going to call the cops on him when he left, to ensure he didn't follow through with his promise of suicide. This lead to a 5-hour standoff between us, where he was too scared to leave since I would call the police, and I was too scared to leave since I thought he might hurt himself. Finally, the morning rolled around, and after a night where neither of us slept, he seemed calm enough that I wasn't as worried. 

Things have still been rocky since then, but he seems okay. I am friends with some of his friends and they have been keeping their eye on him. In fact, he's already hooking with several new girls. I feel like a hypocrite that this bothers me, since I was the one who split it off, but it still really hurts me. I'm intensely lonely. I've always been a serial monogamist, and never really learned how to be happy with myself. But after this relationship, I'm too scared of commitment to rush into a new one. I also, stemming (I think) from my experience getting molested, get really anxious around men who have a sexual interest in me. Plus, I am still very much in-love with my ex. I just know that we can't be happy together, which is why I cut things off. I feel trapped with no one to talk to or confide in. The one person I trusted most tried to blackmail me with his suicide to get back together with him. 

In addition to all this, I've been using a lot of drugs lately. I took psychedelics and MDMA a few times over summer, and about once a week take either adderall or xanax. I've also recently become addicted to nicotine via juuling. This is all on top of very regular drinking &amp; smoking weed. I know I should stop putting so many things in my body, but it's one of the only things that makes me happy. Otherwise, I am constantly thinking about how unhappy I am with myself. I imagine my body hanging from the ceiling of my room many times a day. 

I don't think I would ever commit suicide, mostly because I wouldn't want to hurt my family and friends. But I also don't know how I will manage to keep on living for another 40 years. I have been dealing with these feelings for most of my life now, even when things are objectively good. I've been to a therapist twice. I've tried antidepressants. Nothing's helped.
