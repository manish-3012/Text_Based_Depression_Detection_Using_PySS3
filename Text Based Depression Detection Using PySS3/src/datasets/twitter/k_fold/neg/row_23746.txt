Dont know how much longer I can go onI dont intend to go into details here. I just need to tell someone how I feel. Everytime I think about killing myself, Its mainly out of shame and guilt. The things I have done and havent done, what I am what im not pains me to the point where I either feel that dying or breaking all contact with everyone I love is the only answer. Atleast if im alone, I wont be have to look them in the eyes.

Thank you for reading and sorry for depressing you
