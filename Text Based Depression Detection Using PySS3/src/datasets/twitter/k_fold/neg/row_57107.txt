My mother has abandoned me with no real food and I want to kill myselfI have low functioning autism and my mother has left me with nothing but tasteless diet food.  I already feel awful about my body but she has abandoned me in the house with nothing to eat so she can go on a drunken girls night out and have sleep overs.  I am very scared and I can't stand the pain.  I've tried punching my stomach to shut it up but that didn't work.  My father will not buy me any good food as he is very sick.

I have already been feeling awful about my body and now I want to kill myself.  On top of that living in a single parent household with just my father reminds me of the first time my mother moved away from the family.
