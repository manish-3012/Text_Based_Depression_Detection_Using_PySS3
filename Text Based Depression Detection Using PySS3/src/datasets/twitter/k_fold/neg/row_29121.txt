I don't know if my gf is bluffing.Hello,

I am in a bad relationship and whenever I come to the point when things go so wrong we come to break up, no matter what she responds with suicidal messages. I don't know what to say to them and in order to silence them I don't end the toxic relationship and come back and nothing changes. Time and time again. I don't want to risk her hurting herself but I want to get out of this mutually toxic relationship. Any advice?

Thanks
