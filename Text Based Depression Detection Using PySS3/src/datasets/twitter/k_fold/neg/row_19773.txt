howdy23/two suicide attempts/big fan of that being the way i will go out. my life, up to me.

told myself i would stick it out. what the hell, right? already shouldnt be here, so why not stick around. everything is awful, thats a given. stickin around means i at least get to see some more colors or whatever. 

shits been rough as of late, but thats life. is there any real way to wake up and have the first involuntarily thought be to put a bullet in my head?

inb4 therapy/ mind altering drugs. tried, did. 

inb4 rehab. quit everything cold turkey, over the course of 6mo's; was progressively worse. so, here i am, drunk and whatever reaching out to strangers who dont/shouldnt care much
