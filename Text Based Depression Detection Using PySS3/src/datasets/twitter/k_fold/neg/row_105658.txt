I got my gun back yesterday. Waiting for decline letter then have to decide what to do.The more I think about the interview yesterday, the more confident I am that I'll be getting a decline letter today for the job. I went and got my gun back out of where I was storing it and went to bed.

When I get the decline email, I have to decide if I'm going to do it when I get home from work or if I want to try the medication route. I've thought about it before, and I think that a combination of SSRIs and Xanax would be enough (if at a high enough dose) to make me live out the rest of this worthless life and not think about anything, at least until the kids get old enough to support themselves.

The problem is that I'm worried that the medication won't be enough to take away all emotions. I either want to be dead or to be a zombie (get up, go to work, go home, go to bed, that's it). It started out as anxiety about never being successful or making it and has now gotten to the point where I don't care. If I get the job? I plan on not taking the offer anyway. I'm old, I don't like feeling like I'm the slow one on a team, and these people are a lot smarter than me.

So is there any medication that can accomplish this? I don't want anything that's going to "help me be happy" or "cheer me up", that's not the purpose here. I want something that's going to make me an emotionless wage slave until the kids can manage on their own.

If not, I'll just get it over with after work. It's a very long time to wait out without something to block "me" out. If we're talking about age alone, at least another 20 years, possibly as much as 50 or 60? No, thank you.

Also, it has to be something I can take while working, it can't make me high/drunk that kind of shit isn't going to work. Just block out every emotion.
