LostI a 29 M in a job a hate with a boss that just is impossible, in a relationship we're is feel like I'm an ATM. No emotional support nothing, one good thing from this relationship is my son. I love him to death. But rarely see him, we are together but not living together.

My health is a joke the last two-three years I developed epilepsy, two types of it. One I get my sleep were i properly get fits, bite tongue ECT. The other type I get 10+ times during the day were by I lose control, swing my body, giggle and rub my head ECT.

I can go on and on what's wrong with my life, health and past but I suspect the story painted above will do.

I sitting here and wondering why continue? Why even be? Would it matter? I'm a stepping stone? A moment? 

Posting this now, I'm I just seeking attention? What I'm i? The feelings that I have that cause this pain and motivating me to do the unthinkable...

We're do I start or end? I feel lost and confused I don't want this to continue I want the hurt to go away.
