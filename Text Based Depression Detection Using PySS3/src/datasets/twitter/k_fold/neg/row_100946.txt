I'm trappedI cant get help for multiple reasons:

1. My family does not believe in mental health
2. Im poor

Thats basically it. I cant even find a way to kill myself as painlessly and cleanly as possible. Amazon doesnt sell real guns, I dont think my jump rope will be enough to kill me, and i cant OD cuz it'll most likely not work and will just leave me in a coma or something.

My best choices so far are to bleed to death or to wait for a train to run me over. Im gonna go with the train option. Ironic because its right next to the dmv where I failed my driving test 3 times and is the biggest reason why I feel like shit.
