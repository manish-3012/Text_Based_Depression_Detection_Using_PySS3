The pros outweigh the cons stronglyProve me wrong. Everyoneâ€™s story, perspective, and experiences are all unique and challenging in their own ways. Me personally, the hand Iâ€™ve been dealt in life has caused me to have crippling depression and social anxiety from past trauma. At what point do I say enough is enough in terms of suffering? Well Iâ€™ve been feeling this way for the last month now and canâ€™t think of a reason to keep going on. Iâ€™m borderline an agoraphobic now who has resorted to living off their mother after having my mental meltdown 3 months ago. I no longer have any independence or the will to live. Everyday I question my self worth and my self image has become so distorted beyond recognition. All I can think about is how relieving itâ€™ll be if I can just follow through with killing myself. Finally achieving that freedom. When I try to â€œbe positiveâ€ and think about getting help, my thoughts and anxiety spiral completely out of control. I fear rejection and not being able to get better. I think whatâ€™s the point of years and years of suffering through therapy and meds trying to force myself to literally just become another slave to society. I donâ€™t know what happiness is and highly doubt I ever will. Iâ€™m exhausted of feeling like this constantly. Iâ€™m so empty and broken. Canâ€™t wait until I have a window of opportunity to put myself out of this misery.
