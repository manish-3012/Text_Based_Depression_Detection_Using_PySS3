Literally living like everyday is my lastEverytime I talk to someone I think "wonder how they'll react when they find out I'm dead tomorrow" or when eating something "so this is probably my last meal". I don't think I'll actually do it but I have the means and a proper plan to kill myself ready at all times. I'm not particularly depressed right now but I have been, on and off for three years.
I don't know if this is healthy but it gives me a sort of peace that I won't have to deal with anything anymore.
