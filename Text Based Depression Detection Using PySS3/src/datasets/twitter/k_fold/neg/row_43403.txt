Well... I don't know what to do anymore.Right now, I feel something that I've never felt before. This feeling keeps growing and I can't stop shaking. I feel so worthless and alone, as if no one cares. I've cried out for help, only to be ignored. I feel so ready to go right now. I have nothing to live for, no one who truly cares, and no future. I feel as if I don't even deserve to live anymore. I... I really don't know what to do. I get that suicide isn't the answer, but it's an option. An option that I'm going to take. Nothing helps anymore. I'm scared, I'm alone, and I'm ready to go. I just hope someone will eventually miss me.
