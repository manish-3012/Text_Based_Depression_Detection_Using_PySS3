I would kill myselfif someone had a gun to my head i would pull the trigger. im tired of living in the hood, man. i listen to songs like â€œSuicidal Thoughtsâ€ and â€œEveryday Struggleâ€ by the  Notorious B.I.G. i have cousins who were born in the suburbs and they donâ€™t appreciate what they have been given. I wish i could live in a place where i wouldnt hear  police and ambulance sirens everywhere i go. Im tired of being the only child. I have to (and still do) sell bottles so i could get my own money to buy stuff.
