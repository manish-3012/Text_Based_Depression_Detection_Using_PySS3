It's been real y'all (jk it's been terrible)I am 27 and have tried everything to fix my brain. I have tried talk therapy, self help books, self help apps, eating healthy, exercise, sunlight, etc. yet I never feel better and always feel a darkness around me that never goes away. I am unattractive, shy and have no friends and wasted my entire life. I cannot accomplish anuthing, all I've ever wanted to do was photography and went to school for art but I suck at it and now am stuck in retail. Everyone in life has moved on and i am thinking of just ending everything.
