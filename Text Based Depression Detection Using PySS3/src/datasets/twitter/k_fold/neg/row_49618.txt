Why should I continue to live?I'm depressed and have been for years now. I've been suicidal before , I've checked myself into the hospital, I've gone to counseling, I've taken (am taking) antidepressants, I exercise, I keep myself busy, I have great friends, and I step outside every day. But I'm miserable. I'm so depressed. I want to kill myself but I feel so guilty because I have so many loans and that will go to my family. and my friends will be sad. 
What do I do? I have tried so many things. I know there is no answer to what to do. I feel like one day I'm just going to get fed up and kill myself. What's the point of continued existence if I have feel so much pain? 
Everyday is a struggle. And its so hard. I don't want to keep living like this. 
Isn't it selfish on the part of everyone else to want me to continue existing when it hurts so much? 
How do all of you work through the hardest times?
