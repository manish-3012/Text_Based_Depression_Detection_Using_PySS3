List of people who I want to blame if I kill myselfsister
mom
dad
ex girlfriend "G"
ex girlfriend "R"
seperated wife "K"
only friend "A"
and practically every company I've ever worked for.

I'm afraid of Hell and God or else I wouldn't be posting this.

However, most suicides have statistically followed parasuicides and self harm.

So I don't want to hurt myself or others.

But, idk what if later on I give up?
Everyone owes me an apology I believe.

I'm lonely broke and a list of stuff going on...my friends and family suck.
