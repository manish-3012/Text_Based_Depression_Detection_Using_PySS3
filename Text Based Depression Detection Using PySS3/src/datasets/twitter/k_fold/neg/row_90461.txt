Need to survive a few more days, but I can'tI'm not going to make it through the next couple of days. I've been thinking about suicide since may but it's only since this week that I've been actively planning it. I bought rope at the DIY store on thursday which I plan to use to hang myself. I've already made the noose so I know it's just a case of making the decision and within 15 minutes I can be gone. it's scary but a little empowering.

I want to talk to someone but I have no support network and I don't find hotlines or therapists useful at all. I have no idea what my friends are doing to me but they are not helpful and I blame them for a lot of what is happening. I've seen them in person 3 times in the last year and they constantly make excuses not to speak with me and I have no idea why. Even though they know I've become suicidal they still don't consider me worth their time. It might seem pathetic that I'm still chasing after them but I'm very lonely &amp; desperate and I see them as my only options. If I wasn't desperate I'd drop them in an instant.

I need to stay alive for just a few more days but it's becoming too painful to do so. What are some short term solutions to help me pass the time? I've been trying to sleep as much as possible but you can only do that for so long before you wake up and can't get back to sleep. Plus racing thoughts make it difficult to drop off to begin with.

i'm a 22 y.o. male. thanks.
