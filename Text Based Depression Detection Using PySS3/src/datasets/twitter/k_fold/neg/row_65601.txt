I canâ€™t continue on. Itâ€™s over.I posted here once before I think, but recently my depression has gotten much more serious.
Recently I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and while Iâ€™ve started getting treatment for it, Iâ€™ve really started to decline in mental health at an alarming rate. My mood swings have been much more severe, One hour Iâ€™m excited to go home and take a walk outside or hang out with a friend, or play a video game. The next Iâ€™m thinking about ways to kill myself.
It has reached a peak today because I realized I have a plan, well several ways to kill myself.
-I could drink the chemicals under our kitchen sink
-I could ask my dad if he wanted to do some target practice and then use the shotgun to blow my brains out
-I could overdose on sleeping pills
Iâ€™ve been sleeping a lot lately, the weekends I could be having fun with friends are spent sleeping. My parents know I have problems but they think Iâ€™m just a lazy teenager when it comes to my grades. I do my best to work on my studies, but I canâ€™t focus on anything. Iâ€™ve lost interest in so many aspects of my life I just donâ€™t see how I can continue. Iâ€™m terrified of hospitalization. If I am hospitalized, I will do everything I can to end my life. Iâ€™m sick of being a no good fuckup who canâ€™t get good grades, canâ€™t even stay in class because of her anxiety and falling so far behind in work. I canâ€™t take it anymore and I want some advice. I have tried to get help but it just isnâ€™t helping me. Iâ€™ve been on so many different medications, many of which make me gain weight and I have no self esteem whatsoever. Iâ€™m a fatass bitch whoâ€™s too fat do do things I enjoy like cosplay, I get bullied a lot at school, I try not to listen to them but they make fun of me for having a potbelly. I want to exercise but Iâ€™m too busy trying to keep up with my work and my grades. I hate who I am and wish I could just start over and end it all. Iâ€™ve also thought about running away, and living in the woods. I just want to be happy again, and not just intermittently. I want my life back. I hate depression so much and going through every day feeling like you are just going through the motions is not the life I want to live. Iâ€™d rather not live at all.
