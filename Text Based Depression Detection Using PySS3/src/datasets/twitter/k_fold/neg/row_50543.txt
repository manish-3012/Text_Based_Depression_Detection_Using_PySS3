I donâ€™t know why I should keep goingIt doesnâ€™t help to know that others feel the same thing. I have felt this way for long enough to know that it doesnâ€™t really get better. Maybe part of a day will be spent with no feeling, if I am lucky. 

I will make one of these posts and perhaps a single person will respond in some way but then I am left alone the next day. I get no joy from anything I used to like. The world is terrible and people are only interested in themselves. Nobody will invest in me and frankly Iâ€™m not worth any emotional investment at this point anyway. 

I will probably look into getting a shotgun when I have the energy to get out of bed.
