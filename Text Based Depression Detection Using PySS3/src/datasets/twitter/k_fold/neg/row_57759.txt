in a very deep and dark holehey everyone. 

this is my first post in this subreddit. I (25F) am in the darkest place iâ€™ve been since I last attempted to take my life. Iâ€™m sober and feeling all of my emotions for the first time in years, and to say itâ€™s overwhelming is an understatement. 

on september 28th of 2017, I was drugged and raped by someone and I still donâ€™t know who. I got pregnant from that assault and was suicidal for months after having an abortion. I told my mom that I wanted to die, and she told me that â€œyouâ€™re not suicidal, you only think you areâ€. I went through a terrible breakup in 2018 with my then fiancÃ©, due in part to rumors around the assault. 

now Iâ€™m coming up on three years of surviving my first and only attempt on my life, but I donâ€™t feel like fighting to live anymore. I have used weed as a crutch to numb my emotions and help me deal with my trauma, but I donâ€™t have that anymore. Iâ€™m in such a deep and dark place right now that I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m going to come out this time. 

the pain is so intense. I have no desire for anything in life. I just want the pain to end.
