How do I talk to someone who feels suicidal?I saw a reddit post that was concerning, linked the guy to a few resources, and he replied. I want to make sure the guys ok, but i'm a stranger online. What can I say, or shouldn't I say, to help? I've tried to assure him things will eventually get better, that healing takes time and all that, I'm just worried since I don't fully understand that I might say something to make him feel worse, but I can't just ignore him when he's made it clear how he feels.

The replies he's made to people, it's clear he wants help too. [https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/bhfoj8/if\_i\_kill\_myself\_what\_will\_happen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/bhfoj8/if_i_kill_myself_what_will_happen/)

Also google keeps redirecting me to my countries phone numbers and charities/services so it's hard to find resources that could be helpful in america. :/
