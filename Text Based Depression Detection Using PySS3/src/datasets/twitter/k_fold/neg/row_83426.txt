OMG PLEASE PLEASE HELP MEI never ever thought about suicide but tonight I'm in such a lowplace, I can barely type this out. I was playing cards with some friends and we had to guess who the killer was and the first go up one girl said it was me because I look nervous and then followed that with ''he always looks nervous'' and everybody laughed. I just want the ground to swallow me up, I'm breathing so heavily, I just want to end it all. All my doubts about myself are confirmed. I'm so so sad. I'm sorry if I sound over the top but the comment hit me at a bad time
