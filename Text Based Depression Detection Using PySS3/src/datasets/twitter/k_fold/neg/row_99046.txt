Damned for trying.I've wanted to do this so bad for so long. I'm no good. I'm barred from every profession I've wanted because I'm bipolar. So I'm stuck with half a degree, no way to afford finishing it, and minimum wage jobs that don't require psych evals.

I'm poor and mentally ill. That alone means every bit of related legislature in the US is bent against me. 

I tried to get Medicare; I was denied because I have no kids (apparently that makes me not worth saving, and I'm becoming more inclined to agree.) Obama care is still too expensive. The free program in my area for mental health closed my case with no warning or reason. So I'm left to sell body parts to afford fucking healthcare. 

Hey, I could donate enough plasma to  afford at least maintenance healthcare! Or not because I need a god damn doctor's note to say I'm stable enough to donate. AND GUESS WHO CAN'T GET A GOD FUCKING DAMN DOCTOR?!

I'm at my wit's end. I'm done. BPD:NOS wins. I'm taking my life when my husband goes to work. I'm clearly not worth the trouble or taxpayer money to keep alive so I'll nip it before it gets any worse.
