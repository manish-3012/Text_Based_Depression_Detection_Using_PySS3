I'm running out of rope...I've had horrible relationships in my life ... 31 years old, have been cheated on and left by EVERY girl I've ever dated . I enjoy time with my "friends" but I'm always the alone guy. They're all coupled up and the last 4 years they try and include me, but being the nth guy in the party of couples has been dragging me.

I found a woman who I feel was everything I was looking for, but she's hung up on the last guy. I have tried everything possible to make her happy because I think I feel she makes me happy - the moments I'm with her. When I tried telling her that I was in love with her she decided to reminisce on her last relationship and how hurt she is that he doesn't want her. 

Whenever I go home or hang up the phone my mind tells me that I'm worthless... that that I have nothing to offer. Every night I just cry before bed. I have this tingling numbing sensation that shoots through my body and all I think about is how everything would be better if I wasn't around. 

I've been drinking a lot more and playing with my guns. I've had to separate my ammunition because a few times I've practiced pulled the trigger with the gun aimed to blowing out the back of my head. I used to get this way once in a while... but the last month I've been doing this every night. 

My work life seems like it's all falling into place, things are happening that I don't feel like I deserve. All in want is someone to want me... if it wasn't for my cat I wonder if I would've done it a while ago.
