Iâ€™m doneHi guys, new to reddit but need to reach out to someone. Iâ€™m currently 19 and ready to end it all.

Let me give you some brief background:

- I come from an Indian household with an olde brother and sister, they are very very academic and Iâ€™m the dumb one in the family- they get straight A* and Iâ€™m here with Bâ€™s.  My parents say they donâ€™t compare but Iâ€™m just a failure in their eyes.
-I never had many friends, when I started sixthform 2 years ago I became friends with a group of people who were into hardcore drugs - I wanted to fit in and didnâ€™t care about life so I did them. When I was 16 I did LSD, which was a bad batch and nearly killed myself by jumping off a bridge, I got pulled down and started to have a fit. Ambulance was called and so were my parents. They donâ€™t know I tried to commit, and were instead angry as expected. Itâ€™s fucked my head up since then, I canâ€™t sleep and barely eat.
-I have always had an entrepreneurial bone in me, starting my first business when I was 14 and made insane money then (7k). Iâ€™ve been trying to make it as a stock trader for years and was doing well - things looked good, until a month ago where I started loosing money. At the end I was under by 20k where my dad has to bail me out by taking money from the mortgage account.

I just feel anything I do I fail at these days, Iâ€™m a waste of space. I canâ€™t do anything right. Iâ€™m just a burden to my family. Last year we lost 11 people on my mums side of the family including my grandad. I just canâ€™t go on anymore.

Whatâ€™s the point in life if any decision you make youâ€™re ALWAYS wrong in, I canâ€™t even pursue my dreams and am working full time to pay back my debt. Iâ€™m trapped, thereâ€™s no way out part from 1 - leaving this world.

Itâ€™s a lot of info I know, but Iâ€™m struggling to see the point in life. I feel like I just need to get it done with and die. Iâ€™m a burden to everyone.

The only thing holding me back is what itâ€™ll do to my mum, but maybe itâ€™ll be better for me just to leave and maybe Iâ€™ll cause less pain than if i stay.
