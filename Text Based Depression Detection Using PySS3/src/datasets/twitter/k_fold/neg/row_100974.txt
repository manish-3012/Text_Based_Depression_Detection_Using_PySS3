My life is too perfect. help.I have struggled with depression and anxiety for almost 9 years now. Sometimes I wish my problems were bigger so I had an excuse to end it all. but I do not. I just feel like death all the time. I have a great life and I cannot enjoy any of it.

I am 22, about to graduate Magna cum laude, working as a TA, doing independent research in two labs at my home institution and currently on the airport from my way back from a sort of prestigious summer program in neuroscience. I have no major financial issues, I have a house, a car, free tuition, siblings who look up to me and a family who loves me. Yet I feel so tired all the time. my head feels foggy most of the time and i have to read things multiple times before I even grasp what i am reading. everything is too much, music, tv, people talking, everything makes me feel like my head will explode at any time. Despite everything I feel worthless and everything seems like a chore; school, work, family, waking up. sometimes i miss school for days because I cant get out of bed. I have no friends or romantic interests because my anxiety always gets the best of me.

I was actually supposed to graduate last year but didn't because I did not apply to grad school (i'm here on student visa so couldnt just take a gap year) because i wasn't planning on living that long. But now that I am here, I do not know what to do. I don't even know what programs to apply to because I am not sure what I would enjoy, given that I cant seem to enjoy anything at all. Lately I found myself reading on a topic completely different from what I am doing in undergrad but i am scared to pursue it because i have no experience and honestly I do not think I'm smart enough. 

I've sought help, mostly in the form of CBT so far but idk maybe I should go to a psychiatrist? self harm, and binge eating were some of my coping mechanisms. since i do not really engage in these anymore I stopped therapy but i have come to realize that the only reason i have stopped is because i do not even have energy for that anymore. I'm just a blob of self pity and sadness that does the bare minimum at this point.. 

Also, I am Hispanic and these things are hard to talk with my family. my grandmother only has a fifth grade education, she worked really hard so my mom could go to highschool, my mom then had to drop out but worked really hard so that I could go to college. I am a first generation who gets to live the dreams of three generations and I wish I could enjoy what I am doing a little bit more.i feel like such an ungrateful brat for not doing so. My extended family will secretly roast me forever if i open up about it because thats just the way mexican families are lol but I dont care anymore or maybe I do? i hate confrontation. idk, idk why im writing this, I should be doing work.
