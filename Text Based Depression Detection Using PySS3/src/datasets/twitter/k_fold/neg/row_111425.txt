I need someone to talk to Im alone and sad .I just moved to a new town in Florida and ive been here for like 3 weeks and I have left my house 6 times and I have made no friends and really I don't know what to do the reason we moved here is because  i tried to kill myself and now its worse that I have no one to talk to face to face and I'm antisocial but damn i feel like im going crazy here and family i cant talk to them they dont know how i feel so i came here sorry to bother you I've always been a person to keep my feeling to myself so i dont bother anyone but I cant deal with this alone.
