oh god please help me.I planned to end my life tonight and am desperate to still do so. Iâ€™ve got everything ready. AND GOD DO I WANT TO DIE.

However, today I visited my grandmother after she returned from the hospital following a bad fall. My grandad/her husband is also in the hospital following a fall (I know, bad luck right?). And while theyâ€™re both doing quite well, my dad on the other hand is really down, not sleeping, loosing weight, tired.

My parents are usually remarkably strong people which is why Iâ€™m not as worried about the aftermath of my suicide.

But my dad is such a mess I donâ€™t want this to push him over the edge. But I canâ€™t live anymore Iâ€™m in so so much pain. 

If youâ€™re stuck in same predicament, wanting to die but having to stay for family. Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts.

I canâ€™t convey just how much I long to die.
