How should we stop feeling suicidal?I noticed a lot of people on SW are idealizing the idea of death's peace. My life is very familiar with attempts and hospitalizations due to mental illness. Over the years of my life, I've felt that the better option is to die. I don't do it, because it would hurt my family. I don't want that. 

What solution can you offer to stop feeling this way?
I live in a homeless shelter, and this computer is a public computer.
