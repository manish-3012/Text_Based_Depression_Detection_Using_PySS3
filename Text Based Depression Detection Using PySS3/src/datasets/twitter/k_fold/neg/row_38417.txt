DunnoWhen you are going through your day. Pulling 98%s on your exams. Have all the family around you. People around who could be close to me if i just talked to them. My dog who i love dearly.
Yet i can't feel happy. I don't feel joy anymore.
I have no motivation, even though my test scores say otherwise. It isn't motivation, its those hours i can spend studying something instead of how to kill myself while making it look like an accident.

I'm done, mentally. Emotionally. Spiritually.

Ill keep going. Ill keep trying. 
But at the end of the day.
What is the use,
When i can't feel anything?
Just empty and dead inside.
