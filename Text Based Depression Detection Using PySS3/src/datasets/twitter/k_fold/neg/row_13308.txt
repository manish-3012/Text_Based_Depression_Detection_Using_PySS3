I can't handle living with bipolar disorder.Even when I have really good days I think about killing myself. I wish I was never born. I wish I had killed myself a long time ago. I think it's really wrong to bring a child into this world with a severely fucked up mind.

People tell me they envy me because I work at "super hyped up rocket company". Friends from high school see me and they fawn over what I've accomplished. I'd trade it all away just to be normal. I keep pushing myself to accomplish the next thing because then maybe I'll feel proud of myself. It never happens. No matter what I still hate my life.

I get infuriatingly angry at least once per day. I can't hold friends and I don't really want to. It's not fair that people expect me to have to live with the shit I've been given when they don't understand. Anyone who says that it's selfish to kill themselves is welcome to live with my bipolar disorder.
