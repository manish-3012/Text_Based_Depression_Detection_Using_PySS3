This is an emergency, please give me advice ASAPOk, so I've never posted here before and I'm really sorry if this isn't the place to do so, but here goes.


I'm extremely worried about a friend of mine at the moment. I'm afraid that he will hurt himself or worse. But the problem is, I can't call the police or anything to help him because I am in the UK, and he is currently in Michigan in America. Is there an international number I can call to get his local police to do a welfare check? Is there someone else out there who can do it for me? 


Any advice right now would be fantastic and I'm sorry for rambling. 


Thanks, Zortan.
