47yr old feeling crushed by lifeIâ€™m a middle aged man. Married to an amazing woman. Two great kids. I have a 6 figure income but a pile of debt. I hate my job but canâ€™t get out of it because Iâ€™ve got two kids and a wife to take care of.

I wake up every morning hating having to go to work. It makes me physically ill. I want to sleep all the time and not deal with my work.

My kids are in the teenage years so they are arguing all the time. Iâ€™m the one who helps them, and Iâ€™m the one who makes food.

I try to. Get help from my wife but she just doesnâ€™t get it.  All the weight of my family, my finances, my lack of happiness in my job, and my general self-deprecation isnâ€™t helping me.

I fell squashed by everything life needs from me but feel like I am alone. I have friends and family I spent time with and it is good but I still feel alone.

This week I thought about ending it but I canâ€™t. I even thought I was having a hard attack because I had a bunch of signs.

I just feel lost, alone, and no one just â€œgets itâ€.

How am I supposed to keep on going when all I feel is loneliness and despair? I feel like sleeping and crying all the time.
