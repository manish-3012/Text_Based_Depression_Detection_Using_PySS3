hey guys, I think I might do it tonighttoday I was rejected by a girl who I so deeply care about and respect. I don't think anything can be restored how it was before today. The worst part is that I was the only one she could ever talk to and she had mental health troubles of her own. so now we are both without people we need and it's my fault and there is a voice blaring in my head that all I am is a worthless piece of shit. I can't think of a single reason not to do it because quite honestly I would be cleaning up the world a little bit.
