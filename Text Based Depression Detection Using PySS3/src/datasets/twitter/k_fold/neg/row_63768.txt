What do I do...I feel like Iâ€™ve been dealt a really bad hand when it comes to life.
I am 23F. I went to college, graduated this year in May unfortunately. Got two STEM degrees, emphasis on the T, but with a shit gpa. Iâ€™ve been â€œunemployedâ€ since May and make a little bit of money at my part time job (remote)

I have never had a single second of freedom in my life. Never had a sleep over, been to a party overnight, never could explore independence under my parentsâ€™ guidance. I canâ€™t go out to eat, see my friends, nothing without doing it secretly. My narcissist Dad would probably kill me if I tried. Heâ€™s always been emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive. Now Iâ€™m stuck at home during Covid, without school or a job to help me escape for at least a few hours. 

Both my parents are very successful and are now drilling me to learn programming, calling up their friends for references, positions, trying to get me a job. They donâ€™t understand that the market is just not that good for someone like me. Everyday I stay in bed, study a little bit, and cry a lot. Iâ€™ve lied about everything out of fear and conditioning. I canâ€™t take the abuse and emotional blackmail anymore.

The man I love is leaving me and moving away. My depression has pushed him away and I canâ€™t even blame him for that. He really was the only thing holding me back. But now that heâ€™s gone too, I feel like I only have two options. 

1) leave home soon, take my savings, stay with a friend and figure life out as it comes. Leaving will deff push me towards making better decisions. Iâ€™ll have to leave my siblings behind unfortunately. 
2) end it all but make it look like an accident

The only peace and quite I had was at night, when my parents were asleep, giving me that little bit of freedom to do what I wanted around the house before I fell asleep. Itâ€™s sad. But I wonâ€™t be getting out of this one without picking one of those two choices. Iâ€™m extremely broken and Iâ€™m falling apart. Everyday feels like a gigantic burden. I truly canâ€™t live like this anymore.
