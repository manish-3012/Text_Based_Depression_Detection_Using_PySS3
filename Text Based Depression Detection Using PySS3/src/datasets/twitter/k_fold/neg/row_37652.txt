why am i still alivei can't even find words to say anymore. My mind is so fucked. last summer my depression turned to drug abuse and now it is going to kill me. only 21 and drink a 6pack nearly every night,  for the last 10 months.  i thought i would be dead by now.  But im still hiding behind a mask,  pretending i am ok. i don't eat anymore. i either sleep all day or not at all for a few days.  i tried to kill myself, twice,  once by hanging and second time by OD.  woke up in the ER,  moved in and out of the ward, and i've grown so sick of being alive. Things will keep progressing this way until my behaviors kill me or until i cave again.
