17 and suicidalJust in case someone I know personally is reading this I won't use my real name so let's just say that my name is Thomas stevely and I'm from the back end of nowhere in the U.K. I am 17 years old and my recent mistakes have lead to bringing my family a lot of pain due entirely to my own stupidity. All my life all I've wanted is to help people but all I seem to be capable of doing is hurting those closest to me which has lead to me struggling to maintain relationships and friendships. This has lead me down a spiralling path of self harm suicidal thoughts. I don't entirely know why I'm even writing this and I don't see how this will help but many people seem to do this and people I have spoken to on various forums have told me that this can help so here it is I guess. I am pretty much at absolute rock bottom right now and now all I can think of is trying to pay for all the pain I have brought to both friends and family but every time I try to think of ways to pay for the harm I have done throughout my life I keep coming back to the same answer which is committing suicide but I know myself and I know that I'm too much of a snivelling, pathetic coward to actually do it. I know that I should really seek professional help but I don't want to become better or to stop blaming myself because I know that I deserve the pain I'm experiencing and if I get help then I'm not paying for the pain I have brought all I want is to be strong enough to simply end this miserable existence I call a life. 

I'm sorry if that seemed kind of pathetic or whiny but I've never been very good with words. I'm not sure what good I expect to come from posting this but I felt I needed to get it off my chest.
