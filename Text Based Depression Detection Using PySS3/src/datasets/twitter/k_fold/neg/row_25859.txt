â€œCall the suicide hotline!â€ so i can listen to a bored guy who will send the police on me? so i can have a bitchy lady who regrets volunteering hear me sob?
â€œGet a therapist!â€ did that. here i am, sitting with the fear if i tell her too much, iâ€™ll get thrown in a mental facility.
The concept of a mental facility arises! alright, cool. so i can have all aspects of the job i want trampled?
i donâ€™t really know how Iâ€™ve managed to make it to times i feel sane. having stable relationships with friends &amp; family, medication, &amp; self love has been the only method to help at all. i lack all of it. i donâ€™t have the motivation to take my meds, resulting in awful side affects that add to my mental pain. my friends donâ€™t really give a fuck. and the ones who do canâ€™t really be here. no one tells me they love me or that they care about me and mean it. iâ€™m growing to hate myself. even more than i have before. and itâ€™s eating me
