Why do good people suffer?I want nothing more than to move away from the suburbs (parents) and start a modest homestead. I have no higher aspirations. This is what everything I do is aiming to achieve. And the world has continued to crush my hopes; working at a job sucks and doesn't help my depression. All land is now owned by someone, even if it is totally abandoned and nobody else would have a problem with someone moving onto it.
I will not give up. I have felt meaning before in little moments. It can be achieved. It is worth struggling for in my eyes.
I cry a lot. I am often sad or resentful because of the people around me.
