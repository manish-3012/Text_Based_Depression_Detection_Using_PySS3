I think my dreams are crushedIâ€™ve always wanted to be a doctor but was unsure of my motivation.  My mom is a doctor and I admire her but I didnâ€™t think that was a good enough reason to go into pre med. I also had interest in business, so when I applied for college I decided to major in it with a concentration in marketing and if medicine was still my interest I would do a post bacc. I got into a good uni with a very good business program. But mental health destroyed my GPA. I shouldâ€™ve taken leave when I first noticed but I thought I would get better and suddenly it got to the point of no return. 

My GPA is now 2.4 no post bacc program would accept me. I thought maybe with counseling I could get the grades I got in high school but it wonâ€™t help. Thereâ€™s no way to get my GPA up since I graduate next year (unless I flunk out which wouldnâ€™t surprise me because Iâ€™m horrible). 

My dream is dead and I feel dead inside. Guess itâ€™s over and time to say goodbye. Itâ€™s always nice to have a brain that canâ€™t process shit normally and allow you to function. 

Thanks depression you ruined my fucking life.
