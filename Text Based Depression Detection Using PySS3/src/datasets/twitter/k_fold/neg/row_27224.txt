Why bother anymoreI'm tired of living a life of isolation, I'm always at home, not because I chose to, but I live in a shitty fucking area full of degenerates and human filth.....I'm so tired..... I made cutting to a game, it's all I ever feel, pain and adrenaline. I wish I owned a revolver so I could play Russian roulette. Damn, being 18 is no different.... just makes me seem more pathetic now that I'm an "adult". I knew I should have fucking killed myself that day....I'm not even supposed to me alive right now....I just want to die already....but I'm too much of a bitch.... I wish I owned a gun.....oh well, at the very least I can cut, be grateful for what you have
