I am not well. I was blessed with a NASA internship that I feel I have no right to, a loving family, etc. But I am closer to suicide than I think Iâ€™ve been most of my life.Iâ€™ve planned twice. 

Those were my lowest points so far. 
But this pit Iâ€™m in right now is unfathomable. 

I donâ€™t know how to get out. I am surrounded by smiles but they donâ€™t listen when I say Iâ€™m in trouble. 
They say Iâ€™m sorry
Or â€œi hope you find a way around meds to help yourself!â€ 
Or â€œyouâ€™re so smart and capable! Youâ€™ll be fine!â€ 

But Iâ€™m not fine. I feel like Iâ€™m screaming in a glass enclosed room and theyâ€™re just not seeing me. 
I donâ€™t know what to do, but I feel so, immensely alone. 

The worst part is that I know I have people to reach out to, Iâ€™m just not sure if I can handle platitudes anymore. 
Iâ€™m tired 
Iâ€™m so tired
