Medical injury destroyed my lifeI got a small infection. After it healed I still had residual nerve pain. So, they misdiagnosed and gave me more antibiotics. Then I lightly flushed,  so they misdiagnosed and gave me more antibiotics. It injured me. I had a severe allergic reaction. But, still it wasn't so bad. I was healing and recovering. I was still living my life. I was happy. So happy! The happiest I had ever  been after a long, difficult life, overcoming so much. I went to the dermatologist. Told her about my light flushing and occasional slight nerve pain. I didn't want meds. Just a diagnosis,  info about healing, skin care advice. She said my skin care products were too harsh and her prescriptions were more gentle. She prescribed Onreltea gel (Mirvaso). It's topical brimonidine. After the first use I developed a severe flushing disorder (vasomotor malfunction), severe and chronic nerve pain in my face (my nose, trigeminal nerves,  eyes, jaw, ears), intense heat in my ears, feels like soap is constantly being squeezed into my eyes,  my eyes water and go blood shot. I have to  be on an extremely strict diet because food causes flushing. I can eat a few foods, the same foods each day. I can't lie down. But I need sleep. Everytime I lie down the nerve pain and flushing increases. My face broke out in an  acne rash. I had  completely beautiful,  clear, healthy,  flawless skin. I lost my job as  a dancer. I lost too much weight. Lost my muscles. I weigh 96 pounds now. I  just sit in a  chair trying not to cry. I can't cry because crying increases the pain and flushing. I just want back the life I had back in August. I don't want to kill myself,  but I can't stop thinking about killing myself over and over, all day long. It's been three months since I used the Onreltea. I have failed everyone in my life. I can't be the person I was before. I can't do the fun things I did before. I can't even be relaxed and happy in my own home. No one understands.
