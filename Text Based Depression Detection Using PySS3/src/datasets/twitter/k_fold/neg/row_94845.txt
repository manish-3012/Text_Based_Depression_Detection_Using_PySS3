I messed upSo I messed up. Bad. Iâ€™ve been with my current significant other for 5 years now and actually married last year. Iâ€™m the horrible person that made a mistake talking to another girl and this was found out by her today. The talking was sexual yes but never anything about being with her. The worst part is this isnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™ve messed up. For some reason Iâ€™m so shitty and stupid that itâ€™s happened before and almost losing her multiple times (almost to suicide once) it still happened. She said sheâ€™s gonna stay somewhere else for a few days to think about everything and see if she wants to make this work, separate for a few months, or just get a divorce. I have no reason to ask her for anything and it sucks and all I want to do is vanish. Iâ€™ve already started cutting again and the thoughts of suicide and not going through losing her sounds...relieving. She wouldnâ€™t have to deal with me ever again and I wonâ€™t have the pain of losing her. Iâ€™m garbage I know and I can see everyone siding with her to leave me and I donâ€™t blame them at all. I donâ€™t really have anyone I can talk to so I came here..
