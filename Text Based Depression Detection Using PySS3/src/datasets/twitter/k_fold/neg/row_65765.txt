admitting suicidal thoughts?i hope this isn't as stupid as I think it is but im considering telling my parents that I have suicidal thoughts.

the thing is, my parents are so concerned about my future and my ability to function normally at any job or a school or just any commitments they are desperate for me to do anything. My mom keeps interrogating me about what I'm planning for the future but the thing is I've been planning to die or just nothing at all.

my head is so foggy and I'm just so confused all the time. I would like to think that i'm capable but I just feel all my confidence leaking out of me, which prevents me from even trying to do anything. Like, If i were to go to a job I'm sure I would manage, but because my family is so concerned I question all of my ablities and I feel useless. I don't know what reality is.

So to summarize I guess.. I just want to die. Do you think it would help my parents wrap their heads around this better? We are both very confused and I am suffering in my classes. If they knew I'm not even considering a future maybe we could start from there; or maybe I should tell my therapist instead? Is this whole idea dumb? (also i'm planning on telling my therapist anyways, but each day is getting harder to push on) 

Thank you to whomever reads this it means so much :) I really need advice!
