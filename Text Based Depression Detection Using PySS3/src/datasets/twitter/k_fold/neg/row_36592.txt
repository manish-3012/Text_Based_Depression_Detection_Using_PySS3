1 year ago I attempted suicide because I had failed.I failed out of college almost a year ago to this date. I attempted suicide. Chickened out and called 911 at the last minute, and they "saved" me. No one knows about this but me.

Fast forward to today, where everything is peachy keen and wonderful! Just kidding. In 10 weeks I deploy for basic military training. My friends think I'm still in school, my girlfriend thinks the same. I go to work every day and just tell them I'm going to class. Literally no one knows except me and my immediate family.

I've disappointed everyone in my life, including myself. I attempted suicide a year ago, and today I still wish I'd succeeded.  One day I'll have a means to do it and I'll just be another military suicide statistic. I don't have any hope, ambition, or desire to continue disappointing everyone. I smile almost every day, but I don't ever remember feeling content, and definitely never happy.

I moved in with my best friends who are all graduating college this semester. They're still children - they've never worked or struggled a day in their life. Here I am just trying to make ends meet and pay off loans I can't afford for a degree I don't have - all because my parents weren't as rich as theirs. I fucking hate those guys.

My girlfriend just got back from the Bahamas for spring break and is sad because she got an internship and has to cancel her study abroad trip. All on her parents dime, of course. It's ridiculous.

Although I can't complain. If I had infinite money, I'd still be depressed. I could just afford to be depressed at that point. Whatever.

Maybe I'll post again next year. Hopefully not.
