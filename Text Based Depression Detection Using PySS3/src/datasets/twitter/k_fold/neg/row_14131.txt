I'm running out of rope.I'm going to bed soon, but I wanted to make a post here because I can tell I'm running out of gas.

I've been losing my fight against depression for the better part of my life and the only thing keeping me around are my closest friends and family and down to the last man/woman they are finally realizing their ambitions and I am so tired of sticking around to not be a tragic disaster I'm closer than ever to RUN ON SENTENCE.

Originally my family and closest friends were a reason for me to stick around in a time where I felt literally nothing else going for me but that was 10 years ago and I feel like they're all in a pretty solid place.   Meanwhile I've gotten worse instead of better to the point where the last things that gave me joy have evaporated and I just want to go along with the suicide I've flirted with for over fifteen years.

I don't have the guts to finish it when there's only a few months until my nephew is born.  And I feel like a shitheel for even considering being the tragedy bomb that close to my sister finally having a kid.  But at the same time for years I have only been sticking around to not be a huge downer to my immediate family by offing myself while they were down in the dumps themselves.

Clearly I wouldn't be posting here if I wasn't looking for some help, and for all my self deprecation for being a gross old dude who is going to die very alone, but I've been at the end of my rope for a while and given up hope for years.  I want out, and the only thing keeping me on has been my immediate family, and this whole post is just a cry for help.
