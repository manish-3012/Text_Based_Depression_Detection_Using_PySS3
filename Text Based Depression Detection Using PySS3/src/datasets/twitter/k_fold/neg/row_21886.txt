I promise Iâ€™m gonna kms when I get outWhen I get discharged from this psych ward, I promise I will kill myself. 
If 100 pills doesnâ€™t work Iâ€™ll do 200 and if it doesnâ€™t work Iâ€™ll do 400 until it fucking works.

It just hurts so much, too much, way too much. 
Canâ€™t handle this shit. 
Emotional pains turns into physical pain.
