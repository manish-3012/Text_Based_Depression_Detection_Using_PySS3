Well I'm doneJust cut myself. I thought I was done. But no. It never fucking ends and I hate it. My entire fucking life revolves around depression and anxiety and what the fuck caused it. fuck I dont even know what causes it. It fucking determines whether or not I have a good day or not. I can't even make an effort without getting torn apart by anxiety or depression.

I fucking hate my life so much. I can't even get my fucking sexuality correct let alone my failing grades in everything and my complete lack of work ethic. Most people are fucking annoyed by me I can tell. So fuck it. I'm done.

goodnight all. Don't let crippling depression bite
