I'm not suicidalI'm not suicidal - so if you want to help someone who needs it more than me please don't even read this.


It's just I feel so alone all the time and I suck at everything social... I was in a sports team for over ten years (I'm 18) and when I recently chose to quit, nobody seemed to care. Some 'Friends' chose to quit too a little before I did and when they did it was a big drama. We had this website were we would enter our status for each training. When someone of my friends would have their status on "I'm coming" and not show up for the training they would send them endless messages and call them. I did that for basically the last month before I quit and nobody cared. (I didn't do that intentionelly - the status would automatically be on "I'm coming")


I also don't drink alcohol and that seems to be a reason why the guys I used to hang out with on the weekends don't want to do anything with me anymore. Everythig seems so dark and whenever I attend any social meetup I don't really talk to anyone and just start hating myself... The thing is also that no one seems to realize that I'm struggling so hard and I don't want to ask anyone (I also wouldn't know who) for help, which is why I am writing this here.


Oh god this probably sounds so stupid...      


I just don't know what to do.
