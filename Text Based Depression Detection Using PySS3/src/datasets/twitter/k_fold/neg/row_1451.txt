imsotiredim so tired of living like this. when im on my meds, im a husk. a shell. a fraction of what i used to be. when im not, the fucking voices come back. living with schizophrenia is such a struggle. every fucking day. and im about to go into another active phase and i can already feel that tug to go off my meds. death would be so easy. i dont enjoy anything anymore. all i feel is pain and apathy. i wish i had a reason to do it but im too pathetic even for that
