Considering ending it on my 27th birthday this monthMy birthday is July 29. I'll be 27. Seems like a decent enough time to kill myself. 

I am very indecisive about the method, obviously preferring something painless and/or instant. Top three contenders are heroin overdose (I have never done heroin but feel relatively confident I could get some if I wanted to), gunshot to the temple (this one kind of terrifies me but at least I'm 100% sure I could get a handgun easily), and suspension hanging (I like that this is a lazy method, because I am a lazy person, but I've read that failure is likely to leave you all kinds of fucked up). 

I kind of want to just do it sooner than my birthday and get it over with, but my brother is getting married in a couple of weeks and *somehow* I think his sister offing herself might cast a cloud over the ceremony. 

The thought of how sad my parents and brother will be is completely heartbreaking to me, but I just can't see sticking around any longer. 

Everything I read about suicide urges me to think about how things can get better. I don't think I really want them to get better? I just want them to end. Even if I knew with absolute certainty that life would be a jolly parade in a year, I don't think I'd care. I have no interest in seeing a therapist or calling any hotlines, anything like that. 

Should probably get crackin on my suicide note.
