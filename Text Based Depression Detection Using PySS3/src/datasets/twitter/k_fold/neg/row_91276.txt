iâ€™m tired...Iâ€™m so tired. More often than not, i find myself considering suicide. Today though, was so difficult. Today my head was so loud, itâ€™s been impossible to ignore. BF is in a sour mood because he thinks i have an attitude with him/towards him but iâ€™m just keeping to myself so his actions are just making me feel worse but i donâ€™t have the courage to try to tell him iâ€™m suicidal. i almost did, but he took too long to text back and i got so nervous again. i know itâ€™s not his fault he didnâ€™t text right back, weâ€™re adults and live together and busy people. I just want to end it all. It doesnâ€™t matter if whoever will be â€œsadâ€ when iâ€™m gone because iâ€™ll be gone! it wonâ€™t matter anymore. nothing will matter because i wonâ€™t exist anymore.
