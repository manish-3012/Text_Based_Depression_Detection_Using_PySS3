I'm a loser, don't mind me18M; I'll keep this short, I know reading can be hard with depression. I'll answer questions tho. 

I've had depression and anxiety since I was 12, suicidal at 16; I basically grew up with mental health issues. My symptoms rile up when seeing others happy, especially those in relationships who are younger than me. 

I know why this happens; I'm a loser, plain and simple. I want to fix my life but where the fuck do I start when everything about me is the problem. 

I'll probably kill myself this October.

As mentioned in the open, I'll answer questions if you want to know more.
