TraumaI am scared because I constantly feel like I donâ€™t deserve to be alive. I keep having flashbacks and after years of counselling, psychologists and psychiatrists I still feel so little. Itâ€™s been years and the police have done nothing. I was only 13, and it didnâ€™t stop when I turned 16. It was all online but it doesnâ€™t mean you didnâ€™t cause me a lifetime of trauma - the things you said to me and made me do is unforgivable. 
You had the audacity to try and try to indirectly contact me in 2018 and the police did nothing. You now have the audacity to date a woman with children. You deserve to rot in hell. 

After what Iâ€™ve experienced Iâ€™ve got 0 will to live. Every time I call the station thereâ€™s been no progress even with the large about of devices and evidence. I feel powerless and unable to move on. I am scared.
