First time truly being suicidal, I think, but I doubt myself too much to truly know.It's 2:49 and im just to god damn scared to fall asleep. The second i try, my heart just starts racing. i've been freaking out all day. i have chronic pain in my one foot, and now the other one is hurting. im absolutely terrified about my health all the time. i can barely go anywhere. i depressed, anxious, and can barely take care of myself.  my parents have decided if i can't support myself after this semester of college, they will no longer support me. im not allowed to stay in my home because im apparently to depressing to them. i don't know if i can keep this up. i have a hard enough time just keeping good hygiene. i feel like i will ultimately fail, and be disowned. i fucking hate myself so much, i just wanna die. i've been planning it all day. never truly considered it this intently before. If I become homeless, I will absolutely kill myself. Good thing its so easy to buy a gun in Virginia. I don't think I have the balls to do it any other way.
