I realized the people I hate most in life are most like the real meAll my life I've put on different facades for different people and I still don't really know who "I" am. Last night I realized tho that I judge people based off of the things I do. I hate that my brother is a nerdy kid who's content with having three solid friends, because he succeeded and I didn't. I hate people who wear what they want to because I fucking hate that I can't get around my anxiety. Everything I hate in other people are he things I "hate" the most about myself.
