Should I leave my wife and kid?I'm miserable everyday and they are subjected to it which isn't a healthy happy family life.

My wife said she doesn't believe me when I say I have chest pains and been hearing voices recently. I am already unipolar depressed and been getting worse.

Every time we get into an argument about anything I get even more suicidal. Our financial life is already a mess, I can't work currently due to my illnesses, despite being sick I still take care of the toddler everyday so she can go to work, and the LAST thing I need is her to be arguing with me about total bullshit that isn't important.

Stuff like, who's going to the store, where did you put that thing, I can't find my charger, what's for dinner.

I'd rather kill myself than leave her because I don't want to live with the guilt of leaving a woman and child, and having to pay child support for 16 years.

I feel I don't deserve my freedom anyway. I was bullied at school but I also did bullying. I broke stuff. I stole. I've been racist towards some people. I've gotten into fights. I regret all of these things. I feel karma has come around and now it's my turn to suffer. So time to die.
