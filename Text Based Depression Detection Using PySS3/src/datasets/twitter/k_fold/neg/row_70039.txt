I canâ€™t keep being lonely like this anymoreI seriously canâ€™t stand it. Iâ€™m so sick of hoping, wishing and praying for a boyfriend. Iâ€™m so sick of constantly being sad. Iâ€™m so sick of nothing making me happy. Everyone says a boyfriend wonâ€™t fix my problems but it sure would help. I just want to be done. I canâ€™t do it anymore and my life isnâ€™t going to get any better. Someone just please put me out of my misery already.
