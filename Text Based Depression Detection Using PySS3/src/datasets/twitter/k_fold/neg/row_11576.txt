I feel so empty.Iâ€™m fucking tired of going through the same shit over and over again. It feels like on one cares. I just want someone to love me as much as I love them. I want to fucking end it all because I know things will keep on being a roller coaster. 

My anxiety and depression is starting to be debilitating I donâ€™t know how much longer I can take... The only reason I havenâ€™t gone through with it is because by the grace of God he put someone into my life. I know you shouldnâ€™t live your life like that but she is the reason Iâ€™m alive.
