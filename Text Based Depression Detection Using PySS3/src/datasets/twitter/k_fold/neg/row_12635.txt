Who are we kidding? 2021 is gonna be the same.Life sucks and 2020 specifically has been an utter mess. But who are we kidding? Time is just a construct in a sense. Jumping to 2021 dosent fix anything. 

I will still be depressed, anxious, suicidal and suffer from whatever the other shit I have.  

Nothing changes. Itâ€™s only the peopleâ€™s outlook and hope. 
But I have no hope, no outlook.
