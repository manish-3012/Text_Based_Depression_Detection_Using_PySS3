Today was almost my last day on EarthToday was almost my last day on Earth. The pain just never ends. I wanted to stop it. But was too afraid. Not of death but of the pain. I was afraid and I nearly died and now I will suffer. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m like this. I wish I was different. I tied the noose to my door. I didnâ€™t put it correctly on my neck. I thought Iâ€™d simply pass out but I began to choke and I wasnâ€™t able to handle it. I tried a few more times and then the last time I felt myself fading away. I shouldâ€™ve felt happy but for some reason I gave up. I tried one last time after that and the fading went away. I feel nothing. I wish I wouldâ€™ve done it. But today I continue on. I out my noose away. Maybe Iâ€™ll bring it out again but not today. Maybe not tomorrow. It was impulsive. My life hasnâ€™t been a good one. I just wish my death were a quick one. Instead Iâ€™m dying slowly every single day. And it hurts
