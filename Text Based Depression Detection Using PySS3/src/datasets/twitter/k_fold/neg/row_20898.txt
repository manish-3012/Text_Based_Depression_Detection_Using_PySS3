Reddit, I am worried this guy may harm himself or someone else. I don't have a lot to go off of other than this video. Please look and help me out here.This was posted earlier in AskReddit, but it did not get the attention that it deserved, and has since been buried. The original post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gjr5r/not_sure_what_to_make_of_this_video_should_i_be/). 

This is the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r0w25Y7yzw). This seems serious to me. I can sense that this kid is not faking the emotion, and I can clearly tell that he is not in a good mental state. Also, note that he has some sort of gun around his shoulder. I added him as a friend on my Xbox 360, but he has not been on since the video was posted on 04/02/2011, which worries me. Also, his shirt says Gregory Portland Baseball, which after a Google search leads me to believe he lives in Corpus Christi, Texas.

I am worried about him. Please help me in any way that you can to make sure this kid is OK. I called Xbox 360 support and explained the situation, but the lady I spoke with didn't seem too interested. She said they'd do whatever they can, but something tells me she hung up and ignored it. I could be wrong, but I'd feel terrible if I wasn't and a little more diligence could save this kid. I don't know what else I can do Reddit. Please help me out here and possibly this kid as well.

Thank you!!
