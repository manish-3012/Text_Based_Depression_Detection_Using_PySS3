All I think about is the interstateI donâ€™t want to die. Or rather I donâ€™t want to kill myself. And yet, the interstate is right next door. It would only take 15 minutes tops. The thoughts are prevalent more so than ever. I even think about how it would feel to jump. I hate what Iâ€™ve become. I hate who I am. Alcohol doesnâ€™t cover the numbness. Music isnâ€™t loud enough to drown out my thoughts. I really donâ€™t want to die. Who would take care of my kitty. Sheâ€™d never understand my I never came home. I canâ€™t ignore the call though. It plagues me. I donâ€™t want to die. I just want to be different. Maybe if I were different, I wouldnâ€™t hear the bridge call my name.
