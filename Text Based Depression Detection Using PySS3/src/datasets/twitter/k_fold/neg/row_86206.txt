just called in (911) a good friend for threatening suicide. what do you say after that?a) apologies for throwaway

b) a quick google search came up with shitty, canned-sounding responses

* Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™ve been feeling so awful. Iâ€™m so glad youâ€™re still here.

* Iâ€™m here for you. Remember that you can always talk to me if you need to.

* I want to help you. Tell me what I can do to support you.

edit: c) they're (maybe) tapering off alcohol towards marijuana (i'm no saint; i drink heavily nightly) ...as we're in a legal state
