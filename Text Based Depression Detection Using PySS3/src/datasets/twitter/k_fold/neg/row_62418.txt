I have no reason to be like this.I have a stable, loving family. I have no wants. I have the job that Ive been wanting for awhile, and I recently got promoted. I have tickets to see my favorite band for my birthday.

And yet I have no appetite my hygene is awful, my room is a mess, my sleeping schedule is out of wack, I have no motivation to do anything, I look over at my shotgun in the corner and its looking oh so very friendly.

What is happening? Im scared and angry at the same time! Scared of what will happen when one of my motivation swings will coincide with being too close to that corner. And angry with myself that I'm not appriciating the positions Im in and taking full advantage of them. 

I still live with my parents, it seems fine as they're loving and supportive, but their views differ from mine considerably. My jobs dont pay enough for me to get my own place (they would if I had the motivation to FUCKING PUT THE HOURS IN).

I feel so lost, falling in a downward spiral of self-destruction. I used to think I really emotionally self-aware, but now I have no idea what's going on.
