Im lost, stuggling with school and am missing motivation to go onIm in a hard place, mostly my fault for not being smart enough to keep up in one of my classes. I am put down by my parents, am accused of skipping class(I never dream of it for fear of the consequences) I feel like I cant do anything to change it. It feels like if I left I would be a burdon of everyones shoulders. I dont feel like anyone cares. I dont know what to do. Im going to fail my class and lose my french credits and all my work. I hurt, I want it to end. I feel useless and forgotten. I have no reason to continue. I dont want to die but it feels like its my only option.
