Iâ€™ve been depressed for 9 years nowI am convinced I will die by suicide and Iâ€™m scared of myself. 
When I was 13 years old, I had my virginity â€˜stolenâ€™ from me by my boyfriend. Itâ€™s a really complicated situation, but essentially I went to a party; got drugged and my boyfriend got frisky with me. Whatâ€™s hard was I didnâ€™t want that... I hadnâ€™t even had my first kiss.. but I was to messed up to say no.
Skip forward to the next few weeks and I was SEVERELY bullied for being a whore because I was the first girl to loose my virginity in my class. I turned to drugs to hide the pain and thatâ€™s when the depression started. 
Iâ€™ve been living in silence since. 
I have no self worth. I canâ€™t love myself. I donâ€™t see why life is worth living. And I canâ€™t see why anyone else would ever love me.
I have a boyfriend who isnâ€™t the best about my depression as he doesnâ€™t understand what itâ€™s like to live like this... but I love him dearly. 
Anyways... Iâ€™ve been thinking about killing myself for a few years now, I even have a plan on how to do it. But I donâ€™t want to hurt the people who love me. I know it would simultaneously ruin their lives just so I could get some relief from the pain. 
But with how often I have to talk myself down from it, I always ask myself when is it actually going to happen? I refuse to be one of those people who uses this feeling to get what I want. I donâ€™t even talk about it to anyone... but I think about it often. I fantasize about it actually. And I know that there will be no â€˜attemptsâ€™, when I decide to finally do it... I will get it done. Thatâ€™s the scattiest part about it to me.. Iâ€™m serious and itâ€™s not a joke
This is super cynical... but I know itâ€™ll happen one day if I donâ€™t fix whatever wrong with me... but due to how long itâ€™s been, I donâ€™t think there is a solution.
