Can anyone imagine a future?Is it just me, or can you guys barely see past next week too? I literally cannot imagine myself 1 year from now. Drugs have been a life saver for me, literally. I quit wrestling, I stopped working out, and I almost completely stopped hanging out with people. Even when I do go to my friends house all I do I distance myself, and everything they do seems to irritate me. So much energy and laughter and all I wanna do is go home and cry. I feel like Iâ€™m going to jump off of my local bridge, itâ€™s high enough and the current is fast enough under it that Iâ€™m not going to survive. I donâ€™t have anything or anyone to live for. I love my pets,friends, and family but they would all be fine, if not better off, without me. I just want this to be over, and Iâ€™m honestly curious about death. Iâ€™m not gonna kill myself tonight, but I feel like relatively soon Iâ€™m going to get high and Uber to the bridge; weâ€™ll see what happens from there.
