What is lifeIâ€™m mentally unstable, Iâ€™m literally hanging by a thread. Everyday seems to get worse and worse.  I definitely donâ€™t think life is for everybody. They always say itâ€™s going to get better but I know people with situations who never get better and never experienced happiness. The only reason Iâ€™m living is bc of my sister. If it wasnâ€™t for her Iâ€™d be dead already. Does it get better and if so, When?
