You knows whats great? I was taken to hospital in an ambulance 6 hours ago, after trubg to grab a knife and being in a psychotic episode, and I was just discharged.I'm a smooth talker, I know how to not be formed.

I also can't see right now because the cops and parametics didn't bring my glasses so I will be walking at least a half hour home without being able to properly see.

And this is Canada. The system is so fucking broken. But at least I'll get my glasses tonight, eh?

After all, what's fucking up a friendship you really cared about for some decent vision?
