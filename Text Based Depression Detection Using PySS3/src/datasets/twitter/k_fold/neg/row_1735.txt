The plans is in actionI have lived a pretty amazing life Iâ€™ve traveled the world Iâ€™ve thought thousands of young people and positivity influenced the lives of others. 

I have some rules about suicide. You cannot do it until youâ€™re at least 840. We got to give life a chance When youâ€™re young and donâ€™t have a lot of control of your life and seem like thereâ€™s no end in sight, but their at maybe.


If you decided not to have children you have to stay alive for them no matter what otherwise youâ€™re a big piece of selfish ass

Iâ€™ve contributed enough to the world.  I donâ€™t have anything left, I have not had it girlfriend in a while, I donâ€™t have a hope thatâ€™s will change. 

I wish the suicide was acceptable because I would love to say goodbye to my friends. Let them how much I love them.  Thanking about how to let them know I love them without making them sad or feeling somehow responsible.  I am a little worried about my mom but sheâ€™s got a great husband and sheâ€™ll survive. 


I have waited till I gave  my life 100%.  

Itâ€™s time.
