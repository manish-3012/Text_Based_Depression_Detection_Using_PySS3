My closest friendship just endedI was so upset I didn't even go through with contacting the hotline because the hotline should be helping someone who's life actually matters. Mine doesn't.

I cause misery from those around me by prying for sympathy, scaring people by saying I'll hurt or kill myself (ven though sometimes I think it'll actually bring them closure if I were to suffer or die), in the past I was a huge bully (as much as I despise myself I will say I at least changed since then, most of my scars are from hurting myself form the guilt of bullying), even when I'm not doing that all that shit, just venting can make them miserable, or sometimes I'm not even sure what it is, but she became so much happier without me in her life.

She was the closest friend I've ever had. I really don't want her gone, but she is. For good. I can't take it. I hate myself for everything I've done. It hurts so much.

I hate myself. I want to live a meaningful life but that seems impossible as I truly feel as if I have no potential, or maybe I do but I'm just too much of a sack of shit to access it.

I hate myself. So much. I want to just drive out somewhere far, park somewhere, and cut and try to overdose until I die or someone finds me. I can't stand this life. I'm so fucking worthless.

I'm so pathetic. I cried so much. My eyes still hurt and my face was so red and pathetic. I contacted a different friend eventually and basically sobbed for nine minutes.

Sorry that I'm such a mess
