Iâ€™m going away on a trip with my friends next monthAnd Iâ€™m not coming home.

Canâ€™t think of a better way to go out than on a high like this. A week of drinking, gambling, drugs, maybe get laid if Iâ€™m lucky and on the last night before we go home, Iâ€™m going to sneak away and end it. There is only one thing I enjoy in life and that is having fun with my friends, but since you canâ€™t do that for a living and every other waking minute of living is torture, Iâ€™ve decided this is the perfect way to go out.
