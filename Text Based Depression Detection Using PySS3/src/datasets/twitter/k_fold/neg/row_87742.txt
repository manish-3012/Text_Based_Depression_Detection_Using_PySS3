This week is going to kill meWishful thinking I guess. I'm out on a road trip with family and I am hardly getting by. I have been so stressed and look so ridiculously sad to everyone and there's just too many people for me. I'm losing it.  I've had two breakdowns today. The one just recently I was texting my best and pretty much only true friend. I haven't met her but she's everything to me and I'm ruining it and hurting her like I do everyone in my life. I cannot get over my love for her. I'm so desperately alone and all I want in life is to be with her. She doesn't feel that kind of love for me and has said it over and over. I'm pushing her away now. I told her to tell me how she felt honestly and she said it worries her and tires her. I think I may stop texting her for her own good. Right when she sent me that my family was going to a bar party and they convinced me to go. I have no idea why I went. They were hanging out with other athletes and I didn't know anyone. I sat outside for so long crying. I stared at her message forever. I started breathing super hard and had a panic attack. I was close to dropping my phone and wallet and walking off alone to hopefully die. I keep getting closer and closer to doing something drastic. The suicidal thoughts are so strong. I've tried so much for help and nothing works for me. To make matters worse the only thing that slightly helps is weed and I'm in a legal state and at a legal age but since I'm with family the whole time and they hate it and I can't drive myself, it's not even an option. Too much has built up to lead me to this point and my past vividly haunts my everyday life. And I'm losing the one thing keeping me alive. I always say that there's only so much I can take but this time I truly mean it.
