Maybe the world would be better without me!I think I lost motivation to live. I have had a hard time lately and everything sucks. I feel empty inside. I feel lonely. I have friends and family that cares about me. But, it feels like 80% of people I met hates or dislikes me. Of course, I don't expect everybody to like me. But, There's so many that doesn't like me. I don't know why. It's the same deal with Facebook. I feels like 80% of my friends list hates or dislikes me. I done nothing wrong. I don't want to hurt anyone. I always believed I'm a good person. My family and friends says that I am a good person. But, it doesn't seem that anybody else thinks so. Right now, I'm depressed and I have suicide thoughts. I just want to be accepted. I'm in so much pain right now. Please, Help Me :(
