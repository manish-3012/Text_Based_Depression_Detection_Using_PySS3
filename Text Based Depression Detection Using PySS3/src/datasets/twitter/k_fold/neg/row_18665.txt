Tried killing myself tonightI'm such an utter scumbag. I don't think I can ever forgive myself for what I did tonight. I'm not sure if it was even a suicide attempt. All I know is that the thought of just veering my car off the road suddenly sounded like a great idea.

I started flooring the car going as fast as possible, went twice the speed limit and then put my hands up in the air. As soon as I got to the bend on the road though I slammed on the breaks to slow down and made my turn. I went off the road but thankfully didn't crash into a tree and no one was around at this time. I don't know what stopped me, probably the evolutionary urge to survive. I tried again but I just couldn't after that.

Why did I do it? I guess because I've felt empty for years. I've always looked in the mirror but never seen myself there if that makes sense. Haven't cared about anything for a long time. Knowing that I don't have a future and could die at any moment also makes me not care. I fucked up my life so much that there's no way I'll even get a job or live to be 20 or anything. Driving at night, and then one of my favourite songs came on the radio. The song I loved as a child and the stars in the sky.

It all just made sense and I thought I wanted to die. I just feel like such a scumbag for it though. I didn't take notice of anyone else on the road because I was so caught up in the moment. What if there was someone who saw me? I deserve to be imprisoned for my stupid mistake... I don't know why I was allowed to live. It's clear I was never meant to be born.

I haven't talked about this seriously. I've mentioned being depressed, but I didn't imagine it was possible for me to feel like this. In a way, I don't even wan to tell anyone because there's still a part o me that wants to commit suicide. I just wonder if anyone will be able to change my mind.

Tldr; I was going to do it but then TREE FIDDY LOL. Jk about the whole thing lel.
