My soul mate died, I just donâ€™t see a reason to continueShe died almost two years ago, we were closer than anyone. Just absolutely inseparable, she even had my birthdate tattooed. I know Iâ€™m never going to have that again, I miss her with a weight that could bury me. I just want to die because Iâ€™m in so much pain from losing her. Even in sleep I donâ€™t get a reprieve because I have nightmares about her death. I just feel this void in my life that wonâ€™t ever go away. Death seems like the long awaited rest from this hard life
