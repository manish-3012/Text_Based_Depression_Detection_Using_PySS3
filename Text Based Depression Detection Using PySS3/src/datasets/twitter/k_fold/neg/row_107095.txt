Any redditors that can relate or give advice. Diagnosed with severe mental disorders and in need of some internet support.I posted this originally to Askreddit but was advised to bring this up here instead.

To put a long story short, I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, obsession and health anxiety. I'm currently taking anti-depressives, anti-psychotics and anti-anxiety medication.

I've been in therapy (and even been admitted to a psychiatric facility once) for a few months now and despite all the meds my condition is quite stable in a negative way and no matter how hard I try I can't seem to sense any real improvements. It has gotten to the point where I've considered taking my own life as each day is always the same. It literally feels like I'm living out my own worst nightmare (the sickest part is that my real nightmares (dreams) are better than the reality that I wake up to.

My health anxiety manifests itself in the thinking that I have a certain terminal disease even though all the tests show that there is nothing wrong with me. The hardest part is me just not being able to believe my doctor when he tells me that there is no way that I'm seriously ill.

I recently told my girlfriend about my condition and even though she took it really well I'm getting the sense that she's considering leaving me. I don't blame her for that and a part me (my guilt) wants her to just tell me to fuck off and leave me. Fx. when we go out drinking and partying there are always tons of guys hitting on her and afterwards she tells me about it and admits that she's having doubts about us. This really fuels my insecurity even though she never mentions it the day after. The last thing I want is to some kind of baggage for that slows down her own ambitions. We're both academics but I haven't been able to concentrate on my master thesis nor my work and feeling really bad about the pressure from both her and my family.

All in all I'm just seriously worried that my condition is not going to get better (it's been 8 months now) either physically or mentally. So I was wondering if any of you have had any similar experiences and whether you managed to get better with or without medication.
