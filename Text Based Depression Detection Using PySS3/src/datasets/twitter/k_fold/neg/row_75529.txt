Iâ€™m losing everyone around me.In March my grandmother was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. I lived with her and never left her side, even as she died on April 29th. 7 days later my nana died. I had a break and left my toxic relationship, leaving a woman I still loved behind. But also left a family I had adopted behind. And now my mother probably has lung cancer. Speculated to be terminal. I find out tomorrow. I honestly donâ€™t trust myself if the news is what everyone thinks. I canâ€™t do this again. Iâ€™ve never been more afraid in my life.
