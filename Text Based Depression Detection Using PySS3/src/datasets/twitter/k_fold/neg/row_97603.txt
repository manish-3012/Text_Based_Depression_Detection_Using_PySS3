I donâ€™t want anything.My life started out pretty rocky. Life isnâ€™t fair and thatâ€™s okay. Iâ€™ve worked so hard to get an education, become financially secure, Iâ€™ve done years of therapy to build the emotional capacity to exist with my past in a world that has been mostly indifferent to my challenges. I try not to complain, I always look on the bright side. I seek loving friendships and supportive people. 

Sometimes when I open up to new people about my life I get a huge slap in the face reminder of how painful it has all been. A fact that Iâ€™ve running from since I could walk. I donâ€™t want anything today, but one reason to live that isnâ€™t because I have to for the people that rely on me. 

The world is full of so much pain, sometimes I think that staying alive is just me punishing myself. Why commit to a world of hurt, hoping to keep carving out a happy life when I could make it all go away in a flash. What difference could I really be making in the difficult lives of my loved ones? 


Iâ€™m feeling very sad, bitter and lonely this morning. I hope it passes.
