In the middle of a mental breakdownI just went through a rough day, I'm homeschooled and I was interrogated to the point where I had to do my school or I don't get anything and everything started shaking and I was yelled at for that for the last hour of which I have just kept muttering I need to do my school.
 I have had multiple suicide thoughts throughout the years and they continue to this day, I've also had many murderous thoughts about the people that I blame my troubles on.  Please Help
