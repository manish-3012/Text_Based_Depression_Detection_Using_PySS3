So much fun to try and live the normal everyday life when all you want to do is diiieee now. So I had like a month where I didn't go every day saying "F it all, I give up." But now I am right back there. I am already dead in my mind, how can I finish out this last semester of college? How can I keep working my part time custodial job? I FEEL it every time I drag another trashbag out through the wet soccer field to the cold warehouse where my creepy bosses sit upstairs. I close my eyes and imagine I am finally on top of that bridge overlooking the glorious, endless highway where you can see thousands of  yellow headlights approaching on one side, and the red taillights fading off into the beautiful sunset. My feet balancing on the edge, the wind against me, knowing that soon I will be flying, carefree, to the end. But where am I? I am here still, with all these people who are like "hey we all got so much to live for yaaaay!" Sometimes walking around in this world reminds me of walking around in a crazy hospital, with the assortment of people, some grinning, singing and dancing, some playing games, some lonely looking ones with painted faces trying to find purpose and happiness in another person, some OCD ones that find purpose in random obsessions, and some grumpy old ones of course, but all delusional-walking around dazed and drugged on the lie that we can ever truly have freedom, love, purpose or happiness. These are my thoughts as I sit here at 3am trying to finish an assignment for a class. I have no motivation. I am tired and I am full of disdain for my life and life in general. Uuuugggg. I think I shall take up smoking, I hear it helps the nerves. I wish I could like, donate my years to someone who wants them, this misery is such a waste of time.
