As lame as it is, the only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fact that Brockhampton is releasing Saturation III sometime this year.For the past few months, I have felt completely hopeless and have basically given up. I'm failing several classes at college and I'm staying in the loft of my mom's disgusting, filthy house because I am completely broke. I have zero friends due to my autism, and I push away everyone who tries to enter my life. I feel like there's no reason to continue living. I hate being alive and I don't see an end to it. I've tried receiving help and I've tried medication and I've tried improving my life but nothing has worked. The only positive thing in my life is the fact that Brockhampton has released two of the most incredible hip-hop albums I've ever heard in the span of two and a half months, and they're currently working on the third in this trilogy. Their work ethic is absolutely insane, and they are so musically gifted. These albums have been keeping me going and delaying my suicide, and I'm ashamed to say that I'm only alive for Brockhampton. I don't want to kill myself until I've heard the completed trilogy in its entirety. Once Saturation III drops, I will likely end my life.
