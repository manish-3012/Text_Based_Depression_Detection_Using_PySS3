i just can't stand living in this world anymore.i got a friend that he told me he wants to commit suicide. i'll try to talk to him and help him but he said he had enough of it. so idk whats he going to do now. And im affected by it. i can't help him but he have his own choice i can see that he loose all hope in life. So what the fuck man is this world still have a hope for us it seems like we are dying every single day. Humanity is doomed i dont have any optimistic about the future. i see humans life is really a bleak nothingness meaningless suffering thats all.
