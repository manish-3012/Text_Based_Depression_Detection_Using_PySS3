Reddit please help me, please.Reddit, I can't stop crying. I am in tears. I have a knife next to me, I don't know what to do. Me and my first ever girlfriend (I'm not attractive) just split up. I know you may laugh at how pathetic this sounds. But I need help. I am emotionally unstable, and have been suicidal many years. I went on her inbox, she hid a conversation WITH MY BEST FRIEND. on facebook. The messages were here saying I love you. And saying how she wants to jump on his and wrap her legs around him. I feel sick. I could hardly breathe. It's been 40 minutes since that. I just told her i'm leaving her. I realy need help. I cannot stop crying. I am shaking and I feel sick. Please help me. I cannot sleep either.
And to make it worse. She's speaking to her ex about this making out like i'm the bad person. I cannot cope :'(

I feel worthless. I gave everything to her, all of my love, i never got mad at her, got her dinner, I did my best. She was my only girlfriend. I lost friends for her. Now my last 'true' friend is fucking flirting with her behind her back. 

I feel like the only way to make her feel bad is ending it. See if anybody actually cares. I have no one. She has everyone.
