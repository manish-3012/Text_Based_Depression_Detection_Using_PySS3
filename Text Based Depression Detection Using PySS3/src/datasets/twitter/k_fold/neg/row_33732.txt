There's not a way of fixing thingsI havent been able to figure out how to do it the last couple weeks but I remembered I have something. 

I am mentally ill, I have a disorder, whatever you want to say it. Something is wrong with me. There's not a way for me to beat this though. I'm so tired. 

The man I love is fucking someone else right now. 
I can't make a decent living for myself. 
I keep letting my mom down right now. 
I'm ready to go, there is no way I can turn back. 
I'm tired of caring for people who hate me, have disregard for me. 
I hope to get to heaven or Valhalla anyways.
