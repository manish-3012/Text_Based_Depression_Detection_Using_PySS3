My new medication is ruining me and I cant keep living like thisIt makes me sleepy and irritable and absolutely hopeless by the end of the day I had to smoke weed again to get through but the combination made my head hurt so much I felt sick. The scars on my wrist from the last time have faded and I have the urge to replace them. I want to go fucking crazy again and drive off. Im in such a fog. Nothing I do will ever get me away from this. The feeling will always come back no matter how good my life is. WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO NOW
