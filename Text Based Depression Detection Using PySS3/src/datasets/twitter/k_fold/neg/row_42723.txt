Am I suicidal?I started cutting myself whacking myself with wood and been burning my skin about 2 days ago, none of it is obvious just some scars. I wrote a will today and started writing a letter to a friend about my death. I donâ€™t want to be anywhere at the momement home is too stressful. I have physical anxiety issues and I have lost all interests. I am planning getting myself drunk and having some SSRIs for depression then calling my local crisis line tomorrow. I donâ€™t want to kill myself but I donâ€™t want to be at home or around anyone and I canâ€™t trust my self not to hurt myself.
