Probably losing my job tomorrowI have a work probation meeting tomorrow because I've missed 9/23 days so far. I dont know if I have the strength to keep going if I do lose it, not that I make it in to work anyway. I want to be able to just go in to work and be happy and not feel like I'm in constant fucking pain but I dont know if that's possible for me.
