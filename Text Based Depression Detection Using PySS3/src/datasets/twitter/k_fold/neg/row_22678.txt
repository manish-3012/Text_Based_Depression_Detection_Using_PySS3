Not sure if I am going to go through with it. I have a plan. I'm going to buy a bottle of rum, and two packages of Tylenol PM. 
 I have a good life (now). But I didn't before. I came from a family who ostracized me after I asked for help after being sexually assaulted for seven years and don't have a family anymore. I'm really only here because my cat depends on me and he is my best friend. 

But he's sick. 

I don't know. I'm 23 and I feel like I've lived all my life and tbh I just don't see a future for myself. I have PTSD and have gone to two doctors in the last month and told them I'm suicidal and they turned me away. Idk.

Idk.
