I went to a mental hospitalIn my opinion it's not worth it

Imma say where I went tho because people from 4 hours away (other states obviously) were there. Windsor Laurelwood 

The place only taught me what my therapist has and they took away my main three coping mechanisms being art, music, and going or looking outside. While you can look outside you are not allowed by the window so I had to sit a ways away.

Got out

Got the wrong diagnosis

And I can say that matter of factly because you cant diagnose DMDD with PTSD. Also I told them I cant get angry at people because instead I get angry at myself and then have suicidal thoughts, they did not listen to that.

I havent even been home for 24 hours and I have already been in 3 arguements and want to do the same thing that got me in there

I'm not like most people, I actually want to die

Like 99% of the time, it's not situational but it is worsened with triggers

I'm so fucking done with this family, if they hate me so much maybe they should emancipate me because the whole time I was away from them I didnt feel suicidal. My 1% is from being at a mental hospital that I hated.
