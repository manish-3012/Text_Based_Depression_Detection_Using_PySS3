I watched a video on YT about a high school that hung himself after being bullied, I am just obsessed with watching videos about people dying. I would wish I was that person who died....Today I also wrote the following in my notebook:

"Is Death peaceful? I am just so tired of my shitty life. I am pretty sure it is \[death\] peaceful, like being asleep w/o dreams. I have an idea to kill myself if wish to go down that path. If I do it one day I just want to say sorry. I was just so fucking done with the pain, the pain from depression. 

Pretty sure that I am not ok, and this is not normal.
