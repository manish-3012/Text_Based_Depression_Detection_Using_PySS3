Accepting things as they are/Class mobility.Hey SW.

I need some help trying to appreciate what I do have. I've been having really high ideation lately, mostly because of my socioeconomic status. I'm about to complete my associate's degree and feel like a B.A simply might not be in the cards.


I feel like I'm a reasonably smart guy, but I fear that life without a bachelor's degree, coming from a poor family is just going to be miserable. I'm trying to convince myself that ANY life, even that of a bum, is better than no life at all.

On the other hand, I feel like maybe if I can just bust ass, I can finish my bachelor's and have a "better shot." I just feel really crippled by my circumstances. 


I was also having a really crappy time at the beginning of the year, and managed to score myself a criminal record (retail theft), which is making it a lot harder to find work while I'm in school. It was an idiotic thing, not to mention fucking asshole-ish, thing to do, and I'm definitely not going to continue down that road. I just feel like the bed I have now laid for myself makes it really difficult to find happiness.


Basically, I'm just terrified of having to live poor. There's so much information suggesting that class mobility is effectively dead. But still, it HAS to be better to live poor than not live at all... right? It sounds so defeatist, but I just want to be one of those people who can be happy with an "average" job. Doing great things doesn't even matter to me that much anymore, I just want to be happy doing SOMETHING.


So... any advice? I'm honestly thinking about stopping school after my AA and just trying to find a decent full-time job, but on the other hand, I feel like I should give the B.A. a real shot. I just get so damn down on myself that it takes away from my ability to study and really try. I guess sort of just feel like if I settle with the AA, I can start my life and not worry so much about whether or not I'll get more education.
