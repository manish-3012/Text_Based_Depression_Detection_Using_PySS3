Literally no reason not to do it.It's been what? Nine years? Nine years of thinking about it all day every day? Why havent I just done it yet? Theres no reason not to do it. I'm completely alone. I'm ugly. I have no future. I'm too fucking stupid to learn a skill. Im poor. I can't get a girlfriend. My family fucking hates me. I can't do it. I really just cant live anymore. It hurts so bad and I can just make it stop. Why shouldn't I?
