Ruined everything. Please help.I haven't set a date yet and I haven't decided on the means. But I need your help, guys. I'm scared. I've been working on clearing out all my belongings. 

Two nights ago I fucked up my friendships with my roommates by having a drug induced panic attack and I was told I need to stop taking up their time with my constant neediness and reassurance seeking (I have OCD). I don't do drugs often but I think I also scared them by romanticizing the heavy stuff. 

I keep having these situations where I could do it. Right now I'm taking a bath and there are plenty of benzos within arms reach. I could drown right now. But I want to get my belongings cleared out first and finish wrapping Christmas presents. I just don't want to feel this pain anymore. 

I don't want to go to a facility because I still have some devotion to my career; gotta be there on Monday. Because if I don't kill myself, I might as well keep going with regular life, no? Except for all the times I'm stuck in bed for hours and ruining my friendships and crying and dreaming up ways to sabotage my life or end my life.
