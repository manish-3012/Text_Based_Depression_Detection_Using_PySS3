Feel like thereâ€™s bad luck on meKicked out my apartment... I was so sleep deprived from crying the past few days and tired sleeping in my cold car. Car battery just died and itâ€™s raining here in NJ. No money to tow and no money to get a new battery. I only have $10.50 from IC. 

Honestly, Iâ€™m thinking about jumping off the bridge. I have no will to live anymore. Never thought that my job would reduced hours significantly and my life would turn out to be hell.
