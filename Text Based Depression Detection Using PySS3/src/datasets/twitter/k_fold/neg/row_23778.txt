Thank you all :)I decided to seek help next month. I am afraid but I decided that I am going to see one of those doctors that can help me. I'd like to thank everyone that helped me here. Thank you very much for just having some of your time to talk with me. And a huge thank you too for all the people that I meet here and talked too. So being all day in internet and speak with strangers makes me anxious and worse so I will stay away from this until I am good. But after that I'd like to keep talking with you all and know you better and help people here, because I know what it's like and even if I don't talk much I can be at someone side. And a huge hug to one person I meet here, you really made the diference :)
