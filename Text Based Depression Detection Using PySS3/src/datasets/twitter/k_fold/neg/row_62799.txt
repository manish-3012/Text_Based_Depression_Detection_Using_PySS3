I will try and end it every day until it worksLast night was supposed to be my last but of course I failed again. I donâ€™t get why I just canâ€™t fucking end it already. I have nothing worth living for NOTHING. Nobody wants me here, I do nothing to nobody, donâ€™t even say anything, no looks, nothing. Yet I keep getting treated shitty, every single year of my life. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m a magnet for it. I have no friends. I gave up on finding a relationship at a super young age, like 13 or something, when I realized nobody would even want to be my friend. My own family uses me and I have no way out other than this. I have been bullied every year of school since first grade. I said I wouldnâ€™t make it past 18 when I was in elementary school. Now I am 19 and I canâ€™t do it anymore. I have been in isolation for YEARS. I gave up so long ago. At this point Iâ€™m just wasting time. I know Iâ€™m going to kill myself, so why wonâ€™t I just do it. Itâ€™ll all be over. No more suffering. All gone.

Then every year after saying I would die at 18, I would always say â€œIâ€™ll give it another year, it canâ€™t possibly get worseâ€ then it always gets worse. If I had access to a gun I would have died years ago. I know my only way out, and the only thing stopping me at the moment is fear of what happens after death. But donâ€™t worry, because I will get over it. I will try every night for however long it takes.
