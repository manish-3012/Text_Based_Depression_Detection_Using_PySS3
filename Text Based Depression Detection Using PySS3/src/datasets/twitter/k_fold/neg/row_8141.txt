Making an effort to keep myself safePart of me just really wants to die, but another part of me is here making an effort to stay safe. 

I have a lot of leftover prescription medications from various failed medication trials and a lot of prescription pain medication that I don't even know why I have. I know that it's probably enough to finish the job. I've been meaning to get rid of this shit for a long time. There are drop boxes in my community where you can dispose of old prescriptions, but they are in really public spaces and I can't bring myself to use them because I feel like everyone would be watching me. I don't drive because of a medical condition so on top of that I'd have to have someone drive me and they'd want to know why the fuck I've been hoarding 3 years worth of drugs. 

I feel like if I don't get rid of these pills I'm just going to kill myself. I know it's wrong to throw pills in the trash. But I need them gone NOW. Would it really be that bad for me to just throw them in the trash?
