Learning disabilityI was diagnosed with borderline disability and it's making me suicidal and homicidal. I've never accomplished anything in my life I have no ged, no job, no licence all I want to do is get a ged so I can go to college to study a trade. Why do people with learning disability have to take the same test as people who don't have learning disability of course it would be easier for them but for us the test feels like a foreign language to me.
