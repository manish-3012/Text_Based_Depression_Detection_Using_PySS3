I might kill myself tonight..The amount of stress school gives is too much for me to handle.. i'm not strong enough. My grades are failing really bad.. my results are bad.. I don't know who to talk to anymore. I have friends in school but i feel so lonely.. my close friend doesn't like it when i talk about depression but if she were talking about things i don't like hearing to, i'd still listen. Everyday when I go back home, my mom will always nag me.. she's one of the reasons i have depression. Teachers in my school are starting to ask me "Do you have any problems?" "Are you okay?", and i'd reply no. I don't know what to do anymore.. I hate the fact that i'm in the highest class when I don't deserve it. I'm stupid. I feel like i'll fail in life so what's the point of me living..? My mom doesn't care about me that much. All she knows is confiscating my phone.. she doesn't know that the only reason i'm still alive is because of my.. online friends..
