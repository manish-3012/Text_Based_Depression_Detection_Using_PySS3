Too much to fit into a title. Hung up on by suicide hotline haha.Suicidal for 8 years. Tried 2 years ago to first call a suicide hotline. I said "My life fucking sucks" and the lady said not to swear at her and hung up on me. Tried again a few weeks back. Hung up before getting to a person. Tried today and yesterday to call the australia mental health access line. Some 24/7 call place. Hung up on before seeing a person. I checked and triple checked. Never call dropped. Never me pressing it. It was them disconnecting.

Imagine being so god damn broken that none of the suicide help places want to even try fix you. I'm very close to another episode. Last time I lost it laughing at how hilarious it was. I scratched myself and made myself bleed, hit my head into a wall, laughing. It was hilarious how fucked I was. So I kept laughing.

I'm close to that again. All I've got left is to laugh. I'm suppressing a smile at this all too. If I don't it'll happen again. I'm very tense right now. Didn't want to ever post here or anywhere but I'm running out of places and ways to delay my suicide. The other part of me doesn't want to but god I want it so badly.
