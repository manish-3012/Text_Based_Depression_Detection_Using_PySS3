Suicide hotlineI've had the # for the suicide hotline (United States) in my phone for years, and more times than I can count I've either thought about dialing it, or dialed it then hung up.. each time I thought, no, I'm not that bad yet, I'll save it for my last lifeline. I finally called last night. I was on hold for 15 minutes, they listened to my problems and then walked me through a breathing exercise and then basically pushed me off the phone. I was left feeling more alone than before. I don't know what I expected.

My point is, there's no help for me. I'm killing myself this weekend.
