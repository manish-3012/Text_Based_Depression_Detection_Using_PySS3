I failedI failed at all my goals for university, I'm in fourth year with nothing to show. I'm wasted and it's 4pm. I can't do this anymore, my boyfriend barely cares about me, most people who used to talk to me stopped after I lost one election, my grades are garbage and I just can't fight the depression anymore, there is nothing to keep me going, I just want it to end.
