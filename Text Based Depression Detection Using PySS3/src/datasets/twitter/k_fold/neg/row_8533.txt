Iâ€™ve come to the end.I fucked up big time. I just got out of respite, and decided it would be a good time to talk to my boyfriend. And now Iâ€™ve just ruined the best two years of my life by being so depressed I canâ€™t even bother to ask how heâ€™s doing. Heâ€™s one of the last things keeping me alive, and without that I donâ€™t see any reason to keep on. So Iâ€™ll say my goodbyes, write my notes, and get it over and done with.
