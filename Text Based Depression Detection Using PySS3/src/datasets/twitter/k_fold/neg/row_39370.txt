Inpatient and therapy didnâ€™t workI feeling suicidal and turned myself in to the hospital to be safe. Ended up taking FMLA and a month off work. Was in a month of intensive outpatient therapy and feel okay, no suicidal thoughts. But now after an argument with my boyfriend if 4 years (huge support system) I was to kill myself. Iâ€™m exhausted and sad and just feel like Iâ€™d be better off dead. 

I donâ€™t know if I have the guts to do it. I know I never could do it to my family but if I could just die I would.
