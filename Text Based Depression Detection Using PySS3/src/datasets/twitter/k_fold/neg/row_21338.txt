iâ€™m losing it.iâ€™m young. i shouldnâ€™t feel the way i do. my life is fine. i enjoy school. i love my family and friends. i have many hobbies. so why do i feel so empty? i just want a purpose. i thought i could find that in people. i was real tight with a girl and she gave up on me. she just started ignoring me for god knows why. can i talk to someone? i donâ€™t want to leave but iâ€™m getting closer and closer each day
