ReasonsSevere social anxiety, depression, social isolation, deep self hatred (I hate everything about my appearance and most of my brain), zero friends, mom doesn't love me, nostalgia, heroin &amp; benzo addict, hoarder, 24/7 in bed, traumas, police raid scared me so much that I can't sleep, debt.

Now I have to appear in court, I could go to jail. I can't even leave my house.

This is it, I will be overdosing soon, there are just too many things going on. I'm only 19 and scared.
