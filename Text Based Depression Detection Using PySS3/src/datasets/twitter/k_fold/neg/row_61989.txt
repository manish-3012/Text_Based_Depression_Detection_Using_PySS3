Should I worry?I don't want to share my exact age, but I'm a highschool underclassman. I don't want to die, and could never see myself doing anything, but I always find myself looking for information on suicide, or resources for suicidal people even if I'm not. I think about it a lot during the day, but not that /i/I/i/ want to kill myself, but simply the statements "I want to kill myself" and "You should tell someone" (even though I don't want to die at all). Last year I had a date set to end it, but never believed I would and never went through with anything. What should I do?
