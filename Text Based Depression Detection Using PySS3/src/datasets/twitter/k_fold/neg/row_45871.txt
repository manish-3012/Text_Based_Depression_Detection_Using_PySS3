I feel like the only way to be free and to free others is by taking my own life.I feel like I'm in a situation where if I want to free people from misery or from anything that has to do with my connection with them, I would have to go. It doesn't bother me to think this way, nor does it hurt or makes me sad. It just makes sense to me. To kill myself in order to be free and to free others.
