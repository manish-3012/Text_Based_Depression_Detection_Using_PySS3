I canâ€™t take it.Iâ€™m forcing myself to leave college and work from home this spring semester to take the refund and work on my mental health... and honestly I donâ€™t think I can do anything right. Iâ€™m in a constant state of panic being here at school. All of my other friends are leaving so I have no support system. So Iâ€™m going home to be with family... but I also donâ€™t want to go home and be dependent. Thereâ€™s no easy answer to any of it and I not only feel cheated by this virus for the year concerning college, but my mental health has been destroyed and all I think about all day every day is wanting to die. 
I canâ€™t take the isolation anymore. 
I hate that Iâ€™m here. 
I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m still doing here 
Iâ€™m permanently broken and I canâ€™t be fixed 
I donâ€™t deserve anything I have. 
Please just let me 
Die 
This shit just keeps getting worse 
Thereâ€™s no way out 
I will fail 
I already fail at everything 
Canâ€™t get a job 
Canâ€™t make a phone call 
Canâ€™t keep a friendship 
Canâ€™t keep a relationship 
Iâ€™m not meant for anything 
Or anyone 
I just wish I would just drop dead 
Itâ€™s becoming too much 
I donâ€™t know what to do anymore 
I canâ€™t be enough 
I will never be enough 
Iâ€™m never going to be a good graphic designer 
Iâ€™m not going to be able to keep my friends 
Iâ€™m going broke  
Worthless
Nothing
I mean nothing 
I donâ€™t mean anything to anyone 
I wished I was never born 
I hate who I am 
Sheâ€™s not worthy of anything 
And never has been 
Iâ€™m too fucking fragile 
Everything just hurts 
I wish I was dead 
Itâ€™s too much
Iâ€™m scared 
I donâ€™t know how to do anything 
Iâ€™m broken 
Nothing can fix me 
Just permanently 
Worthless  
And no one cares 
Iâ€™ve begged for help 
No one answers 
My shit doesnâ€™t matter 
I donâ€™t matter 
I want to 
Die
I really wished I had just died in January 
While in the hospital 
If I had known all of this was going to happen 
I would have asked to die 
I shouldnâ€™t have lived 
Thereâ€™s no point 
No one would miss me 
I want to 
Die 
So bad 
Please 
This isnâ€™t a fucking joke please just let me die 
Why am I here 
Iâ€™m so worthless 
Broken 
Pathetic 
No one would care 
Just let me die 
Away from family 
And away from my friends 
Because I know it will hurt for a few days 
Then theyâ€™ll be over me 
And itâ€™s like I was never born 
It wonâ€™t hurt too bad 
My existence was always a burden anyways 
Please 
Why didnâ€™t I stay dead earlier this year? 
I wouldnâ€™t have to fear going outside or leaving my house 
I wouldnâ€™t have met him. And fallen in love.
I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with the debt 
Or my best friend leaving leaving 
Or not being able to touch anyone 
Or have to be afraid every time I leave the house 
Honestly 
They are all better off without me 
I am a burden 
Why am I trying 
If Iâ€™m just going to fail
Please
My body canâ€™t stop shaking. 
I canâ€™t take the constant state of panic anymore. 
I canâ€™t listen to music anymore. 
I canâ€™t focus on class. 
I canâ€™t make art like I want to make. 
Iâ€™m realizing I am without purpose.
I want to die 
Please 
Let me out 
I want to 
Die
But if I killed myself Iâ€™d only fuck it up 
Because I fuck up everything 
I suck 
Iâ€™m worthless 
I should have died 
Please 
Let me 
Die.
