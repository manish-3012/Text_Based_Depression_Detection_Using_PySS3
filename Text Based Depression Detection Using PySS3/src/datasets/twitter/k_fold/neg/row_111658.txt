Dead kittensI remember now. That time my mother told me about how she drowned some kittens because she wouldnt have been able to care for them.
My brother is going nuts. Lying about everything to everyone. Drinking, debts to no end. Breaking up with everyone in the family (except me yet, although he has been lying to me too). Today my mom told me she would be so glad if she wouldnt need to see him ever again. In the past she said she wouldnt care if he tried to kill himself (again). I wondered if she thinks the same about me.
