I hate myselfI don't really know why I'm like this. I want to live you know, but I'm seriously unmotivated and I just want to disappear for like a long time I'm just too stressful. I feel like I'm a piece of trash that it doesn't deserve to live. There were many times that I wanted to kill myself, but I'm too coward and pitiful to do it. I would like to have a gun and do it quickly so not to die without suffering. The worst of all is that I'm affortunate, I had a lot of things, but I feel that it didn't satisfied me, the only thing that I like is to play videogames, but even I know that the satisfaction isn't too long and I got depressed again. I have attention deficit and it is a torture for me I don't do anything. I feel like I'm inferior than the other people, I feel like everyone else do the things they want, but me no and later ther goes my thoughts. I'm trash, stupid, worthless, I shuld die, I hate myself. A little mistake for me is just something that demostrate that I'm a piece of trash.

Sorry for the english, is not my maternal lenguage
