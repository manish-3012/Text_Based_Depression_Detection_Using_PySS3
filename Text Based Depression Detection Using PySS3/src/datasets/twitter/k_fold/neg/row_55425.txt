Merry Christmas, no one loves youUgh I hate holidays cause everyone always has the perfect family and are able to get gifts but my family is broken up and hates each other so no one has any fun, the holiday passes, and nothing changes. No happiness, no fond memories, just poverty and wanting to shoot myself in the face. Same goes with my birthday, or any other holiday where you're supposed to be around each other and have fun. God I wish I was dead so I could be in Heaven and chill. I hate this world. Nothing for me here. If you weren't born lucky then you're fucked.
