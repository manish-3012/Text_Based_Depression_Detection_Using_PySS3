I'm not cut out for this life.I just started college. I wake up at 6:30am to go to a school will 8000+ students, anxiety city. I lay awake at night worrying about my future, so I don't get enough sleep and end up making things worse. I have no talents and no real passion. I'm in psychology, I chose this path because I wanted to help people, but now I don't even feel like I would be capable of that of I can't help myself. As I see my friends less and less I feel us beginning to drift apart, I find it very hard to make friends and am not the type to just randomly speak to the person next to me in class. I don't know what to do, I just needed to say these words somewhere, I have no one to talk to.
