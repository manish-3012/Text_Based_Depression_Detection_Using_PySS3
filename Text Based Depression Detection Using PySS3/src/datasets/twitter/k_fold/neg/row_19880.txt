I want to dieI live a great life right now. I'm a teen so I live with my parents. We live in the nicest part of Houston. I have good grades at a top private school. My life should be perfect. For some reason I feel awful. I'm so afraid I won't find love. That I won't be successful. I feel like I'm floating away from my friends. Everything is falling apart. I dont see the purpose of continuing. I've lied to my friends. Im a class clown and I feel like people laugh at me but don't connect with me. I feel alone.
