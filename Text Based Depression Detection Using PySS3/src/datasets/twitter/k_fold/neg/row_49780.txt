I wish I didnâ€™t have any good reasons to live so I could kill myself easieritâ€™s really hard I want to die from my mistakes, and how much I hate myself, but I canâ€™t kill myself because  of my family and how lucky I am. My ego hurts, people hurt me, and I feel hopeless, super high expectations but it was all I cared for cause Iâ€™m insecure. I really donâ€™t want to be here though.
