Just gotta say it feels good...... to be so fucking angry all the time as opposed to being depressed. Iâ€™m still incredibly bitter every morning I wake up that I have to keep going though this cause I canâ€™t kill my self because of my mom. 

But I gotta say, it feels good to have more energy for once. I feel like I have a lingering headache all the time tho.
