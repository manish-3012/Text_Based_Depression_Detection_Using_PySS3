I'm tired of the emotional abuse.I'm emotionally abused by my mom, I have been for the past 20 years. I can't remember a time she was actually nice to me. 


Everything is my fault, I guess I can see it too. But I don't think I deserve it, I never thought I deserved it. She keeps on saying she's sorry and how "I will never treat you that way again" but she does. I can't leave. My parents are together. I have no friends who live near by nor no family members who will take me in. I'm a shitty child. 


I'm tired of it, I'm tired of being treated like shit. I'm tired of living everyday wondering what she'll say or do to me today. I cry over just the thought of asking her to take me to my doctors appointments (I can't drive. I have epilepsy). I would love to run away but I have no way to. 



I want to get away from it. I want to end it. I want to never hear from her or see her again. I have to deal with it whenever I come back for the holidays. I can't afford to move out, I'm a college student so all my money goes to classes.


Why was I born into this family? Why couldn't I have a half way decent mom? Why couldn't I have a mom who loves me?
