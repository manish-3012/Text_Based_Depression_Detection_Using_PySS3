Trying to help someone...Idk if this is the right group to ask, but my friend is making very intentional posts on social media saying heâ€™s close to taking his life. My mom took her life last month and he really helped me through the first few weeks. Iâ€™d be devastated if he took his own life. He makes the posts all the time. He has many friends who make a big effort to involve him. They really do try and make him feel welcome and loved. He has parents who adopted him as a child and are still very involved in his life. I believe heâ€™s even living with them since his wife decided to separate from the relationship due to his depression. Heâ€™s been to medical professionals to be treated for his depression, but since Iâ€™ve known him, his depression seems to have gotten much worse. I feel helpless and torn about trying to do more, but with the amount of help heâ€™s received and continues to receive I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s more that anyone can do.
