WHY????whats the fucking point????

I'm 28. 

i've lost hope

its not getting better

i'm bad 

i'm sinful

i'm wrong

i don't deserve happiness after how i mistreated my boyfriend

i don't deserve life

i wish i fucking could end it 

i wish no one cared for me

or that i didn't have so much fucking empathy 

so that i cared that they cared for me 

fffffffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkk
