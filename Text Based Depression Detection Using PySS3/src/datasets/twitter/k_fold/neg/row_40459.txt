Not sure why I'm posting this.I'm a 26-year-old graduate student in a chemistry department in the South. I'm absolutely tired of everything, especially being alone. I lost my grandmother about two years ago and with her not being here, I no longer have anyone that gives two shits about what I'm feeling or about whether I live or die.

My family consists of a Mom and Dad who don't really bother to visit or make time for their only child. Their "caring" is just to financially provide for me, but the emotional and mental care that a parent is to demonstrate for their child is completely lost upon them. They really only view me as a means to an end, and that end is to pay for their retirement with my paycheck, or serve as a status symbol, so that they can brag about their son having a fucking doctorate).

My friends have all changed. I get mocked and/or bullied by them more than anything. They may think it's playful, but they treat me like I'm a fucking kid or as though I am a fucking dumbass. Some of my friends are dating, engaged, or are married and they frequently throw that shit in my face as if to gloat. My lab group members were people I considered friends once upon a time, but when I hang out with them or go to lunch with them, I get completely blown off or left out of their "inside" conversations.

As far as romantic relationships, there isn't a positive there either because every girl I've ever asked out or talked to has just flat out rejected me without giving me a chance. It is a girl's right to reject someone as she has her own standards for finding someone attractive. But out of all of the girls I've asked out, probability makes me feel as though one of them would consider me attractive?

I just feel terribly alone. I don't feel as though I have a family or friends or anyone that gives a shit about me anymore. Ending this makes me feel optimistic that I can at least see my grandmother again.
