Iâ€™m so done no one knows how much i careIâ€™m so done with life. I want out right now. I put so much effort into making sure all of my friends know  that i care and would do anything for them. I tell them everyday that i love and care for them. I make sure theyâ€™re ok and know they can always talk to me and iâ€™ll be there. I make sure they sleep well, eat well and on time, and know their value. and itâ€™s not just one friend itâ€™s ALL of them. I try to talk to all of them daily and check in to make sure thereâ€™s nothing i can do for them. AMD THEY DONT NOTICE. they even have the fucking nerve to say that they donâ€™t think i care about them at all. and itâ€™s not just one of them. itâ€™s most of them who say i act like i like other people more. i put so much fucking effort into people who ik would not do the same for me, and they donâ€™t even notice. A friend might be reading this rn and thinking itâ€™s directed at them. itâ€™s not, itâ€™s u and my boyfriend and the other two, and even more. It may seem like you bc of the timing but itâ€™s just collapsing in now. I think overdoes in my sleep would be the best way to kill myself. if i can find powerful enough pills i might just do it. Iâ€™m so tired of working hard with my grades, and people saying iâ€™m a try hard. Working hard for a body i want, and people saying it for guys when itâ€™s for myself. And SO FUCKING TIRED of working hard for my friendships, and ppl saying i donâ€™t care about them when i make it so obvious i do.
