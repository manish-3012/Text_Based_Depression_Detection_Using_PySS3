Everything hurtsI'm so mentally exhausted I'm not sure if I can even write much right now, but I'll try.

I'm tired. Mentally and physically. When I wake up the first thing I think is "oh not again." I don't want to get out of bed each morning. It's really hard to make myself do it.

My boyfriend left me. Well. He cheated on me, and when I confronted him he left and hadn't been back. I'm not even sure I care anymore.

I feel like I'm wasting away. Like I could just lay here and fade into my mattress. Sometimes I slow my breathing just to feel my heart trying to keep my alive. 

I have no family, no friends, no school councilors to talk to, nothing. I can't afford a therapist or anything either. 

I'm just here, but not here. I try really hard to pretend I'm happy, but I'm not. I feel like a zombie. My own body feels like someone else's. 

I just want to die and get it over with.
