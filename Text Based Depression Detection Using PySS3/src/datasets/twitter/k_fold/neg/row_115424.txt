Thank you guys so muchAfter i came back from the hospital having lived from my suicide attempt my family and I didnt really talk much so i just immersed myself into memes and video games .played a lot of overwatch during this time. Well i guess the reason i made this post was because im glad communities like reddit exist dont really have much to say except thank you. all of you beautiful redditors out there
