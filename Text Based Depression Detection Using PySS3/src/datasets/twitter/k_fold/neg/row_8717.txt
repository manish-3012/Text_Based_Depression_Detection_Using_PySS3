Those who observe, those who watch, those who know, those who stay and those who go, no one knows. Ignorance is bliss; knowledge is dangerous. Those who know are those who go. But, those who stay, it knows their goal. Ignorance, delusion and insignificance, they become unworthy pray.With knowledge, with authority. Money talks but the observers refuse. They who ignore become refused. 


Fucking wake up.
