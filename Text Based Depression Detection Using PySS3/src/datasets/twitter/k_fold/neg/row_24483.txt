An update from a thankful teenagerI doubt any of you remember me but a few months back I made this post:

A lot of shit has gone down since then but mainly I've realized what a POS my old friend always was, I acted vengefully and tried to get him expelled, which only made the situation worse but to be honest I don't regret doing it at all. I was in a really really horrible place that night so I really owe it to everyone that talked to me then. I've since been able to switch to a new school and start over with a group of friends I've known for a while.

Thank you all.
