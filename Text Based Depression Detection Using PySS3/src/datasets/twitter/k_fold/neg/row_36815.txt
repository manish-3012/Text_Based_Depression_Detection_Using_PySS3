51 and not sure I can take more of this.51, married with kids and recently unemployed again!  I am trying my best to stay positive and motivated but I am sinking and sinking.  Had to borrow money from FIL to pay for COBRA insurance because Illinois is 7 months behind on approving insurance for my kids.  I can feel the disappointment in my FIL's voice when he talks to me.  As though his daughter deserves better than this failure.  And she does and I am.  If I could plan the perfect painless suicide I would but I lack the balls.  I am venting and I know others have it worst than me but right now I just want to die.  My family would really be better off, weird to say that but I am too much of a burden.  Sorry for the rant, it's stupid I know.
