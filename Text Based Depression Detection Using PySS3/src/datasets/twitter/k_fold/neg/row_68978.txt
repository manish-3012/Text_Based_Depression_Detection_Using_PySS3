Not sure I can keep doing this...My wife of almost 12 years threw me out tonight. She won't let me see my 3 year old daughter or my 2 year old son. She's due to give birth to my other son in April, and said that she won't list me as the father on the birth certificate. I just can't live without my kids. I'm sitting in my car with a knife, and seriously thinking about ending it.

(I'm using a throw away so my wife doesn't show this to my children when they're older).
