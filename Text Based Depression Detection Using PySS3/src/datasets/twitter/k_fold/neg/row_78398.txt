Question regarding suicidal thoughtsHi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm posting on here because i'm unsure what to do. Occasionally, I get suicidal thoughts, maybe once or twice a week. I have only ever really considered taking my life once, and haven't done anything close to an attempt for months now. Yet, I still feel like these thoughts are unhealthy, and wanted to reach out to friends without feeling like a bother. I really don't want sympathy from them or to intrude on their lives. For example, one of my friends who I wanted to reach out to, works as a counselor, yet her wedding is in about a month and I don't want her worrying about anything other than her wedding (I want her to, ya know, be happy now). I really don't want to bother any other friends now too. I have had counselors to help with anxiety in the past, but not with this. I'm still conflicted, as I think this may just get better with time. I'm really unsure on what to do next.
