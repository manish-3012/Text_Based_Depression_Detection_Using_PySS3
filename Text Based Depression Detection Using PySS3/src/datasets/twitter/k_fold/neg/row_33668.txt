I keep wanting to slice myselfI keep geting too stressed out and the coking up, drinking, and then using it as an excuse to feel bad and cut myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Each time I've got closer to an actually letting a blood vessel bleed out, and talking about itdoesnt seemto help.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do?
