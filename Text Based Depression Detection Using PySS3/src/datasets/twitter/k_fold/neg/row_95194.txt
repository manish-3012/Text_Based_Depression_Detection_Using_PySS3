24M I'm so tired and I'd like it stopI'm tired of feeling this way. It's been a decade since the first time I thought of killing myself, at least 8 years since I started cutting on &amp; off and 2 years since I stopped but I started again. I'm tired and I just want it to stop. I want to feel better but i don't know what that'll mean for me in the long run.
I'd like to not have to think about any of this so I sleep. A lot. Its calm when I'm not here (if that makes sense)
I don't know why I'm writing this, I'd really just like it to stop
