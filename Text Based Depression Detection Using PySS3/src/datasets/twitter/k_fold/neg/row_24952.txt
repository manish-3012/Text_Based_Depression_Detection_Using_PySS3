I just needed to write that down because I can't sleepAll started with the my gf breaking up with me after 3,5 years. She never explained why or why she didn't talked about it before. The other day we cuddled and the next day she is ending it. Worst way to start 2020. That was just the beginning of a horrible year. Father has an alcohol problem and my mother just want to get rid of him but didn't do it because of my brother and me. This and many other little thing drive me crazy. I am afraid to don't finishing university. Now I think nearly every night about suicide. When it's daytime I don't have any bad thoughts or not often but at night I can't sleep. I think I'm pathetic that those little things fuck me up that much. I don't think that I would kill my self. I don't have the strength to do that because I'm a fucking piece of crying shit. But I already have a place to jump from. A tall building behind my old kindergarden. If I ever have enough of this life you'll find me there and if things keep getting worse I won't see 2021.

Just a whiny text from someone with no self esteem.
Sry for my bad English.
