I'm just sadI honestly don't know why I decided to post but I'm honestly really f-ing depressed. This school year has honestly sucked and I've blamed it all on myself. It's never going to get better because I feel like I've ruined the lives of those around me. I literally don't know what to do. I've contemplated suicide but i know that's not the answer. I really feel like I'm slowly going insane inside my own mind. I just wish all my problems could just leave ad everything could be the happy memories I remember.
