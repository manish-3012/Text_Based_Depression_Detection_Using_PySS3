Iâ€™m the next Elliot Rodgers.I whole heartedly believe nobody will like me unless I have washboard abs and all the money. I will most certainly kill myself and Iâ€™m saying this off the back of an awesome vacation. Therapy isnâ€™t helping. Talking to friends and family isnâ€™t helping. I just wanna tell the whole world itâ€™s a fucking cruel place and to kill itself so maybe more hopeful humans will inhabit it. I hate everything and donâ€™t wanna ho back to my normal cuz itâ€™s such a fucking shitstain.
