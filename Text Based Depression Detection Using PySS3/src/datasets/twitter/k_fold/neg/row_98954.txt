Tonight is the night.i was at work tonight and all i could think about was killing myself. iâ€™ve thought about it for almost every second of every day thinking about it, but all night iâ€™ve been telling myself iâ€™m going to do it. i got home and couldnâ€™t stop cutting myself and i donâ€™t have the stuff i need for my original plan and everywhere is closed so iâ€™m going to take 15 extra strength tylenol and end it for good. iâ€™m so sorry, i know nobody knows me, but i need to get it out. i canâ€™t tell my housemate.
