Everything is falling into place I feel at peace nowEverything in my life is falling into place now . I have broken up with my girlfriend , my parents  know I donâ€™t love them and theyâ€™ve turned against me , I have broken up with my long term girlfriend , I am on the verge of being kicked out my friend group as theyâ€™re too annoyed at me for being like this and me distancing myself , I am failing at education as Iâ€™m unable to think about anything other than killing myself everytime I hear anything involving death or heights or water or pretty much anything . There is only couple things in my life left which will soon be gone and then I can leave without hurting anyoneâ€™s feelings. This makes me feel at peace .
