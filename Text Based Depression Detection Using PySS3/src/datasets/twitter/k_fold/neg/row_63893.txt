I'm confusedMaybe I just have a lot of bad days in my life. But I'm confused. Why even when I I shouldn't want to die. I want to. I seem to be doing well. But now I am talking with a person who wants to commit suicide and I do not know how to help him. You know, I feel bad myself and I want to end I want to commit suicide. From my life, but I want to leave that person. Is it selfishness?What should I do? Maybe I should die? In order not to suffer, but what will happen to him then .. Now he blocked me and I understand that he will probably do it and I am very scared. If this one is dear to me  What should I do? Maybe I should die? In order not to suffer, but what will happen to him then .. Now he blocked me and I understand that he will probably do it and I am very scared. If this one is dear to me The man will die, then I will probably commit suicide. I have already had attempts, I will probably go with a suitable gas or something like that. I do not think that I will have someone who I care about. It will be ironic if i die on christmas as a child it was my favorite holiday ..
