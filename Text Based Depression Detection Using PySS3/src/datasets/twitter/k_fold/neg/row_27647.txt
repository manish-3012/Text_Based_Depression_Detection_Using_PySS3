Iâ€™m scared of feeling this wayLately my SO and I have been fighting a lot and every time we do the more I just want to end it. Not because of my SO, but because I canâ€™t fix anything. I feel like I just donâ€™t want to go through another day. 

Iâ€™m scared of my SO finding my body. Iâ€™m scared that they will end it if I do. Iâ€™m scared to hurt my parents and friends. I feel so fucking stuck. Like I canâ€™t die and I canâ€™t live.

Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m so scared
