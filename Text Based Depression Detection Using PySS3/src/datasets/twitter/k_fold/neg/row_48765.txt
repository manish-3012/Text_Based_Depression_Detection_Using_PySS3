Almost 30 and done with this crapIt seems like no matter what I do or try to accomplish something always comes up and I shoot myself in the foot. In 2016 I was at the end of a tech internship going into my senior year of computer engineering, when I found out that 15 y/o cousin of my dads wife was more of his personal fuck toy for the previous 3 years than his adopted daughter after all. How did I find this out? She started a relationship with me when she was 18 after fucking my dad for 3 years. I totally lost my mind and went over there and smashed the mirror off of his truck. Then I went to jail for three nights, pled down to 3 misdemeanors, now I am totally fucked with a criminal record and he hasnâ€™t paid shit for his crimes. And Iâ€™m scraping by and maybe gonna wind up destroying my credit and getting evicted while heâ€™s in the house on the hill. I havenâ€™t even been able to get that many interviews and I am so discouraged because I know even if I make it to an offer it will probably be rescinded after the background check. I am so fucking stupid and I have so many problems, the easiest thing to do is just end it. Itâ€™s been a long time coming and Iâ€™m turning thirty soon. I think Iâ€™ll take a dive off of the narrows that day.
