i think itâ€™s the only way out.iâ€™m in my first semester in college and practically failing every class. i have no idea what to do. i am genuinely trying my best. i took so many ap classes in high school to prepare myself for college. iâ€™ve spent the past three years of my life preparing myself to get to this point and now iâ€™m failing out of my major. i have no friends here and my friends back home have seemed to forget about me. i have an a eden if advising appointment to schedule my classes for the next semester in a few days but i donâ€™t know if iâ€™m going to live to see it. i think suicide is the only way out of this. iâ€™m backed into a corner with no direction.
