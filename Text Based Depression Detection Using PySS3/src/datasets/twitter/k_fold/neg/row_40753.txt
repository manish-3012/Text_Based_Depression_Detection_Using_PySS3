I want it to be overEverything in my life feels wrong and bad - if itâ€™s good I know it will be bad. I am doing my a levels, they are fine so far but I know the lack of effort I am putting in means I will get bad results and they will be pointless (not that I care anyway). My boyfriend is moving countries in 6 months - this is the amount of time I have left. When he is gone, Iâ€™m going to kill myself, I thought I wanted to have one more summer but I wonâ€™t be able to go on without him. Iâ€™m so sick of every day feeling the same and being alive, I just have to finish writing notes for everyone and then Iâ€™ll be ready.
