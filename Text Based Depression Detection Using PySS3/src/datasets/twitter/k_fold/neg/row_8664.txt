I can't even sleep anymore; I feel ever so close to ending it right now.I've been depressed for around six years now, since I was twelve and roughly around the time I found out I was gay. 

As the years have passed, it has just gotten worse; at this point all I feel is extreme anger, sadness, apathy and deep envy. I can't *sleep* anymore unless I've been up for twenty hours or more; when I try to sleep, or my mind isn't focusing very hard on something, my mind races *constantly*, going from one subject to another (religion, politics, history, medicine, bad life experiences, **so** many mistakes, envy, etc), so much so that my headaches are near-constant.

A couple months ago, just before I turned eighteen, I had to leave home with my family to move to a *very* small roadside town in the south. Ever since, my depression has gotten *very* much worse; now it is even harder to get to sleep, my mind races even more and I am just plain miserable. I simply cannot stand this place, everyone here acts like they want to slit my throat as soon as they hear my northern accent; everything is different (hell, their *crosswalks* are different). I miss my home and what few friends I had so fucking much; it's hard to not think of it, and even harder to not cry over it.

In a couple days I'll be getting my change of address so I can get an ID and start looking for work; I am agonizing over it since there are so few jobs in this small town, if I fuck up I could be stuck here even longer. I *need* out of this god forsaken hell hole.

Because of this move I've been royally fucked over; I was so close to finishing my third year of high school, but now I've lost an entire semester (and over 3/4 a quarter of hard work) *and* am considered a *year* behind. Back home, should I have passed this semester, I'd only need one quarter to finish high school. Now I have to go to a small town high school filled with hicks *and* graduate with people I don't know or like.

Even after high school, though, I don't know what to do from there; I am stuck here for at least fifteen more months to save up the money to move, and I don't know how or where to move to. With my marks, I can't go to college, but I wanted to try to get my RNC, but it is entirely impossible to work *and* go to college here since the closest college is over an hour away (hell, the closest *Starbucks* is two hours away); I wanted to move to Washington, but I don't know how to move across the states, nor how I could juggle full time work *and* trying to go to college.



I don't know what to do; my life is a wreck. I can't take another month here, let alone two more years just for the *chance* to move. Even then, my life will be filled with even more hardship; I've been poor my entire life, and now I am looking at complete poverty once again.


I was told my entire life that hard work would get you everywhere, but everything I've been through the past four years has proven that to be the largest amount of **horeshit** ever spoken.

My apologies if this is incoherent or all over the place (which it seems to be to me).
