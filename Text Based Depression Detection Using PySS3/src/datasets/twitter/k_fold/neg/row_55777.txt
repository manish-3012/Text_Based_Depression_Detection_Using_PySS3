letting goRecently i had to let another person that wanted to leave my life go. And I'm really tired of letting go. I don't even miss the people that have been a part of my life,  I'm tired because it keeps happening. I have different friends every 2 months, all my friendships last for a couple of months at most. Will it ever change? I want to have my own place in the world,  friends that don't leave and I can always talk to. It's extremely exhausting to change my environment all the time and be unwanted everywhere, people treat me like a toy they enjoy for a while and then abandon. I don't want to keep having to make friends. All I'm asking for is one person who would show me that there are still things to enjoy and live for in life, i can't overcome depression in complete solitude with no support system from other people. Tonight I'm feeling extremely suicidal  and helpless. I hope no one's going through the same thing as me
