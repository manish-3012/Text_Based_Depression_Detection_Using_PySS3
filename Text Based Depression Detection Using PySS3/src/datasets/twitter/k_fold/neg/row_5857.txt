It's such a calming feeling once you've made up your mindOnce the path forward becomes crystal-clear in your mind, it is such a calm, peaceful feeling.

I feel less anxiety right now than I've felt in over 15 years.  I feel like I could lie down and sleep like a baby.  The path forward is so clear now after the news I got this morning.  Any and all doubts have been washed away from my mind, almost like a baptism.  A rebirth.  A cleansing of the soul.

I can go now because it all really and truly is exactly how I thought it was.  It was never "just the depression talking" or "the lies of depression".  It was all the truth.

People just ain't no good, and we live in a world of shit.  Never, ever, ever put your trust and faith in another human being because that person is just as messed up in the head as you are.  The angel that you thought you found who was sent to rescue you from the depths of hell will always, ALWAYS, turn out to be another demon waiting to drag you down into hell.  People are cruel, and the only way to survive in this world is to be just as cruel.  And if you don't have a heart made of iron with no soul, this world just wasn't made for you.

It's all one big joke.  I hope I laugh right before it all goes black.  Because life is the funniest, sickest, cruelest goddamned joke I have ever seen and heard.
