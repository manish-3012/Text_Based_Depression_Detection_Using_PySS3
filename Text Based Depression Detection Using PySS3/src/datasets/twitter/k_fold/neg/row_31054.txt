23[M]On 2017 New years eve , I said I was going to commit suicide If I would still be single in the end of 2018.I'm so tired of being single. I've never had a girlfriend. All my friends have girlfriends , so they have very limited time with me , so I think I'm going to exit this crazy stupid world if I end up single in the end of this year.
