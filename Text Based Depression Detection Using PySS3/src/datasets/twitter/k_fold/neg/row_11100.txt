I am worthlessI am worthless and I don't know how to deal with that. My body is not correct and body matters more than anything. People look through me and for some reason I am never good enough. Other people, often with visible flaws, are good enough often, but I never am. So the problem is me, but years of trying to fix it only made me hate everyone because how could you not? I don't understand why life is so fucking unfair, and apparently I control everything in my life according to everyone who doesn't want to hear about it, but truthfully I am the most powerless person on the planet and an extremely pathetic example of what not to be. I don't understad, I don't understand, I don't understand. Why did I have to be different in all the incorrect ways?  It doesn't matter, nothing matters unless you have the right body and voice and mind, otherwise there is no pleasure ever it's just pain and shut up we don't want to hear it you failure just shut up and die already.

Why is human touch and pleasure only for some people and how the fuck am I supposed to deal with this? I don't want to die, but this problem is fucking unfixable and NOTHING ALBEIT NOTHING CHANGES THAT IT IS CONSTANT NO MATTER WHAT THE FUCK I DO&gt;  THE FUCK IS WRONG THAT I DON'T EVEN DESERVE A FUCKING TOUCH? THE FUCK, WHY IS IT **THIS** STRATIFIED, AND THEN YOU LIE AND TELL ME HUMANITY ISN'T VERY OBVIOUSLY EVIL.
