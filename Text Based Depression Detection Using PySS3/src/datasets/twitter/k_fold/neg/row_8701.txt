The future scares meI recently received an estimate for a few voluntary surgeries and they said the total could be as high as $50 000 without insurance since my insurance does not cover it. I can't afford this, I am already in debt from school and I don't make a lot of money at my current place of work... and I hate it here. All of the jobs that I can get with my current degree are in the world of business and I lost all interest in this field, so I am supposed to go BACK to school until I am 28 in political sciences... how am I supposed to afford this.

The state of the world is in such a balance, and with Russia and ISIS taking over more and more land (and, oh idk, hacking the White House) I feel that the world is ending as we speak.

I don't want to live through this at all, and I am hoping that I die very soon so I don't have to go through any of this, or see how my family goes through it... I have a gun with me at the moment (unloaded), and the thought is eating me up. please help
