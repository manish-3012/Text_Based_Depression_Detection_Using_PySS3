I don't think like a normal human being any more. Everything seems extremely hopeless and suicide feels like ultimate answer!I use suicide as an escape. I have been procastinating my study for 2 years. Everytime I fail,I just say to myself let's die!
I don't want to take responsibility for anything. My thinking is suicidal. If I get arrested? I will commit suicide, if I get scolded by my parents? Then suicide. For every situation of my life, suicide seems the answer. I don't think like a normal person anymore. If you fail, what will you do? Improve right?
For me, I will blame my parents for having low IQ and still breeding. Crying about how I was cursed and then cutting myself.
If something goes wrong, my first instinct will be "kill yourself", rather than let's face it or fix it.
