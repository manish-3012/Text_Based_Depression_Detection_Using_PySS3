OverwhelmedMy finances stress me out. My wife is depressed as fuck. My wife says she doesnâ€™t want to have sex because she feels she is too fat. Tells me that I would just fuck anything so what gives. This offends me as I feel she is beautiful and I try to show her how much I love and care about her yet it makes no difference. I have three children and my oldest is so wild and crazy that I donâ€™t want to come home from work. I have begun fantasizing about suicide and researching methods. I have begun considering what I would leave in a note. I have a great career and make a decent salary yet I am always broke. I feel like the cycle of life will never change and as I put forth more and more effort I still get the same result. Sadness. I am in graduate school and it is so overwhelming that I do nothing towards my studies. I have a test coming up in two days and I am beginning to panic. I think of dropping the class but I donâ€™t have the money to pay for the tuition I would have to pay back. Fuck. I would be leaving a giant mess for my family to clean up but I still feel like they would just consider it a temporary setback and life would go on without me.
