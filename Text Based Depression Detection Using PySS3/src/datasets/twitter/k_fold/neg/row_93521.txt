I know I'm young.... It's so cold in my chest.I've already attempted in the past, it was scary to feel numb and see people gather around my body, laying me on a stretcher.... I'll start from the beginning._x000D__x000D_I remember fights between my mother and father vividly. I always saw them through cracks in the door. I crawled into bed with my brother (he's 5 years older than me) so it wouldn't be as scary hearing my father break a door or punch a wall. _x000D__x000D_When I was about 6, my brother began.... Began touching me. He was 11 and he said it was okay for him to do this. I didn't think it was wrong so it continued. My father was a drunk so be would pass out watching some movie and I would go and put blankets on him. I saw what actors did to each other and it was similar to what my brother was doing. My mother saw me watching and said never to do that until I was older like them. But my brother kept doing it. I was scared to get in trouble with my parents so I kept quiet. My oldest brother brought my older brother into it too. This continued until I was 13 where my oldest brother got a girlfriend and left me alone. _x000D__x000D_All that time I became sexually active. I felt urges to do things with teachers, students, people in general. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I meant some friends one day outside of school in the forest. Being young teen boys they joked about sex and how many times they've done it. I couldn't stop myself and it ended with me and two boys having sex in the woods for months to come. _x000D__x000D_5-present I was always at the mercy of my mothers feelings. Some days she was angry and found any reason to hit me, some days she wanted to go hiking and if I protested she became angry. Almost every situation ended up her being angry. It wasn't until I was 7 I started acting out. I felt it was unfair for me to get hit with cords and belts for not doing something perfect. But she became angrier, I had bruises on my legs, back, arms and hands. She told me it was because I was a bad child I had to receive such punishments. My little sister (4years younger than me) always saw me being beaten. _x000D__x000D_I started being bullied when I was in 3rd grade. The kids thought it was weird of me to wear jeans and sweaters all the time. I would always have my body covered in school. I would cry when I got a B on anything which resulted in more teasing. My mother hated B's on anything. Every low grade I received resulted in the grade minus 100 hits with the belt. (100-85 = 15 hits) this led to panic attacks still in High school. Which brings us to this time period.
