COVID-19, being autistic and in an abusive home.Today I found out, despite being unemployed, disabled, and paying my taxes, I won't be getting any welfare money. Instead, by verbally and emotionallly abusive dad will get 1700 dollars.

I make 6K USD last year (for reference, the poverty line is 12K USD), and I wouldn't have got it had my dad had connections. My dad is the only reason I had a job, but this does not make up for the several years he abused me.

Right now I'm trying to talk myself out of trying to hit my head with a bat or slitting my wrists again. But it's hard when your country turns its back on people who needs this money the most.
