CuntsYou lot do realise that there are people whose lives are actual hell but you donâ€™t see them trying to off themselves. Just because you are alone doesnâ€™t mean you should kill yourself. It takes a few years if loneliness for what is potentially a lifetime of happiness. 

And donâ€™t say â€œyou donâ€™t know the pain I go thoughâ€ fam i tried to strangle myself with a dog lead, even writ a note said goodbye and all that stuff. But I stopped because I knew that even though life was shitty at that moment it would get better, it may takes months or years or decades but I know life will get better. So stop trying to end your life and just live it ffs.
