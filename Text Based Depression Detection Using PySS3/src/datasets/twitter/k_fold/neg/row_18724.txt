I want to call a hotline but I can't stop cryingI would use a throwaway but I can't be bothered. 

I don't know what to say. My situation is pretty tame and altogether very boring. But I need to talk to someone or I'm going to explode and hurt someone and I don't want to hurt anyone but myself. I'm probably going to skip my afternoon  classes.
