What should I do if a friend has said they are going to commit?They have told me they will do it on a certain date, and im going to try and convince them to not but if I dont succeed who do i call? How do crisis centres work? (Im in toronto). Im also scared that if I call the police they will never speak to me again. Are there any anonymous ways of doing it?
