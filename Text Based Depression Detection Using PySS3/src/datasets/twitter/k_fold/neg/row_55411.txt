Can anyone tell me what the point is?I'm supposed to have one semester of school left and then my thesis and I'm done, but this semester the whole world came tumbling down and I'm just done. I've spent the majority of my life depressed and I tried to use college as a ladder to happiness but it was a faulty plan. I don't want to do this. I skipped one of my finals yesterday, just sat through the next one staring at my paper, actually tried on today's final but got sidetracked thinking about how much I've failed at pretty much everything in life halfway through the test and ended up not finishing it, and then left campus feeling pretty much useless. I'm going to fail almost all of my classes this semester, I've reached out to a counselor but they're booked two weeks out, my parents are dead and my siblings look up to me but they're all either addicts or alcoholics and I feel like my whole life revolves around trying to fix them and failing, I can't find a job because nobody wants to hire students, and I'm two months behind on my rent and a month behind on all my other bills. On \*top\* of being depressed. I'm having trouble finding the point in continuing. I've tried to find friends and it hasn't worked. I tried to join a church and it was horrible. I try to reach out to family and it just turns into me giving them advice and nobody acknowledging me as a human.
