People donâ€™t make it any easierSometimes I find it hard to tell whether people put up with me out of pity or not. My mind wonders what they say behind my back and I worry I could lose those who I think to be closest with. I just canâ€™t seem to get the hang of social situations or really keeping anyone interested in me. Overall Iâ€™m a very boring guy Iâ€™m almost 17 and I donâ€™t have a life outside of school never been kissed, sits at home sleeps and plays vidya, basically the definition of a high school loser. At this point Iâ€™m starting to consider ending it but this isnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™ve considered it Iâ€™m just too much of a pussy to actually do it. I never get invited to anything nor does anyone start conversations with me, even people I consider friends. I donâ€™t have any reason to go on anymore if anything im the closest to suicide than Iâ€™ve ever been.  Iâ€™m dead weight for all those around me I can see that they donâ€™t like me at all which is a good thing because they wonâ€™t have to put up with me for much longer.
