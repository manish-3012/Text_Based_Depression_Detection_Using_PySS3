I don't know what to sayI've been diagnosed with Borderline and Depression about 2 years ago and i worked hard to change my mind and it worked. I found the love of my life and felt happy again but lately i feel like im on an downwards spiral into depression again. Life has been hard these last few weeks and in the last 2 years i always felt like i was still in power over the way i feel but that feeling is gone. I once again feel lost and it hit me like a punch in the gut and i just want to end it. At the moment my partner is the only thing that brings joy to my life but this feeling i had all these years ago is coming back. Just the feeling of emptiness and not beeing understood. I feel like a empty shell of a human being and have all those chaotic thoughts. It feels like i have a thousand negative thoughts and can't finish a single one so they all just are there with no real way for me to stop them and i can't take it anymore. I just want to hit my head against the wall to make it stop. I can't do anything against it and just feel like a complete nutcase. I don't want to feel like that anymore and just want to feel a distraction from it. In the past i used to cut myself and i have a really strong urge to do it again but i am afraid my partner will find out and think it's her fault (which it obviously isn't). Anything to make this mess in my mind go away. I don't want to wake up to another day to feel like this again and again and again. The worst part is that for those last 2 years it wasn't like this and now i know what i miss. The feeling of peace within myself but i can't seem to find my peace these days. I just cry and sob all the time when im alone. I don't want to die but living just took a big toll on me these last few weeks.
