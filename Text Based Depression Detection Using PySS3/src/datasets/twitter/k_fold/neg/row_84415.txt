Am I normal?At the moment, I wouldn't say i'm suicidal, but my whole life I have always fantasised about killing myself. I don't really know why, but it's something that crosses my mind occasionally and sometimes frequently. I guess I just like the concept of suicide.  Doing something "unnatural" which my body is telling itself not to do, but doing it anyways.  When I do die, I hope it is by my own means.  I just want to choose how I die.  I'm also not afraid of killing myself at a young age (i'm 18 btw) Maybe I'll choose to die when i'm in my 20's, or maybe in my 60's, I think i'll know when the time is right. I just would like to know if i'm normal and if many other people think this way too.  Thanks
