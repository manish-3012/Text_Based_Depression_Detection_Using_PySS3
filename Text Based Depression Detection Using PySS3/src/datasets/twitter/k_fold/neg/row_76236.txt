2 days from now...I'm not really looking for advice anymore. I just wanted to let this out. In 2 days I plan to hang myself. I hate myself, I was dealt a shitty hand in life and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of barely being able to function, I'm sick of not being able to sit in class without crying because everyone arfound me is so damn happy. I'm sick of seeing everyone succeed while I fall down a spiralling hole. I'm done I'll be happy when it's over, everyone is better off without me.
