Getting over someone lost the love of my life and for the worst reason we were forced to break up neither of us wanted too but it's been 4 weeks now and I dint even get a goodbye it was just a bad situation but she was the only thing that brought happiness into my life she was perfect for me and now I can't stop thinking about her every day every second it's in my mind she's in my dreams it's torture I had a really shitty life grew up in a very abusive house till I was 14 and my father shot himself in front of us then 15 came and my mother left without saying goodbye and now the girl I love it can't have Because her mom just decided she did not like me and forbidded me from seeing or talking her daughter this shit makes me want too die even more than before life just seems so meaningless I've been doing drugs to try and cope for awhile now but drugs aren't free and the happiness is only artificial and when you come back down your problems are still there lying stalking you like prey I feel like death is my last option I fan heat death calling my name there is no will to live left I think I should just blast my self and just get this dreary nightmare over with I'm not normal I never was I rember as far back to kindergarten thinking I'm not normal because of all the hellish nightmare my life has been
