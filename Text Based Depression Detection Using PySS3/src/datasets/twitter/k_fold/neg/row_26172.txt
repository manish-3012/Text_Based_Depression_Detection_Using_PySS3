I genuinely believe therapy can't help me, as it is too late and my problems are too developed. (read before trying to make me feel better)Honestly I don't know what to do any more. I am 17 now and have an extreme anxiety problem that stops be from expressing myself and talking to my OWN FAMILY (i fucking know right), sure talking to friends and strangers is fine, but when it comes to my family I am locked in a box that blocks communication and every time I try to break free from the box I instantly feel like complete and utter shit and I go back to being inside it, so that means that there is basically no way this will ever be cured. Also im 17 so its too fucking late anyway my brain has already developed haha. i dont know why i put haha because I feel like death inside and out. my life is a complete living hell and I cannot live normally. cant have friends round, incase they find out how i act like a retard around my family, cant even introduce my girlfriend to my parents. i wanna fucking die. oh and whats more NOBODY DOES SHIT ABOUT IT. i went to doctors, they referred me to someone else, who then said 'oh fuck we cant deal with that mess of a person' who referred me to someone else, I am now 63rd on a waiting list and have been waiting for about a year for therapy, all the while the clock is ticking as my brain develops (too late anyway). I will never get better, I may as well stop letting this condition control my fucking life and end it already.

please help
