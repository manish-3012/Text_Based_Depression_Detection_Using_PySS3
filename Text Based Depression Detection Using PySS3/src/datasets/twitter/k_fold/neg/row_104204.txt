I just want it to stopIm a 25 yr old female. Iâ€™m clinically depressed and have generalized anxiety. (diagnosed at 14) I was raped two years ago by a ex, Iâ€™m in crippling debt, and I have so much anxiety I canâ€™t work a proper job. Iâ€™m a opiate addict (itâ€™s the only thing that makes me happy) and Iâ€™m so unmotivated. I just want to die. I think about it everyday. Iâ€™ve tried all kinds of antidepressants. They donâ€™t help. Iâ€™m stressed out. I canâ€™t afford my bills and my car payment. My father just reminds me of how much of a disappointment I am everyday. He doesnâ€™t think depression is real ðŸ™„. I honestly just feel like a waste of space. Itâ€™s selfish of me to want to kill myself, but honestly I donâ€™t care anymore. I feel like people should be somewhat happy for me that Iâ€™m finally at peace and I donâ€™t have to suffer anymore. Idk.. Iâ€™m so close to giving up. The only thing keeping me alive is my dog. I just want to die and make the pain stop.
