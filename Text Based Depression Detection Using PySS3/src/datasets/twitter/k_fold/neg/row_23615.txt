Back againI really don't like posting on this reddit but last time it really helped me push on for a few weeks and I didn't come back to thank those who helped me out because I really don't like being here, it makes me feel like I have a dirty secret that I hide behind a poorly thought out username._x000D__x000D_I know I'm not going to kill myself because I worry about what I would leave behind, walking infront of a train inflicts my death on the driver, jumping off a bridge onto a motoway would affect others, you get the drift, but I don't want to be here anymore, I don't care about what happens after I die, I just want this bit to end._x000D__x000D_I have serious trust issues after being lied to by a female friend, and after a group of friends shunned me after finding out I was unstable, I only have one proper friend and I think the world of her, and would do anything to be more, but she's married, I always seem to be able to fall for the unobtainable, nothing in never in my favor, things just seem to get dangled infront of me and snatched away._x000D__x000D_I think the point here and I apologize for this being so long but, I want to just fade away, I want something bad to happen,to me, I want to die but don't have the balls to take it myself , my dream of getting married and having kids seems so impossible that I just know I will never settle down because I have spent my entire life being uprooted, maybe its a thing of nature, I know I'm not going to have kids so I'm useless to nature and my body is telling me to kill myself._x000D__x000D_I just don't know how to approach my depression anymore._x000D_
