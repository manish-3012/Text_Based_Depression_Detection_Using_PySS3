I think my brother is depressed and suicidalMy little brother has been threatening to kill himself. He says there is nothing good in his life and would like to end it. I have been trying to get my parents to take him to a psychiatrist but they just say that I shouldn't worry and let them raise their son. I don't know what to do about it and what to say to my little brother to make him feel better. (Sorry for possible spelling errors)
