I turn 30 todayand all I want to do is kill myself. the day started out ok and then something set me off and it ruined the whole day. I donâ€™t like to celebrate my birthday, and I kind of use it for a day of reflection. Itâ€™s also notoriously the day out of the year where my need to commit suicide is so strong. I feel like a fxcking loser. All I wanted to do today was go on a hike, get high, play some video games, work on my thesis, and just relax. Instead Iâ€™ve cried a bunch of times, raged until my throat hurt, and Iâ€™ve locked myself in my room and nobody understands that I just want to be by myself. Iâ€™ve been alive for 30 fucking years and I regret every year of it.
