Everyday is Groundhog dayAt first it was ok, I understood the need of routine.

Then I realised I was the only one to stay at the same place.

Everyday I tried to fight harder and harder to go where I'm supposed to be. I took all the initiatives I could with my friends, my loved ones to get out of this neverending misery. I even got the bright idea to call my doctor to change my meds.

I got numb, I got tired. Now I'm just tired, repeating the same things without hope. The pain is just too terrible for me to handle. Anyways, everyone I know has progressed to much for me to be useful. This pain is not just in me, it's a whole part of me and I can't get rid of it without getting rid of myself.
