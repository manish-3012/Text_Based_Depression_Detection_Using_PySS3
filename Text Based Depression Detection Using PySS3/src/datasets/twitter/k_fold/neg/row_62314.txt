Suicidal desiresI have been thinking about suicide since I was 16, and have recently decided that the circumstances of my situation would require more effort than is possible to salvage, I feel it is best that I kill myself, but recently I've been so depressed that even suicide seems like a waste of time, still selfishly I don't want to be here, I just don't want to have to go through it, it's not that I feel entitled to anything, including an early death, its just I am in constant pain all the time, and i know how reality is, and I just don't want to do it anymore.
