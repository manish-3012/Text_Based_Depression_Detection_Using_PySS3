I can't do thisI think this is my breaking point, people have said it gets better for years and yet it still hasn't and I doubt it will, I just don't think there's a reason to stick around anymore. I don't care about anything I have no motivation to do anything I've spent days in my bed. I've barely eaten or slept. Ending it here just makes sense to me. None of the meds work, there's no one to talk to and I have nothing to live for.
