My boyfriend is only kind to me when I pretend to be happy.If my suicidal depression shows through, he becomes cruel. Not physically. Just very cold, condescending, and invalidating. This morning when I was expressing to him how something he said made me feel, he told me to stop making things up and that the things I was saying were â€œunbecomingâ€ of me, and all in my head. He knows I am suicidal but doesnâ€™t really seem to understand the seriousness of it...at all. Frankly, I feel he doesnâ€™t believe me. He doesnâ€™t seem to care about my feelings. I am trying to hold on but I also want to take all of my pills and just end it. My support system is non-existent. I feel so fucking alone.
