Iâ€™m having suicidal thoughts dailyI know this may not sound like that big of a deal but every day I just wanna kill myself. Every day I just wish I could die. Iâ€™ve stopped wearing my seatbelts in cars hoping I crash, Iâ€™ve stopped eating. I just canâ€™t stand being lonely like I always am. Multiple people at my school bully me, when I told the girl I had a crush on she said I was ugly and blocked me. I just have nothing to live for and nobody would care if I killed myself. Which is what Iâ€™m gonna do becuz I have no reason my family hates me and doesnâ€™t care me. My only coping mechanism is drinking and drinking tastes terrible and hurts my throat and I just donâ€™t wanna live anymore. Goodbye to u all I know u donâ€™t care anyway.
