Sleep paralysis and suicideI have always been suicidal and always had sleep paralysis with mostly auditory hallucinations. Usually the hallucinations make me afraid to die because I start to question my belief that nothing happens when you die. This year I started having these SP hallucinations where I would breath in some evil ghost like thing and I could feel it residing in my brain. Right away I began having headaches and feeling really hopeless and depressed like this thing consumed parts of my mind and I failed this quarter in senior year college biochemistry. Anyone else experienced something like this? Feeling like someone is draining your life/mind from you? Now I don't even care, if there was really a ghost thing sapping my life, I say go ahead and take it. I never wanted to be here anyways, the one thing I always wanted is to stop being alive.
