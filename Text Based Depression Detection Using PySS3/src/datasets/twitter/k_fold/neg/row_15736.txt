Phobias and mental health worries too strong.My hypochondria triggered a manic episode a few days ago, and I can't see a doctor for the problem I'm anxious over until April 16th. I've lost 6 lbs from not eating, I can't sleep for longer than 3-4 hours, and I'm getting all the other fun side of agitated mania with soaring levels of anxiety and fear + delusions and hallucinations. 

I'm so terrified. My body is tense all the time. I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday out of manic frustration and energy with the notion that I was going to die soon. The worst part is I don't even know if my death will be a suicide or from my own body. I'm just scared, scared, scaaaared all the time. Massive panic attacks are becoming the norm for me and I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it April 16th just to quell what might be a minor issue. The mania isn't helping.

My therapist highly recommended I go to the ER/psych hospital if my symptoms become strong again, and I can feel that tonight is going to be a very hard night, but I don't think I have it in me to ask the person around me for help when it's midnight and they're aware I lose my shit over small things due to severe anxiety.

Thanks for reading. I know to them and everyone else I just look like a neurotic girl that's crying over spilled milk, but it feels like the end of the world to me.
