Life fell apart.  Giving up.My life fell apart in a very short time frame.  Donâ€™t know what to do.

A year ago, I was a confident young woman with great friends, a nice apartment, a wonderful job and outstanding university grades.

Skip to now.  I have no friends (ditched me when I started dating bf).  I broke up with my boyfriend, who cheated and gave me an STD (now forever alone).  My parents are divorcing.  I lost my own home, now renting a dive apartment in a bad part of town.  Lost my job due to downsizing.   I went from having the highest GPAâ€™s in university to having a poor academic standing because I failed this semester.  My plans for graduate studies are over.  I dont know what to do with my life now.  Thereâ€™s no way out.

Help me.  Please tell me why life is worth living.  Why I should go on.  I need something to cling to.  Anything.   Please.





**EDIT**:
Holy shit.  I seriously owe you guys my life.  Last night was very bad, I was in a real dark place - I had completely given up on life.
But you made me realize it's not about "things" or "status", gave me practical advice, and reminded me that I will come out of this.  You gave me hope.  
I decided to take a sleeping pill and go to sleep instead of doing something rash, and I'm alive today, with a new perspective on things.   I know life sucks right now, but I don't need to end it to get through this (really, really) rough patch.

All because of you guys.
