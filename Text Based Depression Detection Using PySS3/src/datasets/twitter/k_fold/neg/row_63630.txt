I don't really know where to start with what will no doubt end in some kind of epic rant about my own failings, but what I will say is that I know this part of our community has helped a **lot** of people in the past and due to the season is *incredibly* busy with lots of people wanting and needing someone to talk to about their lives.  I honestly don't know if I have it in me to do anything seriously like, say... kill myself.  I spend more time helping other people than I do considering my own problems, which is probably a good thing.    Hell, in the time it's taken me to write this much I've recieved a text message from a friend who lives nearby who has just fallen *extremely* ill and needed my help for around 30 minutes and I just got off the phone to another friend who called me in tears talking about a rumor they heard._x000D_

It's an old story, I know.  **The guy who's there for everyone but nobody's ever there for them.**  Everytime I've tried to explain my problems to someone or just generally vent it always ends with *them* telling *me* their problems before I can finish my first sentence.  Besides this social '*wall*' that seems to be closing around me I've become stuck in a job I **hate** with bosses that are trying *very* hard to make me quit.  My bosses can't fire me directly thanks to a handful of coworkers saying that if I was fired then they would walk away from the job too, since I do more actual work than most people there and I do it pretty well.  The only issue I can think of that would make the upper management of where I work despise me so much is the same reason most of my teachers at school disliked me and that's because I get my work done quietly, quickly and decently and then basically run out of things to do, so to them it always looks/looked like I was never doing anything, even though they had all been told otherwise.  One of the main causes behind me finally submitting here is knowing that for yet another year my Christmas day will involve me waking to an empty house, getting dressed and going to work while pretending to be cheerful to the customers who will *all* say the exact same thing: "*Well, it's tough luck working on Christmas day, but someone has to do it.*"_x000D_

I did try to get a better job through studying a while back and did at least get a better offical education than what I had formally, even if I didn't learn anything new.  I was planning on following this studying through to university, but I was told by my father that it would be a waste of time because I'm '*...too old...*' for more schooling (I'm **21**) and that I'd probably '*...just fail it, anyway.*'  Nice guy, I know.  The few chances I've had at bettering myself I've managed to screw up,  mostly due to a lack of **self-confidence** and **self-respect**.  I lost both of those thanks to always having all my plans ruined by outside forces in one form or another._x000D_

Anyway, the main reason I'm here is that as a result of working a crappy job I can't afford to leave and generally being screwed over by my employers and my own family, as well as my own ineptitude, I don't feel like I can do anything anymore besides be a mindless '*zombie*' all the time.  I get up, go to work, come home.  Rinse and repeat.  The one outlet I used to have was my martial arts training, but after over a decade of that I can't afford to attend any longer.  I'm just **so tired** of seeing people I knew in school, who were total idiots, getting $60,000 a year jobs in positions I'm at least partially qualified for, unlike them.  They get ahead just because they know the right people and they'll openly admit it.  I **hate** seeing people I know get paid *almost* as much I do for working, just to sit at home and play *World of Warcraft* because they have a slight back pain that comes on once every few months and the government in my country sees no problem with this.  I just can't be bothered with anything lately.  I've even had a few offers of random, meaningless sex in the last months from a few women I know and I can't even be bothered with that._x000D_

I don't know what I'm hoping to gain from posting this.  Maybe I just needed a way to vent.  If you've stuck with this post so far, **thank you** for reading the biggest epic tale since *The Iliad*._x000D_

Just... *thanks*, for being a great community and helping those who feel helpless.
