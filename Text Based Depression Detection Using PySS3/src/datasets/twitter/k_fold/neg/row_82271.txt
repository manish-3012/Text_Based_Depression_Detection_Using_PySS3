I just realized something really depressingMy whole life I've been so depressed only cats make me feel actual joy.

Yah, i have had fun and laughed and felt happy. But the only tone i feel generic joy(no suicidal thoughts or pain, more than just a thin half hearted smile on my face), is when i have a cat. It makes me feel so much joy. And being that i don't usually feel that good, it just makes me feel even happier. Idk what I'm gonna do without my precious kitty! She's really old and may not last too much longer in as good of health she's in. I think I'm gonna finally kms when she's gone.
