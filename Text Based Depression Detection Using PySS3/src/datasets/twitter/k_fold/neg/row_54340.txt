I just want to walk until I can't anymore.Me and my wife got into it last night. A reminder of all my failures and shortcomings. She wants us done and over. That means losing my son(he's 2), my job (I work in her families business) my house and my only family is on the other side of the country(america.) I don't want to lose my son. I don't want to lose my wife. We don't have much and what I could take I won't so my son can still get taken care of. I'm worried about her because of her medical problems and that makes me worry about my son's well being. But I can't fight anymore. It's finally clicked that I'm a failure. That I'm not someone people like. I don't want to be an embarrassment to my family by moving back in with my parents. I don't want to be away from my kid. It would just be best for everyone if I just disappeared. Let everyone just forget about me.
