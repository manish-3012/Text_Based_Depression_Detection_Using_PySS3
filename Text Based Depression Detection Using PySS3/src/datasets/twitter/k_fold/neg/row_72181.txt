I was saved by the random subreddit generator.I meant to put this up a few months ago, but right now is fine. I was just looking at random subreddits, one by one going along, cars, trees, etc. Then I came upon this one. I decided to check it out, and that was the right decision. I've been going through a lot of tough times lately, whenever I'm lonely which is very often, I start to think of what I could have done, or should do with my life. Then start getting more and more depressed each time. Almost everyday I look at this to know that you guys do care sincerely and aren't doing it for fun. I don't have time to chat, though I just wanted to tell you of what I accomplished. Sorry if this post isn't good
