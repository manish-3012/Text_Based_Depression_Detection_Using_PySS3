If living a life is already a miracle. Where did my misery come from!?Sound of rain, walking on a grass field, or just petting an animal used to bring me so much joy, and the crazy thing happened. I GREW UP

The though of suicide has been with me for the longest time ever, that crippling anxiety is slowly stripping my soul away. I canâ€™t deal with the thought that Iâ€™m an mere mortal that canâ€™t change anything in the world.

I have lost the ability to communicate with people , to help people, to live in other peopleâ€™s story. The pure loneliness is quite addicting as I am so used to being myself.

I remember the moment I told my mom about the dystonia diagnosis. ( a movement disorder just imagine Darth Vader is using the force to stop my movement) my momâ€™s initial reaction was that where did I get the fake pills to lie to her. I loled in my heart as I lose faith. I am just never the son that can feel all their vain.

Few reasons Iâ€™m still alive is that my cute little nephew is born. Watching this little innocent angel getting corrupted by my crazy family certainly isnâ€™t very fun but witness the simplicity of pure joy does teaches me so many lesions . Iâ€™m really exhausted ....
