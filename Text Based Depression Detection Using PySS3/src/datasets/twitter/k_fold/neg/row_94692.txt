No one needs me anymoreI donâ€™t have any friends, Iâ€™m terrible at my job and could be easily replaced, and now my parents hate me. If I died right now it would take at least a week for someone to notice. All I do is suffer, so why not end my pain now? I wouldnâ€™t be hurting anyone. If anything, Iâ€™d be helping because no one would have to deal with my stupid problems anymore.
