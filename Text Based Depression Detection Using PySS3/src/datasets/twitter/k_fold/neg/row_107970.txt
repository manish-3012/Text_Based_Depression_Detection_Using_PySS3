Im going to hang myself todayI cant go on any longer in this life. Ive lost everything i care about. in the last 10 years, ive lost my kids, then my wife cheated on me and left. I havent been able to do anything but cry. ive chosen to hang myself today. ive been thinking about i for weeks now. my wife told me shes not coming back.

I loved her so much. i just wish shed come back. but she told me shes not. shes all i ever cared about after losing my kids. I thought we could work though anything. but the mistakes i made were too big. I hurt her so bad. I wish i could have been better. I wish i could have just been more understanding. Ive written my letter and hung my rope. i hope she understands after im gone. I love you erica. Im so sorry
