Tried drowning myselfWhile my dad was watching TV and my brother still sleeping, I was there, inside the bathroom, breaking down. Before that happened, I was having lunch with my parents and my dad lectured me about "Happiness" and what it should be and just how to be happy. My mind was blank and he was asking me something, I answered him back and didn't like my answer. He asked if what'll make me happy, I said that I don't know, maybe death, maybe when I don't feel pain anymore. I gave him more answers and still didn't like it, he said he's gonna slap my face if I don't answer correctly. **HE'S GONNA SLAP BECAUSE HE'S NOT HEARING THE ANSWER THAT HE WANTED TO HEAR** I thought that was messed up. I was giving him hints that I'm depressed and clearly, he doesn't see that Just because I'm the goofy one around the house. &amp;nbsp;

He even told me that I'm gonna suffer while I'm living under the same roof as him &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I've been thinking of ending my life these past few months and this is not my first attempt ending it. But I think the next time I break down, I'm surely gonna end it.
