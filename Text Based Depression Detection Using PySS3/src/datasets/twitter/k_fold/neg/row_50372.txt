chronically suicidal &amp; brokeni've been lurking /r/suicidewatch for a while now, too messed up to post or help anyone else going through hell.. thank you to everyone who's been brave enough to reach out and those supporting each other, although i'm still planning to ctb, it's somehow comforting to know others can relate.

warning long rant to follow..

i guess the main reason i want to die &amp; think i should is because of how fked my mental health has become; last year everything in my life imploded, during a manic/ slightly delusional phase i quit my job, my debt grew into a mountain and i was facing eviction.

i could deal with these things until suddenly i couldn't, November i sank into severe depression and was barely functioning, i put job interviews on hold, went to see a Dr and tried to sort myself out..

it hasn't gone well..

since then i tried to end my life 4 times and been in psych ward twice for suicidal idealation. completely unable to get my shit together enough to even consider work etc, developed crippling anxiety to go alongside the depression, ended up moving to another city to live with my sister and now my mind is such a mess i can barely string a coherent sentence together..

i've slowly isolated myself and ghosted all my old friends and other family as i feel completely unable to interact with people like i used to (they're better off without me in their lives &amp; i'll be gone soon anyway), i have zero self esteem left, i feel like a failure and a waste of space, i should die, i need to die.. 

i've been here for almost 2 months now and haven't improved much, i'm a horrible person and lying constantly to hide how suicidal i still am.

my suicide now feels inevitable, the only reason i'm still alive is because i don't want family to find my body and i can't find a good enough jump spot near by, but i can't keep stalling forever, it's getting more and more tempting to jump from the 4th floor i have access to (i know not great odds)
