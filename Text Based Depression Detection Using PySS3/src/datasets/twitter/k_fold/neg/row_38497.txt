I will show them soon, that I was not just seeking put attention.First of all. I am a 29 year old man. Several family members of mine know that I am suicidal, and that life is now longer worth loving for me. They all just think I am; self centered, selfish, and hungry for attention. I am none of those things. I just want to die, and I will be dead as soon as I work up the nerve to finally end this nightmare. I was first extremely suicidal about 6 years ago. Over the years I kept telling myself, things will get better, eventually the pain will go away,and I will find friends, and maybe find a woman that will put up with my ugly, idiotic self. Well not me of that happened. The only positive thing about my life is that I do have a decent paying job, that I usually enjoy. My life is honestly not worth living. People are disgusted by me. I try to connect with people, but they lose interest in me quickly. I feel like an alien, or something. Life is for normal, looking, and acting people. Not only freak like me. Anyways, I will show everyone soon, that all I ever wanted was to no longer exist.
