I just found out a friend of mine died by suicide.She and her husband died earlier this year. I had no idea until now, and her own mother told me today, and that it was by suicide.

It feels really, really strange. I strongly believe we should be allowed to take our own lives if we're suffering badly enough, and that no one else should have a say. My body, my life, my choice.

But I can't help but wonder if there was something I could have done. I definitely know I could have been nicer to her, or reached out, or something. She pulled away and evebtually unfriended me, and I took that personally and didn't bother reaching out to patch things up. I also knew she had struggled before (with drinking, with depression, etc.) and I feel like I should have been more present for her and maybe it would have made a difference. Maybe it wouldn't have.

But I'm trying to process this, combined with my own constant desire to do the same.
