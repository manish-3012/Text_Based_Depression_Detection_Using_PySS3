The world is shitty and I have only two options.1. Get massive medical debt even with insurance If i want therapy which prices are now $200 per session in my area.

2. Lay down and die, that's it.

I'm sick of people believing that diet and excercise fixes everything, it doesnt. I worked out every day for 2 months and was on a diet and it didnt work. All it did was make me feel even more insecure and make me skip meals.

Everyone knows this world is shit, if not now theyll figure it out later. "Life isnt fair", people say that constantly like it's supposed to make me feel better, It makes me want to kms more!
