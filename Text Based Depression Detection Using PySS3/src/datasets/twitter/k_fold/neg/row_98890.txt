An aquaintence of mine on Facebook posted these disturing messages on his wall(read inside). What should I do?He wrote:
"I think I will kill myself." &amp; "why is it all a joke????????????????? it is not.  Bye. "

I hardly know this guy, met him once, but when his posts popped up on facebook it really hit me. Would it be weird for a near stranger to message him or am I reading into this words to much?
