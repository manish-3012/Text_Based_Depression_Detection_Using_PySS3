I'm 23, I don't want to but I'm worn outIm emotionally broken, lack real connection to anyone. Ive had a complex upbringing and suffered a lot. Been depressed for 4 yrs. Haven't been able to work or meet anyone or pursue anything. Live a hermits life of suffering even though that isn't me. I just wish this was all a dream. In a sense it is. I've learned about spirituality. I understand the truth with my mind but Im stuck in this state. The thought of my family being ripped apart by my death breaks my heart. I dont know why im ramlbing on. Im crying. This feels pathetic. 

My mind is stuck in a broken state
