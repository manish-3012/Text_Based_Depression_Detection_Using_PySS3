Iâ€™ve spent the last twenty minutes looking up suicide methods and I found the one Iâ€™m going to use19 year old F.
Iâ€™ve been feeling super hopeless like my life wonâ€™t change and I genuinely hate myself and see no need for living anymore.
I was thinking about getting an Airbnb with a garage and leaving the engine running with the garage door closed.
But I found the perfect way to die. I finally feel so at peace.
