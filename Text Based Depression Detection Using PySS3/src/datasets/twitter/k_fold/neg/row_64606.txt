Iâ€™m sorryI finally decided I was going to do it last night. I almost did it the night before but my ex checked up on me and called both the police and my best friend so I couldnâ€™t. I lied to the cop and told him I was okay and the cop told my ex. 

My ex then accused me of trying to manipulate him into taking me back and told me he wasnâ€™t going to talk to me anymore. 

I canâ€™t live without him in my life. I made him such a part of me it felt like I was losing everything. 

So I did it. I overdosed last night. But here I am... still alive because I didnâ€™t take enough. I feel so sick and I canâ€™t walk and I just want it all to stop. I went to sleep hoping I wouldnâ€™t wake up. 

I feel like such a bad person. I just want everything to stop. Iâ€™m so pathetic and everyone would be better off without me. I know I can do it. I can just take more. But I promised I wouldnâ€™t do it and I feel so guilty that I tried and failed
