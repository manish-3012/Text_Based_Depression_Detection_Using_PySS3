I've decided to end my miserable life today.This may come off in a cheesy way but ever since I broke up with my High school girlfriend, I've never been the same person I was and I have never been able to communicate or spark a conversation with any girl properly. I get curved every time I do make an attempt and each trial only makes me more nervous and anxious for the next. I consider myself to be a genuinely nice person but, yesterday was my very last attempt and I've embarrassed myself to the limit. It's been 5 years since and the problem only gets worse. 

My friends have stopped talking to me as they think I'm avoiding them but in reality I'm only avoiding myself from making a bigger embarrassment of me. I've got no one to go to or talk to about my self esteem and I'm very emotional when it comes to these things and yesterday only made me realise I'm just another useless, waste of human matter, who's got no hope in reality or life. 

My parents are too busy with their construction business and they hardly have time to listen to my problems, adding on to this matter is the fact that I'm their least favourite child, unemployed and goalless. My only company is my cousin brother, who upon revealing my plan to end my life tonight, suggested me to make a post on this page. Now I doubt any of you would read this but I'd really like to know what kind of scope I honestly have for the future. All the "There's definitely someone perfect out there who's waiting to meet you" crap is pointless to say as I've lost my faith in it, given the number of people I've talked to.
