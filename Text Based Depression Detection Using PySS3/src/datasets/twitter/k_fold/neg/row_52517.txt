I don't know how much longer I can hold oni've always felt a constant feeling as i will never live a happy life, i've grown up thinking i would never make it past 18. i've had depression for years now, my cutting started around 2-3 years ago. i just want to leave this world, i was placed here without a purpose. the only thing that kept me from suicide was my parents, but i've lost that feeling of guilt if i were to end my life towards them and i'm so scared. i am only here for an online friend i met a year ago, but we cant even talk now without arguing. our friendship will end soon, and that's when i'll end my life. i have tried receiving help but it's all the same bullshit, i don't want to live in this world. school is really making everything worse, i get bullied by both teachers and students, i have nothing to live for.
