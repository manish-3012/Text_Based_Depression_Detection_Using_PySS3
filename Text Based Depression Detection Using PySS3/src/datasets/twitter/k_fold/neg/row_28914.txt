so frustrated that i canâ€™t do what i want to my own bodyI canâ€™t self harm, because other people donâ€™t like it
I canâ€™t kill myself, because other people donâ€™t like it 
Iâ€™m not in control of my life, the only way iâ€™d ever gain control is if I killed myself. I have nobody to talk to, it doesnâ€™t matter because talking doesnâ€™t even help when youâ€™ve been suicidal for 5+ years. It hasnâ€™t gotten better, I donâ€™t think it ever will. For some people, it gets better, for others like me it wont get better. I canâ€™t live my life how I want to so why should I even be alive
