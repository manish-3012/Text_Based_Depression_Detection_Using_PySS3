I cant help but i feel like this Why am I alive? Because dying isnâ€™t easy. On top of that, it is illegal.  You know both your parents really donâ€™t care. They are taking care of you because you were born and they canâ€™t give up on you.  You donâ€™t have friends.  You donâ€™t have people who love you.  You donâ€™t see your career or love life heading anywhere.  Sometimes you are the just extra weight on earth and it wonâ€™t really matter if it loses few kgs.  Every time I think of saying Goodbye, I donâ€™t know how many people Iâ€™ll be leaving behind. Maybe Iâ€™ll miss a few things, like Game of Thrones ending, my best friend, few more things I donâ€™t see daily. I might never read a good book again, Iâ€™ll never see my next favourite movie, I wonâ€™t listen to my favourite songs anymore. It was somewhat my reason to say, now they donâ€™t look good enough. So many things, so many Goodbyes.  Just like Ross said, because it is difficult to say Goodbye to so many people, Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye, Itâ€™s physically impossible.  When I think of gulping down few medicines, I wonder if I donâ€™t die I canâ€™t explain why I did that. Lack of love doesnâ€™t sound convincing enough.  If I jump off my roof and survive with a broken leg, I donâ€™t it will look better than this.  I canâ€™t cut my wrist, I am afraid of seeing my blood.  Just like anything to do in my life, I need the motivation to die. Some push and it will be easier. My mind is already playing weird games with me.  Every time I talk to someone, they assume I have seen nothing, they have had it worse. Yes, I didnâ€™t see much but I canâ€™t even handle this. I am not smart, I am not confident, I am not talent and now I canâ€™t even handle life.  I donâ€™t know why I stopped sharing, I have no idea who I can share things with. I just need to be at peace but I canâ€™t even do that without thinking about everything.  Itâ€™s tough when you have too many friends and still, you canâ€™t reach out to anyone. And I donâ€™t think I am a bad person who deserves this, I maybe donâ€™t belong here. I donâ€™t look like someone who would have suicidal thoughts, I am someone who would help people at night because it feels better.  I donâ€™t want to be remembered as some coward who gave up. I wish I donâ€™t have to do this, I wish a bus would help. I swear I wonâ€™t be useless, I am willing to donate whatever is useful of me.  I am not depressed, I just have suicidal thoughts. I am cranky and mean lately and I donâ€™t really like being in this body doing such things. I wish it gets over and I start acting mature and my responsibility.  Or I wish it just gets over.
