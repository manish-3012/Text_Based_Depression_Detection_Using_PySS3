WhyWhy should I live? I hate everything and everyone. Maybe it starts with myself but what's even the point. At this point my only reason to live is to pay back the debts I owe and to help my grandmother in her final days. Once she's gone and I've made enough to not screw over the one person who seems to have ever cared I'll be square, what's the point after that. I don't like me, no one else does, why keep wasting time?
