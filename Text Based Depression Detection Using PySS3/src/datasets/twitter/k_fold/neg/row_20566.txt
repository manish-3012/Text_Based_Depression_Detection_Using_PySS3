Past episodes, things better, but still tipsy. Seeking experience/advice.So I've had the thoughts from time to time, I only ever made a plan once but thankfully an internet friend talked me through it, and let me release so much held pain.   

I should of sought professional help then, but as I feel myself teetering recently I just would like to get some advice on a type of psychiatrist, what I should expect with prices, if insurance is truly required, etc.

I finally came over one big hurdle that was destroying me, and finally came out gay to my parents(well one parent, not sure if they told the other yet) and a cousin who was blown away, but quite loving in their response.

I'm 29 and single.   Mostly I would like to know what a session might run me.  I don't have insurance (cheapest I could find was $280 a month and that just isn't happening at my current job). 

So has anyone else went the cash route? Is it feasible?

Thanks for you time.
