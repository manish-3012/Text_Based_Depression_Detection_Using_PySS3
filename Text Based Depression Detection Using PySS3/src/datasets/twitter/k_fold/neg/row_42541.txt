I still fear death, and I have no idea what is after itI can't stand this life a single day more, but I still fear the nothingness of death.

There is a giant wall dividing my past and my future. There is my past on the left of the line, my present in the middle, and nothing on the right. Nothing at all. Just a giant wall right after my present, marking the moment of my suicide. And then, obviously, nothing else at all. Just an empty void of nothing and more nothing. There is the wall in front of me, but nothing behind it.

I tried to kill myself days ago but before losing consciousness I panicked and cried like a maniac. I was scared. I can't stand this life anymore, every single moment is pure pain. But I fear disappearing, I still feel terrified of the nature of death.

It's so hard to do it. I will try again, and see if I'm brave enough.
