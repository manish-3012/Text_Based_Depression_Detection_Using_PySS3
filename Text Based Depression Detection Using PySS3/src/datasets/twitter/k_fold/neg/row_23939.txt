I'm sad and scared and I just want to talkthis is so stupid and I know it's stupid but I have been in a really bad place the past week and I just want to put it into words

I don't even know how to explain it without sounding insane. I'm twenty two years old and I still don't feel ready to be an adult. I miss being fifteen and having my mistakes forgiven and I actually miss being told what to do and how to live my life. I just want to start over. I feel so old and I don't know if it's just anxiety about "the real world" or what but I've I can't handle it. I still live with my parents which is a source of shame for a lot of people my age but I can't imagine moving out anytime soon. I can't even get myself out of bed most days I don't think I could take care of a house. my family doesn't mind me being here and in fact I think they would be sad if I left. Maybe if they were pressuring me to move out I would. 

it's a type of sadness that time doesn't cure. I'm only getting older and it's only getting worse. I don't know whats wrong with me.
