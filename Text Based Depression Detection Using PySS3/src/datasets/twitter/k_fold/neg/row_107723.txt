Sorry.I want die and I just wanted to tell someone that I was actually here. I was actually conscious. loved and cared deeply. I'm really sorry I want to leave people I could have helped behind. I'm exhausted and utterly burnt out and my nerves are shot and my brain doesn't function anymore. I'm actually not really here anymore. It will be as if I never existed because nobody knows me at all... even the ones I love and are now gone. Even the ones I love right now and who are still here. I can't function. I can't carry my own weight. I can't stop feeling hated and unwanted. I wasn't meant to be born. My birth was a freak accident. I can't even talk to someone without dying inside. I'm mush and knots inside. The event horizon is my very being. People look at me with contempt and disgust. I'm so over the pointlessness of my existence. I'm so over the shallowness of some people. I'm so over judgemental people. I'm so over competition, selfishness and ambition. I'm so over ruminating and wondering and worrying and crying and then feeling dead inside. I'm over cruelty. I'm so over of this world. Goodbye cruel and heartless world.
