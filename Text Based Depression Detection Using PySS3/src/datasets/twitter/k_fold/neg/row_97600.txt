I'm about to end it all out of jealousyMe 18M, was in a long distance relationship with this 14F from the other side of Europe, started October last year till about April this year. It ended because my I want everything my way side started taking over. I thought I could deal with it but i couldn't. I have her log in info still and I check everyday what she is up to like a psycho. Yesterday was her 15th birthday and she had sex with some guy. I completly lost it because we were both virgins (I still am) and out of anger I send all of her nsfw pics to her mom not even an hour ago. I know it wasn't right what I did but I just don't know what do to and I'm so lost rn. I need help, please
