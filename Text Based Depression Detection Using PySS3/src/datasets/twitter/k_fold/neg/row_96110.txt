i cant take how unfair life has been treating meis it possible to be 100% unattractive?

when i say this i don't mean in terms of looks, in fact i'm talking in terms of completely removing looks from the equation. when i ask this i'm asking more of: is it possible to have no good personal qualities? is it possible to be completely boring, uninteresting, weird, awkward and scary to the point that nobody would ever want to date you?

i feel this way right now, i feel that no matter how much i do to better myself i still end up as that weird socially awkward and just devoid of any positive traits person. ive had girls openly call me ugly to my face before, all because i tried to start a conversation with them. usually when i try to keep a conversation going i fail becuase i have no idea what to say, ask or what topics there are.

im considering ending my life soon, every girl i genuinely like and want to get to know better ends up either not liking me or leading me on, i see no point in trying anymore, i dont want to live a lonely life anymore, goodbye.
