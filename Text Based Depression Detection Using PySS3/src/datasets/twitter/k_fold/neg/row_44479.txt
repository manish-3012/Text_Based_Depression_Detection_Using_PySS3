Taking it one day at a time, barely.Long time lurker on a throwaway, but here goes. Life is shit at the moment. Within the last 5 years I've lost my mother, father, sister, son and daughter. My wife attempted suicide on my birthday, and again on Christmas day and I had to Baker Act her on both occasions. Then she left me and was living with another man within 3 weeks in another state. I've always been slightly socially awkward, but I have become such a mess of depression and anxiety that I really can't hold a job for very long, so am constantly getting behind on bills and such. I have pulled completely away from family, and in fact have had no contact with 99% of them in a couple of years. I'm alone, except for 2 cats. And because of growing up in poverty, then remaining in poverty because of taking care of both parents through cancer my teeth are in pretty bad shape and that also causes social issues. I'm fairly OK at this moment, but I can tell you exactly what gun-oil tastes like.
