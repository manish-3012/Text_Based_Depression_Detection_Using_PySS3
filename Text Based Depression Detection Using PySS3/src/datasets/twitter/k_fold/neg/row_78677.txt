Leaving I feel empty and am just sick of everybody. All of my friends and peers are fake and worthless. Ive been borderline suicidal for like the past five years and just really feel I should go through. Last time I pussied out with the noose around my neck. I see no reason to live on. The only thing keeping me from killing myself was my family and friends and now I dont care.  I cant see life as anything other than cold and meaningless. I've made a lot of mistakes and have wronged a lot of people more than you can imagine. I cant find relief. This feels like the end.
