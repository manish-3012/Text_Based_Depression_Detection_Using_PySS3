Making plans to kill my selfI find myself to busy to kill my self, I had all these thing I needed to do before I killed myself. I needed a note (Done) I needed to make sure I tried getting help which did not go a single place but I tried, I need to make sure I was very close to my birthday that way my parents don't have too many occasions to be sad about, but lately I've felt like I need to do it sooner but I can't find a single minute alone my parents are planning so many things and I don't want to disappoint them and ruin there plans but I just can't stand it anymore! Every second I try to convince myself of the bright side but I feel like I'm being sarcastic with myself nothing is nice I have no nice thing in my life to be happy about I'm grasping at any little things to do! I'm so lonely I'll talk to anyone but everyone hates me! I have no one! I can't stand this anymore I have to get out of this! I have to die, But I can't even do that!
