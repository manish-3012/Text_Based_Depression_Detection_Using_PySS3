Over a girlI was talking to this girl for a bit and i actually thought she was in to me, then out of nowhere she goes out with one of my friends. I feel stupid to think she might have liked me. I also feel stupid that i'm suicidal over a girl. There is a lot more going on in my life that is making me depressed but this bullshit is the tipping point. To top that off i skipped class today to hang out with this girl, then i find this shit out. All i have is a bottle of fireball to comfort me.

edit: i see now that it was about who had the bigger wallet
