Too Terrified to Ask for HelpI know I need it. You're not supposed to want to kill yourself. When you're 20 and in college and surrounded by incredible people, you're supposed to want to live.  
  
When you're suicidal, you're supposed to ask for help. But I can't. I can't talk on the phone. I can't get myself to my doctor or my hospital because I'm afraid of driving. Every time I get behind the wheel of my car, all I see are the buildings between me and where I'm going that I could drive into. I can't bring myself to tell anyone how much I want to end it other than on an anonymous throwaway account.

I need some courage. I need some strength. I need to put down the razor and pick up the phone but every time I try, I end up with the razor again. I'm trying to get better to make things easier for the people I love. The harder the try, the harder I fail. The harder I fail, the deeper I cut. If I can't get the help, I need the pain to end. For me and for everyone else I keep ruining.  
  
I know you'll say it's worth it to keep working, to get help. But if I can't get help, is it really? If all I do is hurt people, is it really?
