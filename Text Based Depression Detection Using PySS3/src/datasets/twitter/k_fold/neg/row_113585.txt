I think Iâ€™m ready to dieI donâ€™t wanna be here anymore. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m tired of hurting, I donâ€™t care to even try and be happy anymore. Iâ€™m scared of what will happen after Iâ€™m gone, which is the only thing holding me back. What if I go to hell? I wish hit men werenâ€™t so expensive, otherwise it wouldâ€™ve been done.
