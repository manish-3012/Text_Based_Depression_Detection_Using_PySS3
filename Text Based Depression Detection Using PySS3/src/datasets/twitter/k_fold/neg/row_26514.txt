Nobody knows how bad my mental health is.Not my family. Not my friends. Nobody.

Every night. Every NIGHT. the days aren't so bad. Although, 1-3 times a week I wake up feeling like shit and suicidal.

 Those days I sleep until 3-5 pm and lay in bed the rest of the day. Trying my best not to cut or kill myself.

I've considered opening up to family, but I can't put more stress on my mom. We're moving again in a couple weeks and she's already really busy and stressed about it.

I don't know what to do anymore. 

Kinda just wish someone would shoot me and get it over with.
