Killing myself after schoolI'm so fucking sick of being alive. Everything that I liked to do in past I've lost the ability to enjoy. I have little motivation to do anything, so little I force myself to eat. Every day I feel constant pain and emptiness. I have never really been successful or motivated in life. My failures causes me to leach off others, I'm sick of being a burden on others. I've recovered from depression before, but it always seems to come stronger. I'm sick of fighting it and just want to end my life.I appreciate you reading this post and if you're struggling try to do better than me. Goodbye all. 

Edit: For those who commented on my post I thank you. Tried to kill myself but it didn't work. I'm just not sure what to do anymore. I've been planning to do this for awhile. Now I'm just not sure what to do, I didn't think I'd still be alive.
