I'm willing to end this but I shouldn'tI'm going through a lot of things, haven't been out of my house for some time and I don't want to anymore. My mother is alone and she lost my father last year. I would've ended it a long time ago but I can't do this to her.

Life is meaningless, I broke up with my girlfriend as well about 10 days ago since it was just going downhill. I tried to distract myself with a lot of things. I haven't done any work in over a month and I'm soon to be facing my seniors for it. Either tell me how to do it quick or tell me how do I get out of this. I can't live, or I can't live like this. I've killed my future with my own hands and now I'm willing to kill my present.
