Not depressed or suffering but I want to commit suicideI just feel so done with living. Its exhausting and it boils down to mostly just doing things I don't want to do all the time. I don't have any dreams or goals or things I want to do in life, all i really like to do is sleep and eat and watch tv.  I don't really have a path I'm trying to follow so the road ahead of me just looks like a long stretch of working some sort of job I can tolerate until i die anyway. I figure why not just cut to the chase?

I'm just really tired already. the prospect of having to be alive for 70 more years or so is just so daunting. I dont really want to get old and have my body stop working and watch my face become wrinkled and unrecognizable as the version of me i know now. I've had a good life already, i'd be ok with a short life. 

Ive thought about how my suicide would affect my family and i know they'd be horrified and it would scar them, but eventually they'd learn to cope and move on and not too long after they'd all die too and none of it would even matter anymore. Anyway its my life so i should be allowed to do what i want with it including end it.

I recognize that this is a very selfish, lazy, unimaginative, and negative outlook to have but i'm ok with dying as a person with an outlook like that. i'm just tired already, you know?
