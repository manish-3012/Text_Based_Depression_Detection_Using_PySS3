I don't know what to do anymore.It's been about four years since I last attempted to commit suicide via overdose. My school tends to judge me when they find this out, and they have been threatening my future, the only thing I look foreward to, by claiming that if I mention anything like that at the school ever again, they'll somehow put a mark on my record that I can never work in an emergency position. I'm honestly nothing but a burden to my parents, doing all the wrong things and never knowing how to let out my feelings without somehow ruining someone else's life, not to mention how much social anxiety makes it hard and extremely embarrassing to talk to anyone. I've wanted to try several times, but at this point there's nothing I can do to control my feelings but break down. I'm so scared and I don't know what to so anymore.
