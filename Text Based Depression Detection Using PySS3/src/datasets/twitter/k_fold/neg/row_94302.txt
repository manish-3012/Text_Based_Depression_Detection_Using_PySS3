Today I was able to truly cry for the first time in months.But, I didnâ€™t cry because I was sad. While I was sad, but I was mostly frustrated because I canâ€™t kill myself without hurting those around me. I know I am able to do it, itâ€™s my friends and relatives keeping me on this planet. Iâ€™m thankful and angry at the same time. But at least I was without suicidal thoughts for the past two weeks. They just always keep coming back.
