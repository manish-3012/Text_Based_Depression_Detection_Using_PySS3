I just need someone anyone out there to listen to me pleaseHello reddit, long time lurker around different subs just now coming to this one looking for help. Recently me and this girl have had a thing going on, well a couple days ago things got serious. I was fingering her, and eating her out, but I couldn't get hard. No matter how bad I tried I could only go half for like 30 seconds. She wanted to do stuff to me but I just couldn't stay hard. I told her that it was me and I was having a bad day, now shes probably going to dump me, just going to say this its not her fault, shes amazingly flexible 10/10 body 9.5/10 face incredible woman. Most beautiful i've seen in my own opinion, and I couldn't get hard. I can't take viagra as im only 17 and i feel its to unnatural. All I can think about is killing myself non stop running through my head just wanting to hang myself because I can't please the girl of my dreams. I am almost in tears writing this because I simply don't feel theres hope for me in life as im the most average person you'll ever meet. I tried boosting my testosterone doing exercises eating healthy but nothing helps. AMA i'm open to any questions or replies. Edit: I forgot the mention how therapy wont help because I can't tell my parents they'll kick me out and beat me and say "just stop being depressed faggot" I feel broken useless and helpless thats why i'm here, I need anonymous support. this has been going on since before the girl, I have had suicidal thoughts since i was in 8th grade people always have called me useless, annoying, fag and more~ I am sorry if the grammar is bad i just cant care about anything right now, btw my girlfriend is the tough love type if i didnt write that before (she likes choking and being called names)
