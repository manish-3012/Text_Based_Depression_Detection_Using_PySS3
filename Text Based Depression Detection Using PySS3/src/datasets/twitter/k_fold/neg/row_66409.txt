I was raped Last summer in a San Diego barLast summer I went to San Diego to visit a friend of mine from high school. We graduated 10 years ago and have stayed in close contact since then. Weâ€™ve always had a flirtatious friendship Iâ€™m (27f) and heâ€™s (28m). I was recently single so I figured a weekend away would be relaxing and fun. Iâ€™m from Detroit so getting out of the state is always a good time. 

The second night I was there my friend took me to a roof top bar on top of a hotel. I left him to go to the bar to get us drinks and started talking to a guy while ordering drinks. My friend ran into a couple people he knew so I didnâ€™t feel so bad talking with this new guy. We talked for hours while over looking the city. It was amazing. He was buying my drinks the rest of the night but what I wasnâ€™t aware of is he slipped me somthing at some point. I ended up in a hotel room with him,  the only thing I can remember from that night was trying to crawl to the door. 

I woke up fully clothed in the hallway to someone shaking me. I called a Uber and went back to my friends apartment, he stayed out at some girls house. I never told anyone about what happened that night, Iâ€™m currently in a serious relationship with an amazing guy and with the one year anniversary coming up itâ€™s eating me up more then before. 

I feel like such a failure. I feel like I donâ€™t deserve this happiness. I get depressed more often then I e we want to admit but keep moving through my day like a robot. On my way back to Detroit I prayed my plane would crash so I wouldnâ€™t have to live thinking about that night ever again. 

I ask myself every night â€œshould I have called the cops?â€ â€œWould I look like some drunk girl crying wolf?â€  
I keep everything bottled up and itâ€™s eating me alive now. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore
