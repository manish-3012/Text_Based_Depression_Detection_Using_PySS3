Should I warn her?Well, I guess I need some sort of advice. English is not my native tongue so there might (and gonna) be some mistakes here.

There is a girl I'm in a deep love with. She knows that, and we talked about it more than once and she always completely refuses any possibility of romantic relationships between us.
Long story short, I'm done with this shit and I often feel like I can kill myself because of it. This is complicated; I actually have a depression that's been lasting for 3 years now so she and the hope to be with her are like the main reasons why I'm still alive.

So I don't know if I'll ever be able to do this, and don't even really care about it. Just started to notice that thoughts about suicide became more often and realistic (I've finally decided how to do this, for example). The thing that I do care about is how she can react. She actually had a friend of hers that killed herself a year ago, and it was hard for her... in her way, I think. I mean, she was able to get through it in a month and didn't even cry very often, but she told me recently that she still sees her in a nightmares.

Im not even that close to her as her friend was actually, but I can't stop thinking that if it will happen she might feel herself guilty or something and this can be even harder for her to handle. So the question is, should I talk to her about it, at least to let her know that I will never blame her and that I am the only one who is quilty in all this. I'd better do this now than rely on the future when it can become difficult to say or when we can quarrel or something. But I wouldn't like it to become a burden for her, like that she'd start to treat me better in some ways just to prevent my suicide, or, in the countrary, would end our relationships hoping that this will heal me.

So, should I?..
