I don't deserve sh*tSo: I've got caring friends, a loving family, recently started dating this girl who I really love and she loves me just the way I am. Now here's the problem: I have no f*cking clue at all if they just stay with me because of how lame I am

For example: I've opened up so much to my gf, and feel like she should've left me by now. And I think that maybe she doesn't do it because she feels bad for me? Because when she asked me out, she didn't know all of my problems, as I saved them all up?

I feel like I'm just a charge for them and that I'd be better off dead. I really can't think of cutting myself to death. I just think I and everyone would be better off if I just... Dropped dead.

Also, I need to mention this, just in case. Up until I was 10 or 12 years old or so, there were constant fights in my house. Like domestic abuse. F*ck, I even had to accompany my mother when I was 14, to go report my father to the police. So, yeah... They made me insecure, probably asocial, and a long list of shit.... 

Is there any way I can just focus on good things instead of just thinking everything is sheer luck and will go away as quick as it came?
Please.
Please...
