No matter how much i try to express that I need help, nobody does anythingi don't care about my life anymore, I don't want it anymore. ive started to experiment with weed in the beginning of the year and my mom asked why I came home high and I was confessed and said I smoke because it makes loosens up my tensions and relieves my anxiety. she was fine with it then but she caught me with my stash and now she wants to tell my father, who she divorced. 

the problem with telling my father is that he won't comprehend anything. I've been telling my mom my problems over a timeline. starting with anxiety, to depression, to suicidal thoughts, and finally using weed to not make me feel like shit

the fact that she is telling my dad makes me realize I can't tell her anything anymore. I can't trust her anymore. every fucking time I tell her I need help she tells me it's in my head. my brother's told me the same. 

I'm a fifteen year old kid that just cried in the shower for 30 minutes because the past couple years of my life has been trial and error of trying to appease my mother's advice of "it's all in my head". and once I had found a way which was weed my mother took it away and now Im left helpless. 

she's going to tell my dad later today and my mind is too blurred at the moment to comprehend what is going to happen. my dad is also mentally ill and he has caused lots of hardships within the family so I don't understand why he needs to know this
