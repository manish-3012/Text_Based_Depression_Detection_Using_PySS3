Will probably "opt out" soon.Waiting for the electricity and water to be cut off. Only a few more days until my phone is cut off. Sitting in a house that was abandoned by my mother since she couldn't make payments anymore. She just moved away to a relative's house. Who knows when the bank will be by to do whatever. I don't have a car anymore, a job, or any money so there is nothing I can do. I won't be homeless again. I've tried to apply to some places I could walk to, but I haven't heard anything back. My work history is pretty bad because I can't seem to hold onto jobs, and last job I had was years ago. Can't get disability either, even though depression and anxiety have destroyed my life and kept me from being able to take care of myself. 

I have a cat I can't take care of anymore and I don't know what to do with her. It's sad and pathetic, but I can't bear to be without my cat. Like me, she was homeless for a while, a stray, and I adopted her because I needed a friend. 

None of my friends care. They know my situation but there's nothing they can do. I know they may care, but my depression tells me something else. No one ever even texts me to see how I am doing. 

It's been an awful year for me. Worst ever. I've already posted why in lots of other threads. I am just too tired, hopeless, lazy, sad to post all of the bad things that have happened. 

There is a gun in the house. I am making myself as comfortable as possible for a few days before hand just so I can probably go out in relative peace and comfort. I think I will somehow post a message on Facebook just before I do it, asking someone to get my cat and do something with her. They can take any possessions I have left to sell to use as compensation. I won't need them, obviously. 

Suicide has been on my mind for weeks now. Every single day I play scenarios in my head. I just want peace. I have been a burden to people and no one really cares anyway.
