stuck.Tonight I fell back into self-harm. I've been sitting here afterwards considering suicide. im telling less and less people, even my significant other, that I'm suicidal. im terrified to tell him I harmed again. he'll see it though, so I know I have to brace for that. I've texted the suicide hotline before, called the number, talked to people, nothing changes. my feelings don't change. I've tried counseling, im taking medication, hell I'm a masters of social work so I could almost counsel myself at this point. nothing gets better, it just gets worse and worse. I'm stuck.

tl;dr- venting and being very selfish.
