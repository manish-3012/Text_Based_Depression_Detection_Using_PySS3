My 2019 resolution was not to kill myself: I thought giving myself a year to turn things around might work. It didn't. Off I go.Iâ€™m going to hang myself from a pine tree. Iâ€™m basically an incapable man-child who failed to grow up. At twenty-eight, my resume is white-space. I have been rotting away at my parentsâ€™ house since college. I thought, impractically, that if I spent all of my time writing and reading that I might become a writer. But it didnâ€™t work out. I have several book-length piles of mud. Nothing else.


As of last week I decided to try out coding with Python. Though, my parents are going to throw me out soon. So it wonâ€™t matter. I donâ€™t blame them, and this probably would have been a blessing in disguise if not for the timing. Without any kind of career, money, or place to go I wonâ€™t survive.


I have bad social anxiety. I feel disconnected from reality when in unfamiliar situations. Despondent, disassociated, itâ€™s the worst feeling in the world. Itâ€™s like a sheet of fog is stuck behind my eyes, and I become incapable of the most basic actions. My   therapist pushed me to get a job through a temp agency. It was a manufacturing gig. Basically I was to staple, drill, glue, clip, cut, and fit windows and doors together. I couldnâ€™t even do it. I couldnâ€™t even lay a straight line of adhesive. I quit after two days. That was the week before last. With all options exhausted there is no reason not to die.


I just feel bad for my therapist. She has tried really hard to help me. At least her time will be better spent on those younger, more able clients. Iâ€™m like a leaden weight strapped to the ankles of all around me.


I want to put a gun against the top of my mouth and snuff out my consciousness. Iâ€™m forsaken, and I canâ€™t wait to die. Part of me doesnâ€™t want to go. But itâ€™s better to get it over with. I canâ€™t take another year of me. Thank you for reading: don't be like me and waste away. Life can be so much more. Maybe you can succeed where I failed, whoever you are.
