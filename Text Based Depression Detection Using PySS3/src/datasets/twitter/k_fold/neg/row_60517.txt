Wednesday.Iâ€™m going to do it on Wednesday. I have everything I need at home. Iâ€™m with family until Tuesday. I just need to get home and sort out some things and then I can kill myself. Iâ€™m relatively sure itâ€™s going to work. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a long time and Iâ€™ve tried everything. Itâ€™s over for me.
