Iâ€™m done tryingIâ€™m done complaining about everything that makes me want to die, now Iâ€™ll just focus on the dying part. 

How hard is it to kill yourself hanging from the doorknob, Iâ€™ve tried before but knowing I could just lift myself up to breathe once my vision started blurring fucked everything up. I could probably get really drunk first this time to fuck up my fight or flight response, make the noose even shorter.
