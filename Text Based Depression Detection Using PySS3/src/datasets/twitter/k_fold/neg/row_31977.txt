This time of the year is the worst and I don't want to see the nextI thought I saw a bit of hope for the future today, probably in some fantasy thing I probably imagined, but it's gone now. Replaced by a breakdown and now I never want to get up again. It's so shit. 

By my age, people are studying and working. Some are starting businesses and some are having kids. I've failed the first two, and I'm so useless and I haven't made any progress there's no point to trying to fix all this shit. I can't even go outside because I'm anxious and even if I did I have to wear leggings and long sleeves in +40 degrees. At least no one has to look at my repulsive self then.

I'm sorry for my rant. Thank you if you read it. It's late afternoon and I'm shaking, crying, unclothed and covered in blood and I never want to breathe again.
