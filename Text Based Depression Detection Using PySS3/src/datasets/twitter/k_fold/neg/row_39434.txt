Hopefully dying tonightJust bought a 36 pack of sleeping pills. Plan on taking all of them tonight in hopes i don't wake up tomorrow. For my last day I want to  eat something that I don't usually eat probably 2 cheese burgers, watch a couple episodes of my favorite shows,  drink some welches white grape juice and that will probably be it. Wish me luck,  pray that I don't wake up tomorrow.

Should I buy another pack (72 all together) to have a greater chance?
