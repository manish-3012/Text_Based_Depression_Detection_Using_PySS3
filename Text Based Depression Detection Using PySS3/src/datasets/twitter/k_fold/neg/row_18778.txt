FMLI posted a rant on lonely how I'm on my last legs.  So desperate for anyone to talk to and flirt with that I would even be fine with it being online only because I know how ugly and worthless I am, only to be told I am now banned.  I never put my age, or requested someone to reach out.  I didn't actively post a personal ad.  I literally was just venting about how pathetic I am, and their response is to say fuck this guy, even we don't want him.  FML. I'm so sick of being alone, suffering with depression, anxiety, ptsd, and being ugly.  I believed the lies I was told as a teenager that things would get better.  I struggled and fought against my demons for years, and life just gets harder, and more painful.  I fucking wish life just had a reset button or a power off button.  I am so extremely tired.
