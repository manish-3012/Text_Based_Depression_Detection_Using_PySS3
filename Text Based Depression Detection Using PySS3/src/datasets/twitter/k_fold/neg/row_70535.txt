I think my friend just killed himselfSo I was checking instagram stories and I got into my friend Alex's, there where two pictures: the first showed a long rope with a message that said "The infallible friend rope" and the next one was a closeup to his eye with the phrase "but hapiness hits".

I send him a direct message and I got no response. The more I think of it the more I believe he did it, I mean, he waited until 12 AM to publish this and maybe its no coincidence that today is halloween. I know this because I had an episode with him like a month ago, which I also wrote on this sub, you can read it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/72phr4/a_friend_of_mine_wanted_to_kill_himself_at_a_party/

Now im having a hard time thinking about this whole thing and im writing this because I dont know what else to do...
