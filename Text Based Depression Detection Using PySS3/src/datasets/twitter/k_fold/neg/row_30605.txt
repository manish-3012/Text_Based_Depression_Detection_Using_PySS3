Dying insideIâ€™m in my mid 30s, no kids, not married, havenâ€™t spoken to my parents in years. I am a horrible alcoholic. Iâ€™ve been arrested for DUI 3 times and will be going to jail in January. Iâ€™ve been sober now for 3 months but I canâ€™t stop thinking about wanting to die. I lost my job of 17 years because of alcohol and now Iâ€™m about to lose my house, my car, my drivers license, my independence. 

I would be getting out of jail a felon, with no place to live. I havenâ€™t talked to friends or family for over 5 years because of my drinking.  Everyone in AA tells me itâ€™s going to get better but I canâ€™t mentally handle this outcome. I know itâ€™s all my fault but itâ€™s fucking hard. 

Ironically, this user name was one of the suggested names when I created this account. It perfectly describes how I feel. I feel like such a disgusting person. I donâ€™t deserve to live.  I know people will be sad, blah blah blah. I get it. Should I have to suffer to keep people happy?  Fuck that.
