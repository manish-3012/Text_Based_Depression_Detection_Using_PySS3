The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fear that I won't succeedEverything in my life is fucking garbage. I am a piece of shit and I can't do anything to change that. 
I know that there are a lot of people who are going to be hurt by this, I've played out every reaction I can imagine in my head. 
I just can't do this anymore. I don't feel anything. I feel like a ghost already. 
I already know I'm going to hang my self and I've weight tested my closet to make sure it will work, I'm just afraid I won't succeed and i'll end up a vegetable or the person everyone knows tried to kill themselves and failed. 
But I know i'll get the courage in the next day or two. I'm done with this life.
