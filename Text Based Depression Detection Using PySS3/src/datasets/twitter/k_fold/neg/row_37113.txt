Life is cruelI'm giving myself until October 15th. (My would've been 2 year anniversary with my now ex) It's been over 2 months since it ended. Being the dumbass I am I poured everything i had into that relationship and planned my future accordingly. Now that it's over I'm so lost. Recently I learned she went on a date with one of my now not friends. I don't have very many people in my life and having bad social anxiety makes me have a hard time making new friends. I'm in college right now and I still have no idea what I want in life. My ambition, will, and self love is at an all time low. All of my problems seem so much bigger than me and I have can't bring myself to talk about it out of fear. I'm such a bad son and a burden on my family. At this point I don't know whether or not I even want to help myself anymore. I'm so alone...
