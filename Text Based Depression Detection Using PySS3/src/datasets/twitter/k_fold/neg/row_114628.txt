Why I want to kill myselfMy situation is far from unique. I have what should be a good life- Iâ€™m a high school junior, I get 90â€™s, compete in gymnastics at a national and international level. I have friends and family who care about me. 

Despite all this, it feels like everything I can do just isnâ€™t enough. I have no fucking clue how to explain it, but no matter what goes well, no matter how well I do Iâ€™m just not happy with it. At the very first big competition I went to, I placed 3rd; that week I attempted suicide because I was so upset I didnâ€™t get first.  I wasnâ€™t the best, so I was a failure.

I just finished my exams, got the results back, and I am now averaging a 95. People tell me that that is good, but even writing that down made me want to cry. I feel like I need to study more, work harder, but I fucking canâ€™t.

Part of it might be that Iâ€™m surrounded by people who are insanely smart- the school I go to has a very selective application system, and I know people who are going to Harvard, have won international stem competitions, and some who have papers published in university journals. I wonâ€™t ever be as good as these people, and I wonâ€™t ever be as good as them. Again, Iâ€™m not the best, so Iâ€™m a failure. 

So after that page of rambling garbage I have a question. If I wonâ€™t ever accomplish anything that satisfies me, and if I wonâ€™t ever be good as the best, good enough to really change the world, whatâ€™s the point of living? Why shouldnâ€™t I kill myself?

Thereâ€™s a bridge near my house. Tonight, Iâ€™m going to go there and Iâ€™m going to jump. Its tall enough that dying is a guarantee. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this post.
