Psych wardI wonâ€™t go back. I canâ€™t threaten suicide I canâ€™t even think  about it otherwise I have to go back to that awful cesspool .. why put fucked up kids with .. Well the EMS and nurses and doctor was all very condescending ... like itâ€™s not my fucking fault I ended up here... nobody ever WANTS to be suicidal... or have mental disorders...  i donâ€™t see why isolation and being put w other psychopaths helps at all. It makes no logical sense... the mental health system in America ISWAY TO SIMILAR TO PRISON.  people need their FAMILIES IN this moment oh wait I, and many others, donâ€™t have a family that cares or that wants to be involved. HAHA, I want to fucking kill myself so badly but I canâ€™t or tell anyone . Nothing is worse than that hospital ... society treats suicidal people like livestock which is more incentive to die.... Iâ€™m only 17 yet this is my mindset... this is a fucked world we live in ... I just want to leave can somebody please tell me Iâ€™m wrong but Iâ€™m not so???
