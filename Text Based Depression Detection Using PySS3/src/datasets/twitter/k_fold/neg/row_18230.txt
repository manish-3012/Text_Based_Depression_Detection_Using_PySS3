Someone to talk to pleaseI feel like I've made the decision to do it, just deciding the when and how. I've lived my life feeling like I don't deserve to be happy so I've been a subconscious fuck up my whole life. Anytime I'm starting to be happy I self destruct. It hasn't been an issue until the last few years since I've got married and had kids. Now I feel trapped in my happiness and the war between that and my feelings of undeseradness are driving me mad.
