I Fucking Hate Being AliveI have no creativity, drive, or passion. I have a very weak moral compass and I don't wish to strengthen it. Morals are stupid and pointless. I don't care about myself, anyone else, or anything around me. I am by all accounts an empty vessel.  I have no ideas, no goals, and no dreams. My perspective on everything around me has been horrifically warped to the point where I don't connect with other people or care about their emotions. I only care about them as much as they effect my pathetic life. I dislike responsibility. I gain no rewards from being responsible except for the avoidance of pain and misfortune. I'm not willing to try my hardest to make things work when shit hits the fan. I'd rather sleep on the cold ground and beg for money so I don't starve, and if a police officer harassed me for sleeping in a public space I'd attack him so that maybe he'd kill me but if not I'd be able to punish him for blindly enforcing a law I have zero respect for. I hate being responsible to other people. I hate having to do something I don't want to do...,

I'm fucking running out of steam here. Fuck life and fuck you. I deserve to rot in hell and I don't give a fuck. I didn't ask to exist and it's my right to end my pathetic life if I feel like it. I don't care for contributing to society. I'm to weak, stupid, and unconfident to find a way to make a real living. Or to develope relationships. Or to solve the problems in my life. Or to bring myself happiness. I don't want to believe in myself. I don't want to be responsible for the trajectory of my life. I can't trust myself to. I can't admit that to a person. I don't want to work on it. I want to die.
