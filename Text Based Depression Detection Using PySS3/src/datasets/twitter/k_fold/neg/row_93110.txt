I'm lostThe only thing that keeps me on this earth is my mother and my daydreams. I've seen doctors I trust, and suggested physical activities that I have no interest in. I don't have the motivation or inspiration to set any goals for myself and accomplish it. I can't do it, no matter hard I try. When I tell my family about this, they don't know what to say, even my mom. Someone on this thread suggested I do the things I love, but what the hell is the point of that when I have nothing? It's gotten to a point where I have maladaptive daydreams 24/7, six days a week. If it wasn't for my mother's kindness, I would've been in the ground already.
