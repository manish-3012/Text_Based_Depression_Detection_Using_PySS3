I'm an idiot, i deserve death.I'm worthless, I don't understand why anyone loves me. I'm 15 and I want to end my life. I make My friends and family unhappy but they keep coming back to me. Why? I can't make new friends, girls aren't interested in me, and I'm failing in school. I shouldn't be here, what's the point. One less fuck up gone. What does it matter. My dad left me, so why would anyone else want me around. I'm ugly and I've tried to fix it and I can't. I hate myself.
