My whole family thinks I'm going back to college on Wednesday, but...I haven't booked the ticket or renewed the student visa. And I have no intention of going. I need therapy+meds, not school. BUT I don't know how to tell them this when they don't listen. And wow, thanks unmedicated ADHD and anxiety, for putting this off as loonnggg as possible so they'll rage even harder. HOW do I tell them? Please at least give me moral support :,(


Everything overwhelms me. I get tired even thinking about doing anything more than clicking around on the Internet. 


I don't want to die. When I do something like jet ski, when I have that wind slapping my face about and water spraying me, I feel alive and I think, this is why we live. For moments like this.



But you can't always have moments like that. And I always I have this impending doom upon me. I feel like I have to die to get away from all my worries.



**I abhor my major, my college, &amp; the country it is in**. The country it is foreign. I have no idea why my parents green lighted me going it as I don't even know the local language. Well, I do.
 My dad: whatever, it's the best ranking out of all your colleges, hellz yeah I can now brag about this to everyone. As for me: lack of impulse control/foolish optimism. I know, I make reallyyy stupid decisions when depressed. At the time, I thought I could do it. I also thought I had no other choice, as the college options from my own country are poor, and I don't exactly have the best grades from high school because ADHD traits (have trouble prioritizing, completing work, starting work, careless mistakes) and depression (just...thinking everything was doomed so I shouldn't bother).


The school, it isn't that bad. I get good grades because it's taught in English so the locals do bad so I do good, but at the same time, I learn nothing. I feel like I'm wasting my time, I could do better somewhere else. This is more true because it's a liberal arts school and I picked this at the time because I've never had any career dreams, even as a kid (I had no sense of the future), and I suck at math and can bullshit through humanities well. I mean, geez, would you send your kid to college if they were like that? But not going to college wasn't even a question because my dad installed it in me that I would go to college. Like I literally never even considered not going. He wouldn't even let me get a job in HS because I needed to study to go to college.

I've tried saying to myself, there there, it's not that bad. But I realized after one semester that it was bad because **I have already DEMONIZED this whole school and place in my head and I can't UNdemonize it.** I wish I could, but I am STUBBORN as hell and I just want to speed away from this whole thing and start a new chapter in my life. I finally brought this up to my mom in my second semester, but she just said to keep going.



It got worse. **Last semester, I had to drop out in the middle** because my depression got really, really bad and I could do nothing but stare at the ceiling all day in bed. This was because: I was in a exchange program that semester and the classes were harder (and I liked that, but my ADHD didn't and I just got overwhelmed in the end) and I realized for the first time in a while, I was constantly happy and this was exactly what I wanted and I didn't want to go back and the thought of going back just made me feel so, so bad.

So before you say, you'll be unhappy no matter where you go, I was REALLY happy there, I was happy with my social life for the first time since HS, I felt like I was learning things, I felt like I had opportunities.

**I have tried to transfer out** and researched like crazy, but my dad won't accept anything ranked less, they say they don't have the money (even when I have showed them colleges that cost around the same), they want me to just graduate already so they can focus on my brother who is going to college next year...they're sending him to architecture school so that's like 5 years and they're going to spend a buttload of money on his college to send him where he wants, and because my school's a liberal arts school, IDK where the fuck I can transfer to because my credits aren't focused.
 I'd get a loan if I could, but they don't do student loans here. 

**At this point though, I just don't care.** I can't make the effort anymore. **I haven't left the house in weeks and have just slept the days away** so I wouldn't have to worry. I also pretty much ruined shit even further and this is just funny because the whole family thinks I'm boarding a plane to go back to college on Wednesday, but I haven't been able to bring myself to book the ticket, renew my visa, or apply for a delay in paying tuition (I can only pay in country). Not doing the third=I'm going to get kicked out of college. I'm ok with letting my life go to ruin because I've got no fight in me anymore. IDK how to break this fact to them because I've never defied my parents and thus, I've never been heavily punished by them and I'm kind of scared but I really don't think returning to college in this state is going to do me any favors. The only reason I eat day to day is because my grandma practically force feeds me. And I've tried to convey how depressed I was, but it wasn't like they listened. I mean, **I told my mom I was suicidal all the way back in HS, but she just was like, that's stupid, why would you want to waste your life like that.**

**They don't think it's serious enough because I do well when it comes to grades in college**...hell, I'm even on the Dean's List. And that's all my dad cares about.

I've tried anti-depressants twice. It didn't work the first time, and the second, with a different medication, I didn't think it worked after a month and two weeks, but my mom intervened and she nagged me to get off them until I just gave up and did, so IDK if it would have worked or not. I should fix my ADHD first, but I can't make myself dial the phone to call the doctors because it was hard enough for me to muster the effort to call the doctors the first two times, and because what's the point even if I get treated, really? **Plus, I found out most ADHD medication is illegal/not available in the country my college is in**. Isn't that just hilarious.



I don't know what to do. I just want to fall into a deep sleep forever and not worry about it all.


All I know is I can't go back to college on Wednesday, even if I could. I can't take this semester off, because I already took the last one off and I can't take two semesters off continuously according to school rules.
