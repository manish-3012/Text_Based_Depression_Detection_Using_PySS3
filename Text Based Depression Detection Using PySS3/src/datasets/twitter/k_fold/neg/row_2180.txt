I wish I could dissapearI wish the people I knew never knew me or ever spoke to me. And I know I never meant as much to them as they meant to me, but I wouldn't even want them to go aw that's sad , at the news of me passing.and folding my months laundry at 2am is tiring. I'm just existing. I don't wanna live.not this way at least.
