I'm starving myself to deathWell, I've decided to end my life. I don't want to leave a mess, and I don't want to try something that might end up making me a burden on my family or society.

So, I've decided to starve myself to death. 

I did a google search and I should be dead in the next 3 weeks, so not too long at least.

I know that it'll be an excruciating way to go, but I'm honestly looking forward to it. I've always been a masochist.

I haven't really been hungry for the last few days anyway. I'm still drinking water and coffee though since drinking a lot helps quell the hunger pangs.

Now, I know that sounds contradictory, but even though I'm physically hungry, the thought of putting food in my mouth makes me sick.
