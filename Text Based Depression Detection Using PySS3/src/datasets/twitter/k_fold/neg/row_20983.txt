I want to kill myself after starting meds and therapyI used to be horribly depressed. Like completely detached from the world on autopilot. I'd think about killing myself and wouldn't have the will to do it. A few months back I finally managed to start therapy and got on anti-depressants, and I'm starting to realize how empty and meaningless my life is. No one would miss me. At least before I didn't care that my life sucked. But now I actually want it to be over. The modern world isn't for me it seems. I just need someone to fucking talk to. God I'm crying in the bathroom at work.
