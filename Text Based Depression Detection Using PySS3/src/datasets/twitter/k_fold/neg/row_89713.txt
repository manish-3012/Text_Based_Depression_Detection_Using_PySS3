Panicking and SuicidalI left for college Friday...I am so lonely and have no one and miss my family and baby brother so much... On top of that I got a DUI Wednesday...a very stupid mistake that I regret...I feel bad about that and am nervous and worried about everything involved with it. Even though my parents said they forgive me and are hiring an attorney and helping me through it, I feel so bad and guilty and feel like I will never be truly forgiven. I miss my family and friends so much and I don't think I want to live anymore. I'm on Wellbutrin and Effexor and ability but none help me at all. This is the lowest I've ever felt and I don't know why going on reddit would help me vent a little. I don't know if I will kill myself or not but I want to be dead. I hate my life.
