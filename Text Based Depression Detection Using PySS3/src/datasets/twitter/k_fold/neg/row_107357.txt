I dunno what I want.I want help but ik I'm not consistent or committed enough. At this point I wouldnt even know where to go. 

I'm feeling desperate though. Like my plan that had patience is wearing thin. I feel such a pressure to go away from all of this. 

I feel trapped &amp; pressure &amp; tbh a little scared bc I'm not sure how long I can keep myself safe. I need a plan that's right I dont even care. uch how it is. 

I just really want to go. 

I would possibly consider the hospital but I've turned away so many times in crisis I kinda just don't bother. I don't really bother talking about it anymore. 

I have my moments though. It doesnt matter bc I'm not an immediate risk but I'm def losing some control over that. 

I dont think I'll be alive by the next few weeks if I can help it tbh. I just feel such a pressure like a.. "finally it's time to go now" 

I dunno who to talk to anymore anyway. So I'll just manage &amp; try and stay outta the way....
