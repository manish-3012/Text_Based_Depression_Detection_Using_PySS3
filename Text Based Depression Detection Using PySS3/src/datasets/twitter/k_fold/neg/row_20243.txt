Unsuccessful attemptsTried cutting femoral artery and carotid artery in neck. I was 4mm away from carotid. Femoral I skimmed past - I somehow cut all the tendons, sheath, nerves &amp; lymph nodes in my groin instead.  
   
I always wanted to die a violent method. Iâ€™m a young female but overdose or suffocation etc have never been my method. I prefer deep self harm, something bloody or gory. Iâ€™m afraid my next attempts will be unsuccessful so I should just go something fool proof like hanging however I donâ€™t want to die... so passively.   
  
Was thinking of jumping in front of a car tonight. Either I get fucked up badly or die. I am scared of becoming a vegetable whoâ€™s conscious and locked in their body.
  
Just ranting.
