I donâ€™t want to dieI donâ€™t want to die. I am scared of death. But existence seems to be becoming a daily challenge. I wish I just was never born in the first place. I wish that I could live my life as just a normal person. But everything is so overwhelming, and I canâ€™t cope anymore. For years Iâ€™ve just been existing, occasionally suicidal, but existing. Lately itâ€™s been non stop. Iâ€™ve never been suicidal for this period of time before and Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t want to die, I wish I could just live normally but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m scared and I feel trapped.
