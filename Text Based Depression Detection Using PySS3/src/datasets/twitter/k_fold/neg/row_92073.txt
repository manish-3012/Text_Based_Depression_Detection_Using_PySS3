Is it better to die with potential than live as a burden?Hi everyone. I'm a college senior. I've got a semester left. No jobs lined up. No prospects.

Every day, a little bit of me dies as my future gets a little dimmer, a little bleaker.

My decisions have led me to this place. I've made my own bed. I'm not afraid to lie in it. But my family won't let me. And that's the problem. They are well off enough to support me even if I don't get a job. And I know that they will despite anything I say, because they know I'd never be able to survive on my own. I don't want to live a life where I leech off the ones who helped me get to where I am. The ones who believed in my potential only to watch me fail. The ones I love the most.

I want to end it. Every day, I wake up, and my fate is staring me in the face. Every night, I lay awake with my future by my side. It's almost as if I know what's going to happen. I feel it in my bones. I don't want it to end that way. I want to go out with people asking what could have been. The boy who had potential, not the boy who failed and couldn't take it.

I don't know when I'll have the courage to finally grab that kitchen knife and cut down. But I hope I find it.
