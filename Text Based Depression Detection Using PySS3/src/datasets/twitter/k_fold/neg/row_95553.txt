I want to die.I'm tired of living this life in this body. I want to fucking die.

 I don't care if people around me will be sad, I don't care if others are in worse situations, I don't care if I can fix some little things in my life.

 I will never be happy with my life, with my body, with who I am... I want to die. 

I will always be the disgusting and weird guy for people, even for those in this sub. Why I don't have the courage to do it instead of whining?  I don't know, but one day my pain will end.
