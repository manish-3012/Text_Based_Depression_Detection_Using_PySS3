I'm not going to do it but I need someone to hear itI want to kill myself 

I can't see how life is going to get better. It's so hard for me when it shouldn't be!! I wasn't abused, I'm not poor, I'm successful from the outside but I can't fucking connect with anyone. I'm so goddamn fucking lonely all the fucking time and I have been all my life. How is that ever going to change. I've met so many many people and I can't connect with them. I just want my life to finish. No pain, not drawn out. Just a god or something clicking his fingers and it's gone. Because it hurts too much right now feeling so hopeless and empty. So disappointed. I have so many issues. I have been crying all day my eyes are so red. Life wasn't supposed to be like this. I'm broken
