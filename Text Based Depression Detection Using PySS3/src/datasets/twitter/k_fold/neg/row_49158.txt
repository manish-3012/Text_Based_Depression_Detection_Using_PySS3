I think tonight is a good last night.Recently I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on a bunch of meds that make me feel worse. My partner left me , they were my only friend. 
I'm miserable , numb , and so tired of feeling like a burden for reaching out for help. I hate my eating disorder cycle  I hate how much of a burden I am on everyone around me. I think tonight feels right. It may be the prescription meds im Doped up on giving me confidence idk
If it wernt for the cat that crawled into my lap sleeping I think I would do it now. I just have to wait for him to wake up.
I feel like a burden posting this and forcing someone to read my dumb problems
