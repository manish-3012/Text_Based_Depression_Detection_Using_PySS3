There is just too much expected from a teenager**THIS HAS BEEN MARKED AS A SPOILER BECAUSE I NEED PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY LISTEN AND SUPPORT ME, NOT READ AND CRITICISE**

I'm a 15 year old male who lives with a divorced mother, her boyfriend, my twin sister and my 5 year old half brother.

Growing up I was meant to believe that education was what I needed to focus on to succeed in the future, I still do believe that but its completely fucking ridiculous. With almost every sibling there is always some sort of competitive race to whose the smartest etc... etc... but I was never really a smart kid even though they keep saying I am but its all just a big lie, they don't believe I'm good enough to achieve my dream and that brings be down with the, now I think I can't do it because people's opinion of me was so important to me, my happiness and mental health was based around grades I couldn't achieve and I am writing on a fucking reddit post (no offence reddit) about suicide because not even MY OWN FAMILY give a fuck.

When I was born it was a rough patch for my mum (yes I'm british so I spell mom as mum) my dad cheated on her, just before we were born and for the past 13 years we saw him every 2 weeks and a little bit more depending on the holiday. Things were nice and calm back then, sure there was still shouting but even though me and my twin hated going to our dads because he just interrogates us to get dirt on our mum it would be the break every parent needs from their kids.

Eventually I hated going to see my father just to be made a puppet for something no kid should be involved with. He couldn't get our numbers LEGALLY UNTIL WE ARE 18 but HE decided not to have contact with US and I'll never forgive him for what he did to his own children and I'm glad I don't need to see him anymore but for my age and how long it took, I think I did pretty good.

But then I think my mum got too used to our 2 week break which in some cases I can understand but I think that even though its only been a year since we've seen/ spoke to him, I think that all of us need a break from each other.

I did have a school counsellor that helped me out through a lot of stuff that I couldn't even think about when my mums in the room, but I got through it, it went  over my learning period though so my mum told me to stop going. So she chose Education over My own life.

Lockdown was a total nightmare especially with a little shit brother who doesn't shut the fuck up. Lockdown made my life so depressing and teachers over posting tasks that ArE sUpPoSeD tO Be WhAt We Do EvErYdAy. It's bullshit and my mum was always Miss Negative whenever I put my happiness over school. Its understandable but how am I supposed to enjoy childhood what every adult says when you won't let me?

One thing that really started my depression with a kick up the arse was that little shit that dominates a fucking family at fucking 5 years old! Don't get me wrong before him I loved kids and probably would still consider starting a family when I meet someone but this kid was the D E A T H   O F   M E!

So when lil brother was like 2 we had a little border terrier by the name of Lupo way before him, that dog was my depression away space but one time he decided to hit Lupo on the nose and every dog reacts when you annoy them, its basic instinct but when he retaliated, 5yo had to go through and animistic (where they open up the wound more to see for infections) but I was crying by the steps because my mum always talked about getting rid of Lupo and I knew this was it but they thought I was crying for lil brother. Again, never used to hate kids but I couldn't give a single fuck what could happen to him, he isn't my full brother so why should I care? 

We ended up having to give away Lupo but it was for the best because the choices were to have him put down with us or get his last chance with new owners. He's doing great but I've lost a best bud (Idc If I can't have my dog as my best friend, he may not talk or barely understand me but closest thing to someone giving a fuck)

My main reason for hating that little soul sucking shit is because he gets everything fucking handed to him like a fucking angel even when hes not! His parents havent been seperated, he didn't have to travel 2 hours everyday just to go to a different house every weekend but yet he gets spoiled like he's seen the light. I have given him SO MUCH of my shit and MY PLAYSTATION 4 and I AM THE MEAN BROTHER? I GOT MY REASONS, HAVE YOU? NO

His father gets him everything and I end up suffering. If I be honest I only gave him my Playstation because I just wanted to be left alone, but no as long as I'm having fun with my m8s he HAS to be there same situation and school, have the people only friends with me because they like my sister!

Honestly this 5yo is the worst thing that happened to this family, anything whether its to get me in trouble or to snitch on me.And what really bugs the shit out of me is that **I get in trouble for ME not liking to be touched by him. THATS FUCKING BULLSHIT!** and only some people would understand how frustrating this is, every time I play a game whether on PC or PS4 there always has to be some sort of audience and I **HATE** being watched whether its on a game or in general **AND MY FAMILY HAS A PROBLEM WITH THAT!**

The favouritism in this place fucking sucks and there are no such things as compliments here its insult when you wake up and insults when you sleep.

To be perfectly honest when my mum was pregnant I had no idea wtf was going on nor did I care but when I did I NEVER SAID I WANTED ANOTHER SIBLING I was just hoping it was a boy so I could relate more, and fuck I was wrong I WANT A GIRL and Just because I wanted a boy doesn't mean I wanted one in the first place,I didn't want anything like that and he's affecting my mum making her always stressed the TAKING IT OUT ON ME. He only loves me because I give him my old stuff but now that I stop he doesn't shut the fuck up about me and I'll say it **LOUD AND CLEAR. I.FUCKING.KIDS**

And one annoying thing, Im 15 and I'm not supposed to have devices in my room. FUCKING   1 5! I don't know one person whose as limited as me for a teenager.

Thanks for listening to me, I've just needed something to put it out there, I have attempted suicide a few times but I'm starting to think that its maybe a sign that I should see through the rest of my life.
