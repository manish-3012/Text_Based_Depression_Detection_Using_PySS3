Gathering my supplies tomorrow.This has not been a pleasant week. Every time I go through a suicidal episode it becomes more and more clear to me that this is how my life is going to end. Tomorrow morning I'm going to Home Depot and getting a gas hose, gauge, and flow regulator, and then straight to Party City to get a large helium tank. I'll probably leave it all in my closet for when things get even worse. Then all that will be left is a nice bag and an elastic band, and I will be gone from this world. Off to wherever is after this, if anything at all. It's been nice knowing most of you.
