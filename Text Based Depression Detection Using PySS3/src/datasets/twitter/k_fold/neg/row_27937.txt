If I cannot find a reason to live by the end of tonight, I will kill myself.Life is meaningless. It has nothing to offer me. I don't want to be better. I am depressed and that is all I will ever be. Everyone who has ever cared about me has left me. My friends don't actually want to be around me, my girlfriend left me because I was too dependent, I'm falling way behind in my classes, I don't even care. The only thing I have is a broken heart and I'm drowning in pain and suffering. I have no reason to continue. I have no one to even tell this too, hence this post. All I do every day is sit at my desk in my room, smoke pot, jerk off, play video games, and I hate all of it. There's no value to anything in my life. I had love and I lost it. Not just for her, but for myself. My persistent existence is all just a party trick so that I don't hurt others. No one around me can relate to the pain I have, no one wants to. No one wants to help me, they all just want to prolong my suffering. But I don't care anymore. It's selfish, and I don't care. Fuck everyone, I don't care if I hurt them. They certainly didn't give a shit when they hurt me.
