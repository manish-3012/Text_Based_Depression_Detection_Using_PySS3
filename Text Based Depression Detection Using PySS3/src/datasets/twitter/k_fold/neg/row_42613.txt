Suicide is the only thing on my mindI don't want to be here. I'm 17, I've just started studying my A Levels but I don't see a future for myself.

I started going downhill back in April this year and now I suffer with emetaphobia (the fear of vomiting), social anxiety, depression, eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and intentions, anxiety as a whole and panic/anxiety attacks.

Everyone that I talk to about says it's a slow process but you'll get there but if this process takes to long, I won't be here. Suicide is the first thing on my mind when I wake up and the last thing on my mind before I sleep.

I don't see a future for myself as I just panic all the time and I can barely eat as I've lost 5 stone in a matter of months by not eating.

Does anyone have any advice?
