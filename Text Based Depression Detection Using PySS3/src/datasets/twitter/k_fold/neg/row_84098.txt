I'm afraid. F21 college student.I'm really concerned about my health. Mentally, of course..
 I just started taking anti-depressants, almost a month ago. I'm still feeling like the world is ending around me. I've been told I'm more productive. I've been told I look happier. But on the inside I've never felt more suicidal in my life. I haven't been to classes in almost a month. I'm terrified to tell my parents because I'm not ready to be that level of a disappointment just yet. 
My person just caught the flu. Like the big deal one. Type A. (Scared the shit out of me when I looked it up.) So he went home. I'm terrified I've got the flu, and I slept past my appointment with the campus wellness center. Lucky me. I've started coughing today.
So on top of being a miserable wreck in school, I've got some just blanket statement issues.
I'm failing. I'm always wanting to die. I feel like I'm not comfortable in my own home. I dread seeing my parents. My friends keep lying to me. My feelings are too much, and getting stomped on too often. I'm anxious. I'm unable to get up. The pills aren't working. The support isn't working. I'm scared.
