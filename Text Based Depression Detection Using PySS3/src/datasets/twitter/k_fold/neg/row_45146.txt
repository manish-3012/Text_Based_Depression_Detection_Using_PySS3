i feel useless.i never vent, but i honestly dont know what to do. im just done at this point. everyone i know is annoyed of me, i talk to much, im too childish and immature. i dont know how to act my age (16). my little sister (14) ignores everything i say, she treats me like a child, and bullies me everyday. my parents always side with her. i dont know what im doing  wrong, why am i always in trouble, why am i always the issue. no one treats me like a human, they come to me to vent, than dont even bother to listen to me. they treat me like a dog, or like a little baby. i cant even push myself to do one assignment. 

my parents recently found out i havent done any assignments and took my phone away and are making me do school work 24/7 until i am caught up. i have no access to speak to anyone. i am incredibly lonely, i feel so useless, all my parents and sister do is yell at me and tell me how lazy i am. i cant do my homework! i cannot, no matter how hard i try, i cannot bring myself to do it. i am also struggling with many untreated mental, and physical health issues. i just feel like a waste. i have no one to talk to. lately ive just been thinking how much easier it would be if i were just gone. but i cant do it, because of guilt. im trapped. i dont know what to do.
