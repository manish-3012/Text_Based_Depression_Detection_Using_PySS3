First postI honestly donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even writing. I do things without thinking and I end up regretting it; I ended up reaching out to my school counselor and I just felt pathetic after. These intrusive thoughts are becoming too frequent, and I donâ€™t like them. All these thoughts I fucken hate them, theyâ€™re irrational and they keep coming. I just wanna die and stop it, I donâ€™t like this itâ€™s pointless, it all just feels like a distraction. Iâ€™m starting to fall in love with the dream
Of there being a day I have the opportunity to kill myself. I have a good life, I just hate it. I donâ€™t know What I want, I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking for. Iâ€™m fantasizing with the idea of being cheated on or my gf leaving me so I can just do it, and I can just go into nothingness. It sounds fucked up Bc I love her, she loves me and I donâ€™t want to leave her. I donâ€™t want this feelings, I donâ€™t want this thoughts, and I keep doing it to myself. I donâ€™t know what to do, I just... I wrote a bunch of random shit and I donâ€™t know what to expect. Lifeâ€™s shit for being this way, this concrete system. This concrete cycle, this is life and you have to Make The most of It and I just canâ€™t accept this. Iâ€™ll
End this with saying that I hate myself, I hate my thoughts and I hate Iâ€™m like this. Iâ€™m
A shit person, and I wish I was never born. I wanna die but I know Iâ€™ll
Regret it but then again itâ€™s Bc Iâ€™m
Alive.
