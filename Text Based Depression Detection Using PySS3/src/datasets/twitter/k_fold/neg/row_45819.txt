i cant handle thisim on a call with my friends, and this is going to be my last call before i end it. i dont want to be alive anymore, ive felt this for so long and i cant take it. im so sorry, if i could take back everything i would. everyone hates me and its okay, i get it. things would be better if i wasnt alive, im just a burden. my parents regret having me and the people i thought were my friends arent, i cant trust anyone. not even myself. ive fucked up so much, i dont want to live with my parents. i dont want to live with myself. i hate it here. 

no one cares about me, no one loves me and no one supports me.
