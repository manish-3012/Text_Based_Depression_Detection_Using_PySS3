i wanna die because of a girlhello, i'm need help, i've never asked anything on the web because i'm too paranoid. (forgive my english, i'm from swiss). i wanna die because i love a girl so much and she dont loves me. I told her about that bu nothing change. I dont know how to do to move on because i'm thinking about her every second of my f****** existance.  I'm dreamming about her almost everynight and i think i'm crazy (dependent personality disorder) i'm often acting like TV Show's character. when i talk to her i feel something that we (I et her) "break out", it's when my anger takes controll of my brain and i say things that i don't want to say at all. I think it's happening at the moment. I can't trust my parents to talk about it and I'm not social then i don't have any other friends but her. She is my Bestfriend (yes i'm friendzoned, laugh or not, I dont care anymore) i'm a bit obsessed about her (I scarified her name in my skin). I'm ugly and Evil. Then if someone could help me with that, it would be nice. I know it will be hard, I even tried to talk with gods but I don't have any answer. I don't know if I could stand that long. If it can help I can make you a list with all thing about DPD. Thanks you
