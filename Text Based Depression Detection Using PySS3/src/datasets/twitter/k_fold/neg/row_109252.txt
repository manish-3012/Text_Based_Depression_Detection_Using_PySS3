I decided on my method of self-deliverance today.I won't state exactly what it is because of sidebar guideline 1b but it'll be as painless and quick as a self-administered death can be.

The weirdest thing happened though. I was reading more about the finality of the decision (usual "this causes severe brain damage so make sure not be disturbed" line) when my throes of despair were replaced by fear. Like the adrenalin of a fight-or-flight response, I immediately shed my depression and became determined not to go through with it. How irritating. As was said in Candide;

*This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of the most fatal of our faults. For what could be more stupid than to go on carrying a burden we always long to lay down? To loathe, and yet cling to, existence? In short, to cherish the serpent that devours us, until it has eaten our hearts?*

That steely determination won't present itself anywhere useful though. It won't dismiss my crippling fear of failure nor help me get over all the squandering of all the advantages growing up as a straight white male in the western world grants me or keep poking me to continue chipping away at a task even if it's trying to correct 20 years of someone else's poor decisions. I'll do the mental equivalent of throwing myself down the Niesenbahn funicular staircase and be in unendurable agony but when faced with the ultimate end my emotions suddenly right themselves and keep me carrying on.

I fucking hate my brain.
