No notifications, no one talks to me and everyone avoids me, not even the mods of this Reddit respond to my cries for help, rejected by therapy, and my 17th birthday is coming up. I'm going to hang myself in my attic.This is my last fucking post. I blame every fucking person who didn't talk to me or at least try to help. I've posted on here for months, no help, I've tried dating apps over 30 times now, no luck. Nothing. 

Look I don't care anymore, no one helped me and that's their fatal fucking mistake, another life now gone. I fucking mean it this time, I will not only try, I will commit suicide.
