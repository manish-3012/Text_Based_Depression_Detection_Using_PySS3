Today is my 30th birthday, and my last day on earth.I am going to take some pills later on, and if they work I will die at exactly 30. I have made it longer than I thought I would five years ago, but suicide is my way out of hell. I am tired of being rejected by society for things out of my control such as my appearance, and personality. I wish I could run away from society, but the only way to result escape it is through death.
