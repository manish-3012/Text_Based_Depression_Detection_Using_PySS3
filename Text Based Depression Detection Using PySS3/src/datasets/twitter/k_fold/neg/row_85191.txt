I need someone... The pain is killing me...BACKSTORY

Around last year, my best friend broke up with her boyfriend. I was the person she went to becuase she was about to commit suicide, multiple times i tell you! Later, I had a major crush on her... I never made the move though. I had plenty of opportunities, we had 2 sleepovers.. The first one was tame, the second one was kissing city! I was dating however during the second sleepover so I couldn't make a move, but we promised... We would be with each other after i was done. A few weeks ago, I made my move! I asked her out!!! She wasn't interested she said... no big deal, maybe I'll just wait a little bit... A week later, she found herself someone, they weren't me... Everything was gone... I lost control of everything... I was jealous, I was pissed, I was depressed... and I went too far... I tried hanging myself... I wanted her to see me dead, so before I attempted, I texted her to come over.  I didn't know she was only a few houses down at a friends house...  She barged into my room just as I was able to knock over the chair I was standing on. I had the rope around my neck... and I just needed to kick away the chair.  

Later she told me this was a very selfish act and I was just being jealous.  It all feels strange... thinking back about it...

END OF BACK STORY

I think I need help... or someone to talk to...  She was my only friend... and I feel like i lost her
