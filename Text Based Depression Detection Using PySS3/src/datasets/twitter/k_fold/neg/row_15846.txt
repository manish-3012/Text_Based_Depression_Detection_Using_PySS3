If I had no obligations, I would sleep all day. I am not liking life. HelpAll my feelings about life:
I dont enjoy having friends,talking with people, having people/family take care of me and make conversation,eating good food,having sex,driving fast cars,going shopping,buying jewelry I dont laugh at anything, i am not interested in any hobby Previously my goal in life was money but now I see that what will money bring me if i cant enjoy anything or not interested in anything whatsoever? My daily life is made up of studying for a business degree(or desperately trying to, very unproductive and retaining and understanding information is extremely hard) and nothing else. I sleep when I am tired of studying because I find nothing else to do to be interesting. Studying is a requirement so I force myself to do it (very hard, I am sleeping more than actually studying). I would sleep all day if I wasnt at university. My parents are paying for my expenses and university(do not think it is me who want to be there).
LIFE HAS BECOME EXTREMELY BORING THAT I HAVE NO PURPOSE OF LIVING. I HAVE NOT CHOSEN SUICIDE BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING TO LIVING THAT I AM NOT SEEING NOW. Could you help me?
Tl;dr: I find life and all that surround it extremely boring and I cannot live like that anymore (feeling extremly down to the point where I favor sleeping to being awake). Help
