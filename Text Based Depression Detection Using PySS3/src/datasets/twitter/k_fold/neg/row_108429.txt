I can't be happy no matter whatI mtf have no idea what I need to do to sort my life out. I get quite severely dysphoric, mostly about body hair, genitals and just general structure of the body, that sometimes gets to the point of self harm just to get my mind off it. There are some things I like about my body such as I'm tall, have a good metabolism and have have quite nice thick black hair, but everything else about me I hate, I am an ugly shit and will never pass as a girl, no matter how much surgery I have or how many hormones I take. And even if I do begin transitioning, physically or surgery, I'll just loose all my friends and family because they're all extremely anti-lgbt I get called a faggot every day just for growing my hair and it's not even that long yet, so I have no idea what to do. I'll never be a woman and I'll never be happy as a man, and even if I could become female I would still be an ugly shit and all my family would reject me. What the fuck should I do with my life? I feel like I'm going to kill myself in the future no matter what, I can't be happy as a man and will never be a woman. I feel like the best thing I can do is pretend to be happy as I am for as long as I can just to please my friends and family. Everyone says women on HRT pass and are beautiful, but they clearly aren't, and even if some people are luckily enough to barely pass, I never will, because I have masculine features from my father that will never let me pass as a woman. What's the fucking point in anything anymore honestly.
