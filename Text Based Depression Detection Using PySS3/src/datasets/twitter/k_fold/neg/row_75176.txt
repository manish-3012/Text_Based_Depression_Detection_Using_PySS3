Whatâ€™s the pointWhatâ€™s the point of learning to accept the pain and living a life you donâ€™t want to live. Whatâ€™s the point of being on a ball you donâ€™t care to be on. Whatâ€™s the point of living life. out of the people who have held on some still say I wish I had done it decades ago Iâ€™ve been through just so much more so whatâ€™s the point whatâ€™s the god damn point of fighting if you have no drive. Arenâ€™t you then just a skin sack using the worlds  depleting resources?
