I hate my job and want to kill myselfI put in my two weeks notice at my job yesterday and my parents went ballistic. They are absolutely adamant that I should have another job lined up before leaving my current one. Now they want me to go in and ask about taking back my resignation and I really don't want to. They just don't understand that being there is fucking killing me. All day I think about either lying down in front of a train or buying a shotgun. I've tried explaining this to them, but they don't care.
