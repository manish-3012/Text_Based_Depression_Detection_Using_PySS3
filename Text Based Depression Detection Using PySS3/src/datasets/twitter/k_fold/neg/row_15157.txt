Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s being suicidal but I keep fantasising about stepping off a cliff.It keeps making me feel peaceful.

The last time I felt this way was nearly two years ago.

I decided to go for a walk and I suppose I donâ€™t know what came over me but I took a step off.

The next thing I remember is holding onto the safety fencing and trying desperately to pull myself back up.

I donâ€™t really know what to think but Iâ€™m thinking  of it.

Not sure I should go for a walk tonight.
