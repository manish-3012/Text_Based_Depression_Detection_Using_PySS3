morningsEvery morning I wake up and refuse to get out of bed. I am a 25 year old male computer programmer with a well paying job. I like to get in as early as possible but am only obligated to be in by 10. I wake up at 7 every morning (disciplined sleep schedule) and am hit by an unbelievable need to escape. Thoughts of suicide abound. I do not want to go to work, I do not want to live on this planet anymore, I just want to die. I have researched means of suicide, and as time has passed I have become more calm about the idea. I am no longer afraid of death.

I feel pain every day. I am miserable at work. After work, I spend my few remaining hours of free time assaulted by irrational fears. I have no desire to perform at my job. I DO perform, but only because itâ€™s a necessity; until death comes, I need income.

The idea of sharing this is humiliating to me. I canâ€™t imagine what other people at work would think if they saw this. I feel no real emotional connection with anyone.

At work, it seems everyone wants to be my friend. I am met with friendly greetings, hellos, questions about games, or my beard (?) (an abnormally large amount of men have taken interest in my beard - i donâ€™t know if i should take this to mean i will attract more women this way). I view everyone as stupid and annoying. I wish no one would talk to me. I feel that it is impossible that they are actually this friendly. Surely there is an alterior motive. I hate them and wish they would stop treating me with such respect. It feels irrational and not right for some reason.

I wish I was dead. That is constantly the strongest feeling, I wish I was dead.

Everyone told me I needed success to be happy in life. Well, it didnâ€™t work.
