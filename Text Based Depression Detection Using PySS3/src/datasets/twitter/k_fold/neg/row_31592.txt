I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll survive this weekMy best friend, or however I should call him, keeps making backhanded comments about me and posting about how our relationship is ruined and all of it. Thing is, he is basically the only reason Iâ€™m alive. I texted him saying that if it was about me he could just tell me and idk whatâ€™s about to happen. He treats me like absolute shit sometimes but I just love him so fucking much and he has helped me with my suicidal thoughts since I was twelve. My life is empty and I always feel like such shit but I could never kill myself because of what it would do to him. Itâ€™s okay if he doesnâ€™t want to recover our friendship anymore and I get it but I donâ€™t know how to deal with it. I know I shouldnâ€™t depend on other people and bla bla bla, I donâ€™t need advice I just want to vent so please donâ€™t try to give it to me. I already had such a shitty week in front of me and Iâ€™m definitely not planning on doing it but I know myself and know how often Iâ€™ve had to flush random pills through the toilet because I had a mental breakdown and wanted to do it. Idk what iâ€™m saying at this pointto be honest iâ€™m just so scared. Iâ€™m always so fucking scared. Iâ€™m so sorry
