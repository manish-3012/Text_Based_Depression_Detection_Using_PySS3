Fuck it. No throwaway.I don't want to keep living. I don't want to die, I just want to never have lived. I'm too spineless to actually do anything planned, one day I'll just have enough and off myself. 

I have nothing to believe in. Religion was forced down my throat as a kid and now I don't believe in that. I don't believe in the goodness of people, they fuck me over too often. People always think that I'm strong because of an exhausting facade I carefully cultivated. They think I can handle their shit. I can't. Everybody, even my family of which I am the youngest, always assumed I could take care of myself.

My dad was a dick who would torture my two older sisters then turn around and try to be father of the year to me. It fucked me up inside. Then he "got better." Then he got fired. Then he got cancer. 

Everybody played him to be a martyr and such a good guy. I don't know if he changed or if people see what they want to see in the sick. 

I went from living in a full house with a mom, a dad, two sisters and a dog. My sisters go to school across the nation and my dad has a cancer that's likely to come back soon and kill him. My dog is sixteen years old and every time she falls a little bit of me dies inside because I know she's going, too. It's just going to be me and my mom soon.

None of my "friends" care and I'm moving next year anyway. I can make friends when I'm not depressed, but I don't think I can anymore. I'm too comfortable coasting with my current group to remember how to be charming. I am slowly quitting all my many extra curriculars because I have no energy to do any thing. I hate everything yet long for the world. I'm so fucking ambitious yet apathetic and lazy. The world can't hold good things for my future so what's the point? I have countless stories of being screwed over by people who think I can take it. What a better way to finally show weakness than by taking a leap out of my window.
