I have to do it. I really think I have to.There's no other option. Living is shit so I should kill myself and be done with it. Anything I'm missing here? And I mean living is **shit**. Life can go fuck itself. Fuck it. Fuck this I am fucking done. 

EDIT: Here's to hoping that I can hold onto this determination until I get home from school. I'm sick of being a sniveling coward and never doing it.
