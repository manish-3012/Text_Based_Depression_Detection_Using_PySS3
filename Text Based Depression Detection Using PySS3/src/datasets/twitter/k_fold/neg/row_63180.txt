Help17. In clinic. Moving to another clinic tomorrow. All hope is gone. I can't bear it anymore. Going to an open station. It gets better my ass. Don't know how to best kill myself there, I can still do it here. Ran out of ideas for methods, can someone please suggest something.
Almost two months of medical care and medication haven't changed anything, miss me with the don't do it shit
