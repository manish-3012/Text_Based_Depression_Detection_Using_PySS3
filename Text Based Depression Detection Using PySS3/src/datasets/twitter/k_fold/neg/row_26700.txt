32 in July and I want to let goI want to let go so badly. I did what was asked for so long, I reached out, I tried and now I want to be gone. If my mother just came up to me and hugged me and said, "I love you, you can't leave", if anyone just intervened and said I actually mattered in this big picture, I'd be willing to fight a little longer but there's NOTHING from them. I'm 31, the need for attention is fucking over. I'm so fucking angry and unloved.

There's no relief. I have a bottle of klonopin, and I know better. That won't actually kill me, it might knock me out for relief but the consequences would just be dire.

I don't understand hospitalization either. It's really just there to keep me safe, isn't it? The last time I left, I didn't feel "better", they just had me on more mind numbing medication. The hotlines are bullshit. 7cups is bullshit. Therapists... I don't have the energy to explain all of this to get the exact same response I always do.

It's just not in me anymore. I don't feel joy. It's sorrow. There isn't an hour that I'm not thinking about it. I can't take anymore.
