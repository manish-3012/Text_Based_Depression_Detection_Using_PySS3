I'm really going through something rough and I need a third-party perspective on it and I'm too ashamed to talk to any of my friendsEven reddit isn't anonymous enough for me; I don't want to write my problems somewhere that people can see them.

I don't want to talk to anyone on the phone - I wouldn't be able to open up.

Is there somewhere you can anonymously talk to someone online and the conversation doesn't get saved?

edit:  Thanks everyone.  I got the third-party perspective I needed.  I really really appreciate all of you.
