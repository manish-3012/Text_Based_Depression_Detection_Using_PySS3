bad thoughtsI have this voice in my head, and at night it keeps telling me to â€œcall it quitsâ€ like just end the suffering, parents donâ€™t understand why I stay up all night, just canâ€™t stop thinking, canâ€™t relax. Iâ€™m just sick of this, never have any motivation, I want to start working and get my drivers license, but I have zero motives to go do it, I just think itâ€™s not worth because I feel like Iâ€™ll be gone soon. Iâ€™m on meds and they donâ€™t seem to be working, itâ€™s been about a year now and no real differences, Iâ€™ve been to many therapists and they donâ€™t work and donâ€™t wanna waste my parents money on that stupid shit, Just sick of being a disappointment.
