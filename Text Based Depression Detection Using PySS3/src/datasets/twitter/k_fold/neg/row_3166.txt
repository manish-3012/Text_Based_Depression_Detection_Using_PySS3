I think this might be my suicide letterI wrote this a while back, but my feelings haven't changed.

&amp;#x200B;

 Can't really think of a reason to get out of bed today. I think this might be what a downward spiral is all about. Anyway, hope some of you can relate, see you in another life.

The want to want.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have never been a driven guy. I have always been one who steers clear from change, lingering in the status quo. I chose what university to go to with little to no research, I chose a major simply because I had to, I am who I am, where I am, because of uninformed decisions made through my own laziness and the constant harassment of friends and family urging, coaxing, begging me to try to be a positive member of society. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is I donâ€™t want that. I have little work ethic and have found no passions in life beyond napping and drinking. With the GPA I have earned through over indulging my finite pastimes the future ahead of me looks bleak and grim. Iâ€™ll get a mid range paying job at a reputable firm with a long and corporate sounding title thatâ€™ll do little but stroke my ego because in reality Iâ€™ll spend the next 30 years giving away my time, passion, and sanity to a concrete building and a fat man behind a desk. I see people grasping at even the smallest opportunities with both hands but I can barely rouse myself to watch them as they pass me by.

My father is a self made millionaire, born in a small European town, both my sisters were lucky enough to go to a great high school where they both passed with mostly all A\*s (I remember my sister crying because she only got an A on something in school, she thought sheâ€™d never go to university.) Me? I pat myself on the back when I go to all my classes in a week, or when I didnâ€™t do as bad on the test I didnâ€™t study for as I thought I had.

&amp;#x200B;

Iâ€™m constantly surrounded by people whoâ€™s average is my extra mile, who are driven and emboldened by the things that they do, who have a set path in front of them and are doing everything in their power to push themselves forward. I have squandered countless chances, where others have spent their entire life climbing to, I have found myself simply drifting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess Iâ€™m not sure where to go from here. I am dissatisfied with mediocrity, yet have no passion to change it. I want to want the things that get people out of bed in the morning, but I donâ€™t. Every second of every day feels like I am just waiting, waiting for something more, waiting for something to put butterflies in my stomach again, waiting for something to remind me that life shouldnâ€™t be just waiting.
