Dealing with my feelingsSo my counselor and I have been working on how to deal with my feelings when they come up and it's all so new to me. I dont like feeling. I wish I didnt have emotions, it would make life so much easier if we were all just robots. 
My boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago. We were poly so he had another girlfriend and she was new to the relationship but he basically let her break up with me for him. He barely said anything. Tonight I let out all of my feelings about the situation and I dont feel any better than I did before. It doesnt change anything either. Hes still gone. And to make things even better he and I just signed a one year lease so I have to live with him. 
I'm feeling a mix of emotions that I cant even name. I dont like it. I dont know how to actually cop with my feelings and I hate it. I was doing so well too for a while I didn't have suicidal thoughts and now I just dont even have the will to live anymore. And I feel so alone.
