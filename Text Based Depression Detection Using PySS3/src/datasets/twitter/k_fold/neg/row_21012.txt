Honestly, what is really the point? Why stay?They say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but that's not really true, is it? Life is the only permanency any of us know. It's the only thing I want to really end for me. Everyone else can keep living. Fuck it. I didn't wanna live to see 30 anyways.
