Help....I don't even know where to start. My partner of 16 years and wife of 6 MONTHS came back from Ireland requesting a separation. Through some sleuthing, it's found that she hooked up with a guy in Ireland (to some degree...), continued the relationship after she got back, until he cut her off entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

Now she wants a divorce.

&amp;#x200B;

Claims she needs to 'find herself' and be 'independent' 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah. That's enough to be suicidal, right?

Last Saturday night on the way home from the hockey game, after consuming two beers, I ran through a check stop and failed the breathalyzer. I've currently lost my license for 90d so far.

I've already decided how I'll do it. Fentanyl overdoes. Quick, painless, and there won't be anyone around to save me as I'm living alone, and I don't think dogs can administer Naloxzone.
