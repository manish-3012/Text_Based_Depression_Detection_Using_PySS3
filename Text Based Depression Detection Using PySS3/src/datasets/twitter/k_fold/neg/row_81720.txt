Suicidal Thoughts Every Day For the Last WeekTitle, I guess. It really fucking sucks man. Itâ€™s such a fucking struggle to wake up every morning and do the same thing day by day, week by week. My life feels like it has lost all purpose, if it ever even had any. I really hope this ends soon. Everything hurts, all the time. I canâ€™t sleep at night, I canâ€™t focus during the day, it all just hurts so bad.
