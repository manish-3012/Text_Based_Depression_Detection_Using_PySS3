im losti just dont know what to do anymore.  i keep holding out, hoping things will get better. but they never do, not in a long-term way. theres so many thoughts in my head.
i guess its hard realizing that im not the hero of the story: thungs dont have to have a happy ending. i never outright believed that, i dont think anyone does. But in the back of my mind ive always just believed that things HAVE to get better, you know? but they dont, and for me they wont. even on medication that works im always thinking about my ex, hoping, praying for her to come back. it always comes back to her, no matter where i am, who im with, what im doing. its always her, its always been her. and i ruined it. over a year ago. who still thinks and misses there ex a year later?? me, apperently. 
im sorry for rambling but i literally cant hold on any longer. i wont let anyone trick me into thinking things will get better. because even when they are better im still missing her. and everyone except me knows shes not coming back. im tired of waiting for the impossible to happen. so goodbye. im sorry i wasnt better. some people never get their happy endings.
