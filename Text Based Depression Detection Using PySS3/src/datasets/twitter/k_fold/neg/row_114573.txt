I just don't have the strength anymore...so tiredYa this might be a little long but I'm a wits end. Sorry if I sound bitchy too, I haven't eaten in 3 days. I'm 20, almost 21. I only have a few college credits. I know I need a degree. (I want one too) I just...I have so many aspirations for my life. I just feel like I'm at a road block. With student loans and some money my grandma left me, obtaining my Bachelors is obtainable, but it's going to be tight. The problem I'm struggling with is just surviving. I work an $11 an hour job in construction. Work anywhere from 30-50 hours a week. It sucks so bad. Especially during the summer. I know I sound like a bitch but I'm so sick of it. I just want a normal inside or desk job. I hate that how my day is going to go depends on what the weather is. I'm already a bit behind on bills. Starting august I have no where to stay. I can't find anything in my price range. Even on Craigslist. So ya, I'm screwed on that end. Looking to spend about $300 a month. Most people I know in this area pay between 250-300 so it's def possible. I'm just so behind on bills and I don't have the short term motivation to survive anymore. Like I have long term goals. But everything seems so improbable now. I wanted to be involved with film or archaeolgy. But now that I'm always so stressed and hungry and behind and busy, I want to major in something where I can be comfortable. It's sad that life does that to you but oh well. I did the whole military thing but eventually got kicked out because of my asthma so that option is closed. I used to want to live, now I just want to survive. All my friends from college are all out living it up, or their parents pay for everything so all the money they're earning is just spending money. Like I honestly want to die. I don't think I'd actually do it, but it just seems so much better. Don't tell me to call a suicide hotline. I like who I am. I'm just a very ambitious person. I'm also a very all or nothing person. Bad combo. Makes me just want to give up if I know achieving what I want in life is unobtainable. I want to go to seminary after college, but I don't know what to major in anymore. Im thinking finance? I might try and get a diplomatic job in the gov after college. I really wanted to get into film or archaeology but I just feel like I'll never have the time or money to do that...Reddit. You're my last hope. Somebody tell me what to do. I'm tired of winging everything. I just want somebody to tell me what to do.

P.s- yes I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was younger. Took antidepressants for about 10 years. Stopped several months ago and actually feel better
