I feel like a ghostI want to talk to people, but I'm too worried and afraid to approach people thinking they'll think I'm weird or annoying. So I just stay silent and hesitate about what I will say to people. I've got no one I can talk to in real life, and that's all I want. I can't keep things from being boring. If I was dead I'm sure most of the people in my classes would just be surprised who I was/was in their class.
