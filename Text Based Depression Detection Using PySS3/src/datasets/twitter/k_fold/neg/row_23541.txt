Don't know what to do.I'm thinking of ending it all. My ex left me for someone else, my friends and I have grown distant from each other. All I do everyday is go to work, exercise, and sleep with therapy once a week. I keeping trying tell myself it will get better eventually, but I don't know when it will. I'm tired of being alone.
