Ready to goI Have no one, Iâ€™m a failure at everything in which Iâ€™ve ever put effort, and Iâ€™m in pain all the time. If the quality of your life can be assessed through your social bonds, your successes, and how you feel, isnâ€™t my existence objectively worth ending? In my 30s, been like this since I was nine, and as an adult Iâ€™ve learned to hide myself when Iâ€™m feeling bad because I tend to make irrational decisions. No one ever notices Iâ€™m gone, and then when I do reconnect with people or make new connections I end up terrifying them or being a nightmare friend. My roommate of a year and a half is getting short notice that Iâ€™m moving out and he seemed relieved when I told him, I made friends with this girl online I ended up growing a fixation over which terrified her to the point of blocking me on all social media platforms, and when I asked my parents if I could move back in with them their first response was â€œare you going to take advantage of us?â€ Literally nobody on any level of social relations wants me around. My parents own a lot of guns. They canâ€™t keep all their closets and safes locked ALL the time. I tried to confide in a coworker today about my problems and it freaked him out and now Iâ€™m embarrassed to talk to him. Nothing and nobody.
