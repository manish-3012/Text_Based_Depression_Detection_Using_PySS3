Just so damn tired of trying to make life workI recently fucked up and now I'm jobless. I've been trying to look on the bright side and use this as an opportunity to focus on making a YouTube career, but I dont have the time because my gf is the type of person that sucks up all your time with her shit and doesnt understand that I have shit to do during the day. 
I try to stay positive and get stuff done little by little while still looking for work, but there's Jack shit for me in the area I currently live in. It's hard to deal with rejected resumes day after day, and just try to smile through it. My depression is getting worse and worse. My gf either has no clue how to help with it or doesnt care. I can't kill myself because I dont want to put my family though that. I'm just stuck feeling like shit till I fall asleep hoping tomorrow will be better.
