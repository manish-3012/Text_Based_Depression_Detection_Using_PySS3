Last moments of the journeyI've just finished writing my suicidal letter. I've always laughed about people who committed suicide, but now I know how it feels. Nothing makes sense anymore and I don't want to. I've had enough been broken hearted it hurts so bad I can't even describe for you guys. I doing this for love, because I love myself I want the pain to stop. I'm writing this because part of me, a very small one, still trying to live. I'm scared of what I'm about to do. I don't want to do it, but my existence is only pain. I've never known anything but that. I be tried my best to come to terms with life, to improve myself and I did, but apparently it not enough. You meet someone only so God can take that person from you and live a hole inside you. I'm full of holes. I'm tired. I don't know why I'm writing this. There's no question to be answered. There's nothing that will make me happy. I can't see the future anymore. Do you really think that suicidal people go to hell, even if it was for self love, for not wanting to be hurt and sad anymore?
