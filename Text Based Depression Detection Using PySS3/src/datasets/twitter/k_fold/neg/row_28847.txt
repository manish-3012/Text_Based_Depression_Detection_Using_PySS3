Iâ€™m 26 and Iâ€™m over it all alreadyIâ€™m signing for a new house today and just had my second child just 3 months ago. Iâ€™m married now have two great children but I feel like Iâ€™m never happy. I should be excited for today but instead all I can think about it throwing myself over the edge of a tall building. I know I canâ€™t because my children deserve a father but I feel like no one not even my wife cares how I feel or cares about me at all. Life is stressful I know this but it seems like everyone from my wife to family to coworkers only care about what I can do for them. Itâ€™s hard and getting harder and Iâ€™m struggling to keep going. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can take all this before I call it quits. This whole world is going to shit and no one loves one another anymore. I need love too and all that seems to happen is everyone around me sucks what little life and happiness I have. Iâ€™m just not sure how much longer I can last...
