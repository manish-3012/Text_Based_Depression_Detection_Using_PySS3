Incest, STD, Psychosis, depression.I'll keep this short. I'm Matt, I'm 19. 

I was sexually abused by my older brother from the age 5-9.

One of my earliest memories is him ejaculating in my mouth. 

Life goes on, I'm a depressed loner for obvious reason. 

Meet a girl fall in love. I'm probably 14. Shits good for a while but she cheats on me. We have an on again off again relationship. She's basically a whore but I love her, and she knows I love her, so she uses me.

Turn to marijuana for relief. 
Marijuana is my best friend. Not your typical stoner, no I love this plant. I learn everything there is to know about it, this plant saved my life, I finally find something I'm passionate about. I finally find something that makes me feel human. 

Then one day a couple weeks ago, it turns on me and I have a psychotic break down. Diagnosed with PTSD and psychotic depression. 

Girl hits me up a couple weeks ago. Only girl I've ever been with. We have sex. Now I have a rash in my pubic area, that is probably herpes or worse.

My life is a series of bad descions. 
Part of me knows it's not entirely my fault, the smarter part of me knows I deserved everything that comes my way. 

I don't want to die. But I'm garbage. Life is garbage, people are garbage. Fuck it. I think I will turn the cars on in the garage and let it all slip away.

There's nothing here for me.
