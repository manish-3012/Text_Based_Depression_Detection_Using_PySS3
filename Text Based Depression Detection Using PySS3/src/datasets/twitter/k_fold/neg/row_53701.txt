I let everybody down again...I failed again. I got a job, went through orientation, fought all my anxiety, but still ended up being too scared and I didn't even go in for the first day of training. I cant fucking do it. Im so stupid, i feel so bad for everybody I let down. I seriously thought i could make a life for myself. What a foolish mistake...
