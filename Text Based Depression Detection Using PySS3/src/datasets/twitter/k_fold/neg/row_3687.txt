I have already taken 50 10mg allergy tablets. And mixing more.I have lost my partner due to a bpd mother. He was my partner for nearly 7 years. And he suddenly just had enough of the heartache she has caused us both for years. 

All our plans are shattered. My life was hanging in his hands too.  My certainty of a new home and life in a new city is shattered. 

I won't be telling anyone I know of my plans to slowly end my life. I know I have friends that do love me; But I can't quite face the idea of having to live with the blame of not being able to be strong enough for my partner and not living up to his standards of dealing with my bpd mother.

It's not anyone's fault. This is my own battle and I am fully aware. I have come to realise I will never be good enough for certain people and that is why I need to end my life.
