I don't know what to do.For years I have ridden waves of depression. To be honest, I've actually been far more depressed than I am at this moment, but as time goes on suicide seems like my only option for relief. 
I'm 23, I have a job, and I've just started seeing someone, but despite all of that I cannot help but stare at one of my guns at night, or think of  the razor blades in the drawer. 
I don't think that I'm in crisis in the same way that some people on here are, and I feel for these guys, but I'm worried that one day I won't stop myself. 
The worst part of all of this has been feeling like friends and family don't want to listen anymore. I understand. They've gotten tired, and it's easier for them to believe that I'm fine, and not to ask or talk to me. Even my therapist seems to have ceased to care now that my insurance has run out. I don't know anymore. I don't even know why I've posted this.
