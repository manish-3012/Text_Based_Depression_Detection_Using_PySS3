Fixed on the rope.. Dreaming of the rope.. Buying the rope.. The correct length of the rope.. Width of the rope.. Fixated on the rope..My mind has become fixated with my death, my whole life upto now I've done what I want! It's all catching up with me!
Family hate me.. Loss of relationships.. Debt massive debt of money.. No friends..
Even worst my family are trying to make out they have worked with me for all these years and they have done there best for me! When they haven't they have pushed me out when nercery.. Ive had serval breakdowns over the years.!
All caused directly by my dad he has built other sybloms up so strong.. and they are all tapped in the head by him... My alchol addiction was brought on by him... Me being the eldest... He sat with me most nights and drank and smoked.... Now he users this against me!!
I've tried to escape so many times from his influence but... I'm struggling with to cope with the failure system set up for me in which he controls!
Please help and look out side of addiction!
I'm 31!
