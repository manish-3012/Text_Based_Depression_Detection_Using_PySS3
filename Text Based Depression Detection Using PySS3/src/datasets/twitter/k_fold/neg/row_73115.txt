Need adviceHi all. I am here again on another throwaway. I just need someone to tell me the right thing to do. Maybe there isnâ€™t a right thing.

I have recently started a new unpaid internship that is very far from me. I am commuting 2.5+ Hours a day to do it. My parents are helping me pay for gas, which is weighing on my conscience. The position is not what I expected. I spend 70% of the day sitting in a windowless room reading literature. I am to design my own project and then spend 4 months writing a paper on it and doing a PowerPoint presentation. 

While this all  would benefit a career in this field, I am no longer sure this is what I want to do with my life. I certainly donâ€™t want to write research papers forever. I am only thinking of the drive up tomorrow and how I want to drive my car off every bridge I pass. This position was prestigious to get (only one position available) and I will not get this chance again. 

I think I should go to the hospital but the last time I was there it only made it worse. I am afraid to give up this internship because I will never get it again and if I do decide I want to stay in this field, I will have left a good opportunity to get there. If I give it up, I only have a part time job currently that is only one day a week because of the off season. 

I am late 20s and itâ€™s becoming too late to change my career again. I think this may be my only opportunity but I really just want to end it. Iâ€™m tired of relying on my parents and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ever going to be happy.

Thanks for reading.
