Life Sentence (Vent)When I witnessed my mother attempt suicide, I can remember a poignant conversation I had with my Dad. 
He asked me where she did it, and his reaction to my response has resonated with me since. 

Almost proudly, I professed that she did so in front of me. Any explanation or words of comfort were absent in the face of the fact that my childhood was over. I was too young to appreciate the gravity of what I had witnessed, and instead rather perversely resumed playing with my teddies and toys. 

Upon reflecting on this experience, I feel neglected by those who were meant to nurture me. Although witnessing a suicide attempt at the age of eight is undoubtedly harrowing - just as it wasnâ€™t the end of my motherâ€™s life - it did not have to be the end of my mine.
