I don't know what to doI've been depressed ever since I can remember. I'm 22 and I've tried taking my life twice. I've been suicidal since I was around 12. I've tried taking pills(antidepressants and anti psychotics) to help me but they just make me feel like I don't have a personality and robotic. I used to be pretty fit as I used my time to work out. But I got sick and lost 40 lbs. I think the sickness was me just being depressed and not wanting to eat. They still don't know what happened but I started eating again. 

I've never really had too many friends. Maybe 10 people I could call friends throughout my life. The past few years I've become very narcissistic and I just can't stand people. I hate going out and dealing with everyone. 

So as of a week ago I was dating the same girl for 4 years and even though she would make me so happy, it would always be momentary. But she had really been helping me with my view of life and trying to get me out of being depressed. She was the first person who actually cared about me. She finally had enough of me being like this and broke up with me a few days ago. She really was the only thing keeping me alive, as i would call her when i had bad thoughts.

Straight out of high school I went to college for culinary as cooking is the one thing I know and that I'm good at. I've never had any other jobs than being a cook. As soon as I was done college i wanted out of the industry. So I just created 20,000$ worth of debt for nothing. Now with that debt I can't go back to school to do something I may actually enjoy. 

I smoke a lot of weed and I'm mentally addicted to it. If i don't smoke in the morning then I'll get sick and start vomiting. I don't want to smoke anymore as I feel it doesn't help my mental and financial situation.

So recently i really feel like what's the point of another bullshit year. I really want to end it but i can't get over what my family would go through. I need help getting through this
