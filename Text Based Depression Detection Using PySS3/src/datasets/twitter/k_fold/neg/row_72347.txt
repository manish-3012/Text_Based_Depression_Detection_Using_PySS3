I have no redeeming qualitiesMy child's disabled. I don't know how to take care of my kid, and it's overwhelming. Sometimes I resent my child, and I hate myself for it. I'm in a bad relationship, but I stay because I can't take care of my child by myself. That alone makes me a waste of space.

I keep screwing up my job because I can't handle the pressure, and I break down. I'm depressed, and I can't take time off from work to get help because I'm on thin ice as it is. The only places my insurance will pay for have banker's hours, so I would have to miss work to get an appointment.

I've called the suicide hotline, and it felt better. I felt like I had hope, but it's all falling apart again. I'm so tired of feeling abnormal, angry, worthless. Nothing to be proud of.
