I almost hung myself, but then I got high.I've been thinking about it for a while.
This morning was an especially tough one, for reasons I'll leave unknown. But in the past 3 weeks, my boyfriend's best friend shot himself, my dad has told me I am worthless, my boyfriend has told me he thought I'd be the one to kill myself first, my boss has told me that I'm a terrible worker for taking off three days for a funeral... I'm drowning. I'm only 17. And this is on top of a million other problems. But anyways.
I hung myself from my bathroom doorknob with a belt.  Everything felt like it was going fine, except I could still breathe.
I readjusted my head and BAM. 10 seconds in my body went cold, my head started to float and I thought "Hey, I feel high as fuck".. off of oxygen deprivation. Ended up sliding my head out and enjoying the feeling, instead. 
The one good feeling I've had in a long, long time.
