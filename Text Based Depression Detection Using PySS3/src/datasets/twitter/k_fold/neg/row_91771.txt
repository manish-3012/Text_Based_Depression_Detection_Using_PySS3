Feel trappedIt's so cliche but that;s how I feel.   
I'm stuck in a job I hate, that doesnt even give me enough hours to cover basic bills let alone give me a chance to crawl out the mass of debt I have from years of just not being able to afford anything so overdraft and credit cards were my only way I could find to live.  
I don't enjoy anything anymore, I feel like a burden to my girlfriend and friend who I live with, but if I end it all they get left dealing with paying my share of house bills and stuff. I dont want them to deal with that, but I can barely keep going as it is. I just needed to get this out. I am going to the doctors to see what they can do but I'm running out of time and energy, I dont know what to do.
