Do not know what to do.I really do not know what to do anymore, life seems so meaningless, no hope no future. I am a male who turns 21 on Saturday, lives in my Dad's basement with barely any friends, never hope of a girlfriend or really making new friends, I have a super stressful job but can't take a break from it or else I really will go insane. I had written up a huge amount of text explaining what I've been through but saw it was too long and was not finished yet so I'll give a TL;DR I suppose.

* It started when I was 14, girl that I have known since I was 2 years old and I were getting quite close but I am very shy and in general very socially awkward, someone else asked her out. Her Boyfriend got her pregnant when we were 15 and I blame myself, I feel stupid for it but I have always been very hard on myself.

*when I was 15 my step dad moved out, at first I thought it was great but then I had to take on responsibilities that were not mine to have. While my mother did pretty much nothing I had to raise my two younger brothers for about a year, skipped out on breakfast and lunch to make sure they were ok, eventually I snapped, after a year I was done and moved in with my Dad. my relationship with my mother and that side of my family is nonexistent, my Dad and I have never really got along well, and most family lives out of town. I can very honestly say I hate my family and they hate me too. 

* In my final high school year I got terribly ill with a skin infection and had to miss a semester of school, with no emotional support from family and not having any friends this was spent mostly by myself. Having 4-5ish months to myself, being alone with what I have previously been through, was absolute hell and I sunk into a depression that I have never really got out of. Having to take 6 classes in second semester also caused a very large amount of stress that just added onto the depression. Things finally got to the point of where I had trouble getting out of bed, having absolutely no motivation to, after I finished highschool I started waking up later and later, latest being around 3:30 pm.

*A few months ago I finally got a job but it can get stressful too, physically demanding and have been working many hours to the point of being absolutely exhausted. I know I cannot keep up with what is being demanded of me for much longer, but I also cannot take a break because I spend days off home and talking to no one anyway.

My apologies for this being so long, I tried to TL;DR it but kind of failed. I tried to summarize it so a few things may have been left out. I really really need help, I have tried talking about what I have been through a few different times but it has not helped at all. I need help, I have very few friends, none who can spend the time with me that I mentally need to recover, a family who hates me and I hate back, and a stressful job I cannot keep doing for much longer. More and more I think about how great it would be to die, to finally be released from the Burdens of the Past and thoughts of suicide have been more and more common.

I probably did a terrible job of explaining what I have been through as I am very tired right now and need sleep but please Reddit, I need help, the end comes soon. For those who actually read my giant wall of text, thank you very much.
