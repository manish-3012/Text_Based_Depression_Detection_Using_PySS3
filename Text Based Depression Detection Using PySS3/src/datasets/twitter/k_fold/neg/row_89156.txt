Trying to help a suicidal friendIâ€™m not sure if this was the right place to post this, but it seemed appropriate. A person I met online a few weeks ago has been saying some very concerning things about wanting to kill himself. Heâ€™s bulimic and eats less than 1000 calories a day, and a couple of days ago he started uncontrollably shaking due to low blood sugar (at least, that was his assessment). Iâ€™m not certain on all of the details, as he doesnâ€™t want to talk about his personal life beyond the obvious cries for help he makes on a daily basis, but I have made a few educated guesses- everything from here on should be taken with a grain of salt. He lives with his parents (who donâ€™t appear to like him very much by his account), has no job, and essentially no education. He feels like a leech with nothing to contribute and genuinely believes the world would be a better place without him. He said his parents would get over his death in a year and would have more freedom and money without him leeching. He used to be extremely overweight and lives in fear of becoming that way again. Unfortunately I can only talk to him online (and he doesnâ€™t like to show his face at all and he hates his voice). I donâ€™t know much about him or what his specific thoughts are but I want to help him any way I can. I genuinely believe he may do it.
