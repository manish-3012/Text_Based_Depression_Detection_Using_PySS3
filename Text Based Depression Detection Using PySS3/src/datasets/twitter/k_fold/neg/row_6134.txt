One stupid mistake have ruined my life.Hello. If someone would've asked me three weeks ago how I was doing I would've said "great". One mistake later and I am now suicidal. 

I was on vacation in thailand with a friend of mine. One night we were out clubbing and we both got hammered. I met a local girl in a nightclub and one thing led to another and we ended up spending the night together. In the morning as she was about to leave she stopped for a second and told me it was time to pay. I was chocked as she had not told me this the night before. I somehow got the strength to pay her after a few minutes of confusion. After she had left I was still in chock. A few minutes passed and I came to a realisation what has happened. I got the impulse to just jump off the balcony but I stopped last minute. I was in complete panic. My first worry was the moral issue. I has just payed for sex. I didnt know I was doing that but it had never the less happened. My second thought was that she might have given me HIV. This was 16 days ago. Since them I've come home, told my parents. Seen a doctor a few times. Started taking anti depressive yesterday. I've also started taking sleeping pills. In one month from now I Will find out if I have HIV or not. If I've got HIV then I cant live with myself. IF I dont have it I still dont think I can live with myself. I have considered suicide every night since I got home. The only thing stopping me is my family. I cant eat. I barely sleep. I cant take much more. All because I was a little tio drunk and was foolish enough not to realise she was a prostitute. I'm 21 and my life is over. All because of one drunken mistake.i
