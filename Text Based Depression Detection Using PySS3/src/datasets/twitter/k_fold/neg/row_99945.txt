my life insurance is worth more than my lifeI took a chance on myself a few months ago. Took a job at lower pay with a much better company with room for growth. At the time, things were working well. Then my husband lost his job, and hasn't been able to find anything where we live. 
I have 2 beautiful little girls and I love them with all of my heart. 
Every week I have to choose between feeding myself or getting enough gas to make it to work (I drive 2 hours one way). 

I don't feel like I can do this shit anymore. I have begged for help from family, I have looked into Uber and Lyft and basically anything else. I have posted on craigslist looking for other random jobs to help us get by. But nothing. 

I have a life insurance payout. If I were to off myself, my family would be able to eat and relocate easily, if it looked accidental. 

I can see so many more positives to ending this than keeping going. I literally can't breathe most of the day because of the crushing anxiety. I need relief. I have anti depression medication and anti anxiety as well, but these don't work, and don't solve our ultimate problem: not being able to provide for my children. 

I can't suffer like this for much longer. I feel like I'm working my ass off just to make it to work. I miss my kids and my husband and food. I hate begging and asking for handouts, but have taken to reddit and even facebook looking for extra work or even cash. I have never been this person before. I have always been self sufficient.

Jesus Christ I feel like this will never end.
