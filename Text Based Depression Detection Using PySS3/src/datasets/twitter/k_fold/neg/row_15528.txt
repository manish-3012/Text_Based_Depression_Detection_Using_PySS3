Second time Iâ€™ve triedI lost the woman I thought I could be with forever. Tried to die and I woke up again vomiting same thing happened again. Iâ€™ve probably did so much damage my to my body now anyway. I will never see her again. I donâ€™t care if I die. Iâ€™m sorry for my mother coz I know she loves me and i have a few friends thatâ€™ll miss me. They tell me Iâ€™m strong and youâ€™ve did great things but itâ€™s too hard too never see her again. People say wait and youâ€™ll get over her but she was too important to get over. Iâ€™m pathetic.
