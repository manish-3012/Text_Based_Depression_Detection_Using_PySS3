Will kill myself if I failI'm a student, very tired and depressed. I'm very afraid of failing the semester, if I will, I will just kill myself. 
I do not know what to do. I feel like I'm stupid, I feel like I'm worse than others. 

Everyday I think about death and suicide


I'm afraid that my family and my girlfriend are going to be very upset of my passing, but I just can't take it anymore. I'm sorry
