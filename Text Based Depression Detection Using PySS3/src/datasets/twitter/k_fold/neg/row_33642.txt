where it all went wrongWhen i was a kid, there was this boy who used to bully me and call me names. He was my classmate and in the end of the school year he got into an accident and well... died. I was aware that i'm kinda different but i didn't know it was that bad. I didn't know why but when I heard what happened, the first thing i said was "that's what he gets for bullying me". That was the moment i knew that i was sick in the head. Years passed by all the trauma was built up. Growing up in a toxic environment and finding out that im an illegitimate child really did contribute to my depression. 

Things were hard but i really tried my best to live a good life and have genuine friends. Not until this year, one of my best friends killed herself. I was so angry at myself for not checking up on her. I was angry at my other best friend who also mourns for her, I don't even know why. I'm angry to those who mourn for her in general. I don't think that they deserve to mourn like that because i was the one she spends her most time with. I am also angry at her... for killing herself. I didn't even get to comfort her or what. I am full of regrets. There are days that I feel like i'm improving and sorta moving on but then the next day I just find myself bawling my eyes out and attempting to kill myself. It was a cycle. I feel so pathetic. I don't even know what to do in this fucking life anymore.
