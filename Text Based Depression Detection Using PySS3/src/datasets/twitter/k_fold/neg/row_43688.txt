I feel like i'm not in control of my life. Like my free will switch has been turned off.I feel like some person is controlling every little thing I do. I do the same stuff all the time. On paper my life seems great. I am at the top of my career, I have a wife and a baby carriage. Something is just missing. I watch and laugh at the same damn show on TV that plays over and over again. When I talk to my wife all I hear is gibberish. I think i'm just go jump into a pool with no ladders and drown.
