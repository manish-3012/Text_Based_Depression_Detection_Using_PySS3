What to say? How to help a friend?I am part of an online gaming community based around military and police role-play and simulation. I have been part of the community around a year and a half, I am 19 now and have a friend I have grown very close to over the last year or so he is finishing up high school this year. Normally a pretty fun year being a senior year and all. A day or so ago he texted me and said he would be gone for a few weeks or longer I said what for and he wouldn't tell me I asked him if someone had died and I was there for him whatever. It was we left it at that then today he texts me back and says I have been having suicidal thoughts. I was confused and didn't know how to respond He was always the life of the party on skype and when talking to him while playing games. He later says he doesn't know who he is or where he wants to go. He really wants to enlist in the military but is super afraid of his parents reaction, They want him to go to college but he feels he needs a gap year to sort out who he is and where he wants to go. How to I respond other than saying I will be here for him, also how should he bring these thoughts about suicide to his parents . He wants help and needs it but is ashamed and is too scared to ask for help in fear he will disappoint his parents(his brothers are all good guys who graduated and went to college). I have never had to deal with this and don't want to loose my best friend over something so trivial in the long run.
TL:DR Friend wants to commit suicide I don't know what to say or how to help.
