I want to sleep foreverEverything feels so heavy and so full of pain. I have been trying to make the sadness go away for so many years. I feel like my entire life has been searching for reasons to live and waiting for things to get better, but each year seems to bring more hurt.

I am very alone. There is no one I am close to...everyone seems to hurt me. I had one person I trusted and they're no longer my friend. The pain from losing that friendship is very raw and it's pushing me over the edge.

When I'm asleep the pain goes away. I don't want to be sad anymore. I don't want anyone to hurt me anymore. I have some pills and I want to just take them, get into bed and let all the pain go.
