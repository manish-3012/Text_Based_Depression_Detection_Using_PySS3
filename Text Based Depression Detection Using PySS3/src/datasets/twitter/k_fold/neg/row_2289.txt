I dont want to live.There's 2 days left before I plan to kill myself. I don't see any reason to live. I am tired and broken. There is no happiness or love in my life. My life and reputation are ruined thanks to the internet. Its nauseting that nothing can be done to change my situation that I'll have to live with it for the rest of my life. Noone can understand my situation so don't bother asking. And I'm not looking to talk to anyone, you can't help. So why am I posting? I don't know, I guess there's just no one in my life who cares, so might as well vent to strangers.
