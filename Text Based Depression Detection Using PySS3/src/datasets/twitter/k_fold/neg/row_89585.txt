Iâ€™m so exhaustedIâ€™m so exhausted of being alive. Everyday is fucking horrible and an uphill battle. I canâ€™t find anyone that actually understands, rather than saying â€œ ðŸŒ¸ðŸ’–ðŸ’–oh just donâ€™t think about it! Be stronger than that!ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸stay positive luvâ€   Being mentally ill has made me become so toxic to everyone around me. Iâ€™m bitchy to my mom, manipulative to my boyfriend and friends. Iâ€™m disgusting. Iâ€™m so tired of struggling and I want to give up so bad. But Iâ€™m so scared. Iâ€™m terrified of death and not getting the option to go back. But at the same time I â€œprayâ€ every night I wonâ€™t wake up. But then I wake up with an elephant of exhausting depression on my chest. I canâ€™t do it anymore but I have no other options than to keep going through this day after day. I wish I could find the courage to jump. I canâ€™t do this anymore.
