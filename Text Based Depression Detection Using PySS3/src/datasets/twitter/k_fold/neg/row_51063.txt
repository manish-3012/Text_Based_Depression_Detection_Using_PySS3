I want to die but i don't want to/can't kill myselfI really, really hate existence. 90% of the time i think about what a relief it would be if it came to an end. nearly every day i have to spend in close contact with other people (work, family, going out with friends) is a fucking nightmare. not that i don't like them, i just feel like a weird alien. time spent home alone is way better, but usually those days end up in an embryo position, in anxiety, crying too. i've started cutting myself (upper thigh so no one can see it) to relieve the anxiety, and self hatred. it works in the short run. i think about suicide a lot, but since i am a weak disgusting shit i can not do it. also, if i think about the pain it would cause to my father, mother and brother, who doesn't even have a clue how deep i am in the rabbit hole my heart just breaks...
i would really, really welcome a lethal disease, or a fatal accident so i can die, and be remembered as the "somewhat normal" guy who i pretend to be (not very successfully i might add). 
though it would be good to talk about this, no one knows this, and i'm pretty sure i won't tell this to anyone i know. i will only receive pity, judgements and advices that won't help.
i've been depressed for years now (6-8), started cutting a year ago and recently this feeling has become just unbearable.
if anyone who has been through this could share his/her experiences i would really appreciate it.
