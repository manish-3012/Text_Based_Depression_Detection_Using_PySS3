No way out.How can you all be so optimistic about suicide?
I'm honestly jealous of your naivety. 
Life is pain, suffering, pointless and whatever we may call it. 
Why should death be any different?
It's just an empty hope, a pretty lie most likely.
Death will probably suck as equally as life. 
I don't believe in God, I don't believe in life and neither do I believe in suicide.
I wish I could but it's not working out for me.
I'm way too pessimistic to think that suicide will be an actual way out of this mess. 
Guess I'm stuck in between.

Well but who knows, I wish all of you the best. Take care.
