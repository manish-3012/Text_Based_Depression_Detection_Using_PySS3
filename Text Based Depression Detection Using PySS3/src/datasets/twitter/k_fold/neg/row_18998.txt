Give me one good reason not to end it all right now.Iâ€™m 16, and I feel absolutely worthless. My friends abandoned me. Fair enough, I suppose. I would abandon me too. The fact of the matter is that Iâ€™m worthless. Nothing I do is ever good enough for anyone. I tried so hard to be friendly, and confident and happy, but I canâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™m a broken human being. Iâ€™ve written suicide notes before, and Iâ€™ve had plans to kill myself, but I didnâ€™t have the balls to actually do it. Iâ€™ve legitimately asked one of the two people I actually trust  â€œwould anyone miss me if I was gone?â€ His response: â€œI donâ€™t want to say no, but I know deep down that thatâ€™s the answer.â€ Fucking thanks, asshole, but heâ€™s right. Iâ€™m an idiot for thinking that someone would even remotely miss me.  I tried to reach out to the other person I trust, and he said â€œIâ€™m sure youâ€™ll figure it out. Iâ€™m going to bed. Goodnight.â€ He knows better than anyone that Iâ€™m suicidal. My mother hates me, my father is dead. So many times have I wanted to kill myself, but every time Iâ€™ve found something thatâ€™s stopping me. I donâ€™t have anything left now. I donâ€™t have any reason to stay on this fucking hellhole of a planet. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m bothering to reach out to people. I donâ€™t have anyone left that cares about me. No one would care if I was gone. Theyâ€™d just continue as they always do. Iâ€™m sorry for this being an incoherent mess. I just want someone to fucking listen to me for a change.
