Why do I try so hardWhat unique aspect of life matters so much that I should try to stay alive?    Thereâ€™s nothing inspiring or original or beautiful.    I want to get shot stopping a robbery or something so no one gets upset at my death.    Can someone tell me the best way for me to do that?   Maybe try to buy drugs and refuse to pay.
