First time thinking about suicideI (15M) have been dealing with a lot of emotions for a while but now I think Iâ€™ve come to a point where itâ€™s all collapsing down on me.

â€¢ Iâ€™ve lied about my grades to my parents and friends. I know, grades may not matter, but Iâ€™m worried that Iâ€™m going to be put in shittier classes because of it. Iâ€™ve failed geometry and English, and Iâ€™ll be put in shittier classes that arenâ€™t advanced. Iâ€™m so scared of being put with dumber kids that I think I want to kill myself to avoid confrontation.

Thatâ€™s just one thing, mainly. That was kind of an asshole thing to say, right? I donâ€™t actually think Iâ€™m smarter than them but theyâ€™re just so...ghetto? I donâ€™t know, I cannot fathom being put with them and as much as I donâ€™t want to admit it, I think Iâ€™m better than them and I just donâ€™t want to be lumped in with them. It hurts so much thinking about it and it drives me to the point where I want to kill myself. I donâ€™t want this to ruin my chances of going to a good college and not making it in life. I donâ€™t like how Iâ€™m put in a system in which the effort I allocate as a child determines the kind of money I make as an adult. Iâ€™ve heard awful things about the stress regarding finances and its importance later in life. Iâ€™ve gotten really bad grades for almost all of my classes and clearly failed two of them, so Iâ€™m wondering if thatâ€™ll ruin my chances of getting into a college. Usually my grades can be better, but this year Iâ€™ve been feeling awful. Reason why brings me to this:

â€¢ I donâ€™t see a reason to live. I feel like all happy moments are temporary and I cannot pull myself out of the mentality that life is cruel and that this manmade societal structure of having to work until I retire for a bit and die is abysmal. I wish we all were a hunter-gatherer society and werenâ€™t as intelligent as we are now. Thoughts like that put me at ease. I need to know that life is worth it, because I feel unsatisfied knowing I have to put in effort and cope with being social with others.
â€¢ My friends are all awful to me and I donâ€™t know how to shift away from them. I want to be friends with new people. Nice people. Ones who I can truly talk with about whatever I feel like. I canâ€™t build the perfect person to have a relationship with and that clearly shows. The people I talk to the most in my life are just awful. I mean, not most of them. But the ones I talk to arenâ€™t the kinds of friends I want but I donâ€™t know how I can just get better friends who match my ideals. I feel bad saying that, because I get how awful that is to say. Iâ€™m not godly in any way. I donâ€™t think I have some high IQ or am smart. But I want to have meaningful conversations with people. And those types of people arenâ€™t in any abundance. 

I have more to add, but I think this is a good starting point. Sorry for the long post.
