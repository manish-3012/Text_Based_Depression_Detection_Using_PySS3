Wrote a suicide noteBackground: bullied/abused (verbally and sexually) at school, no friends, socially isolated. I was diagnosed as aspergers at 18, too late to have gotten help I should have had.

I want to remove myself from the hell that is being alive. I live my life in fear. People have been nothing but a source of pain for as long as I can remember. I love my family but they're distant and not particularly demonstrative in their affection, and they always have been.

I wrote a suicide note today and was planning on taking my life as soon as I got hold of the things I needed. These thoughts tend to come and go. It's a few hours later, I'm wondering if I should tell someone about the thoughts I'm having (I see a social worker once a week). In the past I have had episodes of self harm because of these thoughts.

Should I show them the note or should I throw it away and just try to struggle on? I still feel terrible but the thought of suicide has subsided. I don't know if it will come again.

I was put into a hospital because I tried to end my life in the past, and I don't want to EVER go back there. It was the worst experience of my life. Doctors only seem interested in putting me on insanely high amounts of medication, they never offer counselling or any other kind of therapy.
