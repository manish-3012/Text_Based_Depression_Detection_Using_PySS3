im at the end of my fucking ropeFor the past 7 years I've had the best, most fun,  rocky, and my first romantic relationship. there were definitely ups and downs and a lot of passion fighting especially towards the end. we almost had a family and were set to get married then we lost the baby. Neither of us coped properly and wore each other down and i left. its the biggest fucking mistake I've ever made. im alone. i have no one. I'm neck deep in debt and I'm back at my parents place as a failure. i feel nothing but regret for leaving the best thing that'll ever happen to me with no chance of ever getting it back. she moved on. I'm currently trying to pry off the lock off of a gun and maybe then i can go back to home. maybe meet my kid. anything to wake up from this fucking nightmare.
