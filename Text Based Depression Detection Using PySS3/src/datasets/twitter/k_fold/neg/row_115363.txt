The fact that your brain wants you to die, but your body will do anything to survive is BULLSHITNo matter how hard you try, it's all pointless because for some reason your brain is dead set on feeling like the worst shit possible by default. If you start to feel better for even just a little while, it will all come crashing back down again so you feel worse than you did before. Why do some people have mental illness and others don't? Why are others fine and do I have to be put on meds, not even to be fine, but to not feel anything? What fucking genius created life and decided some people just aren't allowed to have the freedom of a mind that's NOT constantly telling them that it'd be better if they're just dead? In a world where the majority of people are inconsiderate, judgemental know-it-alls who want to decide FOR YOU that what you're feeling isn't a reason to kill yourself.
