I want to die but my family counts on me for supportIâ€™ve had suicidal tendencies and thoughts since I was around 17-18 (Iâ€™m 23 now) and Iâ€™ve even been kicked out of the navy because of it (thatâ€™s another story for another day). Iâ€™ve been married for a little over 5 years now and I have a 2 year old son with a child on the way. But there have been times especially when my wife and I get into it that I just donâ€™t want to exist. I feel like less of a man and I hate myself for feeling like this but she doesnâ€™t really listen to me when I try to pour my heart out and express myself. She either shuts down or says Iâ€™m â€œoverreactingâ€ about something. Iâ€™ve gone most of my life feeling as tho nobody sees me. I feel like Iâ€™ve tried so hard to make something of myself but I just fail everytime. Due to COVID my wife isnâ€™t working and weâ€™re really behind on bills. I work LONG hours but I feel like no matter what I do weâ€™ll always be in debt. Especially cuz my wife doesnâ€™t understand that weâ€™re broke and wants to eat fast food all the time and snacks. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m sorry if it seems like Iâ€™m rambling but I just want someone to talk to thatâ€™ll actually listen to me and see me as a real person and not as a joke.
