Im never going to be okayIm so tired
it never stops.

Im in so much pain. I sliced my arm up last night because I deserved it. I would give anything in the world to not be mentally ill. I crave validation so much. And once i get it, it still isnt enough. A few nights ago i had sex with a 21 year old. Im a 15 year old girl. I know i got raped. This isnt the first time. Ive been molested so many times Iâ€™ve lost count. Is my body really the only thing people see? Am i just a walking sex machine for any and everyone? I hate myself so much. I think Iâ€™m actually going to kill myself soon. It hurts so much i cant keep doing this. I never even got to experience love, ive never had a first love. I want to hold someone and let them know i love them. I want to love and be loved. I dont even know what love is at this point. What does it mean? Ive never experienced it. Im alone. I always will be. I want to be told Iâ€™m loved and worthy. Thanks for reading.
