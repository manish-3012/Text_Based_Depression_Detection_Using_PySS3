Nothing is Wrong, So Why Does Everything Feel Wrong?I'm.... not sure how to start saying this.
I'm not sure how to start this (hopefully short) paragraph of text that tries to explain why I'm depressed, but have nothing to be depressed about, and feel alone despite being in a room full of loving and supporting people, or can't manage to explain why I hesitate to tell my parents about any of this.
I've pulled together a list of 8 people who I've ever told about this struggle, and guess who isn't on there? My own freaking parents. Nor a therapist. 
I don't know why I don't wanna tell my parents anything; it's just like the "why are you depressed" queston. I have no idea, so stop asking. 
But I don't wanna go to a therapist, as that requires both telling my parents about this, and I can't handle knowing that someone is being paid just to talk to me. 
I have a pretty damn good life to be honest, so why can't I just be fine with that and not feel like this. 
Hopefully that was both short and decently detailed. I kinda wrote it very suddenly.
