I don't deserve lifeIf I was someone else I'd shoot me. 

I came to this country when I was 10. I grew up with my grandmother and my extended family when I was little.  with my single Mom and my grandmother followed suit later. 

My grandmother is suffering through clinical depression. She's raised me for 23 years. 

My Mom is holding down a job that she hates at a casino. She's also a cancer survivor. she's getting welfare money to supplement my grandma's depression because she's not in her home country. 

My Mom supported my education throughout.

I started off a difficult major and I switched to something else to get a degree because I wanted to finish in 4 years. 

Didn't do that many internships. Got fired and quit a job. Now I can't find any. 

I dont' feel like I have any real friends because I abandon them when things get tough.  like my Dad did my family. 

Part of the reason why I stayed at the school I did was because I didn't want to be like a drop out.  And now I'm like a drop out like him, except with a more useless degree. 


It seems like I am turning out exactly like my Dad and I'm looking at moving back home. I feel ashamed that my struggling family had to live on $60,000 a year just to see me screw up like this. 

I wish I didn't exist. If my Mom is gone I'll be dead. 

I feel guity and ashamed and want to just stop it all.
