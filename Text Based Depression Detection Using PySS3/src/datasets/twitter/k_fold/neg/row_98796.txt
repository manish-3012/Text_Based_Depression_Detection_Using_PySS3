My boyfriend has 2 days left to live and I think I am going to take my life to be with him.He is the love of my life. I can't stop looking at photos of us together, watching videos of us singing and dancing. Photos of him proposing to me down on one knee.
I feel sick. 
I was deported for overstaying my visa, he is in Florida and I am in the UK. We planned on bring him here. 
Since I was deported he stopped taking care of himself and has drank himself to death. 
All of his organs are failing and he has a couple days left to live. I can't even be by his side, I can't even kiss him goodbye. I can't even attend his funeral. 

I am thinking of taking my life to be with him. He is my world. It has now been ripped from me. 

Fuck.
