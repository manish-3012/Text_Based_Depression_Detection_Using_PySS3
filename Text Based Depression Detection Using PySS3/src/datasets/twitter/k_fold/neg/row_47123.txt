I want to disappear, quietly and without the hassle.University is almost over, only a month left. I've deleted and blocked all contact except for the friends I live with/would be living with next year.

    

I want to quietly disappear, and I don't want to traumatize them or anyone else for that matter. But they are loose ends.

If I block all communication with them once school is over, I don't want them to know. They would have to find another housemate to live with, and I don't want them to go through that trouble. They will all go on to do great things, and I don't want to hold them back.

I don't know how to push them away without creating too much attention to myself. They know my depression from the past. If I lie, say I'm going to another school or moving or whatever, it might work. However, they could become suspicious, as if they aren't already.

I don't want to put up a fight with them. How do I push them away from me without drawing too much attention?
