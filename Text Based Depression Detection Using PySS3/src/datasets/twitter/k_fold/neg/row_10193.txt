I really hate everythingAs cliche as it sounds, I feel trapped. I think one of the main problems is not having a girlfriend or even any girl to be intimate with. I think I look fine; muscular, decent looking, normal clothes, maybe my face is a little ugly. I've been rejected at least 50 times in person; from asking to study, or just trying to initiate conversation, or asking on a date. I've tried being non-interested, being genuinely interested, being an asshole, being a polite nice guy, being the mysterious guy, being the cool guy, being the fun party kind of guy, and I've had way too many rejections when just trying to be myself. I've been taking 40mg Prozac every day but just stopped about a week or 2 ago. I can't focus on college because my mind is constantly distracted by how much I hate everything and thinking about girls. I meet a decent amount of girls, at college, or work, or my sister's friends. But it seems like there isn't a single girl on this earth who isn't beyond fucking retarded (most guys are retarded too, but I don't care about them).

I just like stare in disbelief at all these girls... saying they want love, or a caring boyfriend, or someone who won't cheat on them. "HEY, ARE YOU FUCKING BLIND?"

Not really adamant about offing myself, but I'm just waiting for the right time to do it.
