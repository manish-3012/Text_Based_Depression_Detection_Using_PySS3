I just want to go homeAll my life, as far as I can remember, I've romanticized death. I viewed it as the next step, a path we all must take.

I've always felt like whatever lies beyond it is home. This isn't where I belong. This all feels so unnatural. All these people, busying about their lives, they are them, and I am I. Outside of that world, just waiting to die.

It'd be so lovely just to leave the house today and get in a fatal car crash. I tried offing myself two months ago and it didn't work. I don't think I'll try again. Too risky. The medical bills are going to take a while to pay off.

I just wish this would be over. I'm tired of weighing down on other people, who pretend they care. And it's okay. I don't blame them, if anything I feel bad for the people that have the task of caring for me. They'd be better off without me.

I just want to go home.
