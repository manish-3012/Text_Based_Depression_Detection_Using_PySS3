I'm doneI'm so tired of this struggle. I lost my partner in September, he ended it as he couldn't cope anymore. I have 2 beautiful kids who deserve a good present mum, not one who hides in corners and cries or is grumpy and short with them. My son is staying with his dad as I'm just not dealing well. Last week I got as far as writing notes to the kids. Today I want to buy a rope. I know the place. I know the way to do it,  I just need the strength to leave this pain behind.
