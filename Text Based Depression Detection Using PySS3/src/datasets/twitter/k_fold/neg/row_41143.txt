girlfriend attempted suicide recently. need helpMy girlfriend of 4 years just attempted suicide and she was found early enough to be taken to the hospital where she checked herself into the local psych clinic voluntarily. We do not live together (we are both 25 but living at home with her finishing school while I am about to start a career following my recent graduation). 

From our limited contact together she has told me that the issue is that she doesn't like what she is doing anymore (at school) but because her parents are helping her pay for it she feels she is obligated to her major and has no way out.  She has a bachelors degree but is completing an internship and masters level courses for an advanced degree.

I have told her that whatever she does I will be proud of her and support her but her father, even in spite of her attempt, is mad at her for not finishing her schooling.  He actually told her in his visit that he is mad at her for not being able to complete her courses and that she is not right and needs to be locked away for life. 

My question is what can/should I do. My parents and I have offered her a place in my home while I start my career and build my way financially to a place where we can live together. Part of the problem is that she fears what her father will do to her if she moves out without being married and not finishing her schooling.

On a side note my brother took his own life 8 years ago so I am working through some rehashed feelings of my own. I know it's complicated but any advice/words of encouragement are appreciated.
