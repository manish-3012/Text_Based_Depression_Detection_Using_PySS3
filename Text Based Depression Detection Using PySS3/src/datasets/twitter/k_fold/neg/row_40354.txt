On hold with the suicide hotline lmaoBeen calling for the past hour, tried two different hotlines- the regular suicide hotline and the sexual assault survivors one. None of the people are remotely helpful. The people on the sexual assault survivor line just read off a script, "oh you were abused? Well, here's the crime victim's assistants center." and then they wait patiently for me to hang up, their job clearly over. 

The regular hotline people are even worse. They all just sound bored. I tell one guy I was abused, there's a long pause, he says "you were abused huh" and then repeats it again after a few moments. I apologize and say I'm wasting his time, he doesn't say anything for another ten seconds and it gets so awkward I hang up.

Nothing really works, idk anymore. I don't actively want to kill myself necessarily, but fighting my depression and occasional vaugely suicidal thoughts gets so god damn tiring. I go to therapy, but even after switching therapists I make no progress. They're the only 2 free ones I can get, so I got no options there. I can't keep bothering my friends too often, but they don't know what to say either. Hotlines are worthless, I've called in the past and it's the same deal. Once someone even called the cops on me, which was horrifying and gave me trust issues. 

I don't know where else I could turn. It's just so frustrating. posting on here is pointless too. I do it all the time and it's not helpful and no one is even gonna respond at 2AM anyway, but I just gotta get it off my chest I guess.

Don't tell me you want to talk over PMs if you're just gonna stop responding. I'm not sure what secret thrill some people get about pretending they want to help suicidal people, but I'm not falling for it anymore. It's fucking cruel to do that, way worse than not saying anything. Just say something supportive, don't offer any help beyond that if you don't actually intend on giving it.
