2 attempts during 4 horrible years.Im 16 and i suffer from Post traumatic stress, anxiety, depression and suicid tendencies. And im slowly creeping towards an eating disorder. So letts back track to 4 years ago, my mums partner had only be in my life for 4 years at this stage. I was 12, almost 13. i got my virginty taken from me by force from my ex. My mum and stepdad found out and thats when it all start. For 3 years, my stepdad physically, mentally and sexual abused me. I couldnt go do anything without having to do something for him sexually. He raped me multiple times and used personal things against me.
Last year i fell pregnant. I didnt know who the dad was. It was either him and my ex. I was forced an abortion and i didnt want that. I had kept it a secret for three years. Now im struggling. Ive attempted to killl myself twice and it hasnt worked. I plan it constantly and im too anxious to even go through with it half the time. The last time i tried, it wouldve worked but i had told my boyfriend and he called the ambulance. Thats all i regret from that time, telling him.
I currently live with my amazing boyfriend. All i think about is death. Im no longer me anymore. Ive ruined my family and they all hate me. I havr no one but my boyfriend. He has wanted to leave me multiple times because of my mental state. All i feel is that suicide is my only option. I cant leave my house because of how anxious i am. I cant get a job or anything because ill freak out. And people have said to me just get over it, theres no excuse for not working, blah blah blah. I feel like a burden to everyone and im sick of life. I cant deal with anything or anyone. I taake everything so seriously because thats who i am. I cant talk about my mental health because now a days people will call me an attention seeker. 
Im sorry that this is long and not written great but im anxious about this and havent spoken about everything before. 

Thank you for reading.
