I feel so lost and empty...Iâ€™m a 19 year old boy I still live with my parents and I have a girlfriend. I have no job no money and no motivation or will to do anything I fucking hate myself so much, I have no idea what to do with my life I have no career interests at all I have hobbies I guess but none I would be able to turn into a career... I canâ€™t work normal jobs I just donâ€™t last with them I canâ€™t motivate myself to go I either end up quitting or getting fired, it doesnâ€™t help that I dislike most people too I donâ€™t know why but Iâ€™m so annoyed with how so many people act I pretty much have no friends. I think Iâ€™ve been depressed since 6th grade but not as bad as I am now which if you couldnâ€™t tell by my age Iâ€™ve graduated highschool  which I did so at 17 anyways I feel as if Iâ€™m at the end of my rope I feel everyday I just get worse and worse I feel like Iâ€™m a burden to my parents and girlfriend and I hate that, Iâ€™m so useless I know I just donâ€™t belong on this world I donâ€™t feel right living here it just doesnâ€™t work for me. I wish every day and night that I would just die and that someone would either just kill me or that I will have to do it myself, Iâ€™m so close to getting a gun and ending it all...and please donâ€™t try to say Iâ€™m going for attention if anything I hate attention itâ€™s annoying Iâ€™m just looking for help someone who has been in the same situation or similar and can help me..please
