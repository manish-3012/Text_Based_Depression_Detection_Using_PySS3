Cry for help I guess? Idk, just worried.I know my situation isn't not as dire as most people in here, but I'm still worried. I haven't been able to get a stable job in a year and a half, I stopped paying my credit card debt so I could continue making car and insurance payments so my debt has reached an untenable amount, and my gf has terminal cancer with likely less than a year left to live. I don't have money to go out with friends and even then I don't like seeing friends/acquaintances/family members because I feel like an abject failure and a disappointment, so many of my relationships have kind of just dissolved. I can't help support my gf financially much anymore either, already sank most of my money into it to no avail.

I've spent more and more time thinking of surefire ways to end myself so I can stop being a financial burden on my parents, and I guess to just escape it all. I tell myself I wouldn't do it until after my gf dies as she's the main source of light in my life. I was able to tread water for a bit, but it's getting harder and harder. Apparently not having a job for 1+ years is a valid reason for not being able to get a job at all. 

Showers have become a weird experience as well. I still enjoy the warm water but I often find myself just sitting down, mulling everything over, getting too deep into my own head while I either breakdown or just stare blankly at the wall. 

I know I'm not as bad off as many here, my mind is just a jumbled mess and I don't see a way clear. Really think I just needed to type it or say it somewhere and there's no way I'd tell anyone in my life.
