i have never felt so suicidalitâ€™s so hard to control myself. i canâ€™t help but keep wanting to die. i have never felt pretty in my life. i feel like my boyfriend is losing feelings and interest in me. i donâ€™t feel good enough for anyone. iâ€™m on medication but itâ€™s not helping, itâ€™s just aggravating my feelings.
