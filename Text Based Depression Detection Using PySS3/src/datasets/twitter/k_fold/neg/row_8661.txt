Idk what to do anymoreI've always been somewhat depressed but isn't everybody. But the last few months I have gotten to the point where I have panic attacks and sever anxiety every single day. I've gotten into taking pills which only makes it worse, it heightens the anxiety to levels I didn't know existed. I used to cut but it doesn't even help me anymore, it does absolutely nothing. I don't have anyone in my life that I can talk to this about, I don't want them to see me as flawed or crazy. I don't know what to do, everyday I think of killing myself but I've never intentionally attempted it. I need help, I know I do but I dont think i'm help-able.
