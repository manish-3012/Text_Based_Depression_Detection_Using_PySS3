The cause of my suicidal thoughtsI suffer with schizophrenia along with depression, anxiety and PTSD. Thus, being on my own is a bad idea. If I'm left alone I just end up bullying myself and making myself feel much, much worse. 

And I don't have friends or relationships, I wish I did, but no matter what I do or try everyone seems to leave me and I end up alone again. And alone, I'm fighting this battle with no reason to win it. 

As far as I'm concerned my fight is useless, I'm fighting to stand up and fall down again, what's the point in that? I just wish I had someone to love and care for. I really do.
