School makes me want to die! D:My teachers hate me (at least so I feel), some teachers give me a new thick packet EVERY SINGLE DAY, I barely have any friends in my classes, I take 16 exams in a year, people call me gay and stay way from me mainly because I don't like the "cool" stuff like Fortnite, I'm under a ton of pressure to get good grades, my teacher threatened to give the class assigned seats at lunch if I keep sitting with my friends, my entire class thinks I'm weird so It's either sit with them and tolerate them or get beaten up because one of the kids in my class beat up one of my friends and they broke their jaw. My teachers give detention for the littlest things! (Like being late to class a few times, the hallways are crowded and teachers like to hold students back because a few students are being jerks, and also talking in class will get you detention in my homeroom.) It's just so stressful sometimes and I contemplate suicide. I've talked to my parents and they do their best, they have suggested talking to the teachers but the last time they did this my teacher hated me on a cellular level. PLEASE help! ;-; I really don't want to kill myself but lately I've been considering it a lot.
