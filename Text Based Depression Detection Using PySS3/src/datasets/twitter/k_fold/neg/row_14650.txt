Life isnâ€™t worth living as an ugly teenage male
Iâ€™m running out of reasons to live. Love doesnâ€™t exist when youâ€™re ugly, itâ€™s just pain, constant pain. 

These days I fantasize about how I would kill myself. A gun is so messy and unreliable, I wish I could get the lethal injection. That would be relatively painless and I could just leave. No more suffering, no more being shamed for being a virgin. I wouldnâ€™t have to look in the mirror and cry anymore. I could just die finally.
