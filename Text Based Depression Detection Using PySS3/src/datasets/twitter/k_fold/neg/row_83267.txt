I donâ€™t know how much longer I can take thisI canâ€™t hold down a job, my moms emotionally abusive, my parents dont want me to go to a suicide resource cause they donâ€™t want me to be forced on antidepressants or to be put in a mental institution. Almost everyday feels like a living hell, I donâ€™t care about anything anymore, and weed doesnâ€™t help me anymore. I donâ€™t know where to go or what to do
