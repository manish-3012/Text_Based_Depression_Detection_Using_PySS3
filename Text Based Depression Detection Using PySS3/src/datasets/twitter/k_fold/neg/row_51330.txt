I don't have any reason to be hereMY mother died almost two years ago. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I don't have a good relationship with my father. My grandmother blamed me for my mother's death and my husband was talking to other women when I needed him the most and blamed me for it. I know I should have left but I'm broke and I can't right now. 

Today we were supposed to go see family. Mine and his. He gets home and it's an argument. I should be ready to go now and I am the reason to blame and he is getting sick of it all. He called his brother to pick him up and I'm here alone. I'm supposed to see my grandmother but I'm just ready to do it. I have been trying so hard to change myself and I've been seeing my therapist but I'm tired. I just want to be done with it all because it's too much for me to deal with. 
I don't have anyone and I don't see a reason not to do it today
