DaydreamingEvery time im holding a knife in the kitchen i gently poke my stomach just enough to feel the pressure

Every time im waiting for a subway/skytrain i stay as far away as possible from the track because my body get sweaty and heart beat skips with the urge to jump

Every car i see i imagine myself getting hit by it and i think about what kind of sound it will make when my body collide with the running vehicle and what kind of pain i would experience 

I empty a whole bottle of medicines or sleeping pills in my mouth and spit it back out afterwards 

I know one day i will do it im just waiting for the right moment and i know when i do, the comfort of death will finally make me feel alive
