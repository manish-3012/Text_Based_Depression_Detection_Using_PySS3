Grad school makes me want to kill myself, but I don't have another optionHonestly I've got a laundry list of shit going on -- Bipolar I, PTSD, history of abuse, domestic violence, and rape, realizing my parents see me as their therapist and not their child, partner lashing out due to grief -- and the icing on the cake is i am stuck in a graduate program for a degree I already have in a department that enables homophobia and is not equipped to help me. I know so much of this is my own fault and I can't ask a university to fix me, but I'm at the point where I feel like the only way out is to die. I feel like I've hurt enough for a lifetime, so why not?

It's not like I can even leave. Leaving means no income and no insurance thousands of miles away from home, and if I can't afford my asthma and bipolar meds I'll just end up dead anyway. I can't take about this with anyone right now because I can't use people as my emotional tampons, so I guess I just wanted to say it somewhere.

I relapsed with self harming recently and stopped again, but I don't know why my piece of shit self even deserves to stay on the wagon or stick around. The universe doesn't seem to want me, and I just want to go.
