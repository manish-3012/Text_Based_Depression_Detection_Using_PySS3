Hi. Can anyone suggest online suicide hotlines, preferably with an active chatline?For context, I'm from the Philippines. I read from other people that using our hotline either doesn't work, or they outright send a cop car to your location. So scratching that off.

The Project Trevor sounded good, but doesn't work outside U.S. I could use an apn, and I'll try that soon. But if not, can anyone recommend to me any other ones? Thanks
