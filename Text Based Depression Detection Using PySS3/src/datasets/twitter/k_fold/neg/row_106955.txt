i miss her. i donâ€™t know what happened to her, but i do know that it was me who caused it.all i ever do these days is listen to music, play games, talk to just a select few people and cry alone. i miss my best friend. i just wanted to save her. i wanted to make her feel hopeful.. but i ended up causing a shitstorm instead, just like al-fucking-ways. that too, in the name of â€œhelpâ€. 

she deserves happiness. she deserves love. every good thing in the world. those people who abused her will fucking pay in the deepest depths of hell for their actions. if sheâ€™s still alive and kicking.. then i hope sheâ€™s okay and happy. 

if youâ€™re reading this, iâ€™m sorry, sylvia. i hope youâ€™re doing fine. i miss you.
