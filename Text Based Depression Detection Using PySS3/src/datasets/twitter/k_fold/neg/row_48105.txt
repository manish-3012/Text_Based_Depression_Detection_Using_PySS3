Boyfriend told me to fuck offShort story my bf and I were sending money for visa for me but then my mom understand and took my ID away. My boyfriend told me he is gloomy and depressed and then changed his behaviour to me. Today he left me on seen many times and I told him he is fool (it was just out of anger) and he told me he is done with me if I dont pay a little and that I am the fool. Should i even try to take my ID and send $30? I am so sad we were even planning family. He told me he will block me if I message him again and I did message him but he didn't block me? Is that good sign? Did he said all these just out of anger

I am really upset. Please advice me
