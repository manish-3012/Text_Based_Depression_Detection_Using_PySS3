I cannot take it anymore.Life has always been tough on me, I've read some others' stories, mine is a combination of here and there and adds a bit more. I have thought numerous ways of killing my self, prepared more than once, and every time when it's gonna happen, a life-changer occurs. Just like somebody mentioned he got a text when he was gonna jump. The same happened to me as well, I got a call right before my day of ending. Last year, I tried to spend a few months traveling, spend all my money, then meet the end. Then I found out my mother has been cheating on my father for at least 5  years, then COVID happened. Messed all my plans, kept me breathing painfully. TBH, I am already living in borrowed time, I should have died god knows how long ago. Unlike most people here, I used to be top-grade students, always having good control of myself. God knows since when I became more and more desperate. Also unlike others, it's not one of my parents, it's both. You can't even imagine how it feels like if your own fucking dad spying on you when you are jerking off in your fucking room feels like. But as life continues, I began to realize there is something that keeps an eye on us and will try to prevent you from killing yourself. It sounds more desperate, is it not? Now you cannot even decide your own life or death. Sometimes, you just cannot understand why there are many people who fear death, as people like us, we barely want to live another minute. If I could die someday all of a sudden without any precautions, that will most likely be the best ending for me.
