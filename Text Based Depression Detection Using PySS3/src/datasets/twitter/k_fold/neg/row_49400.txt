Living my dream to how I fucked up my lifeI can't believe how different my life is now compared to a year and a half ago...
I was studying at uni, doing an internship with a film company I loved, had gotten accepted into a dance team and was training for gigs/competitions

I guess I fucked it all up when I started counselling near the end of my degree, when I started to confront my feelings of gender disphoria. During my counselling I realised I wanted so badly to transition, to tell my loved ones and to feel accepted and I was ready to.

Then it all went down hill... I graduated after getting a month extension and because of that I wasn't able to graduate with my friends.

My dance crew took a break so I stopped dancing and isolated myself in my room and continued binge eating (which I always turn to when trying to finish uni deadlines). I worked a part time job and on my free time I  would just watch shows on my phone and spend my wage on food.

after a couple months I'd put on 15 kilos and had completely given up on following my passions in dance and my Film/VFX degree and go make it worse the weight made me look so much more feminine.

fast forward to now I just got laid off my full time night shift job, I've put on another 15 kg and given up on hopes of ever trasitioning or doing anything with my life. I just want to find another mindless night-shift job to make ends meet untill I've properly planned out my suicide and worked up the guts.
