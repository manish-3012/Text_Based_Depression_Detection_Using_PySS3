iâ€™m so donesuicide isnâ€™t a possibility anymore, itâ€™s an inevitability. when, not if. the only thing that keeps me here is my parents. iâ€™m only 15, it would destroy them. but iâ€™ve been wanting to end it since i was 9, thereâ€™s only so much longer that can keep me going. i think iâ€™m finally done. itâ€™s been an okay run i guess. i hope they get over me.
