Everyone else has moved onAnd they all look and talk like they're just content. I'm the only one that's so useless and terrified. I want their lives, even if all I saw was lies. I don't want my body, mind or anything else that's supposedly mine. I want to hurt myself, but I won't like it. I want to go to hospital, but I know I'll regret it. My fingers and lips hurt so much from biting, but I can't stop. I want to scream but never ever speak again. I don't want to be.
