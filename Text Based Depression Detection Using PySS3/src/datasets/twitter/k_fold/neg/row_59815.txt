I just want to let off some steam i guesshello everyone

just so you guys know, this isnt a throwaway, this is my legit main acc. 

Ok so ive never been diagnosed or anything by depression, nor do i think i have it. However i do feel times of loneliness and sadness and all that other stuff. Over the past couple months, ive been having more and more thoughts about suicide whenever something pissed me off. That something usually being my mom. Its like she just knows how exactly to piss me off using the fewest amount of actions and words. Now the things i get pissed off at CAN be unreasonable. For example, I was incredibly ticked off when my mom basically pressured me to stop my league game. She doesnt really understand that you cant pause or restart the game or that i could later be banned and just never be able to paly again, or the fact that i cant play at home becuase my internet is ass shit piss nugget mcfuck balls. 

So here comes the issue, i have thought of so many ways to just end my life. And to be quite frank i really want to try some of them but i can never bring my self to do it. Im so afraid of pain that i just kind of sit there walllowing in my sadness. Ive thought about slitting wrists (though i heard it was ineffective i just feel like it would give me some escape), i thought about jabbing a knife as hard as i can through my throat, or maybe the carbon monoxide from cars. 

I just want to do it, you know? sometimes i really dont wanna be *here* anymore, ya feel?

sorry for this possibly unrelated post... i just wanted to get it out of my mind
