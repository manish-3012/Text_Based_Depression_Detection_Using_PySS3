its an empty feelingfor a really long time ive felt this empty feeling, it was always there in the back of my mind. but a few days ago i hit rock bottom. Im tired of everyone lying to me, the "itll get betters" and that.its supposed to get better for the past 5 years but it only has gotten worse.i dont want to die. If i could live a happy life id love that, but i cant llive happy like this so ive accepted that on my 18th birthday ill go out take my life. the only person who has ever really cared about it is aware but being that theyre just as bad as i am they dont have the energy to help,So i figgured id seek help here, maybe someone here can convince me to do otherwise
