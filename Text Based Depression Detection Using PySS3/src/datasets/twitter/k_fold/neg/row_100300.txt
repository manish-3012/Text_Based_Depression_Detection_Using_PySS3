I feel myself turning into a really weird person and I just want to die and get it over withIt feels like people don't expect this type of personality from me, because I'm just a 'regular 20 yr female college student'. I cant really describe whats going on but its extremely dark, paranoid, painful, isolating and lonely. Spent the entire day on omegle trying to find this one guy I felt a genuine connection to for the first time in years, got banned, ran around to find another computer to waste hours in front of trying to find him. Im really really fucked up. I cant go home because my parents are always angry or have intense emotional reactions. I cant believe this is my life its so dark and it feels like theres no way out of my situation. Im just really scared but I know theres no short answer or way out and Im so sick of feeling like this and having no memory of feeling okay and not fucked up. It just gets worse and worse and worse.
