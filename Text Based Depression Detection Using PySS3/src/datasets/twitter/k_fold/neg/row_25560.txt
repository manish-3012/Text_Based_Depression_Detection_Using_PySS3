Really donâ€™t want to think about the futureLife doesnâ€™t really have a meaning anymore- I can barely get through the days. I can see the people Iâ€™m close to worried about me, but I canâ€™t help feeling that I would be less of a burden on them if I died right now. I donâ€™t get any joy from anything anymore- the whole concept of happiness is foreign to me and has been for years.

Iâ€™m considering just ending my life and being done, I wouldnâ€™t have to think about things anymore then. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of everything and sick of failing. If this is the only thing I can succeed at, so be it.

I donâ€™t think it would be hard for people I know to get over my death- Iâ€™ve never really meant that much to anybody. I know theyâ€™d forget about me, and Iâ€™m content with that. I donâ€™t want to be remembered as I am- or at all.
