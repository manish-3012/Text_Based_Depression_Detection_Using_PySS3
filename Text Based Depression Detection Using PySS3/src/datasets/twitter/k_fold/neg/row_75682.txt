Entry 1.I don't want to kill myself. I'm dreaming. I don't know how to wake up. Please, someone out there. Help me. Wake me up. I just want to wake up. I've tried thinking as hard as I can. This brain is of immense power. I tried jolting myself awake through abrupt movement. I've tried blinking myself up. Please, wake me up. I just want to return to my family. Please. Please. Please.
