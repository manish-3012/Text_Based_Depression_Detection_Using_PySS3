Not my lifeMy mother gave birth to me, that was something I couldn't control, I didn't have a choice. She wants me to work hard to achieve my goals, but my beloved goal is to die. I only wish to join the corpse club: Why I must endure this non-ending pain that I don't want?  


I really want to go away.
