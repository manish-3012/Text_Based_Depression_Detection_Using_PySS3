YoHi. I am in a really dark moment atm. I have Aspergers syndrome which affect my social skills and I have been trying to improve them all the time. But it is never enough and one day I'm probably going to die alone so what's the point continuing? My parents aren't help either, they want me to go back home but home just makes me more worse and isolated. They don't know what's going on with me, they will never understand. No one understands. I remember reading an article about how suicide rates for Autistic people are higher. Heh, I understand that fact now.
