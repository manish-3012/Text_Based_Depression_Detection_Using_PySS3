i think im gonna do itmy last attempt was a month ago i think, up until now i haven't had as serious thoughts about ending it all. im not really sure why im choosing now, probably seasonal depression or something like that, i just feel so empty and aimless i feel like itd be better to not have to deal with it all.

i don't want to go further in life, i dont want to stay alive until i die from some accident or old age, i want to be able to control this one thing in my life. 

I'd feel awkward trying to call a friend, the walls in my house are thin and i dont have anywhere to go to to sit and talk. i dont want to do this anymore.

 i dont know why im posting this, i dont really want someone to talk me down, i just felt like this needed to be said i guess.
