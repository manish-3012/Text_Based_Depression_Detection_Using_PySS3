everything i do is a cry for helpi always seem to scream but it's like no one hears me ever 

i dont even know what to do with myself anymore

i am stuck between moments of random happiness brought on by some fucked up form of nostalgia and feeling unhappy for some reason i can never fully explain, or understand

i don't even know why i bother anymore. i try and be social but it never works and i just end up worse than before. 

i am sick of clinging to any possible interaction with people but that's all i have left.

all i am doing is driving people away and making them hate me
