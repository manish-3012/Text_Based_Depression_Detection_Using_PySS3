I hope this will be my last confessionHi. It's not my first time posting here. This is a good place to confess our feelings. I'll get straight to the point. It's hard to put a fake mask with an ugly smile. It's hard to live. When I was a young boy I've been bullied like "change your face ugly bastard" or other insults. I mean nobody punch me, fortunately, but hearing insults every day changed me. From a fake happy boy I became an ironic bastard and now I'm more loser than ever. No job, no girlfriend, no happiness, no cocktails in bahamas. Sometimes I think about suicide. Come on, before start telling me "nooo plz don't kill yourself", listen to me. The death of a loser won't change the world. Well the worms that eat my body will get fat so something will change. Maybe it's the only way I can be useful to the world. Sorry for this Divine Comedy and thanks.
