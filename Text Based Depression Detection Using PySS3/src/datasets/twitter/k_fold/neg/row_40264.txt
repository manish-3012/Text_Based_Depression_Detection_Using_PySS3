I'm OutAll thing considered, I'm moving my plan ahead. The pain simply isn't worth it anymore. I truly apologize to everyone I have ever hurt, and to my son, whom I love more than anything, but cannot bear to watch seeing me decline like this. I left m,y dog with a friend last nigh under the guise of going out of town last-minute for a family emergency, and to him I apologize as well.

To anyone else considering this route, the guilt is overbearing. Please seek help, and don't give up... My situation places me in a slightly different place, and if I don;t act now, I will be physically unable to in a few months, and I simply cannot take that risk.

Peace and happiness to you, and may it find you even if you're ignoring it.
