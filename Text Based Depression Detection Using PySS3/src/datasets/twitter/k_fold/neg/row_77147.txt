I want to attempt suicide again, but only because I want my mom to take me seriouslyShe always takes everything I say with a grain of salt and even when I tell her how I'm suffering everyday and I want it all to end she still basically ignores me. Does she honestly believe if she pretends a problem doesn't exist it'll eventually go away? 

The closest she's ever been to taking me seriously was after I first attempted suicide, but then things went back to normal after a few months. 

I just want her to take me seriously again, or to at least have a little empathy for how much I'm suffering each and every day. Honestly I just wish I had someone to comfort me, it can be anyone at this point, I just want comfort. 

You know, with all the pain I'm going through and with no end in sight I might actually end up legitimately trying to end my life. And she's sitting on her ass acting like this is some suicidal phase I'm going through and I'll eventually get over it. Fuck her. I at least want comfort, anything to help me fight through the pain.
