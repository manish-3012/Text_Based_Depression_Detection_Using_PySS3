I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do thisI donâ€™t know what to say. Iâ€™ve thought about killing myself for years, but I think Iâ€™ve had enough. My home life has never been good, and Iâ€™m not doing so hot with my friends and it just feels like I canâ€™t go another day living like this. Iâ€™m planning on write a few notes to my close friends and my parents but after that, Iâ€™m planning on ending it. I want someone to know that I really tried to be happy and I was so strong for as long  as I could but I have my limits man.
