All I hear is "It'll get better", but it still hasn't got better yet.I used to post here a lot, and all I would hear is: "It'll get better", but it still hasn't got better. I don't think it ever will. Thank you all, you gave me hope. Months ago (around August), I made a post here, and wrote a suicide note, and was planning on doing it. I was going to do it, but someone messaged me, and explained how I can transition, and one day be a beautiful girl. He said that the majority is accepting of trans people. Which really gave me hope. He saved my life that day, but I feel he just delayed my suicide. The more I started to learn about trans stuff, the more I started to lose hope again. I think the majority don't accept trans people. I mean if you go to any trans related videos, and read the comments, you'll see what I mean. And I also don't think I'll pass, the more I look through r/transtimeline, the more hope I lose. Right now, I just wanna die. I think that's really just the best option. What's the point of living a life where I hate myself, and everyone else does too. A really lonely life, because I probably won't pass. Also I think my friends will leave me if I come out, so my life is just going to be pain. I'm going to be sad, and lonely all my life. 

So I guess thank you everyone for delaying my suicide.
