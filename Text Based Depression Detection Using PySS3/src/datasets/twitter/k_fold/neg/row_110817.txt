No point in it all. I hate being trapped in limbo.I need something to really push me over the edge. I wonâ€™t get anywhere in life and people are starting to lose hope in me (as they should).

  A lot of times I feel like I wasnâ€™t meant for this world. Iâ€™ve done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy. My view of the world is growing more and more dim and Iâ€™m really starting to question what the point of moving on is. Everything here is lame and it just makes me sick and I donâ€™t really see a future for myself. In the end, Iâ€™m just going to keep disappointing those who care till everyone hates me. One last push is all I need and Iâ€™ll be free from it all and Iâ€™m faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally.
