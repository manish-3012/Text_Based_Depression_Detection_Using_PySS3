I am a waste of oxygen.The urge to kill myself surges every single day and the only thing that is stopping me is the fear of pain and I do not want my family members to discover me in a grisly state. I am a loser and a failure and I feel like things are just going to stay this way. I feel like I can neither get a grasp on how to be an adult nor achieve my goals.
