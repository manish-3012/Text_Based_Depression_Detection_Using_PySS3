Eventually my selfishness is going to overcome my want to not rip my family's hearts apart.I feel like I am completely worthless to everybody around me.

Literally the only thing I had to look forward to has disappeared.

I am basically only ever happy when playing video games, and I live from game to game.

* My stepdad is a hateful cunt
* I only ever cause my mother grief
* I'm failing every class at college because I want to stagger out my miserable life with more gaming.

I have cried myself numb over how I cannot kill myself because of what it would do to my mum, my brother and my dad.

I am running out of will to live.
