Okay.I've never had a problem with drinking until this year. My ex always made me feel awful for drinking with friends and now I feel like an alcoholic. She prodded me into a fight one night when my friends and I were drunk and said I'm too frightening to date. The thing is I don't think I'm am abusive alcoholic...but because she left me I feel like maybe I am? Now I just feel miserable when I drink and...because I'm in college...drinking situations are the majority of the social events I can attend. I'm sick of feeling like I'm a bad person and I want it to end.
