iâ€™ve decided. itâ€™s pretty therapeutic.after my suicide attempt in september left me hospitalized, i felt indifferent about life. i felt some hope. but itâ€™s long gone now, and here i am. i wrote my note, and now all i need is a gun. i wonâ€™t fuck with jumping or overdosing or hanging or anything that gives me a chance to live. a gun is the only surefire (ha) way to die.

i wonder what will happen after i die. will i see god? will i go to hell? or will i just simply cease to exist? i guess i get to find out now.
