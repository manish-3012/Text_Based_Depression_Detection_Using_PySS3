Reddit makes me want to kill myselfTroll posts/comments on a joke I made. Wasn't a great joke but it was just a joke. Got told to "grow up and stop being depressed" and called a hostile piece of shit. I just want to die now. Got the knife ready. Think I'm gonna do it in the shower sitting down. Forearm vertically. Might try an eye.

Well goodbye. I'm glad it's ending.
