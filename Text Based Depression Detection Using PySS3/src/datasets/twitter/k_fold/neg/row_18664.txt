I just don't feel like continuing.This is my first post. I'm 20. Just had a birthday actually. I really don't have that bad of a life. I have a family and a boyfriend that loves me. And I know this. It's just that nothing seems okay. It doesn't feel like this all the time. I just get in these moods where nothing seems to be going right. I can't even really think clearly to put all my thoughts in this post so it probably sounds like crap. I just wish I could disappear. I wouldn't have to deal with my constant anxiety about being good enough for my boyfriend or the extreme feelings of self hatred for how I look. Both of those things put such a strain on the both of us when I just want to make him happy. I'm sick of worrying about keeping track of everything I eat every day and constantly feeling guilty about eating. I don't know what to do. I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't want to vent to my boyfriend anymore because I can feel that he just wants me to see myself as beautiful and it makes him sad. I just hate me.
