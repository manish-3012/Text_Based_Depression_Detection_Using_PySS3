How to save someone online from suicide?There is a person, whom I donâ€™t know, online that is planning on commiting suicide in a few days.  They have posted their story and reasons in a few posts on instagram, and their comments are full of â€œdont do it, we need you, please stay aliveâ€ etc.
Is there something I can do, or help others do, to possibly save them?
