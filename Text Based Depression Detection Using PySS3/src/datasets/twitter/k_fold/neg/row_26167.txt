I will end my life before the end of AugustIm 17 and i have already had an unsuccessful suicide attempt (nobody knows about it tho,cause i did it alone)
My family has been struggling with finances ever since the quarantine started(nothing too serious tho)
And i have had zero will to do anything...
I cant study, i can no longer play video games nor watch movies
Sleeping is really the only thing that i do during day and night.
I thought maybe i would enjoy this quarantine cause well...im an introvert
But i can't get myself to enjoy anything anything aanymor anymore.
My other problem is my parents...
They never understand me and always have expectations...i almost hate them...

Whats the most effective method to end it peacefully and without pain?
