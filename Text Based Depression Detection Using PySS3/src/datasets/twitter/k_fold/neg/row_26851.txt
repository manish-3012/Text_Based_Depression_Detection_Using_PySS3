Just need a methodIâ€™m bitter, angry, exhausted etc the whole nine weâ€™ve all heard the same story before so I donâ€™t think itâ€™s necessary I repeat it. Iâ€™ve decided that it is in my best interest to die, as a result of said bitterness, anger, etc. I need a full proof method to go, as Iâ€™d rather not go through unnecessary planning and aggravation just to come out on the other side still alive, permanently disabled, etc. Because the world seems to hate depressed people so much we canâ€™t even find information to help us kill ourselves in peace, Ive has a hard time finding a useful method through research. Any search regarding suicide just turns a bunch of fuck ass articles written by people who most like arenâ€™t even depressed or never have been about how you shouldnâ€™t commit suicide, when if they were really feeling compassionate what theyâ€™d do is assist you. Iâ€™ll cut the rambling short by just giving a synopsis as follows:
TL:DR; my life sucks, Iâ€™m bitter, death has become the logical conclusion, simply looking for some suggestions to put me in the right direction 


I hope posting this here isnâ€™t in vain but I feel like it is. Something tells me no ones gonna actually give valuable suicide suggestions but I donâ€™t have manu options so Iâ€™m giving this one a go.
