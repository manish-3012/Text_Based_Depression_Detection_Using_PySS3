A warrant for my arrest has made the descion easy.A spiteful ex has got me in a legal situation, leading to an outstanding warrant for my arrest. 
This has tarnished my future career in law enforcement and I'm feeling so lost and helpless. 
Not only have I been dealing with this sudden break up for three months now, but every day I an unbelievably depressed and feel as if I have no solid future now.
