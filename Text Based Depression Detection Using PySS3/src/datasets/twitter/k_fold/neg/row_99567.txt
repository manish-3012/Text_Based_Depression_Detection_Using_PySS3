Dutch queenâ€™s sister commited suicideIt was on the local news today in the Netherlands. Instead of being sad, I though: good for her, she had the balls to do it. Meanwhile Iâ€™m sitting here thinking about killing myself, but I know deep down that Iâ€™m too scared to do it. I just wish I got hit by a car already.
