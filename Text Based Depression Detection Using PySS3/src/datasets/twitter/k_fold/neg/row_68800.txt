Are suicidal thoughts normal?I have recently told a few close people about my depression and about having suicidal thoughts, they have been very understanding and helpful. Because of their support I told my doctor I was depressed; however, I purposefully did not tell him about having suicidal thoughts. He put me on anti-depressants, which seem to help my depression; however, the suicidal thoughts still persist. Emotionally, I feel better but mentally I am not so sure. Several times a week I think about the best ways to kill myself. Recently, when thinking about suicide I decided to open my dresser and stare at my gun. I am confused, is it normal to feel fine and even good sometimes, but still think about committing suicide?
