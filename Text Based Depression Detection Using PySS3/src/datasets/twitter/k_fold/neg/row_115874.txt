Best way to make my death meaningful or towards a common goal? (Student)Sure I could put my life towards something, but I donâ€™t really have the strength to gather/use the energy and endure the stress/depression. 
 
But if Iâ€™m going to commit suicide, I feel like itâ€™s a waste of a death if I donâ€™t put it towards something. To at least let people know there wouldâ€™ve been a way in which the world was different and I might not have been brought to end it. 

Maybe I could make a statement about the education system?Iâ€™m an emotionally unstable college student promised only with debt and the chance in exchange to work for other people for the rest of my life. 

It seems to me that nothing about universities will change unless there are numbers of students being directly affected by the death, whether being horrified or more also dying. 

(I also donâ€™t know what specifically could be changed in order make a major change in the current system, besides finances and gen eds. Just that I canâ€™t tolerate the stress of it all). 

Maybe suicidal students could band together to at least put a purpose into our deaths if we canâ€™t fit a purpose into our lives.
