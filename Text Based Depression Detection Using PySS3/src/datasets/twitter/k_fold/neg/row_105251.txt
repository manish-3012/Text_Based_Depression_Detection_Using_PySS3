I will finalise my plans tonight.I will finish my plans tonight. I will write my note and put it away. Iâ€™ve given myself until the new year to see if things get better. Iâ€™ve come to this decision after a year of thinking about it. I believe people should have a choice whether they want to live or die and I do not want to live anymore. I donâ€™t believe there is enough awareness for mental health in males. I was denied treatment for months and I donâ€™t feel that itâ€™s acceptable.

My mental health has always been a very strange situation. I have negative thoughts about myself but I also have very intrusive thoughts of being violent towards other people. I do not want to live like this anymore. I find it very hard to do anything and I feel like a failure to my girlfriend because I have no drive to do anything and it makes me feel useless. She deserves so much better then me. I canâ€™t live feeling so shit about myself, and so violent towards other people. 

Things may change before this time, I could get more help other then the limited I currently have, everything could become better. Who knows what will happen but for now, on the 31st of December 2018 I will drive to my place of happiness and die via carbon monoxide poisoning.
