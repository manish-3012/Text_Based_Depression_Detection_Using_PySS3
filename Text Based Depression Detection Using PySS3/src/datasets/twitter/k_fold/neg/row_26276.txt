Fuck the mental health"care" systemIt's all about dumping the responsibility on someone else, mitigating liability in the event of tort, cost cutting that some how ends up still being expensive as all fuck. None of it is designed to help people recover. The entire system just pays lip service to the idea that anyone cares. I am just the bottom line on a fiscal report, the excuse for someone's inflated pay and pension. I am just a statistic that politicians and hospital bureaucrats come up with as a half assed ideas to address so they don't look heartless, but  the plans aren't designed to help anyone, just to cover their ass.
