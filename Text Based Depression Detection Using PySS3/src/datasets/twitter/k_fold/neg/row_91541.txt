I need to talk, i can't endure that anymoreHello, first i don't know if i can trust people on me, and if posting here is safe, i don't know to have more troubles.

Second, i don't know where to begin to tell you my story, there is so much to say and it's hard to think about all of that.

I'm, 23 and i feel like I can't do good things of my life, I feel too old, i did only shit since i'm born, ruining everything. I have achieved totally 0. 

Theses last monthes are the worst of my life, I lost everything, my appartement, my girlfriend, my studies, my best friend, all of my friends... My family is a joke, they don't care at all, they are not living together either. All my life is a joke.

The worst part is how all of this things happenned to me, i can't handle this, i can't live with this regrets, and this solitude. It just burn me inside of me. I think about that all of the day, when i wake up when i go to bed... 

It's never gonna get better. I'm so tired of everything. 

Am I anonymous here ? Can they find me ? I would like to tell more of my story to see point of view of others maybe, and for leave a trace i guess.

Sorry for my english, i'm even shit at this.
