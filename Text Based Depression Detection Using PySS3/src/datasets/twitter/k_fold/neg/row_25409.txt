I have a plan.I made a decision today. I'm suffering from depression for 5 years now. Getting worse. I'm a trans girl, and I had a lot of unaccepting experience. I have no one. I enjoy nothing. I have to move out from my parents place. 

So I made a deal. I'll give myself a real chance, I'll try and if I can't make a living or my depression and anxiety isn't going to get better, I'll kill myself instead of coming back. Today I found a method that's okay for me. Like, I can just fall asleep and not wake up(won't give advice or say what it is).

This is the first time I'm okay with it. Not worrying if I can cut deep enough or jump. I'm peaceful and calm. 

I'll write a list tomorrow morning about pros. And a detailed plan.
