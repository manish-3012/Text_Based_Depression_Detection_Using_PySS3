This or thatEither I have to pack my shit and leave or I canâ€™t take it anymore. 

Itâ€™s this or that. 

Iâ€™ve tried my heart out. 

Lost myself, found myself, got broken down again and repeated that crap for 15 years or more. 

I canâ€™t do it anymore. 

I have to get in my car and drive far away or quit life. 

I canâ€™t take not having control of my life anymore.

I canâ€™t take being in a job with nasty coworkers, condescending bosses, and rude clients. I canâ€™t do this anymore.

I quit this life.
