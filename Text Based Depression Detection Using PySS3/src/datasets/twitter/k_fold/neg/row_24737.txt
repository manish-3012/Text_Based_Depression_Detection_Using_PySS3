I don't know how to live sober. (throw away account) This is going to be written like slop and I would like to apologize first for that. 
I have been abusing drugs and alcohol since I was 15 and while I am only 21 now I feel like I cannot deal with life being in any sober state. I started using heroin about two years ago and as a bi polar young lady that needed to put her manic mind to rest it was amazing. Although I have been using a lot less due to a resent overdose I have just substituted it with alcohol and pills again. No matter what I am always self harming myself. Whether it be with drugs, cutting, or starving myself I always need to be doing harm to my body or I just cannot cope. 
I have been taking some advice I have been reading on here. For the past 5 months I keep telling myself that I won't kill myself today, I'll wait till tomorrow or the weekend to see how i feel. Now I'm at my end. I can't keep this going. I have tried to get help many times. I have been in and out of clinics and hospitals. They never seem to help. My resent doctor had to drop me because my health insurance dropped me. I had to stop taking my meds last summer due to this as well. 
I am a poor student who has more medical bills from overdoses and attempts then I can even process. My mother kicked me out recently because she just couldn't bare to watch me anymore. I can't even talk to her really after my father's passing anyway. 
I don't even want to die, but I feel that I have to. I can't live like this anymore. Thank you for reading.
