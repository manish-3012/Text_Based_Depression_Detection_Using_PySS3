"It'll get better." I've suffered for 40 years because I believed the people that said that to me.I've done my research, have my plan. (and my backup plan if I can't get nembutal)

I know they had the best intentions, but they only prolonged the suffering.

Hopefully they were less inconvenienced in their lives by me not ending things back then. But now it's not enough anymore. I'm putting myself first.
