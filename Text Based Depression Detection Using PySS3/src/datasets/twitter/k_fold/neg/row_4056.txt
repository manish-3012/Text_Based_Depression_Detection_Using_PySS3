The only thing tethering me to life ...... when I was a kid was that I was really into video games and I didn't want to die before X or Y game came out, because I was excited for them. Stupid, right? As a got older, my thoughts were darker and I started to distrust myself. I was getting desperate for help, and eventually got the courage to tell my mom. At 15 years old I walked into her room and forcibly said, while choking on tears, **"I think I need to see a therapist.** She asked why, and without getting into specifics I said "...I took a test online and it said I could have severe depression." This was it, no turning back. I finally owned it. I was hiding it for 4 years at that point.  I thought I was going to be free. I was fearful that my family would think I was crazy, or call the police, or put me in some looney bin. 

Then she laughed.

**"Oh, [name]. You aren't depressed. You're just a teenager."**

I didn't trust my mom before, and didn't trust her then. Our relationship has always been a little rough, but she got worse after the divorce. Extra moody, would scream at me, ground me for no reason, isolate me from my friends, put me down, etc... it took a lot for me to come to her with this issue. She completely dismissed me. I couldn't believe it.

To this day I've never told a counselor that I wanted to die. When I was 12 my mom had me see a counselor because she thought I could use one after my dad announced that he was divorcing her. We had 4 sessions. I didn't trust the counselor. She'd know about my weaknesses and report to my parents. I couldn't give her any ammunition. But she'd let me play any board or card game I wanted with her, and my siblings would never play with me because they're older. I wasn't opening up. But I started to like her, and I was just about ready to talk. But after the 4th session, my dad got laid off and we lost our insurance. I don't remember her name, but I remembered the office she used to work at, her hair, her glasses, and that she was recently engaged. I miss her.

When I was 16, my cat had barely turned two years old when she was hit by a car and killed. She was the only warmth I had. It tore me apart. I tore at the clothes I was wearing. I screamed. I sobbed. My only comfort was taken away from me. My mom never did let me get another cat.

After my cat's death, I got... introspective. If I felt that awful over an animal, how bad would my family feel? They frustrated me, angered me, upset me, but in that moment I couldn't wish that feeling on my worst enemy. I made an active decision to push aside the bullshit and try and live my life. I stopped being as fearful of rejection and tried to make more friends at school and be more sociable. It sort of worked. I thought things were looking up. Eventually boys started paying some attention to me, but unfortunately it wasn't the way I wanted. I just wanted someone to care about me.

A few years go by and I start to wonder if I've put depression behind me. I'd still get sad, and I don't get excited easily, and I don't get happy very much. But I felt content. I eventually got married and I thought I finally kicked it. I'm whole now.

Now I'm sitting here wondering if I'm the most selfish mother fucker alive to even think about getting married. With the right conditions, and the right events, with the right timing, it all comes back. I become that 12 year old. I become that 15 year old. I want to die. I want to die. I *want* to die.

My husband is the cat. He's never done me wrong. Sure sometimes we have spats, we don't get along here or there, but he's always been kind to me. He's the blessing that I didn't deserve. I wish so bad that I could disappear, but it would be so unfair to him. I've told him that I wanted to die once or twice. He said "Oh honey, don't say that." I think he doesn't think I'm serious because it's only when I do hit that really low point. Maybe I'm not serious. I don't know. But it feels real. And I wish people would listen to me. It's all I want.
