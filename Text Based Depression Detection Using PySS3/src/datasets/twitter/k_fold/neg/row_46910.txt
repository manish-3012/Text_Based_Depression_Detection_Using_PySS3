Why does topics about suicide and death interest me?To be blunt. Iâ€™m not crazy...well maybe I am. Iâ€™m not sure. But I can be moody. No Iâ€™m not bipolar either. Itâ€™s just for some reason when it comes to those two topics. It gets me sorta excited in a way. Like if my homies mention suicide I turn my head in excitement or say some shit like â€œsuicide pact???â€ With them knowing Iâ€™d be more than down to it. Now donâ€™t get me wrong I donâ€™t hate this planet. It does have its flaws and itâ€™s stupid hypocrisy. But I can find enjoyment. Like in the heat of the moment if I was held gun point ofc Iâ€™d be scared af. But in reality Iâ€™d be like â€œwhatever do that shitâ€. Itâ€™s just I canâ€™t really talk about things like this with ppl since theyâ€™ll think thereâ€™s something wrong with me. Or â€œyou need to get yourself checkedâ€ comments. But here I can tell you guys this. But anyways am I alone on this feeling or am I really just crazy? Why do I find enjoyment in talking about those two topics
