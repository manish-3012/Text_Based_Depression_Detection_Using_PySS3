What is the least fearful way to die?I'm thinking of coming suicide today. I always had a suicide thought but I just couldn't do it. But today is the day. I am not lazy anymore. This world is fucked up. (Well I shouldn't have expected it to be good anyways.) Rich people have all the power and authorities. They can make money easily. But poor people, on the other hand, can't seem to find the way to make money easily. They can't even have a proper education. Rich people, they can make money even without education. I am 30 without proper education. I have the debt which I have no idea how to pay them off. I've had enough. I truely hate my parents for giving me a birth.
