I've been planning it for a long time.When I first got depressed and was aware of what was wrong with me I was at university. At first I tried to treat it with drugs and counselling but nothing helped so I thought about how to minimise the effect on those around me and began a plan that is only just coming to an end.
I decided to essentially make sure as few people as possible would be affected and those that were I would minimise the damage. The easiest part was drifting away from my friends. I made sure that I started seeing them less and less over the course of the 3 years I've been planning this till I barely ever speak to them. My parents were more difficult, I first dropped out of uni in my third year and they still supported me so I realised I had to do more to make them stop talking to me. I started stealing money from their bank account in such a way that I knew the bank would tell them who it was. I've not spent any of this money it just sits in a savings account but it was enough to make them cut off contact with me which I feel a weird sense of achievement for doing after so long. I've put my affairs in order. 2 years ago I even took out a large life insurance policy and left it to my sister, now it's been long enough, as of today, that I can end it all and even if ruled a suicide the money will go to her, so I guess when the drugs I've ordered online arrive tomorrow I'll go out get drunk one last time and that's it. I feel like in doing this I've finally achieved something and I just want there to be a record somewhere, even if no-one I know ever finds it that I did plan all this and it's not a spur of the moment thing. So yeah.
