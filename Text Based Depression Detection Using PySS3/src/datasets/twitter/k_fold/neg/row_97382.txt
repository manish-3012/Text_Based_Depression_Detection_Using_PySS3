no friends, no love, no passions, no happiness, no life, why bother?For ten years i ignored life. i played video games and watched tv, lived at home isolating myself from the world in my moms attic. i went to bed whenever i was tired, be it 1pm or 1am, i had no schedule whatsoever. i happily distracted myself from life for a long time. but a year or so ago it stopped working, i was no longer able to distract myself this way. i started feeling like if these things no longer work, i have nothing, no life, nothing but sadness and boredom. so i attempted suicide. i took 10,000mg of seizure meds, broken down into the powder and added to water, a nice, quiet slip into a coma and brain death was my hope.

obviously it failed, my family realized what i did. i was put in a ward for a week, put on meds. afterwards i tried to take ahold of my life and find a new purpose. i started excersizing every other day for a few hours. and i started taking more responsibility in myself, my hygene, and my responsibility around the home. i even did a little volunteering. things should be good right? im getting better! im motivated!

i was not getting better. i was getting worse. i started hating my appearance and body. i cut calories hugely, losing half a pound a day. i so far lost about 55 pounds in 3 months, i still looked very ugly and unfit, looking at myself and still seeing my stomach bulge was just a reminder of my failure. i was also not finding any volunteering to do, nobody was interested in my help. why would they? i am a total waste of space. i slowly found myself staying at home, doing nothing again besides excersize, which i hate. i started realizing nothing was really changing in my mood or life.

i was not happy. i was told it takes time for excersize to make you feel better. i was told getting in shape/Exercise goes a long way towards making you feel better, and even gives you energy! instead, it just makes me exhausted. i cannot stand it. it depresses me even more when i look at my body in the shower and still see the same fat ugly peice of shit looking back.

my therapist saw my suicidal idolations in December and had me recommitted. while i was there i electrocuted myself with a wall outlet. i figured why live if im just going to keep coming to this place. obviously that failed somehow. they put me on more meds and kept me till just before Christmas.

when i left i decided to instead focus trying to get friends, and dating, i have never been on a date before and am a virgin at 29. so instead of working out alone i went to classes. i started using dating apps constantly when i had any free time. i got a student license and started saving up for a car. going good right?

nope. nobody is interested in talking to me at the classes, and i have messaged just about every possible person on POF i could find. nobody is interested in talking to me let alone dating me. so i stopped using it. i also stopped going to classes. no point trying to stay to the schedule if i can just do the workout alone. its the same thing either way anyways.  my sister was letting me learn to drive in her old car, which was nice, but i was making mistakes and she got upset with me and has not let me practice since then. i hate the looks i got at the dmv, getting a student liscence at 29? what a loser right? they did not even provide driving lessons if your not in high school.

i went to a speed date this weekend, i figured at least they would be forced to interact with me then right? if we chatted in person someone would like me. nope, i was just fooling myself. of course they wouldent. the people i thought i had the best conversations with were just humoring me, they were always looking around eager for me to be away from them.

so here i am, i have no hobbies or passions i enjoy. and the only active thing i do, excersizing, makes me totally miserable. i am totally unhappy and very bored. i wasted ten years of my life doing nothing almost nothing productive. now i am 10+ years behind in being a normal person. i have tryed to fix it. but all my attempts have led to failure. i am a worthless person, i hate everything about myself. when i ride my bike to places i often hope the cars coming behind me would just run me down. at least then i could alleviate any sense of guilt my family may have if it just looked like an accident.

i really wish i had a passion to be happy about. something or someone to get me up in the morning. but im tired of looking for it. and im tired of taking up space. i am a worthless person.
