if things don't get better I'm ending itover a year ago I graduated with an engineering degree but due to Hfa and a lack of work experience outside an internship, club leadership and volunteering, I struggle immensely with finding an entry level job. finally my uncle's best friend needed a data analyst.

he said it would be temp to hire and the pay would be low due to budgeting. I took it because it was better than living at home and getting nowhere. 

at first I went through some training but as time went on the boss simply gave me bullshit data entry tasks. I asked family about this and they all say I need "to build a resume."

well now that engineering degree might as well be useless because most companies will rather want fresh graduates or experienced engineers than someone who didnt use any engineering for over a year. 

I'm stressed because at 28 I'm too old to yet again build new skills, especially since no girl will ever want to be with a guy who doesn't have a salaried job with benefits. at least according to family members that is. I also heard dating is hard in your 30s becaus you're dealing with the left overs. 

well If things dont get better in a year I will kill myself. hopefully leave this planet for good.
