Iâ€™m tiredHello, iâ€™m a 17 y/o female living in an asian country with insane academic standards. iâ€™ve come out â€œon topâ€ (academically anyways) for the last 9 years and i canâ€™t take it anymore. academic stress, my family life falling apart, my own internal problems. 

i donâ€™t have the motivation to work hard or eat, im too scared to ask for therapy iâ€™m too scared to talk about this with what few close friends i have. i donâ€™t know how to deal with it. 

iâ€™ll sit down to study and cry myself to sleep and i donâ€™t know why i feel this way all the time. whenever iâ€™m alone with my thoughts all i think about is dying or how overwhelmingly hopeless everything seems.

my brother cares about me but iâ€™m too scared to talk about this to him, heâ€™s the type of person to believe depression doesnâ€™t exist and suicidal tendencies are for the weak. my mom is swamped with work all the time and she doesnâ€™t seem to care (sheâ€™s also a large part of my emotional turmoil) both of them have seen me crying many times but usually just keep quiet and leave me alone. (my dad is entirely out of the picture, so no help from him) 

iâ€™ve tried talking to my school counsellor but the thought of having to book an appointment with her scares me and iâ€™m never able to do it.

iâ€™m just so lost i donâ€™t know what to do.
