I am not strongI am not strong. I've never been strong. But people tell me that I am strong.

I'm just tired. I'm tired of feeling like a victim. I'm tired of lashing out at people and hiding and being fearful. "The people to be the most afraid of are the people who are the most afraid."

I've been suicidal since I was 9. There was an 8 year period. I've been hospitalized twice for suicidal ideation and once for an attempt. 

It's not that I want to die. I'm afraid of dying. But I just can't keep on living. I ruin everything I touch.
