Done with thisI have a great life. Money, parents who are together. That's what matters, right? I've gotten accepted into colleges and make A's and B's and I'll be graduating in 4 months. But that's not enough. I have 3 friends who are barely around. I need them but I can't make them be around the sick excuse of a human I am. Boys don't like me, don't think I'm pretty, they like my ass but it ends there. I want to mean something to someone but I don't. 90% of people at school are mean to me to my face or behind my back or both. My parents recently started me on weight watchers. I'm 17. They won't let me eat anything really and threaten to cut off my only outlet, lacrosse, if I don't go to the gym every day. They buy me things because they feel guilty then punish me for being disrespectful and ungrateful and a bitch. They say these words to me. I want to die. I don't want to live where I can't be myself because what my parents want is not who I am. They want to change me and they say it's because they love but if they loved me they would work with me and accept me. I want to commit suicide but I'm too much of a wimp to brave the pain. I'm done with all of this shit.
