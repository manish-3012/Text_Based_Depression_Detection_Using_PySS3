Passive SII have BPD and struggle with passive SI, but its been so much worse lately. Recent stressors include I'm in school full time and hate my major and recently quit my job after only 1 month without notice because it was too stressful, then got chewed out by my boss. Mental health resources are scarce in my state and it feels like nobody can see me for a consult for at least a month. I can't go to the hospital because I don't have the money to pay for the bill and I can't take the time out of school. It so bad that I don't even leave my bed because I know I won't hurt myself as long as I'm safe and in bed. Just not sure what to do, need some support.
