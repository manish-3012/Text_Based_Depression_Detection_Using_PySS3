suicide by seizure from xanax withdrawals?lol this may be a long shot but please bear with me. i have about 30 2 mg xanax bars that are pharmaceutical and tested from someone i know. i have the ability to access these and get more at any given chance. 

i have taken 2 mg today, yesterday, and i plan to tomorrow as well (social anxiety). how many days consistently would i have to take xanax and at what dosage to have a seizure?

a friend of mine was taking 3-4 bars daily for 2 weeks and quit coke turkey and had a seizure and only came out alive because she wasnâ€™t home alone. would this be a possible way to commit suicide? if i were to have a seizure and planned to go cold turkey on a day iâ€™d be alone
