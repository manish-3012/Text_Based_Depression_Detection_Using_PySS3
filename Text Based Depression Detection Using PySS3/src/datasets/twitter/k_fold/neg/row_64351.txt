No legs, no lifeI can't feel below my knees, and at the hospital they have told me they cannot do anything about it. It stems from a hereditary condition. When it spreads to my hips and takes out my ability to walk completely, that's it. After that, I'm done. I absolutely cannot live like that. 
Just, idk what to do anymore. Thinking about not being able to use my legs has been literally bringing me to tears night after night. I need some fucking sleep. 

Edit: I should have been sleeping but instead all I can think about are my fucking legs. Thanks all the comments, reading through them has helped me think further on my situation.
