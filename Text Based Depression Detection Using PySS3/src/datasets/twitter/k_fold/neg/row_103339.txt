Dreamt about dying, now I can't stop thinking about ending my life. Beginning to worry at this point.hello, I've suffered from constant chronic pain for the last 2 decades, I've been all around the country for help, nothing works excepts opioid pain meds and not being upright so I'm basically paralyzed by proxy for a good deal of the time.

The other day I had this dream or vision, don't know which, where I was in a completely different place suddenly I was standing and then suddenly I lost my balance, fell in slow mode, and began blending into the external environment while my consciousness was fading.

I have never felt so much relief in the last 2 decades. I cannot even explain the feeling of being finally able to let go, it wasn't bliss but damn was it a good feeling anyways. 

This has just made me basically start to think ending things this way is meant to happen. Anyone else  have something similar happen and then come out of it intact and okay? The only thing stopping me is fear of an afterlife that is more painful--which is a terrible reason to live in this world, it basically negates my entire life, makes it only about just existing simply to try to avoid possibly worse pain-which in its own way is a kind of hellish place to be.
