Suicidal thoughts and periodsI always get suicidal a week and a half to two weeks before my period. The thoughts are so intense and scary. I have come close to killing myself several times in those couple of weeks. I tried to talk to several doctors who just will not listen to me. I can't afford counselling and I've been on the waiting list for counselling at my university for god knows how long. I don't want to die (well, I mean, death sounds appealing to me in those few weeks), and I'm scared I will kill myself. I don't know what to do. I can't deal with this every month for the rest of my life. I will die, literally and figuratively.
