I cant go on like this anymorei really just cant deal with it anymore. My dad constantly puts me down and makes me feel useless. It has gotten to the point were i dont even like life or look forward to the future. Like i dont want to get older and have a family and complete my goals and dreams anymore. I just want to die. My family doesnt have enough money to get me the help  i need. My dad just cancelled my car insurance that i pay for ( i dont really get why he canceled it when i already pay for it ). He just saw my room ( it was really messy ) and lost his mind. I just want to be happy but i cant deal with it. He makes me feel useless. i could be having a great day and he could text me anything and i would have anxiety. i just dont want to live like this anymore. and i know everyone is just gonna comment "its alright it always gets better, keep going" like i always comment but i really cant see it getting better. Im just a lazy piece of shit who will never get anything done. i just want it all to be over. I cant kill myself though because my mom and my brother. I dont know i figured i would just try and vent here because i have no one to talk to, or anyone i talk to just thinks im trying to make them feel bad for me or something. i just cant do it anymore and i dont know what to do.
