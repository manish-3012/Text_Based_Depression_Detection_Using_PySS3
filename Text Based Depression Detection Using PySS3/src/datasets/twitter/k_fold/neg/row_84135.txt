I think I'm doneI honestly do not know I can carry on. I don't where to start or what I want to say. Tomorrow might be different but today and last friday all I could think about was just switching off. I used to want out when I was a using addict but since I've been clean and sober for 10 years I've always coped pretty well. Even back then I only ever thought I wanted out because I couldn't stop using. Now I have 3 kids and one of which who has severe complex needs, makes it so difficult to deal with the guilt of feeling this way. I cant abandon them. My head is full of conflict and I guess it's the conflict that's keeping me here. My head is battered and I'm just so tired of just managing and coping. Happiness these days is real hard work. Its fabricated most of the time just for those around me to enjoy a version of me that they can tolerate. I hate living in my own skin, I hate taking breathes because each one is just effort these days. I'm just sounding off here. Please dont offer me support or sympathy because need it I guess, I just need to say it out loud.
