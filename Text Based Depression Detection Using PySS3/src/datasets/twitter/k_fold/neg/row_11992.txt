I am killing myself after I watch Star Wars, Return of the Jedi tonight.Iâ€™m going to watch my favorite movie of all time. Chill out in my bed. And drift off. No specifics. Just restful sleep. Iâ€™m excited, yet reluctant. Fearful, yet oddly hopeful. I hope everything goes blank. I hope my mind and conscience cease to exist. I hope I turn into.... nothing. An eternal sleep, after a lifetime of suffering. I hope I have memories, as I drift through the open space, thinking of all the good times I had, and reflecting on the bad. I have a lot of regrets, but they will wash away. I will become, alone, yet connected, dead yet, alive. Tonight, I will travel a journey we only get to travel once. Weather thereâ€™s a destination or not, well all get there. Itâ€™s just a matter of time. I wish you all luck and a happy life.
