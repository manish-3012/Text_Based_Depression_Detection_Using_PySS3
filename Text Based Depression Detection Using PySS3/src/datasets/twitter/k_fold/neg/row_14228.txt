Just want to get awayAll I fantasize about  is going to a beach with a small group of people, without internet, without electronics. Just to support each other and make a community, just so there would be genuine human connection. Tired of feeling trapped in society, especially when the world is dragging me along with things I don't agree with. I just want to escape the routine of working for an asshole and being suffocated by grades and family.  It's all so overwhelming. Just want space for my mind to breathe.
