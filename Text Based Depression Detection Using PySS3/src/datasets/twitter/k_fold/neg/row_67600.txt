Hi I need help, nobody I know loves or cares for me.I feel like I am going insane. Everyday I feel worse and worse, and I take it all out on myself. I always find flaws in everything I do and I hate myself for them. I cut myself when sharp things are available. I am nobody's favourite person. My mum is neglectful and I am suffering. I never get noticed and I hardly get the things I need. I hate myself. And I don't care if this is the wrong subreddit or not. I want to die.
No one is noticing me, I can't stand sound or people or myself. I can't stand anything, I break down regularly, and feel trapped.
I want to kill myself.
