Couples suckEverywhere I go, all I see are couples all over eachother... kissing, hugging, holding hands.  Gag me.  I even have an instagram where my â€œfriendsâ€ can post their happy couple pictures.  All it does is remind me of how much of a worthless piece of shit I am and how much Iâ€™m no good for anyone.  Everyone says â€œ oh the right person is out there.  Be patient â€œ.  I ducking 41..... at this point just fucking kill me.  Life fucking sucks. Iâ€™m done.
