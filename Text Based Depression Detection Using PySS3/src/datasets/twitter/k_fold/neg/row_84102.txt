I am leaving it all behindI don't expect anything here can change my mind, but I may as well try. I apologize in advance for the disorganized thought stream.

I left an arguably great job last year. I've almost drained my savings, and the remainder will be spent traveling to whatever next destination seems best. When it's almost gone, I will spend the remainder to end my life. Probable in the next few months. I feel I can't keep going, no matter what changes I make.

I can't hold a job, friendship, or relationship for more than a couple years. I've been very good at every job I have had. I'm friendly and kind and people seem to like me for the most part, at least up to a point. I eventually feel unwelcome, no matter the situation. I'm pretty sure it's my state of mind more often than not. I can't keep up with any hobby. I'm tired of everything. Have been for over a decade. Medication makes it worse. I don't love nor value myself, though I know I am capable.

I have plenty of people who care about me, and yet I still feel alone.

Therapy doesn't help. Everyone I have seen seems to not know how to help.

Everything in life feels like a sham, and I can't find enjoyment in it in really any way. Things that bring me enjoyment one day are uninteresting the next. Nothing makes the drudgery of self-sustenance worthwhile. Nothing about me is consistent, except depression/anxiety.

I believe that I'm not meant for this world, and no one has been able to nudge that belief in any direction. In the end, I still have to survive, and I have no reason to do so.

I've been here for nearly 35 years and people always says it'll get better. It really, really has not, and the sum keeps getting lower. My life doesn't look at all like I should feel this way, unless you count my baseless, incessant self-pity. I just never feel good about it.

So hit me with your best shot. Or not.
