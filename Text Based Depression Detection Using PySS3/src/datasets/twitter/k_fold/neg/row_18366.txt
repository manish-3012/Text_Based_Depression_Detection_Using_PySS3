I can't help but think why bother...So I started noFap, and I'm 4 days in. But before that, and for a while, I've despised my life and everything in it. I quit my job because after 5 years, I felt like a robot, undergoing the same routine everyday. I also quit cuz after 5 years they wouldn't give me full time after I had put everything in my being to stand out and be the viable candidate for it.

So I have no job, I'm doing noFap and with that comes all the lack of confidence that I've experienced throughout my life. I have been trying to reassess my good qualities, but im always discouraged by the qualities vanity accepts most ( money, security, a nice car, etc. ). Because of my monetary failures and the fact that I live with my parents in a house we're getting kicked out of at the end of the month (nowhere to move to yet) I've been feeling pretty down in the dumps.

The last few days I've really talked myself into doing things better (resisting sexual cravings, working out, even smiling at others more and casual conversation). I don't take it past here because i don't see myself as worthy to others, and all the things I'm doing to occupy my time doesn't translate into anything I feel I can share.

TL:DR I feel unworthy of others (especially women) and wished I was dead to help my parents undergoing bankruptcy to avoid having another face to worry about, because all I feel essentially Is shitty, no matter that I'm doing the things I feel to try and change it
