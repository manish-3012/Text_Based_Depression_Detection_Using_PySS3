I am the one who has ruined me.I push away the only people who care about me. I freak out and canâ€™t deal with my feelings. I started to fall in love with someone who is astonishing and I lost it and scared them off. I tried so hard to apologize. They just said they need a few days to think of how to respond to me.

Iâ€™m alone, and itâ€™s always my fault. I canâ€™t trust anyone. I am so tired of sabotaging myself because of my past traumas. Iâ€™m falling apart and my soul is dying. I am constantly crying. I gave my guns to my sibling. I regret that so much right now, because I want to kill myself so badly. I have my meds. If I take them all, maybe it will do it. I have considered just buying another gun at this point. I have the money to.

I hate myself and want to die. Why am I like this? I canâ€™t just let things happen. I canâ€™t continue like this. The therapists donâ€™t help. The shrinks just keep changing the pills. The pills do nothing for me. I canâ€™t keep someone in my life no matter how incredible they are. They keep trying to save me, and I refuse to let them, until I regret all Iâ€™ve said and done. Then the damage is done.

Iâ€™m going to try taking all my pills when I get home. Maybe that will do it.
