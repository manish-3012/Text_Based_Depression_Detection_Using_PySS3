If they won't even protect me, then I don't want be here.I was safer living a school. There were hardly any Covid cases in that county, and I had my own room to self-isolate. 

My family pulled me back here where cases are getting out of control and they still go to large gatherings and don't practice social distancing.

8 people in my extended family are sick because they were doing the same shit. I don't feel safe here.

I want to have control. I feel like I'm waiting to die. I want to get it over with already.
