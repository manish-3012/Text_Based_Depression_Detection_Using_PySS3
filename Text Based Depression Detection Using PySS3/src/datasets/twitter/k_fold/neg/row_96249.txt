How can I help my suicidal spouse?My husband has been dealing with depression for a few months now and things are escalating so quickly I fear I will loose him! About 6 weeks ago he started having depression symptoms and started seeing a counselor. Two weeks ago it got the the point of him being suicidal, and he left in his car to do so, but we (his friend and I) talked him down. He started smoking cigarettes and has been shopping and gambling as self medication. After that instance he went to a MHMR and they gave him a care plan, and set him with with a general practitioner to get on meds, which was pushed out a month being a new patient. On Monday he leftthe house and send me a suicide letter. I finally got in touch with him and he came home covered in blood. He had cut himself with a razor on his are 89 times and his face and neck 42 times. It was superficial wounds and I got him cleaned up. He didn't even look like himself in the eyes, like he wasn't even in there. Finally he snapped out of it and we went to bed and I called off work the next day to be with him and watch him. He missed 2 days of work and went back today. When he got there he was fired for missing work. Ugh! I don't knkw what to do at this point. I thought about calling 911 when he came home bloody but I though they might not be very helpful and with hime being uninsured it would cause a financial burden on him. I feel like his care plan isn't working as they haven't scheduled therapy with him which I would think woukd be the top priority since they know he's suicidal (he told them). What should I do?
