I can't handle the hand I've been dealt anymoreI've been in an abusive marriage for 11 years..... and I can't seem to escape no matter how hard I try. I'm not allowed to get angry or fight back whenever he does anything. He uses everything against me, he's yelling constantly and always telling me I'm crazy. I can't handle the amount of pressure he always puts on me. A few years ago I made a friend at school who said they wanted to help me... he degraded me and would oscillate between being helpful and hurtful. So much of what I went through with my husband was mirrored with what happened in that friendship. Hearing their words hurts so much. I feel like I have no future or ability to move on with my life. I worked really hard to get to where I'm at but I can't handle everything that's happened. They both told me its my fault and I"m always the victim. I can't handle this anymore.
