I have had 3 suicide attempts in the past 2 weeks.I'm so sick, so fed up of being like this.      
PTSD, BPD and Dyspraxia.      
There is always something I have to deal with, and I can't keep this up anymore.          
I tried getting help, and was let down. I was told I wasn't in the right mindset for it.        
They just put me on medication and sent me away.        
I can't do it, I'm truly well done here.      
I need a break from my head.
