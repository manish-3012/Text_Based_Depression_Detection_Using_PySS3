I'm total scum and I probably should end it already...Lemme preface this by saying I know there are people with real problems and struggles. I can't begin to describe the guilt I have. Here I am, a 22 year old white male who's been given several opportunities to be great, and all I've done is give up time and time again.
I remember having suicidal thoughts as early as 9 or 10 years old, and I remember expressing ideas I was having of hanging myself to one of my friends during that time. These thoughts have persisted over the years, and it's getting worse now that as an adult, I find myself unable to adapt to the challenges I am expected to face.
I was given a full-ride through college that I threw away during my first semester which resulted in a 0.0 GPA. I gave up because I thought I had already messed up too badly from neglecting my schoolwork to keep going. This blunder has stuck with me for years.
More recently, I feel like I've been pushed to the edge given the fact I dropped out of Navy boot camp about a month ago. I had been living at home for a couple of years, (after a brief stint living with a girlfriend for about 8 months) and during that time I had become sick of feeling like a failure, so I caved in to what family members were telling me about joining the military. I ended up enlisting into the Navy's nuclear field which is perhaps the best rate one can end up with in terms of advancement and bonuses. Admittedly, I encountered a little more drama than most after arriving at boot camp due to the fact I was held up while they ran tests on my heart for about a month, which gave me a lot of time to reflect on what I was doing, but pretty early into this time away from training, I decided all I wanted was to leave. I was doing pretty terribly in training in all honesty, and I found myself completely distraught over the idea of committing 6 years of my life to something I would undoubtedly be terrible at. Basically, I decided that I wanted out, and I had even hoped something was wrong with my heart, so that I would be sent home without having to explain anything to anyone. Well, after a month, I was sent back to training. After a week and a half, I said my knee hurt and after some tricky wording to my doctor about my pain, I was put into separations. I have been lying to everyone since I came home to avoid any more problems. 
After I knew I would do what it took to leave, I came to the conclusion that the first thing I would do when I got home would be to buy a gun. This way, I would have a choice for once whether or not I wanted to go on living. The pain of hanging myself or doing something similar always scared me. Well, I lived up to that promise, and now I feel like there's only one choice for someone like me.
I am total scum that doesn't know how to deal with the real world, and I fear I will never have a real connection with anyone in my life given that I have retreated into myself so much due to the shame I feel. All I want is to be left alone sometimes. I am not a real man and I don't know what I can do to start being one, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to reverse the damage I've done to my life or overcome how weak I am... I've literally done nothing of value to anyone and I feel that I'm destined to become a cautionary tale. I don't know what to do anymore...
