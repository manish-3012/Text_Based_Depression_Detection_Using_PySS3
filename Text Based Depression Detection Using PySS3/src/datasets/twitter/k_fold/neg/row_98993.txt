Just another one unable to cope with lifeSo, the thing about 'having depression' for me is, I never knew about it. I always felt this way and I don't remember anything else - which includes that I have completely forgotten everything that happened in my life prior to puberty.
One of the earliest memories that I have now is, when I was something around 13. I do remember that at that time all the other children in school were hanging out with each other, except for me. I was too shy to ever do anything about it so I usually hung out alone here.
Thats over 10 years in the past now. Except for about 400 consecutive days where I felt good about myself because I wasn't alone anymore, I've always contemplated suicide, every day. I made plans that I eventually threw away, because all of them involved not being a wimp and actually be determined and finally end myself. Sadly up to this day I wasn't up for the task.
Anyway, something - for me - rather impactful happened at the very beginning of this year which put me into another crisis and finally got me to open up to one of the very few friends I have. Turned out to be a mistake unfortunately, since he straight up went to my parents and told them about it. They convinced me to get counseling and medical therapy, which started by the end of january.
So now, after 9 month of weekly appointments with my therapists and taking antidepressants I am more convinced than ever that those things are not helpful at all. It's making things even worse because it's a huge waste of time and also I feel terrible everytime I have to talk about the reasons because its basically just a regular reminder pf why I hate being alive.
Last week I ditched my therpist and I stopped taking the antidepressants. I know you shouldn't do that but I feel like that was the best thing to do. I finally feel like I could accomplish a fatal task.
I made a new friend at the University who also deals with depression. She copes with it my cutting herself in places where no one sees. Alas, she didn't mean to give tips but she *accidentally* did anyway so I started doing it to. I don't even think I have it under control. It's just happening when I can't deal with life for a moment.
Another thing that I kinda lost control of is Marijuana abuse. I know it's not a serious drug but in the past I smoked one or two at the weekend just to relax but for a few months now, I consume at least 1 gram a day. As soon as the effect fades away I immediately start feeling bad about myself and everything again so I take the next hit.
This whole text is pretty badly structured and probably incomprehensive and I doubt that anyone actually cares, but I had to get this out there.
To get to the core of the problem, I hate living this live without anyone in existence caring enough to show genuine love for me. I'm gomma stay alone forever, there is no way around it. There is no medication in the world that can change the fact that there is nothing desirable about me and no one would ever want to be with me.
Antidepressants won't help with this, neither will therapy. I said that before but after trying it out and seriosly trying to make it work, I noticed I was correct all along. Tell me, what am I supposed to do now, except for killing myself? I often get lost in thoughts when driving so maybe finally in the next few days this will be over. Until then I am grateful for any advice you can give.
