First and only relationship ended. Can't cope.My whole life has been shit for one reason or another. It's always gone in fits and starts, with breakdowns inbetween. Short periods of activity,work,friends, me trying to be the best at work or everybody else's best friend just to be needed and being shat on and used. I've not worked now for ten years because of depression and anxiety and some awful experiences at work.  

I never had a relationship with anyone, never believed it even to be possible, but met an amazing guy 3 years ago, but we've never been able to make it work. It's disintegrating into a mess, I can't see him anymore, it was my only shot having anyone in my life. i waited almost half a fucking century for the first person to say "i love you" but I'm too fucked up to handle any of it, the intimacy, the sex, the trust.

I can't go on rebuilding my life time after time every few years, i can;t do it anymore. I'm exhausted and just want to die. I can't stop crying. every time we start to talk to each other it just gets too intense. I held everything back and now I realise what i've lost. I want to kill myself tonight. Totally had enough. 

**EDIT** Thanks to all those strangers who talked to me last night. I'm really touched you did that. I took a bunch of valium last night, on top of all the booze I fell to sleep straightaway and must have slept like a log. good to have a whole night's sleep. Still feeling shit today. But thanks.
