who cares?if i killed myself right now, which i absolutely could, what would it matter? iâ€™m a horrible mother and i deserve to die anyways. every morning i wake up and immediately cry that i have to do this shit all over again. i hate it. i hate everything!! i donâ€™t want to be here. i feel like my mental illness has won, iâ€™m just a shell of the person i used to be. all i think about is dying and different ways of killing myself. i canâ€™t even think positive anymore. i want out.
