I need peaceI'm done with this life. I'm 25 and have been suffering from anxiety and OCD attacks for 7 years now. My energy and spirit has been sapped and there's nothing I wish to do more than go into a state of deep sleep forever. I love my father so much but the pain is starting to exceed that love. I'm a broken man and I want to go.
