I trust no one around me now...Im going to leave everyone in the morning and attempt to make it for myself by myself. My life took a sharp turn for the worse towards the end of 2019. I've never felt so low and defeated in my life. I figure I'll go out trying at the very least. I'll be homeless and on the streets but I can't stay at my friends parents place stuck up in my head anymore.I feel like a leach to them and I'm going crazy doing nothing all day. 

I was told to "man up" by someone I consider extremely close to me. Its been repeating in my head all week. So I will make an attempt to save myself and do it all on my own for once. If I make something of myself then great. If not and I die on the streets at least I tried right?
