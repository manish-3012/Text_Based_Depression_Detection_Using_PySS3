Friend in trouble, I'm not really sure how to interpret this but the pieces are coming together. Hi,

I have recently started talking with an old friend whom I was very close with. She lives in another province but said that she is coming to visit on the in two weeks. Then she asked me to read over something, she said she was sorry and wanted to know if there was anything she needed to add.

This is the note in question,

&gt; I'll die a musician, I would have been a child prodigy if I had lessons, I have all the skills you can name in the book but like exceptionally great skills. And I loved skills... I have aspergers or now called autism. Just look at the characteristics. I have only all the strengths. http://www.autismcanada.org/aboutautism/characteristics.html . I'll die with aspergers. I'll die a philosopher. I have my theories and such saved on my laptop. Like that every thought is energy, therefore we are energy, and therefore god is a mass of energy.  I'm giving my laptop to my mom. If anyone is interested in knowing some, then just ask my mom. A little later though, at 416 277 1809. And 416 326 8807. 
I love myself. I am a truly amazing person. Open, non judgmental/accepting, caring, and all that good stuff.

I did not think much of it until I saw her status update two minutes later.

&gt;Whoever wants to join my suicide club . MSG me

She's thought about committing suicide before but the last i've heard of it was 6-7 years ago, when we were both in junior high. I'm really at a loss for what to do right now. Please help!
