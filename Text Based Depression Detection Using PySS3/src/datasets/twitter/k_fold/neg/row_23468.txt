I've made my plans, not today though.I've been planning my last day for a little over 2 months now. August 9th, I get paid that day so that makes my plans a little bit easier. I'm going to go to DC, watch a baseball game, eat barbecue for dinner, play chess with the hustlers at DuPont Circle, and then I will put a bullet in my head somewhere off of the highway late at night so even if I survive, I'll just bleed out before anyone can get to me. I'm pretty excited for it, truth be told. 

It kind of really started when my kid's mom took him out of town on my birthday, so I didn't even get to see him, and honestly, he is the only reason I have been getting out of bed for the past 2 years. I've lost my ex, which hurts a lot, but I'm not going to off myself over that. However, She has been systematically reducing the time I spend with him and implanting him with ideas that I am a bad person that he should be fearful of. We still live together, but that's about to change and I'm going to be relegated to backseat/part-time maybe 2 days a week having to watch someone else raise my kid. Eventually he will come to loathe the days he has to be with my sad and pathetic existence within my miserable apartment so it's best I do this before he can formulate any real memories of me. Well that's my tale, or at least the parts I could organize and put down. 

If anyone has read this, and want to help, first of all thank you, but I encourage you to help those who have more immediate needs. I know that I've tried to help some people on this sub, and I hope you don't think I'm hypocritical for being this way.
