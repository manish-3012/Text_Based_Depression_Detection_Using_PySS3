I have to keep my mind occupied with the music I writeI'm undiagnosed OCD. I have a guitar compulsion and a writing obsession. If i don't use my imagination for my music though it goes against me by creating horrible things i take entirely too seriously. so I'm always on a musical journey writing or drawing album art or something for my music if I'm not taking care of my son. I'm a 34 year old father. My son is 5 and we both live in my parents basement since we lost our apartment in October and had to move in here. He is going to be spending more time with his mom starting this summer and that frees me up to play my music around while staying at a friend's in town. As productive and positive as this sounds I'm actually quite sick. I'm afraid of the outcome if things take off and also terrified of what I might do if I'm working full\-time again and my mind fills up with that kind of hellish shit. I have trouble in work settings and school settings. I never really broke out of my shell in those places. Rather I rotted away and got all creepy and gross feeling. I keep snapping back into that character in environments like that. Idk why. I had to create my own world where I'm ok. That's what my music is. It's helped me crawl out of the pits I dug in my mind by giving me something else to focus on.
