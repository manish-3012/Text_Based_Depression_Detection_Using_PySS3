Ready to do it soonJust have no idea why I am bothering to continue taking up oxygen. Nobody loves or respects me. Nobody would miss me. There is literally zero reason for me to be alive. I matter to nobody. 

Family disowned me, no friends, no lovers. I would finally be at peace. 

It is just so painful to mean nothing and have no place in the world. I would rather just stop existing.
