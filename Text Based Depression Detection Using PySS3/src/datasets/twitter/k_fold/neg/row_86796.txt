Suicide is all I can think about lately.Suicide is all I can think about lately. Nothing is going well for me. I feel like the walls are closing in on me and I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I have tried talking to my family and they just think I am seeking attention. The only thing thatâ€™s preventing me from doing it is my 10 year old son. The pain is just too much as I sit here typing this sitting in a puddle of my tears.
