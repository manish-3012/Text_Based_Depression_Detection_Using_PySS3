Can't deal with my own obsession anymore, don't want to liveI loved her. I still do. We were together four years (lesbians). Then she wanted a threesome with a friend of mine and I lost her. just like that. it's been two years of drawn out nightmarish hell and now they live together. The pain never stops. I never stop thinking about how humiliated I am, how lonely and how they thought so little of me that they threw me out of my own relationship. I must be worthless. 

I can't stand thinking about this anymore. It is literally the only thing I think about and it's driven me mad. I can't take it anymore and I'm going to go hang myself.

Guess i thought someone should know.
