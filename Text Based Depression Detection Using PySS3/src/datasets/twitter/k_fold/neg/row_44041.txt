How do I make it stopNot life, the thoughts, every second Iâ€™m not doing something itâ€™s all I think about, I donâ€™t want to die, I just want to be happy but I feel like Iâ€™m being prevented from doing so. I wake up every morning and lie in bed for hours without the motivation to wake up I canâ€™t sleep because of the thoughts, when does it stop? How does it stop? Please Iâ€™m getting tired of it
