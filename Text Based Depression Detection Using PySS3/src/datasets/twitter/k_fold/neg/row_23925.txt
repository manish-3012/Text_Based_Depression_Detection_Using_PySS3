Being a male is a curse in today's societyI am not transgender.  I am male through and through.  But society hates men.  I am about to turn 18 and I can already see how depressingly true this is.  Men and boys are not considered valuable.  For example, an average looking woman can have as many romantic/sexual partners as she wants.  An average looking man will be lucky to find one.  A woman is comforted when something bad happens because society cares about her.  A man is called a loser.  If women don't find a man attractive, he is "creepy".  

I do not hate or have anything against women in general, but in my opinion, they have almost everything easier.  Girls have manipulated me, rejected me, bullied me, lied to me, and taken advantage of me numerous times in the past.  And that is socially acceptable.  What is not socially acceptable is for me to be offended by it.  

I do not want to live in a world that is so corrupt and against me.  As Jordan Peterson said: "there is nothing in society more valuable than a young woman.  And there is nothing in society less valuable than a young man".  Society is against me, so I'm going to do it a favor and give it one less thing to worry about.  Thanks for reading,
