Expeessing emotionsHow do you...... express? Emotions. I mean Iâ€™ve been burying my emotions since I was like five. I mean I had to be a support for my older brothers who have mental disabilities, so I had to be a pillar of support and stop being a little girl. So now all I feel is like, pain? Iâ€™m not even sure. I can only laugh and cry when Iâ€™m watching anime, usually, other times I feel like crying all the time, which is usually cause my brothers, well only my brothers I guess. But at least, one out of four of my brothers have multiple mental disabilities, I guess Iâ€™ve just gotten used to being monotone and pretending feelings, like smiling during class and fake being angry. So..... how do you feel anything, but pain? I donâ€™t know what I usually feel, But itâ€™s familiar.
