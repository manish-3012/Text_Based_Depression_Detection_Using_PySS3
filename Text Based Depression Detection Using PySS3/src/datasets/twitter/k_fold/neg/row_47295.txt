I feel so lost. Been feeling like this since I could remember.Whoever said life is easy is such a lie. I have learned that the hardest thing an individual can do is live life. Some background information about me I guess is to say that my life isn't bad. I grew up with my parents and sister. My family is pretty religious and I'm not due to my own personal reasons. I went to catholic school all of my life being told that God will always be there to guide you, but it's whatever to me. I would say I'm very open minded and empathetic to everyone. You could say I care about others too much. I don't know. Lately, life has been dealing me a very shitty hand. I had to put a hiatus on my education at college due to the fact that I don't have money. I have a job and make a decent amount of money, but most of it helps out my family and I can't really save up to pay for college. It fucking sucks. I feel like I have no other options. I can go to the military and utilize their benefits and whatnot, but I feel like I would be joining for the wrong reasons. I'm 21 and people talk about how college is the way you'll have a secured future. I just feel like I'm going to burn out one of these days and give up, but I don't want to, at least I don't think I do. But what other choice do I have...
