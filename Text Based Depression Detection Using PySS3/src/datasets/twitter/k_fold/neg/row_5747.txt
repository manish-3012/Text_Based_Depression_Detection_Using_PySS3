Goodbye everyoneI've been a lurker here, and now I'm saying my goodbyes. I've been exchanging nude photos with a girl I met on okcupid and we've been talking for a while. Turns out she's 16 and she lied on her profile and said she was over 18. Her father caught her in the bathroom making a pornographic video for me that I didn't even ask for. The laptop she was using got broken and I can either cover half of the cost (1400 my end) or go to jail. He insists she told me her age and I ignored her, but she didn't. Apparently he's been at Verizon all day and they searched her phone.

Anyways, I'm not going to jail and being pegged as a sex offender for something like this. I can't do it, I had such huge plans to be a chemist and do great things, but now they're all gone. I'm planning to kill myself soon.
