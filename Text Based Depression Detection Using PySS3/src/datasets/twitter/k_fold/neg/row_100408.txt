One weekIâ€™ve made my plan. I just gotta hold on for one more week and Iâ€™m leaving this life for good. Iâ€™m so ready but so, so scared. Iâ€™ll miss my friends. My horse. My dog. But I canâ€™t even love them right anymore. Iâ€™m doing them and myself no good by staying here. 

I just hope that when Iâ€™m gone my family can admit how miserable theyâ€™ve made me. If I could get professional help, Iâ€™m almost positive Iâ€™d be able to keep myself alive. But theyâ€™re the reason I canâ€™t. Theyâ€™re the reason I choose death, because every time I open up they laugh at me, act like Iâ€™m joking, like my feelings are a joke. Theyâ€™re the reason Iâ€™ll be gone in a week. 

Anyways, Iâ€™m tired. I have so much to think about until the day comes. I doubt my mind will change though. I hope it does. 

If it doesnâ€™t, then goodbye. 
Iâ€™ll see you all (hopefully much) later.
