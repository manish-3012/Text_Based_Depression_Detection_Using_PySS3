When i was i was 12 i wanted to end itIt was after school, i got a detention, and i was tired of trying to live up to expectations my parents set. There was a bus coming real fast. And i stood in front. And waited. It never hit. My friend pulled me away. Ive lost contact with her but, man i wish they hadnâ€™t I would feel better than i do now. But im not gonna do it any more. Im gonna live, get a job that pays alot, then throw money in my parents faces asking them if this was what they wanted. I want to overcome this. 
Thanks for letting me vent
