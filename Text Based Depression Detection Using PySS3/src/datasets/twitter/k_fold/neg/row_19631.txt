Another failureHey everyone, looking for some impartial advice as today the suicidal thoughts are really dominating.

Iâ€™ve been depressed my whole life I was bullied at school and suffered some emotional and physical abuse at home so I never really had any respite from other peopleâ€™s torture. This has left me as an adult with awful anxiety around other people and I have had spells of Agoraphobia. Despite this Iâ€™m a functioning parent and wife and if I donâ€™t need to leave the house I am a half decent person. 

I stopped working ten years ago when I had my first child and we have lived comfortably on my husbands salary in that time. I even did a degree part time during this time, with no real pressure to socialise or be around people I was at my most relaxed in years. Thatâ€™s come to an end now as my kids are older. I applied for a graduate job in January 2019 and by some miracle I got it. Itâ€™s taken a whole year of blood sweat and tears and a demanding recruitment process. Iâ€™ve had many, many panic attacks in this time, in fact I would say the build up to getting this job has been hell on Earth. 

Iâ€™m due to start on Monday morning and here I am on Friday wondering how Iâ€™m going to kill myself over the weekend. I cannot start this job, my entire body aches with adrenaline and fear. I canâ€™t walk into that room full of people and act like a normal person when Iâ€™m not one. I used to have some resilience and I could hide myself, but I canâ€™t now. I simply panic. I cry. I leave. 

The alternative is to let my family down, again, by cancelling something last minute. Something we know will help give us all a â€œbetter lifeâ€ ie financial stability. 

I feel Iâ€™m actually at the end of my rope now and canâ€™t take anymore of these crippling thoughts.
