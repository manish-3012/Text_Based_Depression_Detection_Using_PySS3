I canâ€™t function anymoreI just donâ€™t want to exist. Thatâ€™s the only thought in my head right now. I canâ€™t do anything that takes brain power because 100% of my brain is just thinking about how much Iâ€™d love to disappear. Itâ€™s debilitating. Things arenâ€™t fun anymore. The only reason I do anything is to distract myself from my own thoughts. I donâ€™t have any motivation to be better, I donâ€™t get joy from anything, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m stuck inside my own head. 
I get high pretty much anytime Iâ€™m not at work just to numb myself, just to forget briefly how I feel. Whatâ€™s the point anymore? 
I actually made an appointment with a therapist, but I just didnâ€™t go. I donâ€™t even know what they would do, itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ve gone through something traumatic and I can work through it, Iâ€™m just an ego centric piece of crap. I have no reason to feel like this and yet I do, I donâ€™t want to waste other people time to â€˜helpâ€™ me. I donâ€™t deserve other peopleâ€™s time, thereâ€™s nothing they could do anyway. 
The worst part is that I know my family would shower me with support, I have access to it, but I donâ€™t want them to be worried about me. I know that they know something is up though, I basically just stay in bed all day until work. 
I donâ€™t want to be they family me never that everyone has in the back of their mind as â€œgod, I have to worry about him still.â€ I donâ€™t want everyone to act differently around me because they know I hate myself. But I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve been getting more and more suicidal recently. I have a bottle of Norco that I never used from a surgery. I guess the only reason I kept it is just in case I wanted to use it. 
Anyway, thereâ€™s all my feelings Iâ€™ve been bottling for 8 years barfed out into text.
