Friend is suicidal. Should I tell someone?I have a really good friend who is suicidal. As far as I know he doesn't have any concrete plans about when and how. But he tells me that it will happen sometime in the next few years at most. He is very determined, and I honestly believe he will go through with it if nothing happens. 

The problem is that we are internet friends, so to speak. I've never met him personally, and I don't know any of his friends or family. It's also really hard for me to talk to him, as I don't know what to say. This far I feel like I can't be very helpful, and that I'm saying the wrong things. I will read up here on how to improve this, how to talk to him, but I think it's very difficult when I can't see him in person (We live in different countries). 

He claims that the only people he has told about his suicidal thoughts are me and his therapist (who he recently started seeing, according to him). I feel like I can't be entirely sure that he has told everything to his therapist though. Should I reach out to the therapist (I know his name) and give all the information I know, so I can be sure my friend gets the right treatment? Should I try to contact one of his family members who might be in a better position to help him? Or should I just try to provide the best help I can myself, even though I feel like I'm not fit to help? I would love any advice on what to do, as this is a very difficult situation for me.
