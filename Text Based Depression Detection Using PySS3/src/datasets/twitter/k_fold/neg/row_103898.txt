Suicidal because of heavy financial problems.Hey all,

I've been having financial problems for the past 7 years or so and it's not because I'm financially undisciplined, in fact I'm frugal and smart about my money. I have terrible luck with employment (only ever had 1 full time job) and I am trying to save money to finish college. I have 3 courses left to finish college and get my bachelor's degree but the lack of it is heavily impeding my chances of holding a steady job that pays me enough to pay my student loans as well as save money for college.

Due to this, I resorted to freelancing. It's been great, I've made some money but this financial problem is also with my family and whatever I earned I helped them and I paid my student loan that's due every month. But freelancing is volatile and right now I have an employer who will potentially give me projects but he needs to wait for his clients to pay him. Honestly at this point, I'm fully expecting it to fizzle out because life always finds a way to fuck me anyway.

I blame nobody but myself. The path I've gone down has been hard and I could have chosen the easier path, but I made mistakes. All I want is to be able to earn a steadier income to help me build my life but life is just obstructing my path. If this project doesn't come through I'm back to square one and I feel like I should kill myself because I'm running out of energy to even handle this anymore. 

I'm lost and my mistakes have made a heavy impact on my family and myself. Why bother living if I consistently get fucked over no matter how hard I work and if I just caused burden and hardship to my family and myself? Fuck this life.

Also, I don't have any issues with self esteem, women, etc. I'm a pretty normal person and I only need a damn job and money to get me out of this rut. I'm willing to sacrifice a limb or a couple of limbs if it means getting me out of this, honestly.
