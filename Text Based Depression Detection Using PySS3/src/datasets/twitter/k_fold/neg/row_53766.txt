Buying a gun todayToday is the day I buy the gun. Iâ€™ve written my letters and I plan on sending them shortly. I donâ€™t want to own the gun longer than a day because I have no where to put it. So, hopefully by tonight, Iâ€™ll be gone. 

Is it selfish to call the person out who caused  this? I wrote her a long note and I feel like she wonâ€™t even care that Iâ€™m gone. Any tips for letters?
