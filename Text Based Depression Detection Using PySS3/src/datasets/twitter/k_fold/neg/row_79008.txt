Anyone want to help?I'm literally breaking down. I can't take this anymore. Does anyone else desperately want to kill themselves but feel guilty leaving their family behind? It would just be another disappointing thing I did. I have no one in my life besides my dog. I love her so much but honestly think she'd be better off with someone who wasn't a piece of shit.
