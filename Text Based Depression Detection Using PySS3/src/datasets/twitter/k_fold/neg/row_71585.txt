I don't want to kill myself, I just wish someone else would just kill meI'm over my head with work, I'm never happy with anything I do. everything's about getting into college which means I don't do anything I enjoy and I'm upset with anything less than perfect grades. I've never really been happy with myself, only temporarily satisfied or distracted. I don't care about any of my friends or even my girlfriend I just keep them around because otherwise I'd have no one to talk to. my parents don't understand why I'm not instantly happy when they buy me things and when I bring up my concerns they just yell at me and fight all the time. I'm hopeless, there's nothing I'm looking forward to just a future of disappointing myself and hard work for no purpose. I just want to die. I guess this is me giving up for once, well see how it goes.
