I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.Iâ€™m so sick of all of this. I havenâ€™t had a day where Iâ€™ve actually felt remotely good in so long and Iâ€™m so tired of all of this. I always feel like fucking shit and I donâ€™t know what to do about it. I get so goddamn anxious whenever Iâ€™m in almost any social situation and Iâ€™m tired of it. Iâ€™m so fucking behind in school and when I actually try to do any of the work I donâ€™t even do all that well on it and my teachers probably all think Iâ€™m lazy and stupid. Really the only thing keeping me from offing myself is that I donâ€™t want to make people sad with my death.
