Mentally self harming is not enoughI wish I have the guts to cut :( I really hate living with my siblings and being ugly. I always get blamed and accused. I want to die easily and left this mean and dark world. I can't feel any love or anything. Even loneliness is my second nature. I feel not complete or myself without anxiety and depression.
