Born with birth defects that I canâ€™t afford to treat, every tooth a cavity and will probably need dentures soon at 18 because hygiene never enforced as kid.Best way to opt out? In a situation like this I feel wronged for even being born, itâ€™s too much saving up to get surgery for problems I was born with and dental implants easier to just end it.
