Not looking for methods to end it, but more like how to prepare so that my family doesn't have to deal with much after.I don't have a plan. I don't want to hurt, I don't want to create any horrifying mental image for anyone that would find me...I don't want to survive in horrible condition...    I no just want to sleep. Forever.
But that's not what this is about. I find I can't even take comfort in knowing that at any time if it gets too hard I can just exit. Somehow I think knowing that would be a relief.  But how does one make it easiest for their loved ones?
  I don't want them having access to my phone and conversations I've had about my struggles, or my email etc....   So closing accounts, deleting, those are all things to have ready to go.
But I know there's so much more.  What to do with my childhood keepsakes, coordinating all of the family photos and videos from the past 20 years, letters telling them that it's ok... I know they lived me even though they couldn't show it.  These are the things I've thought of.  But what am I missing? If anyone had had to go through the horror of losing a loved one, to any cause....   What could they have done to make it easier?
  I'm a 47 year old mom of 3, and my life has been in a spiral since my husband serial adultery 6 years ago. I've tried to move on in so many ways, but I was a stay at home mom and now with my youngest being 15 and my husband off in his own place and taking the current girlfriend in vacations and to do all the things we used to do, I just don't have a place. Every attempt to move on has been met with failure and I'm just so so tired. Defeated. And more and more the one thing I look forward to is just peaceful darkness.   Again I don't have a plan in place, I just think it would be theraputic to have my ducks in a row... It might even be enough of a comfort to get me through a few more years and maybe to actually new life.  I hope that makes sense, and I hope people have suggestions.
