Distancing myself from everyone. Including family.Now that Iâ€™ve collected my thoughts and feelings. 
I have something to say, 

Tonight one of my bros came home shit faced. Got into a huge fight with my parents and then my older brother, whose cabin weâ€™re currently at. My older bro then came out after hearing it and they go at it.

The joys of alcohol. But I canâ€™t blame my bro because I too have indulged in alcohol because of my own problems . And now I will do so again because of this whole incident.

I wouldnâ€™t be lying if I said I feel like Iâ€™m â€œdoneâ€ with living. There may be this tiny fraction or part of me that clings on ever so lightly to hope, but itâ€™ll break at the thought of anymore problems. 

Itâ€™s almost like my spirit of life has been broken. Or my effort to even try anymore. I feel like I may become mute. Never speak unless spoken to. Never interact with anyone unless I absolutely have to. I just feel like Iâ€™m a particle floating around in blackness. 

People say life has its ups and downs but I just feel like Iâ€™m this grey, old, disoriented figure walking among the bright beauty of what people call â€œlifeâ€. 

I donâ€™t want any pity. Just needed to let that out. I donâ€™t know what the future holds, but yeah...
