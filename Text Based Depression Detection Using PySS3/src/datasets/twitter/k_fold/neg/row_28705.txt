I only spread miseryI can't have any sort of positive interaction online or even read anything written by someone else without hating them or someone they're talking about. i don't know why I'm so hateful now. I seem to get along with people well enough in real life but I also don't have friends so who knows. I'm just so perpetually angry and miserable, and I hate that I can't just at least talk to people online normally since I find people boring or uninteresting or useless to me in real life. I deleted an account i posted with on here earlier for some reason because I was angry I guess and now I'm just back here again wondering what would it be like if I actually succeeded in hanging myself a week ago. now I'm just some emotional idiot wandering around causing harm to people because all I can do is either hate them or overempathize with them
