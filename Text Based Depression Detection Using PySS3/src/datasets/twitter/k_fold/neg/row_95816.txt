Iâ€™m doneIâ€™m ready to do it. Iâ€™ve had enough of life. Everything hurts too much. I canâ€™t even move. I seriously just want to die. Thereâ€™s nothing I have to live for anymore. Iâ€™m so alone. So fucking alone. This world isnâ€™t meant for me. I donâ€™t have a place here. I canâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™m a worthless piece of shit. I canâ€™t stand myself anymore.

Iâ€™m ready to go.
