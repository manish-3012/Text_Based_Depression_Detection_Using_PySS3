It's all I can think about now. It's like an obsession.I am so ready to die, yet I can't bring myself to do it. I'm a coward, who can't even take the easy way out. Before you ask me if I've tried therapy or whatever check my post history. I've tried everything. Nothing fucking works. I'm going to die alone, because according to the people on /r/amiugly I look "like a frog alien hybrid from a horror movie". Nine upvotes on that comment. I am unlovable. I'm ending it the moment I can will myself to do it.
