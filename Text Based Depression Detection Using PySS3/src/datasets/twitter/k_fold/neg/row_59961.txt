I need some supportHey, everyone. Things have been really hard for me lately. I've sunk into the deep pit of depression and have been considering suicide these days (in a passive way). And now, I heard that my friend's friend killed herself and it has triggered serious suicidal feelings in me. I don't know what to do. Please advice.
