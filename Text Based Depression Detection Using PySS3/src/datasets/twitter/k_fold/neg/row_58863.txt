Depressed, broke, hated, friendless, unemployed, worthless.I found out today that someone actively prevented me from getting a job. Someone who knows Iâ€™ve been struggling for years and knows how poor I am. Why even go on? It was bad enough knowing that no one cared to lift a finger when I cried out for help. Now I have to live with the reality that people WILL lift a finger when it comes to holding me back.
