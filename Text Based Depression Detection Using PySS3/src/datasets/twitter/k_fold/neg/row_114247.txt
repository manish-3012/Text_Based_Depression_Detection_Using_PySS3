A Note to everyoneDear everyone with depression, 
I've never been suicidal and that is something that as a society everyone who hasn't been drowns out the people who are suffering. The ones going through hell like no one can possibly imagine are the people that society drowns out for some fucking reason. If you are reading this know I LOVE YOU. I'm just a 16 year old kid behind a screen but i TRULY LOVE YOU. I've got empathy and sympathy and both combined make me understand your pain and suffering. I cry when I read a note as simple as someone's depressed. I cry when someone tells me they cried last night. That is how my empathy works. I don't have to be in this sub, but I chose to because this is the most important subject matter to me. I'm in a suicide prevention club at my school because I CARE. no matter what you tell yourself you are here for a reason and you are the only you on the planet. If we lose you, we lose the only YOU on this planet. Every single person is worth everything. If you are depressed or suicidal please call me or text me at 7705650525, I swear I'm here for you. Don't hesitate to call the suicide prevention line 1-800-273-8255. You are loved by this entire community. In this community are people just like you or people who choose to be here. Remember people come here and comment because they LOVE YOU. It is an optional sub and yet this sub almost has 200k supporters. Remember you are loved and please call or text me or dm me if you need someone. I love you.â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
