When does it get betterHow long am I expected to wait?
Itâ€™s been 19 years already, how much longer am I supposed to wait?

My girlfriend killed herself about a year ago. My close friend overdosed over the phone with me and wouldâ€™ve died if I hadnâ€™t called an ambulance. I stopped taking my antidepressants, they werenâ€™t doing anything anyways. And today, one of my dogs died. 

So please tell me, when does it get better? Iâ€™m so tired of waiting. Iâ€™ve been crying all day. I feel so alone. I donâ€™t even have anybody to tell this to.
