itâ€™s overIâ€™ve been a failure my entire life. I procrastinate too much, I started getting into drugs, I have no motivation to do anything, and I just donâ€™t wanna wake up. I have everything going for me- Iâ€™m a freshman at an amazing college, Iâ€™m an only child and my parents give the world to me, and I am very smart and normally have great grades. However because I manage to find a way to disappoint everyone Iâ€™m close to failing out, I have tried killing myself on multiple occasions, all I do is smoke weed and drink when I get the chance, when I should be studying I play video games and just tell myself Iâ€™ll do better tomorrow. I used to be in great shape from running cross country and track but quarantine stopped that and I havenâ€™t been able to recover since. I donâ€™t know what my options are and Iâ€™m not ready to face the real world. I canâ€™t do this anymore.


Iâ€™m expecting this to go unnoticed but if you read this I hope you donâ€™t suffer the same fate as me. Adieu.
