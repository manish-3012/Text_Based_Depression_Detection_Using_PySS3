Went 6 years without a suicidal thought and now I'm back to thinking about it daily.I just... I'm so tired of being in so much pain. Of always feeling like my existence is wrong and I'm worth nothing and I'm stupid and I'm ugly and everyone has a family and friends that love and support them and I have absolutely no one... 

I became extremely independent and now I have a good job, my own apartment, pets, I pay all of my own bills, I'm almost out of debt.... But I still want to kill myself and it's getting scary because I've had bouts of depression in the past few years. But they never last long, I can pull myself out. But this time it's not working, and I'm so scared I'm gonna fall back into being suicidal all the time again until I really do it.
