Random ThoughtsAccept for a moment three statements. There is a God. He is all-good. He is all-powerful. 

Because He is all-good, He must punish sin. 

Because He is all-perfect, sins must be punished according to their severity. 

Because He is all-perfect, any sin, no matter how little, must be grievous to him. This is because even a little speck of dirt is incredibly ugly on a white sheet. The whiter the sheet, the uglier the dirt. So therefore, God must punish even the littlest sins with extreme prejudice. 

Because He is all-powerful, there is no limit to the punishments He can give. Therefore, little sins beget massive consequences. 

Because we do not see these punishments happening in this life, they must happen in the after-life. Therefore, the punishments must start after someone dies. 

Because God is all-powerful, He cannot die. He will forever be willing and able to punish wrongdoing. 

I am constantly sinning in both large and small ways. Therefore, when I die I will be punished extensively. 

Whenever I am punished in this life, my response is not always perfect. There is no reason to believe death changes our character. Therefore, when God punishes me after my death, I will respond with more sin. This will start an eternal cycle. 

Life is not perfect. Therefore the joys of life are mixed with the pain of life. 

Because He is all-good, God will not allow a sinner any joy. Therefore the pain of the afterlife is not mixed with any joy. 

Life is not eternal. The joys and pains of life are finite. 

Because of all these facts, I have two choices. 

1. I can stay alive and experience finite joy and finite pain. At the same time I would be accruing more and more eternal pain. 
2. I can kill myself and start the punishment. 

If you think about it, the logical thing to do is kill myself. The finite joy that this life contains is not worth the infinite pain that this life causes.
