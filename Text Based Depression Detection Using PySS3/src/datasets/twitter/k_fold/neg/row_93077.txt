Do people want to help or not? Why all they say is â€œDonâ€™t do it.â€Every time I ask my mates or someone on the internet about my suicidal thoughts, they only say â€œdonâ€™t do it.â€. Iâ€™ve started to think that they are not really helping me. They just donâ€™t want me to die because they are selfish.
