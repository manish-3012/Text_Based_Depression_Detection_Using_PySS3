I don't deserve this lifeTo put it as frankly as I can I don't deserve this life. I've made choices in the past which could literally rear up and swallow me into a very public downfall at any time. And my family deserves better. I'm not the same person I was when I did those things... But I still did them. I'm a monster who should have been locked away. Deranged and sick. Dead, the problems go away, the fear and guilt goes away, my family deals with the public backlash of a suicide but not the shame and embarrassment of my inevitable fall.
