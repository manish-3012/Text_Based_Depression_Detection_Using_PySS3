I'm so lost.. (part 2)It's begun. She's starting to not reply to my messages. I spent an hour rocking back and forth in my bathroom crying to myself. Why am I so needy and clingy? I'm ready to drink the bleach beside me. It seems to be the only one that understands and knows how to end my pain. I'm sorry Casey...
