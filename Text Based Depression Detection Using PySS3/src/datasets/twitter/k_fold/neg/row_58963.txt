It's just my fault, no one else'sI've been telling myself that over and over for a solid 2 days while thinking of how i'm gonna do it and it's scaring me how calmly at peace i am with just making sure that the people close to me know that and then just fading out without a look back, i know they'll suffer anyway and i know they could help with much more than understanding that but i honestly just want to die and the most i want out of people is for them to not blame themselves for doing nothing wrong.
