I'm gonna kill myself but I'm not gonna tell anyone this time because that doesn't help either. I've had enough almosts and still feel the same so this time I'll just do it.No note, no goodbyes, no giving my stuff or money away, I'll just do it. I can't have anyone stop me. I've been to inpatient twice and it was horrible both times. I came out feeling significantly worse than when I went in.



So yeah. I'm just gonna do it this time. I have a date and method picked out and I'm not gonna say anything. It'll be one of those suicides where everyone acts so shocked like they had no idea it was coming but they really just never cared to listen or help.



So I'll say goodbye anonymously here when the time comes but not to anyone I actually know.
