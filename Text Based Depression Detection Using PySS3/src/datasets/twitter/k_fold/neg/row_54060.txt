I went to a movie just so I could cry and not be alone. I feel really alone and hopeless.I went to Frozen II just so I could not be alone and bawl my eyes out. I'm in therapy and I'm doing all the right things and I just still feel empty and rejected by everyone, acceptance by no one. I'm trying to give that love and acceptance to myself but it gets really overwhelming. I'm very sad and hopeless. Looking at the trauma I still have to work through. Looking at the empty life I keep trying to meaningfully fill. I just want to feel loved and accepted. I got a really awesome promotion at my last job then my new boss started sexually harassing me. I was so proud that I got promoted for my merit but that person chose me for that. I just want to feel worthwhile for my own sake. I want that more than anything. People who say they care don't really and I don't know how much longer I can do this.
