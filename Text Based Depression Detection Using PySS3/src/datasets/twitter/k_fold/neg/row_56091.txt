It feels like the right thing to do. Not escape from painAll day and night the thought of killing myself just makes me feel like its the right thing to do. It doesn't feel like I'm going to escape pain it just feel like its what I'm suppost to do. That everyone will be happier after the initial impact of it. I know people will sad at first but I honestly feel in long run everyone will be better from that it will bring my family closer to each other and do the same for my friends. I just feel that I have over lived my time in this life. That nothing going to improve for me in this life. I'm say that I will come back in other life or anything like that cause truly I don't know what going to happen I just know that I need to end it now so everyone can be happier and learn from and reevaluate how they choose they lives and bring them closer to each other. What I want the most is to be forgotten I honeslty don't want any funeral or any kind of ceremony I just want to be forgotten I don't want anyone to claim my body I want to be cremated and just forgotten I don't want anyone to hold on to my ashes I just want to be dump some where and forgot that I ever existed. don't know if we die and over or we get other life in a different body or we become ghost, angels and demons I just want to be forgotten from everyone mind is the true thing I want
