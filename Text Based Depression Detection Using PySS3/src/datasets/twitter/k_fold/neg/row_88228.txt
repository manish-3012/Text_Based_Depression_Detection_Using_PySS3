...I'm sure you know that sensation of overthrowing melancholy that just pierces your chest every waking hour. 

It's almost that you only realize time moves, once you've done absolutely a single thing each and everyday.

You sit staring at the wall for amusement, 
to be trapped by the same hand of capture yet hostage...Its truly embarrassing how much a loser I am...

I wish I could feel complete emptiness, 
where thought is nothing but a useless part of a temporary life.

I wish all you guys find a better life than me...
