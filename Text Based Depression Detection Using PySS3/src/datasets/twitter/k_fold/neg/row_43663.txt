Suicide is looking nicer and nicer every day...My entire world is crashing around me. Two of my family members died within in the last two months, my grades are failing. Everyone at home and at school hates my guts. All I can say is that Iâ€™m fucking done. Iâ€™ve lost all will and energy to continue trying to live... Iâ€™ve tried counselors, my parents, hotlines, therapists, everything! This is my last resort...
