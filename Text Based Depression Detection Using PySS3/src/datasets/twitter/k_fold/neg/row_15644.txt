I can't believe I did that.I don't have the energy to type everything that is bothering me after mentally writing "I will not delete irreplaceable memories of my dead best friend" on a figurative chalkboard 1,000 times.

I don't have the time for it either. I have to be awake and at work in about 6 hours and I'm already running on about 5 hours of sleep.

I'm really fucking sad and I don't have any friends anymore and now I can't even look at the old videos I had of my best friend. The photos, the audio recordings, my drunken rants and his calm advice following peacefully.

I haven't had him for almost 4 years now, and now I will never hear his voice in any facet ever again because I am a fucking moron. Leave it to me to remember to back up my porn but not do the same for the person I loved the most.

When he died I was the driver and I watched him burn alive and explode in my shitty 1995 Hyundai Accent because I couldn't save him, but I got out (I mean, I tried my best to save him too, I did not succeed).

And I fucking lost everything that included him, other than faint and fading memories because I drink to cope with the loss.



This is hardly even me getting started. This is just what's "got my goat" today. Every day is a humongous struggle and sometimes all you need is a catalyst to flip the script and end the play in pieces.
