Just a postI am not diagnosed with depression. However sometimes, I feel so down, like if I swallow I want to cry. I don't want to get out of bed, go to work, school or socialize with anyone. I manage it though, I find that if I exercise or watch a Disney movie I can get out it. 

Lately though, it is so much worse. I feel like it has a lot to do with my current education and financial situation. My government aid for education is on hold. I have been withdrawn from courses at my university because I owe money from last semester. I don't have enough to cover the cost. I work part time and I am so desperate to cover the cost of my education that I am looking at taking out loans of high interest or turning to prostitution. 

I have no family support for money and only rely on myself, growing up in care. Sometimes I feel like life is hopeless, I worked so hard to get to a point where I can complete a degree and get a decent job but its all for nothing. I'm stuck 2 years into a 4 year program, working minimum wage, owing so much already, needing more money for education and wondering if its worth it. 

I keep away from public transit for now, I feel like I have this urge to jump in front of a train and just end it. It would be so easy, no more worrying about my education, getting a good job, paying for bills and relying on government assistance or loans. 

I don't know anymore, I feel like life is so hard and I am just not cut out for it. I'm scared for my life and where I will end up. I just don't know anymore.
