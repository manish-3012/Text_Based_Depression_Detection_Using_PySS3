It is Christmas and I am aloneChristmas Day is here and I am all alone. I tried to cultivate some holiday spirit, but now that the sun is leaving the sky I am feeling horrible. I have no family to speak of, my wife left me, and I lost a job 7 months ago.

My savings will carry me a few more months and then I will be on the streets. I have applied to over 400 jobs and had a few interviews, but nothing has clicked. My wages from Lyft aren't making ends meet and I am ready to quit.

And tonight as I think about suicide I wonder who are the selfish ones. The people who kill themselves or the people who selfishly ask someone to continue a life that is intolerable just to keep them from a painful introspection about mortality. I am definitely moving closer to mking the decision to die at my own hands.
