I thought I beat this shit and could be happy finally. I thought I wouldnt have to come to this place ever again. Fuck this and fuck that.My dog, my friend of years died a few hours ago. My parents took care of the body and everything and now i'm just left with my thoughts. I want to end this right now so badly.

If you guys dont remember me, a while back I beat my depression and became happy. so fucking happy it was unbelievable. until about 4-5 hours ago i was extremely happy, confident, had everything working out for me.

Now im sitting here with a knife wondering how to kill myself with it with the least pain and typing out this shit as my last fucking desperate cry for help and attention like I always do.


I remember the way my mom called the vet to tell them what happened, " Rocko expired..." expired? Is he fucking milk? I've heard this so many god damn times but it never hit me, we are all just waste. Me, my dog, my milk, we all go bad after awhile. so why the fuck should i stay around?

I feel like my world is falling apart, my confidence riipped away, my happiness shredded into despair

I just want to scream, and die.

I wonder when my expiration date is? what would mine say?
