Thoughts on suicideFirst, I'm okay now but I was having a shitty day Monday. I was trying to explain to my spouse my "suicidal" thoughts. And I hate that term. It sounds so dramatic. And whenever I'm feeling "suicidal" I feel ridiculous saying that. Because I don't want it to be dramatic. Hell I wouldn't even want anyone to notice. Funerals just equal people you don't like and our loved ones being hurt. I don't want either of those things. It's like I just want to evaporate into thin air and be erased from history. No hurt, or pain, or attention. Just gone.
