Hello, I need help, soonHello,
So obviously if im writing here you must know what that means. Tomorrow afternoon I plan to die, i guess this is a cry for a last reason to stay. I guess i should introduce myself, Im Spencer, im 16 and live in a upper class house, go to a catholic school and have a girlfriend. Im an introvert who likes to program and make things. 2017 got bad for me near the end, I have to attend court in the next few days for a speeding ticket, I got accused of cheating and face losing my 3.5 gpa, my dad yells at me constantly and believes im a nobody, and I may have accidentally got my girlfriend pregnant. The last news was brought to me today by my girlfriend saying her period is 8 days late, its not confirmed but im pretty sure she is. She claims shes not and that i never once came in her, nor could it have been possible with the morning after pill. My life is going downhill real fast and im afraid ill never see her again, and my hopes of getting into a tech college will fumble. I wrote a suicide note, addressing about everyone i care about or whatever was on my mind. I promised my girlfriend id stay alive for her but I think that promise will be broken very soon. Please help, im begging you.
