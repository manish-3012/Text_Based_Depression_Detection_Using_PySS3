I need help..So, I deleted my throwaway account (beautifullydead) thinking I'd just end everything. Then my grandparents find my letters saying goodbye to people, so now they're pretty much babysitting me. I need out of this life so bad. I have a final due tomorrow and I was 70% of the way done and my laptop decided to restart and I lost all of it. I think that was just the icing on the cake. I literally mess everything up. Maybe I do belong locked away in a mental hospital like everyone says, but I hate it there. I need to escape so bad. All I know is I'm going to get so high tonight and do whatever I can to end everything. 

**Addition**

I can't stop crying, I have no idea what's wrong with me right now. Everything is just so chaotic in my head. I know its bad when the voice that usually punishes me is yelling at me to stop. I'm just so tired of being a crazy wreck. That's all I am. I'm a giant mess. I hate everything about my life. The only thing I will regret is leaving my family behind they don';t deserve to put up wtih me any longer I'm just so done. I'm beyond done. I can't take it naymore.

sorry for any mistakes I really don't care right now.
