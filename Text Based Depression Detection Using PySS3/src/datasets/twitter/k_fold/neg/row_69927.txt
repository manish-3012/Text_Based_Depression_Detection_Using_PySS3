I have seen it.When I started working, I wanted to be the best I could be. I was motivated and very disciplined. My mind operated at 100% capacity, I was in the moment, focused and very satisfied with my performance. Witty, teamplayer, educated. Throughout my life there have been moments where I have seen who I can be and it pains me to see that all it takes is hope or - best case scenario is = someone to have a relationship with.  


I don't want anyone to help or to guide me. I know what the fuck I should do and how to do it, it's ironic that in order to be the best version of myself, it takes someone else.  


I've learned to put myself into other people's shoes, I make very good decisions. I just feel like shit all the time. And no one cares. People don't ask my opinion, they don't make eye contact, they don't know what to say and I'm standing here hoping for a miracle, getting suicidal and have accepted that either this ordeal will make me very successful or it'll kill me; there's no in-between.
