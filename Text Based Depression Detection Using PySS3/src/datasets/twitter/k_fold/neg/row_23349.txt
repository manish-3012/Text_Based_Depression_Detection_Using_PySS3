It's almost new year at my family's house and everything is so awful, I never though it would actually get to this pointIt's becoming unbearable. I mean, being with my family has always been hard for me. We have never really understood each other. I've tried talking with them but they do not listen and all they do is nag. The worst part is that they're actually think they're helping me when they're actually making it worse. I've said this to them. They said I was lying, that I didnÂ´t get it. I feel like they're blaming me and shaming me about feeling down. Like I'm not allowed to feel like this. It all just feels so violent and I feel like I can't even cry. I'm nearing my limit and I don't know what to do. I don't know who to talk to because it feels wrong to feel this way about my own family but I just can't stand them anymore. It feels like falling down a fucking spiral. More and more anxiety piling up. Can't even look them in the eyes at this point. I feel so much pain. I just need some help. I just need some help. A little rest. Oh my god, and they yell so much, they like to yell so much. Please help.
