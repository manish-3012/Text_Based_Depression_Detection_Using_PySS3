I can't handle itI don't know what to do any more. I feel so alone and worthless. I've had the worst few months of my life but I've pushed it all aside for my boyfriend who has depression issues. Every thing just came to a head today and I asked him to be there for me one day and he can't do it. All I need is someone to talk to and he just tells me that I'm overreacting and not taking his feelings into account. He is the one thing I feel like I can count on and now it feels as though he couldn't give a shit less. It's so devastating and heartbreaking. I feel like the weight of the world is collapsing on my chest and I have no one there to help me. I've had 2 panic attacks today and I'm so tired emotionally. I feel like there's only one way out
