Strength?Quick backstory for context. 

TLDR I don't know what I'm feeling. I never really cared. I would like some input.

Foster care at 3

Separated from older brother at 7 when biological dad got me out with my sister. (Not their child)

Unfit parent (Drunk, Abusive, We we're not properly fed even though we had government assistance )

Hurricane Katrina on my 8th birthday

Parent tells me they wish they left us in foster care after one of the Oh-I-Might-Actually-Die beatings

Back in foster care around 16-17 (Adopted)

met my biological mother in critical condition about 2 years ago around this time. (I'm 23 now)

She passed, I still don't know how to feel so I dont even think about it. 

Thankful I got to met her and I leave it at that. 

Ah, that must be why. Guess i need to breakdown or some shit, but I cant fold or its over. and I know that. 

It's her birthday week. I don't remember the exact day, I want to say the 23rd or the 27th.

Throwaway account because I don't usually say what I'm feeling. 

I can't talk to therapists, I'm unable to trust them/I can't give anyone that much power to judge me.

But i'm basing all that off of my childhood therapists, I'm sure there are great ones. I just actually can't.

Wow. Thoughts on paper look ugly as hell. 

There's no point to this?
