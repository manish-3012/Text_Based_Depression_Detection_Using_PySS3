I think Iâ€™m doneI think Iâ€™m just done. Iâ€™m in my 20s and I donâ€™t plan on living past 30. Iâ€™m just tired. I donâ€™t know when or how, but I really think Iâ€™ll end up making a plan and following through. I donâ€™t know why I was born, but I feel like it was a mistake. So Iâ€™m going to correct it.
