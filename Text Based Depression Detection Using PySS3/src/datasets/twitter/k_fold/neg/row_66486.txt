Fuck itWhy do I always feel this way? Why is it back. What the literal fuck. I spent so long fighting these feelings away. But now Iâ€™d rather die than keep breathing. Again. Itâ€™s back. And itâ€™s fucked up. Maybe I did this to myself. Maybe itâ€™s because I made poor choices. Iâ€™m pathetic. I canâ€™t even fuck up properly. My life was never exciting, never cool, never fun. It was just a few highlights with a lot of dark, blank space in between. Anything I love is bound to break. The world is a fucked up place. Why do I want to keep working so hard just to have experiences Iâ€™ve already had? Iâ€™ve traveled a bit, had good food, read books. I donâ€™t see a point in consistent improvement for more of the same bullshit. I canâ€™t even get high anymore and enjoy that. What a fucking pathetic life.
