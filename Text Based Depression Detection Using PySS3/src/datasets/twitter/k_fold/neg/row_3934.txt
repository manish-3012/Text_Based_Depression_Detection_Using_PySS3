nobody wants to have to kill themselvesi've been through so much shit that most people wouldn't even believe it.  
i myself sometimes cannot believe it, because it's truly, without exaggeration, unbelievable.  
i'm not some 17 year old who's going through some relatively hard times. i'm in my thirties. and going through extremely extremely hard times for someone who lives in a 1st world country.  
i'm not gonna go into detail because it's too personal, but let me give some, how do you say, short versions or hints:  
1. no family left  
2. a very serious neurological disease that makes me unable to work or have a carreer  
3. departed forever from the love of my life  
4. few friends, they all moved away, i have one left nearby... my least favorite one! haha  
5. physically disabled also, etc

i lost my christian faith, i can't believe there is a god anymore after all those prayers, and ain't shit changed whatsoever. and the few good things that changed, those things actually occured when i started seeking away from the bible, in regards to my actions and choices
