I don't know if this is the right place. I just need to get this down.I should be happy. I live in a good home with a loving mother and I have a caring girlfriend and a good circle of friends with whom I'm very close. There's really nothing wrong in my life. There's no reason for me to be unhappy, but I am. I wake up most days and wish I had the courage to end it, but I don't, and I hate myself for not being able to. I never feel good when I'm with people, and then I feel bad for wanting to be alone. I just feel empty and I want to be done with everything. I don't know what to do.
