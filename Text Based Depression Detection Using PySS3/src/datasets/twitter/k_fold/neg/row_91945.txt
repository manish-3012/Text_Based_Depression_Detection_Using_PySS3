Why do I keep getting these sudden urges to kill myself?Every time Iâ€™m out or alone I just have the overwhelming urge to kill myself any way I possibly can. I usually donâ€™t try to, but the anxiety and suicidal thoughts just really push me to the edge sometimes. Most of the time I go out I usually bring my dog (only to places dogs are allowed obviously) since I know that if I kill myself while Iâ€™m out then heâ€™ll be sad and alone. I canâ€™t even go out to do everyday tasks like going to the store or going to school without those feelings coming like a punch in the gut. I canâ€™t breath. I canâ€™t focus. The only thing I can think about is all the ways I can die ASAP. Since I have nothing with me I can use as an excuse not to. All of this has caused my stress levels to get so high that I practically burst into tears when I missed the bus today. Something so small caused me to cry for 20 minutes in the councilorâ€™s office while she tried to figure out why I was so upset. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can go on like this being unable to stop these intrusive thoughts 24/7. Broke my 1 year clean streak from cutting which was a huge disappointment. No one knows I cut though so it was just a personal loss. My antidepressants and anti anxiety medications arenâ€™t cutting it and my clinic keeps pushing back and canceling my appointments. Nothing I can do about it since Iâ€™m 17. These have been going on for many many years so Iâ€™m surprised I made it this long, but I just donâ€™t know how to stop this. Iâ€™ve never been this open with anyone other than my doctor so I guess thatâ€™s a good step. I could NEVER trust my family with this sort of information though since all they do is belittle me and ignore my existence anyways and this would only fuel that since I was my momâ€™s last kid before my dad left (he didnâ€™t want parental responsibility over two kids so I just tried to take my brother and failed)... I donâ€™t even feel like Iâ€™m actually living though. I just feel like Iâ€™m watching someone live on some sort of auto pilot while Iâ€™m in a purgatory. I even lose track of the days since they all just seem to merge together into a big grey blob of time. Completely forgot new years was even close until a bud of mine brought it up a week before it happened. I think Iâ€™m getting too off topic and rambling so Iâ€™ll stop here. I donâ€™t even know how I got to this point.
