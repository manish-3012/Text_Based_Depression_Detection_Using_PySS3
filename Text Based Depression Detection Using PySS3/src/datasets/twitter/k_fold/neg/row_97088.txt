I was just fired from a job I spent some money relocating toI've had a rough 2018 so far. I totaled my car in an accident, got fired from a promising job for being a bad fit, and i'm in a city I don't know, with dwindling savings. I moved up here for this position and was welcoming a change. I've been in a bad state of mind mentally to start with, but this is my breaking point.

I have no friends here. I know nothing that keeps me in place. I don't even have a car (and with no income, no way to finance one). I have no courage to call a help line fearing they'll get the local authority involved.

I don't know what to do, besides finish off this beer and jam a knife through my windpipe. I feel so alone, and helpless. God is punishing me for something, and I don't even think he's real.

Can anyone help?
