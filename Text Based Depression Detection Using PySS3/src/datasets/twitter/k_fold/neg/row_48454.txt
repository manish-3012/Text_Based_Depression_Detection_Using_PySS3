I think I'm gonna do itI've tried but nothing in this life makes me happy. I thought having a good job and having my own place would make me happy but always having to deal with my toxic ass gf everything was just worse and I hated my job. So I quit my job like a fucking idiot and now I'm gonna get evicted soon cuz I cant find work and tomorrow I have to give my phone back to at&amp;t cuz I cant pay my bill. All the while the girl who I was dating is still my roommate and still toxic as fuck and makes me feel like I'm under so much pressure not only to support me but also to support her. I really try to be kind to people and do people I care about favors but for some reason all I ever feel is selfish. Non of this would've happened if I would've just kept my job. I'm tired of the pressure and I wanna die but idk how I'm gonna do it yet.
