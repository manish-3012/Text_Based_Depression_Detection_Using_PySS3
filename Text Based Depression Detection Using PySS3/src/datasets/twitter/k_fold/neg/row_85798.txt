I cant do this, tw: abuseWhat are you supposed to do when someone who loves you hits you. Calls you names. I don't even have the right words. I'm struggling to type this because I now have a broken hand. Bruises. A cut lip. I'm fuckin tired, in every way possible. Have no friends, literally. Okay, I have one who is states away and is getting tired of listening to me rightfully so. Have my parents but they do the say God damn fucking thing. They know I'm on THE EDGE. But it doesn't matter. I'd hate me too. The only living thing that doesn't hate me is my dog. I'm embarrassed ashamed. Tired. So. Tired. I fell into my dresser Im not getting hit and pushed, Idk what youre talking about. That's my story everytime. My legs are covered in scars. Cuts. I want to drink myself to death and just go to sleep, forever. I don't believe in the afterlife but fuck I day dream of just going into... Nothing. I want my old husband back. The one I knew. Not this person he's become. I want my life back. I don't know where in going with this so I'm just gonna stop here as all I do is push my issues on people. Fuck life. And fuck this pain.
