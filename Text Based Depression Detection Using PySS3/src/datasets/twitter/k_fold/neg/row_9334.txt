Mental DisorderI never used to be as sad as I am. Hell, when I was a kid I was happy as shit. Now I teeter from extremely depressed to just okay. Sometimes it gets so bad and last so long. I just don't want to deal with it. I have told my family about it and it just ends up with medication. Medication[paxil] that fucks with my sexual functions. Seriously, nothing should mess with that, it is top priority in stress relief and when you take that away it just makes my depression worse. When I told my dad about that he laughed. For the month that I took it it didn't help much at all. So I tried the next thing and started working out with my dad. Nothing.    
I don't know if my depression was triggered by hormonal changes in my body during adolescence or the concussion that I got approximately 5 months before I started to become depressed. (hit my forehead on pavement going ~12-15 mph no medical attention, felt fine) Honestly didn't think about that incident until recently. 
 I have a single job (cashier), part time only 2 days a week and that is a huge stress on me. I just feel so incapable of dealing with working.    
Since this depression started I never felt like I could "make it". Like one day I will just off myself in the future when it reaches that point of not being able to deal with the stress( a full-time job, not being able to make enough money for living, etc) I am constantly being stressed about getting kicked out too, and I know where I would go if I was.
