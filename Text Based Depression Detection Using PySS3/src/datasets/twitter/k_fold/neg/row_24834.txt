Please lighten my moodI recovered from a nervous breakdown years ago where I meticulously planned on hanging myself (and as a medic, knew the response times for ems and the coroner so no one I loved would see me) I've been doing well for years and have "the call of the void" moments but shrug them off. I have a kid now and love my little one to pieces so didn't think much of when my depression started creeping back but the longer I push the suicidal thoughts back the more I find myself bartering about how even though I have a kid and thought I could never possibly leave them that "well she's got lots of family. My husband is a good dad. She would do fine without me." And these thoughts are really starting to freak me out. I've gone from never considering suicide again to actually contemplating it. All I really need to get me through today is to hear something uplifting or funny. I just need something to smile about today because I can't seem to make that happen on my own right now
