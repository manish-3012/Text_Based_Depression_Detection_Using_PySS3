3 more days.I got better, and I was feeling better. **But** it all comes crashing down, and i'm 10000% sure, that it's not going to go up in a long time.

I'm killing myself the second I get out of the hospital, and this time I'll make sure I succeed. I don't know how. But, I'll ensure that I succeed.
