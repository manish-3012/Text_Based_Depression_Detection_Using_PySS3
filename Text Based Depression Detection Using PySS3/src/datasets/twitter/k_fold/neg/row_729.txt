Don't/Haven't left house. Alone. PC is Shit.. Don't know how much longer I can go. Losing my mind. I've been really riddled with anxiety/depression/agoraphobia since I was  a freshman in high school, I am now 24 (25 in july) I've only left my  house 20\~ times in 5+ years. All I do is sit in my room alone for 16+  hours a day. Eat my one meal I get per day. And play on the computer,  alone. My computer is straight dogshit and even that is starting to  drive me insane. I feel myself literally losing my mind. I don't want  help anymore. I've grown too comfortable in my misery. I'm trapped.
