some piece of advice would be really nice!:)Hey, guys.   
Id really appreciate some help and advice.  
Ive been through some shit in my life like domestic abuse, several acts of sexual assaults from teachers and on top of that other problems implied by the fact that im gay in a homophobic country. But the thing is that I don't cling on that anymore and have almost moved on from these things. It is my senior year in the university and even the near future is quite promising. The problem is that I don't have any will to carry on even if the rest of my life will be bright and happy. I just don't want to exist anymore (not in a sad way, more like in "I don't care" way). Ive been prescribed by so many different drugs for the last several years by different doctors and it was a nightmare. Some combinations gave me total insomnia, others intensified my suicidal ideation and so on with 3 different doctors and 5 years, I just fucking tired. My previous attempts were more of the suffering escape, but now im just giving up on life.   
What can I do?
