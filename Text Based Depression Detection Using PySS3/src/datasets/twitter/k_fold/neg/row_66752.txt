I don't know why I'm like thisI use suicide as a coping skill.
Many times the only thing that gets me through my day is the thought that once I get home I will be able to kill myself. I just find life unbearable and confusing. I'm in my late 20s now with a kid and a fiancee and I just can't find satisfaction or contentment any more. Also I'm a drug addict and many other types of addict. I know that I cannot actually commit suicide but my fear is one day I'll be in a position of weakness and will make a bad choice.

I wasn't looking for suicide watch, but rather I stumbled upon it. Im not sure if this meets tye criteria for posting but I just wanted to get that out there.

Thank you
