Hell is empty and all the devils are hereLife is hell. The devils are all around me. 

I love my family and theyâ€™re the only thing keeping me here. But I am suffering. I think I always will. Nights like this I just want to let go. The pain is unbearable. I canâ€™t say it any other way but that. I hurt. Iâ€™ve always hurt. Iâ€™m tired of hurting. 

Life is ugly and people are cruel, itâ€™s really that simple. 

Everyday I get out of bed and go to work. I fucking try so hard to participate in society but I feel like itâ€™s pointless. 

For most of life, the dream of finding someone to love who understood and accepted my pain was keeping me alive. I found him and we spent two magical years together but it turns out he didnâ€™t love me. And my deeper fear came true: that the person I loved most in this world would disappear. He left me and found someone else. I canâ€™t get over the betrayal. 

Thoughts of suicide have been constant. I canâ€™t even get help because Iâ€™m uninsured. And Iâ€™ve spent years navigating this broken mental health system. Pills donâ€™t work, therapy has failed me, honestly taking mushrooms was what saved my life. It helped me see things from a different perspective. I think they wore off, because Iâ€™m starting to feel trapped in the old thought patterns again. Oh, it doesnâ€™t help that my ex was a fucking therapist. Him and all his co-workers were some of the coldest, most selfish people Iâ€™ve met. 

I have completely lost faith in humanity. If it werenâ€™t for my mom and little brother whom I adore, I would have jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge like I almost did back in July. 

I wish I could express myself more eloquently but Iâ€™m tired. Of everything. 

If I have to die, then maybe thatâ€™s how I choose to live. 

I donâ€™t believe that god would punish me more by sending me to hell. Iâ€™m already in it. 

I donâ€™t really care what happens to me, because I know deep down that anything is better than this.
