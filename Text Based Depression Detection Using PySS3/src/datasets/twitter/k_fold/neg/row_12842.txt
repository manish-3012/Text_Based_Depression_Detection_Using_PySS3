Sick of everythingWhat's the point of living if you can't even connect with your own family, you can't watch movies, you can't enjoy food, you can't socialise properly and feel so uncomfortable that you'd rather die than be in social situations.

Yeah it will hurt some people if I am gone but let's be honest they will forget me shortly after anyway so what's the big deal.
