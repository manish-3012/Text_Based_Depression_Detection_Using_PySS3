How do you know if your getting better?Like there are times when I really want to die but there also times where I feel pretty good. And I Cant really remember if it's always been like this or I've got better. I want to try and quantify this and work out if I'm making progress or not. Like I feel like I'm close to something better at the moment but yesterday evening I just wanted to die more than anything.

I want to work out if my spirals are more often or less often and if they are more intense or less intense.

I can kind of see where I want to be now and what I want to be and I have no idea ifs it's always been like that or not.

It's weird how little I remember from the last two years or so and how I can hardly place dates or times or anything like that.
