I decided a dayI donâ€™t think I can live with myself anymore. Itâ€™s too much for me and I donâ€™t deserve life. I hate myself and it wonâ€™t go away so I think this is my goodbye. 
Iâ€™ve lurked on this sub and the depression one for ages on my other account, and itâ€™s always been comforting to me to know that there are other people who are in similar pain and that Iâ€™m not alone, although I wouldnâ€™t wish this on anybody. I know my pain will not go, but I hope for all of you who are suffering, your life will get better and you will live a fulfilling life full of happiness.
I hope you all make it!! I believe in you :)))
