Suicide Hotline doesn't help me with my depression.Everytime I call the suicide hotline they don't help. they just repeat everything you say to them .they don't  have a  clue .what you are going  through .and they don't know how to help you. They put you on hold just to answer the other line get to the other and never get back to you .for all they care you could kill yourself and they won't give a shit. Every time my voices just tell me to hang up on them. Sometimes when I finish talking to them. When they don't put me on hold feel worse.
