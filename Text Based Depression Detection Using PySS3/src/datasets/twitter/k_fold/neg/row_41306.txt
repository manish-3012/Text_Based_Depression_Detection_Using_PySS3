I'm exhausted, depressed and hopelessI lost the woman of my dreams.  We had plans that were once in a life time.  They are shattered.  I'm 28 and she's the only woman ive ever let in enough to know about being raped at the age of 19.

She thought I was continuously disconnected from her which I was, but not by choice.  I didn't want to be.  I didn't know how to handle her emotions while fighting my demons.  I couldn't.

It's over, and I cannot go on.

I haven't eaten in a week, I have one bottle of water a day that I drink throughout the day to keep my mouth from drying up.

I feel my body shutting down on me, my brains going crazy and I cannot block out the thought of just ending it all.  When it goes away it comes back a few hours later.

The support group I have is my family and they don't understand...

If I can't connect with someone I truly loved, how can I?
