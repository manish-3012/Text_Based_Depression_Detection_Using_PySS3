And endless cycleI tried to kill myself a few dayâ€™s ago and Iâ€™m sad I failed. The day after I was out of it and somewhat happy that I didnâ€™t die, however now I feel the opposite. Iâ€™m trying to hard to help myself but I feel like this illness is potentially terminal, and I wish more people saw it that way. Iâ€™m already thinking of ways on attending again and Iâ€™m scared about what lies ahead.
