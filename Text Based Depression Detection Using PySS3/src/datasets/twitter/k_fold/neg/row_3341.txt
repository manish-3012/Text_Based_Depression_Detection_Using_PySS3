How do I handle a cheater?Being engaged to the person you thought you loved would be nice.
But why did he cheat on me? Why did he give me an STD? How can I live with myself knowing the person who says he loves me the most cheated on me??
Iâ€™ve been so perfect and kind, I was supposed to move states away to get a new job and stayed because he begged me.
Now Iâ€™m in his room, miserable and so tired.
I didnâ€™t take medication so he could feel like I was my real self. I donâ€™t know how to cope.
I hope me baby sisters never have to deal with this. I donâ€™t even want them to know I died.
I wish I had hope, I wish I had friends still. I wish I was more selfish. I wish I had the balls to leave a cheater.
