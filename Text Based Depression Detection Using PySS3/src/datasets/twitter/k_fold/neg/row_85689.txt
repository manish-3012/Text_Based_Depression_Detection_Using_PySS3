I don't know what's wrong with meSo, here's some background. I started feeling suicidal in fifth grade because of a huge amount of stress from school (it was kind of a combination of academic and social issues). I told my parents on multiple occasions that I wanted to kill myself. All that did was make them mad. So, I decided to just bottle up all of my feelings. At the beginning of sixth grade I was diagnosed with asperger's, but basically only my parents believe I actually have it. Throughout middle school I only got more stressed out, but I wasn't crying every night anymore. It's as if I had become numb. I still thought about suicide, but it was the same as before. I never really thought about how I would actually do it and I never self-harmed (luckily I still haven't). Now I'm at the end of my freshman year of high school. This year has been a lot better than middle school and I've been mostly alright. That is, up until now. Seemingly out of the blue, I've just been hit with a wave of depression. I feel like I'm drowning. Lately I've been having a lot of anxiety of the future and I'm just so scared of the unknown. I keep on wanting to change but I'm not willing to take action. My dad thinks I hate him even though I really don't. I'm tired of staying up all night doing homework. My thoughts of suicide have been getting a lot worse, to the point where I'm actually trying to figure out how I should kill myself. I've almost made it a goal to die before I graduate high school, depending on what happens within these next few years. The other day I went on a trip to San Francisco, and literally the only thing I could think of as I started to see the Golden Gate Bridge was how much I wanted to jump off of it. I know I need help but I'm so scared of what will happen if I tell anyone how I'm feeling. I hate getting surprised or negative reactions out of people and I just don't want to cause anyone else to have to worry about me. I just don't know what to do.
