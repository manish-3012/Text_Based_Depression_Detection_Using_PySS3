Should I tell the truth?Long story but to make it short I'll start off by saying my life is shit. I've tried to kill myself in the past before but it didn't work. Everyday of my life now I feel like I'm actually in hell I have no one to talk too, But recently I've gotten a new job and met this women (a co-worker) and we started talking I've told her a few things about myself my past and she has told me a bit about her self at times we would have 7 hour long conversations about how we feel etc. But one day we had this talk about suicide cause I happened to mention it at work from a random rShowerThoughts post and she said it's a cowardly thing to do and there's something wrong with your brain to think that to begin with. Since then I haven't said a word to her. I don't know if I should tell the truth because if I do it's the last thing I'm hiding that's keeping me from another breakdown because I can't talk about it without losing it. I don't know if I should tell her how I truly feel because my whole life I've always felt alone and I still do but when I talk to her it makes me feel somewhat better. So should I tell the truth? Or just hide it keep and it professional and not say a thing.
