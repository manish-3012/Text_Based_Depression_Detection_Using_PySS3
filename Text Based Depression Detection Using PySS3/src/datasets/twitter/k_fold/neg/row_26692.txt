Iâ€™m done...Iâ€™ve posted earlier, but itâ€™s just not worth it. Iâ€™m 10 and Iâ€™m been trying to kill myself, but I just canâ€™t, I keep thinking Iâ€™m a loser or that Iâ€™m weak, but I just donâ€™t know. I think Iâ€™m doing something wrong, all my â€œfriendsâ€ say â€œsuicide is selfishâ€, â€œyouâ€™re such a selfish ugly bitchâ€, and â€œI fucking hate you so muchâ€. I even fake smile and laugh every day... I froze my arm with an ice cube, then I cut/scratched my arm with a FUCKING rock yesterday. I donâ€™t know anymore, I just want help.... please....
