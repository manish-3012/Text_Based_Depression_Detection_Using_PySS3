16 Years Wasted - I Canâ€™t Fucking Do This AnymoreThe past month Iâ€™ve done nothing but cry, as I realized Iâ€™m fucking worthless. I can end my life right now and everyone that knows me would celebrate. I canâ€™t do anything right, I make everyone around me miserable, I am an anchor that drags everyone down with them. Iâ€™m 16 - in the supposed greatest years of my life but I have no fucking friends, no fucking boyfriend no nothing. Everyone has always hated me so thereâ€™s no point in going on any longer, if my own parents hate me then thatâ€™s got to be a sign. I donâ€™t have any plans for my life and I donâ€™t want to do anything with my life but end it, Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 7 for fucks sakes. Iâ€™m tired of this gravity crushing me, dragging through each day emotionless and dead, I just canâ€™t fucking do this anymore
