Itâ€™s all been badHey team

Iâ€™ve posted before with the whole story 

Not feeling like doing that again

It all been bad 

Short version

Beaten by parents and older brother as a child &gt; becoming a full time caregiver to alcoholic mom until drinking killed her (guess I wasnâ€™t worth sticking around for)&gt; joining the marines to find meaning... killing people fighting for their believes who haunt my nightmares&gt; a guy mentor taking my place with place in a gun turret and getting shot in the head in my place (he had a wife and kids) &gt; trying to kill myself and the fucking bullet didnâ€™t go off...  seriously! &gt; getting married she cheated, went to therapy things got better, found out she was cheating the whole time just different guy &gt; divorce took half my money and stuff left me upside down on other accounts &gt; years pass feelings numb &gt; meet new girl &gt; looong story but absolutely expends all I have left and rips my heats out and leaves with it &gt; being alone at a job I donâ€™t care about. 

Iâ€™m just done and it all been bad 

I canâ€™t see believing it could ever be better 

Iâ€™m ok job/Financial wise 
 
Iâ€™m 32 all my are married or already have kids or planning in them 

Iâ€™m not a interested in trying a new relationship 

I donâ€™t want kids 

I donâ€™t want to make new friends and the ones I have are moving on 

I donâ€™t have a family that would miss me 

Sooo...... why now close this chapter on a life that has been More bad than good as and Im honestly and exhausted with waiting for things to get good.
