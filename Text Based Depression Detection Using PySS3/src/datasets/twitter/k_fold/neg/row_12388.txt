The emotional pain I have to fight through everyday is inhumane and unfairIf you google â€œwhat is the most painful mental illness?â€ The answer is borderline personality disorder. 


I hurt so much, I have to try so hard to not keel over and bawl my eyes out. It feels like my eyes are constantly brimming with tears and my heart is being pummelled relentlessly. 

Iâ€™ve already been through enough. I lost my best parent in late 2018. My BPD symptoms resurfaced and here I am. Feeling rejected and hurt everyday because of a relationship that I canâ€™t accept will never be romantic. 

I attempted in the beginning of January. Iâ€™m at high risk for completed suicide. My life is worthless, no achievements to my name. I also have a sibling that is the fucked up warden of my house, so my pets stay in our (large) basement. Too depressed to leave my bed because my life is too painful and worthless. 

I canâ€™t get anything right. I keep failing. I just want to go. Itâ€™s cruel to force me to be alive. Just let me go. Iâ€™m a failure in every area of my life and Iâ€™m tired of the shame and the guilt. I want to be with my dad.
