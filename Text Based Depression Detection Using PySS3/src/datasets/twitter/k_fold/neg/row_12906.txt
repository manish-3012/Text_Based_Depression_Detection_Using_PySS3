Im pretty darn sadI have a lot of friends but a couple weeks ago my best friend really really fucked me over. Now i just have no one to talk to and i know this sounds super rash but ill go into detail. After getting fucked over i had this epiphany of sorts that one looks forward to events or vacations or fun things but for what, just to be disappointed that that event was not as fun as previously thought, and even if it is as fun you'll always be trying to recreate that fun but to no prevail. So I've come to the idea whats the point of it all if I'm just chasing this unattainable thing which is actual fun. And back to my friend fucking me over i just have nobody to talk to about the stuff that I'm going through now so all i do is sit in my room and write about it in my journal and I'm getting super super bored of just the monotonous day to day life of just nothing fun or eventful! I don't think I'm ready to die and i really don't want to die Ive just kind of come to the point where i think my life has peaked and i don't want to have to have to live with being this bored and sad for the rest of my life! So i guess my question is how does someone get over a lost friend and what do you do if you barely have the motivation to leave your room and something to do preferably alone. Thanks!!!!
