I have everything and I feel emptyI sometimes feel so ungrateful . I come from a wealthy family, my parents aren't perfect but they're good people. My brother is the coolest guy in the world . I could have many friends if I wanted to (but I always end up pushing them away). I even started dating a really cool guy (but I sometimes don't see the point in dating).

Despite the fact that I could have a good life , I feel truly empty . I can't enjoy anything and I see everything as pointless. I also feel that I have no future. I am pretty useless and I probably couldn't do any job except maybe working at a cafeteria and trying to look pretty. Love doesn't even exist and even if I ended up getting married , I would probably be miserable and also make my husband unhappy. Maybe it's also better if I didn't procreate because I'm insane, lol.

I don't think a psychologist can help me mainly because I feel there was always something wrong with me , it's like this is my natural state. Ever since I was a kid there was seriously something off about me which is why I always messed things up for me and for others.

I have been fantasizing about killing myself or getting murdered since I was 12 and now I am 19 , I don't believe there's any other path for me. The only person I truly love in this world is my brother and I also believe he's the only one who truly cares about me . In the long term , everyone will realize that they're better without me. 

I try to survive a few more years , but it is really hard especially when you know what will eventually be the end of you.
