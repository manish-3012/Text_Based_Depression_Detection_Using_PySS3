Ranti feel so alone even though iâ€™m in a house with 6 of my best friends. i donâ€™t understand why i feel this way, i know they all love me and care for me but my brain is telling me complete opposites. i take every tiny behavior and over analyze it into something that is targeted towards me and hating me. i feel so bad, i am so incredibly lonely and empty but i donâ€™t want to ruin their happiness by showing it or telling them, i feel like i am constantly doing this and it makes me a toxic person. iâ€™ve been distancing myself because i feel so down and donâ€™t want to ruin the energy in the room, the last thing i want is to make everyone else feel as sad as i am when they are having a good day. if iâ€™m being honest iâ€™m just a burden to everyone around me. i constantly cause problems for others to solve and they canâ€™t even solve them. maybe i should just try and end it again
