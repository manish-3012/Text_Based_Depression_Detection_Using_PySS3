I am so broken.Iâ€™ve been in an abusive relationship for quite sometime now. Letâ€™s call him kale. Kale is a cheater. And he is aggressive. Kale and I had a baby boy together last September. I was hoping things would get better after starting a family. They didnâ€™t. They began to get very physical. He cheated with prostitutes. Still, I tried to work things out with him. And I donâ€™t know why because heâ€™s never nice. He insults me daily and tells me Iâ€™m alone and have no where to go. Which is also true. 
Iâ€™m a stay at home mom. I donâ€™t have any family. My mom passed away July 2015. Iâ€™ve been battling severe depression since then. But itâ€™s been somewhat manageable after becoming a mom. Kale works. I donâ€™t. So he uses the finances as a form of control. 
Which comes to tonight. He pretty much skipped out with rent money. Iâ€™m going to be homeless. And heâ€™s put me here before and I always figured it out but on this occasion, Iâ€™ve run out of time. 
I feel so useless. All the insults he tells me are true because itâ€™s all of the secrets Iâ€™ve shared with him. How I feel isolated with my distant family. How I donâ€™t have parents to fall back into. That Iâ€™m a broke bitch because letâ€™s face it I guess I am. 

I just wanna be a good mom. My son used to be the reason I didnâ€™t hurt myself but now, sometimes I feel like heâ€™s better off without me.
