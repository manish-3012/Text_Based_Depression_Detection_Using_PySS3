Its finally the time right?I can finally do it right?
My friend was going through some shit and i didnt want to leave him alone, but everything is fine now. And hes also made a new wonderful friend, far better than i could ever be to him... so he wont be alone. As for my mother, i know she will be sad but she will overcome it quickly. So its ok right? I doubt anyone else would even notice and those who did wouldnt give a shit. Or they would be glad. I wont ever disppoint anyone. Im sorry for everything. I wont bother you again. The piece of shit that everyone hated will be gone forever.

I was standing at the roof of a tall building gazing down. It was a mesmerizing view. I felt the adrenaline rushing through my body but i wasnt afraid. One step would have ended it all. Just one single step...

So its ok right? I can finally escape from this hell. I wont have to live this nightmare everyday anymore. I wont have to go through this shit anymore. I should just do the world a favor and fucking kill myself. It will be better for everyone that way. Everyone will be happy that way.
