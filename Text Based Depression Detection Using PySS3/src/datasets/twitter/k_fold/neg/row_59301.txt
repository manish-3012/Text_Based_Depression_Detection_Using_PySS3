I Don't Know Anymore...I don't know why but I just feel so lonely. No one bothers to message me anymore, no one bothers to ask me how I feel even though I'll end up faking and saying I'm fine either way. I just want to cry but I can't. I've had these voices go through my head for the past few days saying I should just kill myself, though I know it's only my depression and self doubt saying I should end my life. All I want is sweet release but I've promised not to kill myself in the sake of two of my friends. Though would they really miss me if I were to kill myself, is it all just a lie? I have a boyfriend, but in my mind I feel like he's only manipulating me so that he can use my body and mind how he wants. He doesn't bother to call me, doesn't bother to message me anymore. He only reaches out to me whenever he feels the need to. He only ever wants to kiss me whenever we see each other. All I want is to be loved when I fully out right know that I can't truly love people myself. My words and life is complicated in my eyes but that is probably because I can't let anything in other than the depression of being myself. I hate everything which is why I feel like the only solution is death at this moment in time... 

Is there is any way I can understand how my boyfriend really feels about me. Does he only want me for his own doing like his friend once did.

Do my friends actually want me alive, or are they just saying that to use me for their own good?

Lastly, am I even meant to be alive? I've done so many sinful things but I still walk this earth like everyone else. 

I don't deserve happiness. All I deserve is sweet, sweet death.
