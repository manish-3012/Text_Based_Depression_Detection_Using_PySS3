Failed attempt #3... Sort ofBeen dealing with some stuff lately and everything just keeps piling on top of each other and for the first time in a couple of years since the last time, I had absolutely no will to live. 
Now, I'm not saying every day has been a ray of sunshine since that last time. No. I never got that "I'm so happy to be alive I'm so glad I'm not a corpse" feeling. But I've managed to get at least something out of life. Always something holding me over to the next breakdown.
Oh I'll wait until summer. Oh I'll wait until after my birthday. Oh I'll wait until school. 

I'm done waiting. 

Or at least I though I was.
So 1:50 am me is depressed as usual and panicky and can't sleep and has the weight of the world on them. You know the feeling. So I decide to walk half of the bridge nearest me, about a 20 minute walk to the middle. Boom, done, I'll be on the next flight to no where by 2:30. 
This bridge is a landmark where I live, a lot of people walk it to get to the other side of town and there's a lot of traffic. During the day that is. My whole trip out there I see maybe 5 people.
Half way through the wind starts picking up. I feel tears in my eyes as the cool air brushes against my face. I should have brought tissues. I'm not even crying, I just didn't think of how windy it would be. 
So I get to the middle. There it is. The opportunity of a lifetime. Literally. The weight of the world on my shoulders I could just climb over the bench and the guard rail and be done with it. 

But I pussy out. 

I don't know why. Everything still sucks no matter how juvenile that sounds. I don't know what made me change my mind but around 2:25 I turned around and started walking home.

I'll have to bring tissues next time.
