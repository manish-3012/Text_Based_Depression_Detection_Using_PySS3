Is this a sign?A few years back, I had depression, and thoughts about off-ing myself. But, fortunately my life has gotten better, and I had long forgotten about these dark thoughts. But today, I stumbled across this subreddit, and reading everyone's submissions, these dark thoughts have been rising back up and made me think about how I will never reach this point in happiness and contemptness in life. Is this a sign of something bad? Or should I just avoid this subreddit for my well-being?
