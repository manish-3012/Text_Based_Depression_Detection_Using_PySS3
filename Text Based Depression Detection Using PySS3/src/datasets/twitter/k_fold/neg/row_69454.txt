Currently inpatient in mental health hospitalAs title explains, I'm currently sat inside a mental health ward due to depression and suicidal thoughts. And I'm still on the same path as I was before admission. I've been in here for one month now, only leaving twice with nurses to purchase cigarettes. I've rejected my family completely, and have only a handful of friends who have visited briefly a couple of times. I've been sedated, quiet and alone with my thoughts enough to see that the struggle isn't ever going to end, and that I am actually looking forward to leaving so that I can stop wasting everyone's time, bed space, and food. 

I feel like I've already died but my body just hasn't realised it yet. I don't want anything to do with what has been, what currently is, or what could possibly be in the future. I'm young and otherwise healthy, so people don't understand. And that's OK. I'm not often a selfish person, but I see taking my own life as the one selfish act I am entitled to, and anyone I leave behind can sort out themselves as to how they feel and get on with it. 

Life is like a party I didn't want to be invited to, and my friends are enjoying themselves but I am not. I am asking to go, begging, but they insist I stay. My leaving wouldn't mean that they have to leave. In fact, they could easily find other friends to hang around and pass the time with once I go. I'm just too tired and worn down to stay. It doesn't get better for everyone.
