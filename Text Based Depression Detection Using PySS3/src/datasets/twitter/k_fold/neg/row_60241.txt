Can't even help someone without getting shunnedHonestly don't know why I bother sometimes. I'd been talking to this girl on Tinder (yeah, I know) since Saturday and it turns out she has depression too. She was quite nice and pretty cool, woke up this morning and she unmatched me. 

I was trying to help her. She said she had no friends and I said that I wouldn't abandon her because I know what that's like. That if she needs a friend I'll always be there to listen. 

So yeah now I feel like shit. I know she's got depression so it's not  like I can really blame her for it, I'm just sick of trying to be there for people only to get fobbed off instead.
