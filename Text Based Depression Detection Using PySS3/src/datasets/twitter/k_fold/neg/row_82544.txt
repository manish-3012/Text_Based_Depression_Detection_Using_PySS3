I'm scared of myselfI can only be positive for a few moments without being overwhelmed by everything that I'm worried about. Everything feels so uncertain. I  have some people that care about me outside of my family, I think, but it doesn't feel like they really do. It feels like I'm always bothering anyone that I love, particularly my ex. We decided to take a break at the beginning of the summer from our relationship and ended up getting together for a couple days after we'd broken up when he told me he tried to kill himself. It was great but now I think that may be the last time, and I'm afraid that I won't be able to live without him. I know that sounds dramatic and silly, but he's one of the only people that I feel good and safe and happy with, but I think it's gone. I think about what I'll do if he tells me it's over for good, or if he's slept with someone else, and I think I'd kill myself. I've been fantasizing about killing myself a lot lately and I don't know how much longer I can go without doing it. I just don't see myself getting happier. I don't love myself. If it weren't for how I think it would affect my parents or certain people, I think I would do it. I think killing myself is the only thing I truly want and would feel like was good for me. I just wanted to vent, so sorry for the long post.
