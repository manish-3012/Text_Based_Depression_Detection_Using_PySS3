I dont want to continue anymore, im so lostI shouldn't have took that CAT(college admission test) i should have stayed in the province, i cant do my engineering course anymore, idk what to do, i cant convince my parents or siblings to switch courses. The moment i bring up about shifting tjey just say just do it and it will get better but its not, does it take a dead son just to prove a point that i dont want to do what im doing anymore? Its so fucking hard i dont know what to do anymore. Im just so lost.
