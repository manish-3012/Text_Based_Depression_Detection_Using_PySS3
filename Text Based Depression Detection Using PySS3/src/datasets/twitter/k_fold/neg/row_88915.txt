My younger brother took my sleeping pills, should I be worried? How should I approach this?Short back for context.
My younger brother (he just turned 13, I am 19), always has this attitude of "Leave me alone" or "Ok whatever fine" when I try to talk to him about anything serious. He does look up to me and I know that, so I just try to lead by example where I can.
I text'd him yesterday afternoon saying that I took sleeping pills so I can get ready for my graveyard shift, (just using them to help me get into a nocturnal sleeping pattern) and asked him to not bash the door down like he does everyday and just use the key we hide out the front.
I put the box of sleeping tablets at the top of the pantry, where all the medicines in the house are kept. When I woke up and came down stairs about to leave for work, I found him asleep on the lounge and 1 of the pills missing. 

He gets into some really difficult moods sometimes, where he will just block out everyone around him and will insist on being left alone. I really worry about him, our parents split up a few years ago I think it has affected him as he is growing into his teens. What should I say to him? How can I get him to open up about how he is feeling?
