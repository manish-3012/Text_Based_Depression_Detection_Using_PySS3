I do not belong hereNo space accommodates me. There is nowhere where I'm even partially safe from serious injury. I have met no one that can relate to or sympathize with my situation. No one has ever really understood anything I've ever said in my life l, implicit or explicit. I can't communicate. It never goes through. It just never goes through. I want out. I want to die.
