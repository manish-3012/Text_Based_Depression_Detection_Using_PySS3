dont know what to doI'm in 10th grade at a private school. Everyone leaves me out and ignores me. I used to be friends with everyone and now they just act like I don't exist. They refuse to acknowledge my existence outside of school. I'm probably going to fail 10th grade too and if I do I am for sure going to kms
