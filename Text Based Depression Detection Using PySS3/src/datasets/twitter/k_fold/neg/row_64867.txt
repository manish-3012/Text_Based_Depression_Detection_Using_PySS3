Finally snappingI Am a failure... In my 22 years of life, I have given up everything or failed. My biggest accomplishment was graduating high school after being a super senior... Only reason I did that is 2 grandmas aunt and my gf of the time cheating on me on my birthday spiraling me into a major depression so all I did is get 8-10 credits in 2-3 months... Then I found my newly official ex wife ... I have had 20 some jobs ... All have fired me or I have walked out of... They were mostly temps where I got greedy or I was let go to down sizing ( at least I have decent work ethic on my side) ... I was then like I'll try a trade .. Failed trucking school... Then my ex wife became pregnant and I'm like imma go to college ... We had a miscarriage... I was going to out myself do to a pact I made with myself after failing trucking thencollege but I snow drift prevent me actually going to the place I was going to do it... Fast forward through a seperation ..... Car accident ... Rekicking me out... 2 attempts of hanging ... carbon monoxide poisoning... I also had another car literally blow up on me... Attempting to move away ..  And now officially divorce and the lowest point I have ever felt in my life... I can't live or die guys
