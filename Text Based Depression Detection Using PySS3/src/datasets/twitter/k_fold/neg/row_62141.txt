today is the two month anniversary of my suicide attempt. im not getting betteri dont have anyone in my life who cares about me except my family, who dont accept me (for being transsexual). ive had to move back in with them bc the attempt on my life left me with a back injury that keeps me from working, and medical debt. i still want to die but im terrified of the pain any suicide attempt will cause me. im just floating in limbo, hoping a freak accident will take me away. im lost.
