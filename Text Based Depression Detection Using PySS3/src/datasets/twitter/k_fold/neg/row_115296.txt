Constant suicidal thoughtsI have constant suicidal thoughts and urges, but I don't think I'd actually kill myself. I think about taking all of the pills I have, and I feel impulses to do it, and the thoughts really scare me, i get the feeling you get when you're looking down from a height.

I can't gauge how serious it is. the thoughts are constant, never ending, I can't function in college whatsoever, but I know that i really wont do it, and even if i did i wouldn't take enough to kill me, so i just ignore it and do nothing. Im in therapy, im taking antidepressants, but they're not helping. 

I feel like a faker because i keep having the thoughts but I don't have intention to actually kill myself because im too scared and because dumb things like "i wont get to read the ending of my favorite book series". my life isn't even bad. im just a failure

should i drop out of school? is this serious? when should you take suicidal thoughts seriously? Where is the line?
