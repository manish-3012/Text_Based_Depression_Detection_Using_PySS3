No help for meOK so I'v been depressed for as long as i can remember. in high school it got worse. i had no friends in school and i'm a very nerdy guy in a backwater town full of redneck and hill billy's so i've felt alone my whole life with no one to relate to. I've tried seeking help in the past councilors doctors nothing ever seemed to help. now they tell me i have anxiety and my brain is like leather and dose int produce serotonin. I've been so miserable and in pain for so many years i cant stop wishing for the pain to go away by any means i just lay here and sleep anymore its been days since i left the house i barley eat and the only thing i have an interest in is being close to a female but i know that will never happen. the only answers i seem to get is get a job so i can buy meds that are suppose to help or hang in there life gets better or cheer up one day something good will happen but after 24 years of shit i've had my fill of life and if something good does int happen soon i dont think anything will stop me from ending it i quit my job drop out of college i'm about to loss my home and i just cant find any reason to care cuz life sucks that bad. sorry i'm new to this i've never posted anything before this is kinda my last desperate cry for help.
