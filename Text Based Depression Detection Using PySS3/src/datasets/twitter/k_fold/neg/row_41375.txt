I canâ€™t tell if I want to do it out of spite or because Iâ€™m really fucked up right now.â€œYou donâ€™t know depressionâ€
â€œIt canâ€™t be that badâ€
â€œYouâ€™re not doing your bestâ€
â€œYou have nothing to be depressed aboutâ€
â€œNothing has ever happened to you for you to be depressedâ€
â€œI bet youâ€™ve never even looked up what depression is or how it makes people feelâ€
â€œIf you went through my life, you would have committed suicide by nowâ€


My father told me all of this shit and a plethora of other really ignorant statements. He knew that Iâ€™ve gone to a facility and tried therapy separately in the past yet he lied about those details to me AGAINST me. What he doesnâ€™t know is that Iâ€™ve attempted suicide twice before and have a history of self harm. And here I am a dumbass for not hanging myself like I felt committed to last night. If only he wasnâ€™t a piece of shit fucking narcissist then maybe I would have bothered to blow up on him. Iâ€™m so done with this shit. I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s me being sad or mad that is going to bring me to this.
