Got into a car accidentLost control over a car, was close to flipping the car and who knows what injury I could get. Ended up just falling at the side of the road. My first thought was not about me being alright - my first thought was worrying if the car is alright so my dad won't shout at me. That's how little I value my life. It's like life wants me to end myself, throwing at me situations which clearly show I shouldn't be living because how incopetent and miserable I am. And I'm really closer than ever.
