How to reach out to friends and acquaintancesDid anyone ever make a reach out post to several friends when so low, admitting how bad it really is and something positive has happened? I definitely could need help and honestly ask myself how long I will manage to withdraw myself, but I feel as if my immense pain is too much for people and they get angry and/or helpless. 

I am actually pretty sure, if more people would have helped me and if more people would help me, the burden wouldn't be so big for the single persons and I'd have a chance again. But now, It really don't know how long I can stand the pain.
