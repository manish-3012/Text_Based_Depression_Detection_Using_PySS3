Life is a waste of time, and I'm not sure how I feel about continuing it.I'm not one for long-winded explanations. I'll keep it brief, or else I'll just start ranting with no point.

I'm not suicidal yet. Or maybe I am? I don't know. I'm another one of those sad, entitled Gen Y'ers that got left behind by the recession. My idiotic choice to pursue a humanities degree didn't help, so I'm partly to blame. Well, I'm back in school, 26 going on 27 in a few months, still living off family money. I've moved to a new state with my family, I know nobody. I've never been a social person, and building some kind of support network has been almost impossible for me. I can't meet people. I don't know why. Life comes across as a waste of time - my major is sucking the life out of me, my continued financial dependence essentially makes me a child, every attempt I make to do something creative or worthwhile collapses in on itself and just rots. I'm running on empty. Suicide feels like it would be pointless. I'm a zombie right now, for all intents and purposes. I can put on a happy face in the company of the few people I have continued contact with, but alone, I have nothing to distract myself with, and my personal demons come out from every pore and surface, out for blood.

I've tried therapy and medication. Both have only been able to help so much. If anything, I'm reverting. 

Other people will give all the advice in the world. People like them take a certain amount of emotional agency for granted, and will then dispense empty advice regarding things like - I don't even fucking know. An attitude change. If so-called "optimism" is what the doctor ordered, then good golly gee, what in the living fuck am I still doing here?

So, yeah, I'm pretty much a sad and rather useless person, much like many other people. And look at that, I ranted after all.
