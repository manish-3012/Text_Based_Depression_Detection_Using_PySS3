Bye world! :-)Sorry to post here and detract from everyone with real problems, everyone who deserves help... I want to kill myself and I've taken some pills already as well as getting drunk, I feel that being drunk makes me braver so I'll probably take the rest soon... I'm posting here just because I don't want to be alone while I die, I feel very lonely but I want SOMEONE to notice that I'm dying I think. I've already done the proper things: called suicide hotline, told my friends (or the closest thing I have to friends) and nobody cares and everyone thinks I'm just looking for attention so I guess that's a good ticket to go ahead with it? Lol. I think I am doing this for attention but since I'm getting none that seems a good reason to die! I don't expect anyone to reply to this or care, I kind of just want to ramble at this point, as long as I have the brief hope that someone will see this and care about me for even just one second... I mean it's for the best that I die, I've been getting "professional help" for years and they don't know what to do with me, and I can't function as an adult, and all they can do is tell me I have this or that or the other but nothing helps and they've all given up. Well so have I. So, goodbye, if my GF finds this post I'm sorry my love, tell my mom I hope she gets those plane tickets refunded. Pa pa!
