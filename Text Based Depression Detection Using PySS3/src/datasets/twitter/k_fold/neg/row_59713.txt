I started burning myself againPardon my English itâ€™s not my first language. Today I started burning myself again and Iâ€™m thinking about ending it all. 
I donâ€™t see anything positive in my future. Iâ€™m not able to work for my degree, I get attached to the wrong people and I canâ€™t stand my life. I just canâ€™t deal with everything anymore Iâ€™m not strong enough. I just found out something terrible about my family and I just canâ€™t deal with it. 
Iâ€™ve been suicidal before and Iâ€™m going to therapy since 2017, but I just canâ€™t. I hate myself, the way I look, Iâ€™m some kind of carpet and I just canâ€™t stand suffering anymore. I donâ€™t have the strength. I donâ€™t know what I want to do with my life. I have friends that I love but I donâ€™t want to be a burden anymore. 

I wanted to see if things would get better at some point but itâ€™s not.
