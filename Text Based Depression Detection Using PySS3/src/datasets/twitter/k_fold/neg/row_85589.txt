I canâ€™t feel better, not even drugs help anymoreI am currently high. It is wearing off so Iâ€™m able to think  more clearly. Iâ€™ve come to realize that the things that use to help me donâ€™t anymore. For instance, smoking pot use to be an immediate release for me and now, I sit here, wanting to kill myself again. This reflects back to everything else in my life. My distractions donâ€™t help, my therapy doesnâ€™t help, my medication doesnâ€™t help, people donâ€™t help, nothing helps. Iâ€™ve been depressed for 4 years. Wanting to kill myself all that time. I just think itâ€™s getting worse though. I want everything to be over. This is agony.
