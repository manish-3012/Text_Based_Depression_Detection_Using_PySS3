Beauty will save the worldI love the world and it's people, and that is why I want to commit suicide. Every corner and every moment is filled with immense beauty. I feel indebted even to the dirt for my existence, almost as if I wouldn't truly appreciate it, if I didn't learn to love it's every quality. I love my family, my friends, all people I meet. All have been a guiding light and a spark of life. I can't fit into any of it. I am below scum and deserve every torture that comes from my failure in existing. That is how I have convinced myself to stay alive up to this point, but I don't know how much more I can take. I hope any fragment or atom of me or my death will help you in any small way it can. I love you.
