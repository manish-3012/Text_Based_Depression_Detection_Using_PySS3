*Sigh*So, my life is a shit show. \[TW: Self harm/cutting\]. I have been clean of cutting for about 2 years, but then things started slowly going downhill. I tried to stay positive, tried being optimistic, but then tonight... 

It happened again...

I cut all on my forearm. And I cut it bad. 

I have been thinking of killing myself. No one in my family loves me. I am not accepted for being Trans. And when I do cut, my guardians are like: "Well, she has mental issues, and I can't stop her." \[Witch "Her" are NOT my pronouns. I am trans with he/him pronouns. She knows this.\] 

I just feel like straight-up giving up. She\* wouldn't care.
