I hate fighting for my existenceI really canâ€™t deal with it anymore. I could be rich, with a family, with all of the opportunity but Iâ€™m just fucking cursed to fight constantly for who I am.


Itâ€™s such fucking bullshit I had to be born trans. I fucking hate it. Fuck trans pride this is awful. Iâ€™m so sick of having to argue every damn day that my existence is valid, that I wish other trans people would be able to live better lives, I hate arguing and having to constantly struggle every day. I just want to relax.


I just want to lay down and know that my community will have a better future and not have to worry about my safety. Safety is one of those things that humans need to survive just like food and water and I donâ€™t feel that at all. 


Iâ€™m so drained, I donâ€™t want to keep fighting and fighting every fucking day. I just want to know that my best friend will live a good life, that I will live a good life, that the trans community will live a good life and not have to fight like a cornered fox every day. I hate it. Iâ€™m mentally and emotionally exhausted. I donâ€™t want to do it anymore but I canâ€™t avoid it
