Was it attempted suicide?I'd unbuckled my seat belt, turned off the lights, placed my hands in my lap, pressed the gas, and closed my eyes. I'd hit 98mph before taking the wheel again(I had opened my eyes). I know this because my speedometer was broken and had a gps in its place. In my mind I was going to "let" myself die. People knew I always wore my seat belt and this would be "the one time I hadn't". Maybe I'd be a cautionary tale. Was this attempted suicide? 

Edit: this was on a county road with no other drivers around. There were steep hills and tight curves, with forest either side.
