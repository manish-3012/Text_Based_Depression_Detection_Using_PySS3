I'm planning to take my life on my coming birthday.My birthday is coming in a week or so. End of the year end of my life. I've asked to go for therapy multiple times but everyone keeps saying I don't need one. I can't control my thoughts. My anxiety kills me. Idk wtf to do. It's been many years since I have been dealing with shit. And I'm just tired...
