Living my life sucksI am 35 years old and I have been depressed for 15 years and have anxiety for the same. I have tried meds and I always have a bad reaction I tried therapy and I only feel good for a couple hours and then I get depressed again I went to the psych ward and that was hell on earth I felt like a criminal and they didn't care one bit about me . I recently tried to go to Fort Lauderdale to get away and be in the sun, I am from Cleveland and I had a major panic attack and felt like I couldn't breathe and I was really anxious and that is on vacation the only thing I can do to not be anxious is to sit in my room and watch movies but it has been really boring. I don't have a lot of friends because they got tired of me talking about depression. I am so tired and I want to die I am just looking for the best way to do it and then I am dead. Hospitals suck people suck life sucks and my body sucks
