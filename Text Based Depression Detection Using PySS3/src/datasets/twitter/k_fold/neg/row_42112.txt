I feel like I have lost myselfI wake up and just wonder what would happen if I died today. I bought enough paracetamol and ibuprofen to kill me and just think if I should use it. I even have a stash of vodka hidden in my room with a note on it saying 'drink with the pills'.

I feel like I am getting my life back on track finally but I still want to end it all. I can't trust family cause they will overreact and my friends think I am taking the piss. What do I do?
