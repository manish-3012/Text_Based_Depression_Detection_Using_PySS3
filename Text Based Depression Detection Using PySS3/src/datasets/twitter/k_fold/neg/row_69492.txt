I've Had A Breakdown And Can't Move ForwardThis is my first ever post on reddit and I've been struggling with myself all day on whether or not to post this.

I've always suffered with mental health issues but once I met my girlfriend everything got so much better in an instant. It felt like I actually mattered to someone and it seemed like we very quickly fell in love.

This whole week has had me at the lowest I've ever been. I had dropped her off at work on Saturday morning and she kissed me and told me she loved me. On Sunday she was very quiet and distant then on Monday morning she broke up with me by text and ignored me all day.

Halfway through the day I started drinking and planning out my suicide. I had a note written out and a noose ready. I knew that my dad was coming to see my on his way home from work so I wanted it to be a final goodbye. However a friend I had confided in had called an ambulance and I was stuck with him around all night.

These past few days I've felt like I'm being babysat and made to feel so horribly guilty and selfish for my actions. I'm being pushed through with therapy and medication but this isn't the route I want to take. I know that when I do this it will hurt the few people around me, but I really don't want to live like this again.
