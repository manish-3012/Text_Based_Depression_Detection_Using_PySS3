Family and I have been living in a hotel for 2+ yearsI had to quit school this semester basically because I couldn't pay. My only hope is that another school will accept me and pay me full financial aid or close to it, but I don't think they will until my bill is paid off because the other school won't release my transcripts. I also have to get a car for work because the hotel is in the middle of nowhere and not near public transportation. There are 4 of us living in a one bedroom. I also had a chronic illness that racked up medical bills.

I'm really scared I'll never be able to get out or they'll never be able to. I'm really scared and don't know what to do. I just want to be a normal student and go to school and learn and be in a stable environment and have fun.
