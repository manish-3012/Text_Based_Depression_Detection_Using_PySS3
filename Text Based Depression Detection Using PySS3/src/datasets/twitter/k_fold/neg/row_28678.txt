I can't take other people anymore.My entire life, people have always disagreed with me. No one ever wants to talk, because I'm different from them. People change their opinions of me night and day and it's becoming very stressful. Yesterday, two of my "friends" were talking about music and I jumped into their conversation, telling them that all bands are terrible except Run DMC. One of my friends just gave me a look of disgust and walked away. What do I do?
