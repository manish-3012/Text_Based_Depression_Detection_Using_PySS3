Got found outI feel like I'm posting too much and I'm really sorry but things are slowly collapsing and I'm on the verge of losing my mind. So I did the stupidest thing of writing out my plan in details in this small journal I got and I think I fell asleep so it must've fell in the cracks of my bed. My sister wanted to be nice I guess and cleaned my room, rearranging everything and found it. 

So her being snoopy read it and asked me when I came home. I made a quick lie and threw the whole journal away. We share everything with the family and I cant let her share this. My family will actually beat me black and blue and send me to her hometown back in Africa ( I've been told its fucking awful there ).

I don't know what to do now. I'm pacing in my room trying to figure out what to do while typing this
