Not really as bad as the other ones, and I'm not at any risk at the moment, but I have these impulsesSo I have these impulses in which I want to kill myself. I've had depression for many years, but I never seeked any help as I didn't really know it was depression. I just thought it was normal to feel like that all the time. No matter, untill the beginning of last summer, I started getting these thoughts, these impulses. Sometimes they lasted for a day, sometimes for a couple of weeks, but things didn't escalate until I realised one day, a month ago, when I was on the edge of a bridge, ready to jump off, that I really needed help. So, I told my parents about it all, there was crying from both sides, but in the end I began seeing a therapist and taking antidepressants. The problem is, I still get these impulses from time to time. Sometimes they're not strong, more like a second thought in my head, but there are times where I just KNOW things can escalate real quick. When I get these I make sure to stay around my parents or just be around someone I care about, but what I ask is : is there anything I can do to remain controlled? I mean, are there any things, any mind tricks or something to convince me that I don't really want to do what I want to do. Because, for now, I can control myself in these moments, but I feel like there are going to be worse times. I don't need anyone to convince me I need to live, I know that, but the problem is, when I get these kinds of impulses, I stop caring and all I can think about is how I can just...do it.
