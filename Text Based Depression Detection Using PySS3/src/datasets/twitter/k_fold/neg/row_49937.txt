i have no clueI turn 19 in a couple of days and I canâ€™t even bring myself to be happy. Iâ€™ve struggled with this bullshit most of my life and have had many attempts over my teenage years, but idk if can do this anymore. I keep pushing myself to do these things in life thatâ€™ll eventually â€œmake me happy,â€ going to uni and stressing myself half to death so I may one day have a job I actually half enjoy. I go back after Christmas break. Iâ€™m struggling financially. I applied for so many Christmas break jobs but was denied every one. I canâ€™t keep living off ends meat and be happy at the same time. I just want it all to end, this thing called life is too fucking hard, I give up.
