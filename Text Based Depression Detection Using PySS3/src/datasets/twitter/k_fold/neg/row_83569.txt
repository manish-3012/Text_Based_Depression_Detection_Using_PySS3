17 with no hopes So far ive done nothing with my life and about to fail highschool. Since middle school ive never cared about grades as i was just waiting for highschool to end then to off myself at the 1st chance i got. Never had any friends or a good relationship with parents. ive got no skills or experience but as of late i made a few friends over the internet that have made me realize may theres something to live for. At this point though im still failing highschool with no hopes of passing and want advice on what i can do to get my life on track.
