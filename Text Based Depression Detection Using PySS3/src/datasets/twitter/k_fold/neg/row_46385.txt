I want to kill myself for being an introvert.Introverts are weak, ugly, depressed and basically everything bad. I feel like cutting myself until I bleed, every time I think about being an introvert. Why was I given a genetically inferior trait? I have every negative trait imaginable. I am genetic garbage. i will never be like the super strong, super healthy, good-looking athletes. I am an inferior specimen. Nature pissed in my genetics. i am weak, emotional, hyper-sensitive, risk averse, asexual. A f-cking wimp. I want to cut myself until I bleed out. I want to burn myself. i want to stick a knife in my neck and bust my carotid artery. I have nothing but pure, white hot hatred for myself. I want to die!
