The pressure is pushing me toward the edgeThere is so much pressure on me. So much darkness happening in the world. Iâ€™m overwhelmed. Constantly feeling anxious. Depressed. Broken. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know anymore. Nothing I do has been right. I donâ€™t belong on this Earth anymore. I genuinely feel like everyone elseâ€™s life would be better without me. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Living is exhausting. Iâ€™m exhausted. Absolutely exhausted.
