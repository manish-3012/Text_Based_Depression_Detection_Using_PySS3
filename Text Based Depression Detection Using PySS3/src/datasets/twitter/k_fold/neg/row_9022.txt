It's not fairWhy?! I've been trying so hard! After a month of compeltely isolating myself from everything, I finally had enough strength in me to start trying to get better again. I did so much more than I thought I'd be able to in a couple of days, and now its come crashing down. Every time I'm given a slither of hope, I catch the bait, and then fall right back down to square 1. I'm so tired, I want this to stop so much. I can't kill myself, it feels like a hurdle far too high to jump over right now, but jesus fucking christ do I not want to be alive. I want to go back to before I was born, I want to have never existed in the first place. I was so proud of my pathetic attempt at progress, and now I just feel so overwhelmed again. I just hate when life decides to toss me a little bit of happiness, I was getting used to the bad feelings again, they were horrible, but not nearly as bad as they are now, directly after experiencing the ability to function slightly for the first time in over a month. It's just.. not fair.
