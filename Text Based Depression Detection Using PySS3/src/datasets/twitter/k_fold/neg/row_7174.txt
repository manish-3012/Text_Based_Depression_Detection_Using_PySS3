The only reason I havenâ€™t ended my life is because I live for those I loveLately Iâ€™ve been abandoned  by everyone it seems. 
I donâ€™t get the love in return and I feel like a burden to everyone. I have health issues and my life stresses out everyone Iâ€™m close to. I canâ€™t hold a job and when Iâ€™m unemployed I collect benefits to get by. I feel like a burden to the world. 
Iâ€™ve been in long term relationships one after another and Iâ€™m realizing I donâ€™t like to be alone because I make this other person my reason to live. I make them my motivation. When theyâ€™re there, I do great. I get my health together and I make shit happen. But once theyâ€™re gone Iâ€™m empty, and I canâ€™t find a reason to convince my self I should even be around. With my health Iâ€™m gonna have a short life. Towards the end I will be a vegetable and someoneâ€™s burden or hospital bill. Iâ€™m 24 and I havenâ€™t had a single smooth period of my life. Itâ€™s been nothing but 2 steps forward and 3 back. Iâ€™m never happy or comfortable. Iâ€™m always fucking something up even when Iâ€™m doing my best just by being me. Iâ€™m trying to convince my self that ending it is not the answer but Iâ€™m in so much mental pain that I canâ€™t even function. And part of me feels like dying will make a statement. A statement to pharmaceutical companies. That Iâ€™d rather die than spend my life trying to survive by buying their over priced medicine that keeps me alive. Iâ€™m a cash cow to them. I also feel it will make a statement to those who shunned me in my time of need as selfish as that sounds... so they never do it to someone else. Not to make them feel bad, just simply learn to listen. And if that statement isnâ€™t even made, then my existence was pretty trivial all along right?
