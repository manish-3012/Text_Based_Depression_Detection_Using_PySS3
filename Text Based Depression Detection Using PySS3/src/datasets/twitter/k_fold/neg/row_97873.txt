CourageJust need to decide on a method, carbon monoxide or a gun to the head? Never even held a gun before. I don't know if I could even buy one, with those pervious hospitalizations. Just want it to be fast and painless if possible. Don't want to make a statement, just want this suffering to end.

I just keep wondering, how hot do you have to be for people to overlook the fact that you have no personality? I've lost a lot of weight but I'd need a lot of plastic surgery... I don't know if I'll ever be attractive enough for that. There is too much ugliness inside. 

I'm scum, worse than scum. Always have been. No friends or life, no one that would care if I was gone except my pets. I wish I could just never speak to another person ever again. But stupid me, always need social interaction too. I wouldn't be very happy as a hermit, even though that's all I'm really suited for.

I work hard, but it's never enough. I can't change who I am. Which happens to be the shittiest person alive. Evolution sure did fuck up this one. Let's chalk it up to a failed mutation and move on.

They suicide is a cowards way out, but I think suicide might be the best thing I could ever do for myself. Give me courage to find my own peace.
