These are my last daysI'm 19. I can't remember what it's like to be mentally healthy. Maybe I never was.

I've been "ready to die" ever since I've come to terms with the concept. I must've been 10 at the time. I have had a deathwish since I was 14. I've been suicidal since last May.

I can't find joy in life. I did everything I could to find something I enjoy. I fought hard not to let life bring me lower than I already was due to my depression.

I had the best 4 months of my life this year. I refused to be hopeful in the first 2 months, but after that I genuinely thought everything's going to be fine. Life wasn't a constant struggle. Those months passed and I was lower than ever. I've been in a downwards spiral ever since.

My life is not worth living. I love myself as a person, but it's just not worth it. The suffering and struggle outweigh any joy I could ever feel. It's time to end it. I'd have already done it if I wasn't so afraid of surviving an attempt and causing injuries that stop me from trying again. 

I've been preparing myself in the last few days. I wrote my last letters. I've been sitting at home in a suit and tie in my free time in case I feel a sudden surge of courage. It might not come today or tomorrow, but it's not far away. At some point I'll just say "fuck it" and do it and hope I don't turn myself into a vegetable.
