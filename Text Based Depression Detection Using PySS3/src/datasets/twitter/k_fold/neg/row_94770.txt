If I soldier on, I'll just end up becoming one of those cases of 'my Dad killed himself two years ago'I'm 21, and my life objectively isn't that bad. I should have an ok career, marry, etc... It's always been a dream of mine to have a little girl of my own, a nice dog... the perfect family life. The problem is that after that then what? The dog dies, the children grow up and leave and at that point I'll finally decide to call it quits, which begs the question *why bother creating a family when I know I'll never be happy and throw it all away, and why bother carrying on if I'm not going to bother pursuing what I always wanted?*
