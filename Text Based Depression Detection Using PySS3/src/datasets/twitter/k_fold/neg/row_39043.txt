Last night (my story)Last night I took 30 Midol pills. Expecting to just die I climbed into bed. Then it hit. At this point I regretted it. I called poison control and told them I didnâ€™t want to die after all. I was seeing yellow. My vision was so dizzy. I felt high. Hour one was alright. Hour two I felt tired. By hour 5 I couldnâ€™t drink anything. Hour 8 is when it got bad. The chills made me strip and lay on the bathroom floor. Then the pain started. 

I tried everything, to pee, too puke. To bring everything up. Nothing worked. I sat there crying out to God that I was sorry. That I didnâ€™t want to die. That I wanted to be there for my boy (my cat ðŸ˜…). I guess He heard me. I got a wave of dizziness. I fell off the toilet before getting the worst pain of my life. But also the best pain. 

I vomited all over the floor. On my hands and knees like an animal. I felt some relief. I thought it was over. By 11 I was throwing up in my bed. 

I felt pain everywhere. By now I regretted even taking the pills. Iâ€™d always been a rational person. But today I felt so low and alone I thought I was sure that this was what I wanted. I had never been more wrong. 

I feel asleep around 2? 3? Desperately trying to get comfortable. 

To the people that talked to me yesterday on this app, thank you. You may not have changed my mind before I took the pills. But your words stayed with me. And I probably wouldnâ€™t have died from these pills. But this is my story. 

Suicide isnâ€™t worth it. I know that now. Thank you to all who were on my side.
