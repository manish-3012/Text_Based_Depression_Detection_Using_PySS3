It's not fair that I'll hurt peopleI am stuck in this fucking limbo of hating life and wanting to die but not doing anything about it. 

If I kill myself, I'll hurt my family, and if I tell them I want to kill myself, I'll hurt them too. I just have to fucking shut up and smile and pretend that I'm ok because I'm supposed to be "better" now.

 I can't afford to pay for treatment, and I don't want to put emotional strain on my family by telling them that I want to kill myself again. 

I am one bad day from ending it all, and fucking no one knows. No one CAN know. 

And don't come at me with that "but they'll be more sad if you kill yourself than if you tell them!" shit. I fucking know that already. 

It fucking sucks that I have to be strong for other people's mental health when I'm falling apart. 

Call me selfish. I don't care. I'm so angry and tired and done with this trash.
