Probably the last thing I'll write.I turned 20 last month. I'm not sure how that happened. Never thought I'd even make it past 14 to be honest. Recently I've been thinking about all of my past suicide attempts, wishing one of them would have been successful. My last attempt failed at 18, life and my mental state has since gotten so much worse. I stopped taking my medication for my depression and anxiety a few weeks ago. Yes, I know that's a really stupid thing to do without discussing it with my psychiatrist first. But it wasn't helping anyway. I feel the same as I did while I was on it. Numb. Hopeless. Unmotivated. Empty.
So what the fuck is the point? 
It feels like there's a grey film over my eyes. Everything around me looks dull and lifeless. Not a spec of colour anywhere. No joy, no love, no hope. I don't want to live like this. It's not living. I put on my best happy face around my friends and family, lie straight to their faces so they don't worry. But I think they can see through my bullshit. They never say anything though. 
I'm tired of waking up every day to do the same shit over and over then end the night drinking and crying til I pass out. 
I've gone to therapy for years, went on several different medications, and tried hundreds of coping skills. Nothing is working. 
Everyone around me is moving on in their lives, finding fulfilment, on the way to getting their dream jobs, getting married and having kids. Progressing. And I'm still in the same spot I've been. Nowhere. 
So I'm just going to end it. 
I know I'm young. But I feel like a 90 year old man  who's just so fucking tired all the time. Exhausted in every sense of the word. 
I don't have a plan yet, but it has to be something that doesn't damage my organs. I'm an organ donor and I've always wanted the chance to help others to live. I'll do some research tonight. Hopefully after my death I'll finally be useful to someone.
