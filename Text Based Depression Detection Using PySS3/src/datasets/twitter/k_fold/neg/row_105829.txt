I'm having a rough time right now and I want to take my life but I know I shouldn't. What should I do?Basically what the title is. I'm going through some rough times and I just lost my best friend... She overdosed on prescription pills. I haven't been the same since I lost her. I loved her and I feel responsible for not stopping her. If I hadn't cut her off when I did, I could have been there and helped her... I cut her off, stopped speaking (mostly), because she got into drugs and drinking and it was destroying herself and I gave up on her because it was too hard to watch... Aside from that I've got other things going on in my life and I've got mental illnesses, not going into them as I'm not comfortable discussing that. I want to seek help but everytime I do, it doesn't work. I have this pattern where I'll be good for a few months then relapse and spiral out of control before sobering up again. I'm tired of the same routine and I just want to be done forever. I know I can't kill myself, my mom would be devasted to lose me and my sister looks up to me and I could never do something like that to them. Yes I know my friends would miss me but my family means more to me. My dad isn't in the picture, my mom left him when I was 17 and he's just gone and done drugs. Not my problem anymore. I'm going to stop rambling now this went far away from the point. I just want to know what to do. Therapy doesn't help and suicide hotlines aren't all that helpful for me. Does anyone know anything I can do? I do want help but what i've been doing isn't working. Need something different.
