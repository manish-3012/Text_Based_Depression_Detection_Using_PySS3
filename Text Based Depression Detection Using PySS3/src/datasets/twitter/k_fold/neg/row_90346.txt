Sometimes I wonder if or when I will kill myself.I always sit on the edge, like construction workers on their lunch break. I like I might he having a good lunch break, but then my coworkers (depression) jokes about me jumping or then pushing me off. I just wonder if I let it stop, then I won't have to deal with it.


Just a random thought.
