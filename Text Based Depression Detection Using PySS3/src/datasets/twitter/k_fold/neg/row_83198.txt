Buying a gun tomorrow since stores are closed.I'll spare you the details of my life since no one will give a shit anyway. I'm just done with everything. Nothing helps. Yes I'm well aware that I'm not alone. It doesn't make a shit of difference. Nothing can be done and I'm sick of wasting life/time/money/air. As much as I love the people in my life, they aren't worth living with this shit, nor are they of any help because they don't know what to do. I tried knives but I can't bring myself to draw blood. I don't have a garage to try CO poisoning with a car. I've never touched a gun in my life, but I've done it enough in video games so I should be able to figure it out right? Just one movement and it's done. Do it in the bathroom so it's easier to clean. I don't want help since it can't be helped. I just need a place to vent where no one's gonna try to stop me. Delete if you want, doesn't matter really.
