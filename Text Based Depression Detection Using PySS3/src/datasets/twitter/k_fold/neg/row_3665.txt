How do I help my friend? (Male)My friend is depressed

He went from being a funny, popular guy in high school to a college student with almost no friends

He's doing absolutely terrible in college. Half the time he doesn't even show up to lesson and he fails every test he takes

He makes jokes about suicide all the time

We used to play online loads but now he never does and he spends all his time just lying in bed staring at the ceiling

He told his parents he was depressed (Which took a lot for him because it's awkward to admit, especially for him) and they just said that there's "no such thing as depression at his age"

---

I don't think he's entirely depressed all the time. Some times we go to the skate park and he seems ok for a while

I've tried talking with him about stuff but he always makes a joke and tries super hard not to share his emotions

I try to have serious talks and I've told him to call me or whatever if he ever wants to talk about stuff but he just sort of rides it off as me being an "emotional pussy" or whatever.

I wish he would just have a heart-to-heart with me

What can I do? He won't talk about any emotional stuff
