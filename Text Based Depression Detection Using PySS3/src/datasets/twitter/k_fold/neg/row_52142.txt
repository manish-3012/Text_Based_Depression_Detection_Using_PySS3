I feel really suicidal tonightI feel like I can't make my life move forward. I'm stuck at a job I hate in a city I hate. I'm a year out from college and I can't get a job in my field even with experience from 2 internships. My friends are moving to the city we all want to live in next week and i don't see how I'll be able to join them any time soon. I feel like I'm going to get stuck in this city forever and never be able to work a job I actually want to do. I'm too anxious to make the appointment to go back on my antidepressants, but I'm scared my partner won't want to be with me if I don't. 

I'm not sure why I'm posting this, I just feel so drained. Like maybe this is all I had in me and I'm done now
