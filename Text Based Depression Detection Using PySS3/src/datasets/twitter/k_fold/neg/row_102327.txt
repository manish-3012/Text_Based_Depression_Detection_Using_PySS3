I don't know if I belong here, but...I don't really know if I should be posting here. It seems wrong to be surrounded by people with so much hurt in their lives when I have no such... But someone told me that I should. They don't know, but they only suspect.
I wish I could shut it all down. I've spent the last year walking around with a crappy fake smile and telling people that everything is fine, but it's not. I wish I could make it all stop. But I never can, because I am terrified of failing to commit suicide. Nothing in life scares me more. I have recurring nightmares about it now and I could never deal with the consequences of that.
That's why it doesn't feel like I should be here. I don't think I'm a suicide risk, because I'm far too scared to be so... But damn, I wish I was. Every day, I wish I could be a suicide risk.
I don't know what I am to expect here, or what to do to make things bearable, but it feels like I'm crawling through the desert, only because the lions will tear me apart if I stop.

I don't know much about any of this, so I'm sorry if I seem a little... rude, in coming here and talking about this.
