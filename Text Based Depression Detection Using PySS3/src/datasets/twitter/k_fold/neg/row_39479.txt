I brought all the reasons I want to die on myself and I deserve itI want to do it because I hate myself. Because I hurt everyone who ever got close to me. Because I am emotionally unstable, manipulative and disgusting. I am abusive and I deserve what I get. I don't think I can go through with actually doing it but what does it matter. I'm dead on the inside already, I'm just done trying. I'm only good for sex, that's all I have to offer, that's all I've ever had to offer.
