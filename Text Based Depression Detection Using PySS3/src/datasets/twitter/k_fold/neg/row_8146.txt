I feel so alone.First of all, English is not my first language and I have no practice writing in English, please forgive me for any mistakes. It feels weird and pointless writing this, because I do not know if anybody is going to read it. But I cried today, and the day before,which is not something usual for me. I feel my dead so close to me now, like never before. I have about 6 grams of bupropion at my disposal, I think that should do it. I hope that it is enough. I fear that it is enough. I am scared of a failed attempt, but I am scared succeeding as well. I don't feel ready to be immersed(?) in nothingness. But it feels like it has to be done. Should I scream for help while I don't have my mind made up? I was thinking of leaving a Sigur RÃ³s's album playing on a loop, my last memory, the last sound.
