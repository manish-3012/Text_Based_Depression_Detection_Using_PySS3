I'm so tired of it allI don't know why I'm posting.
I just want to die. All of it to stop. What's all? It's me.
All treatments failed to help. Hospitals failed to help.
Now I'm looking at a pile of benzos. Whether I die or not doesn't matter.
At least I'll be knocked out for a bit. And get amnesia.
It's insane, this brain. It's broken.
Get help? I'm not in my own country right now. Usually I just get hospitalised, to be contained. But I'm not home. I don't feel like I can just call an ambulance or whatever.

I'm lost cause.
There's just no hope.
