Yesterday I finally did it! I cut down both of my wrist, now I want to know how to recover from it. Help me, please...My family found out through the messages I left for work, they were devastated all of them confused about why I did what I did...  

They had to perform the stitches at home, because suicide attempts is a big deal, and if they took me to the hospital, then the police will get involved and everyone will know.. 

Luckily all 4 of them are doctors.. I am on a break now.. not knowing will work take me back or how to continue my life now.. I feel dead, my family showed great deal about how they care and will help get through this, but under no condition I must do it again... what they donâ€™t get is that I lost the way, the need to survive, the wanting to live... Their is a huge big part of me wishes they never had saved me... is this normal? 

What does one do after they committed suicide, I always said I was gonna do it, but first time of my life I actually did... aside from the physical pain I am having right now, I feel there is a big whole in me and I donâ€™t know how or from where to begin with the healing process..
