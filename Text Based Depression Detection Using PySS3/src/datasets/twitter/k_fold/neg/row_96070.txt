Suicidal thoughts just seem to be getting more and more frequent..I tell my friends that I will never go through with it. I just tell them they're only thoughts.

I try to tell my friends everything but the reality is.. the thoughts are more than that but also feelings. I have a plan. I know how I'm going to do it. Im just waiting for the day I hit rock bottom again and can find the courage to go through with it.
