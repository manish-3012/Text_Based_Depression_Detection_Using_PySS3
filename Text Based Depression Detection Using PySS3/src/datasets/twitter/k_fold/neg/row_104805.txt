Life is so pointless to me nowDoes anyone else feel as if everything is a grey filter, I smile with friends and family but in reality I just donâ€™t see the point in anything anymore, I donâ€™t enjoy anything and feel completely alone. I think I need to see my doctor soon itâ€™s been a few months now and every day is getting worse.
