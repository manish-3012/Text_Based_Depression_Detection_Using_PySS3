My teenage brother just attempted suicide. I need help on how best to support him. Thanks for all adviceHello everyone. My 16 year old brother just attempted suicide yesterday. Luckily he's fine, unhurt, and back home now, but it's been a huge shock for the whole family. I live a few hours away but I will be driving over tomorrow to see him. He and I have always been a bit distant growing up, but we've always been friendly and rarely fought. 

In the meantime, I am trying to figure out the best way to express my support for him. I have a number of ideas in mind already, all of which are centered around how I will always love, support, and be there for him if he ever wants to talk. 

There was one thing I would like to say to him but im not sure if it would be an effective/acceptable thing to say. Here it is:

"Mom and Dad love you so much and they would give you their kidneys if it meant you would be happy. Losing you would ruin them."

I feel like this is an effective statement because my brother loves our parents very very dearly. And this statement strongly represents my feelings on this too. However, another part of me thinks it sounds a bit rude in a way? I'm not sure, so I'd like to double check with you all. Thank you so much for all input.
