I'm not fucking okay!!!my best friend committed silicide two weeks ago, my grandma died a week ago. 

ive shut my mouth. There are people to support There are things to do. I have to go back to work sometime. I have to get back to my life eventually. 

BUT I'M NOT OKAY.

I'M NOT FUCKING OKAY. 

i shut out my feelings and they come out in substance abuse and self doubt, and anger. 

people tell me that they want to talk. Thats... actually super nice. But nobody can take the pain away.

I need to scream at the void. Im so upset. Im so so upset.
