Hey, /r/suicidewatch. I need to get something off my chest.I feel like I need to tell someone this besides my therapist or I'll end up just doing it. Hopefully this will stop me. I'm in pain, and I don't know why. I want to die so badly, and I wish it would happen on accident. 

I recently moved off to college from a midwest town to Boston. I hate it here. At least I think I do. Maybe I hate it here because I'm depressed, as opposed to being depressed because i hate it here. I miss my friends, and I still talk to them. Going back to them for thanksgiving is the one thing that stops me from jumping off a bridge. After that, I don't know what will happen. I don't want to tell them because I don't want them to care more just because I'm suicidal. It's weird. I don't want to be a burden. But I know I need to tell someone, even if it's a few strangers on the internet. I want to die. I'm lonely.

I feel better now for the time being. Thanks for reading.

Edit: I see a therapist, I just wanted to make that clear.
