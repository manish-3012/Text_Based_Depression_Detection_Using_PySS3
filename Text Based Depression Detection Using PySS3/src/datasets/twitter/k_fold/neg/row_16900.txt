I am afraid of not being depressedIt might sound strange, but without it I would truly be a void. At least with this I have the constant pain. Something to tether me down from being nothing dead. But I think I am going to try to cut the rope and finally just embrace what I truly am, dead. I always have been, as long as I can remember, but the depression gave me new life. But with it getting worse I think I got more than I asked for. It has not even been very long, maybe 6 months, but the pain is unbearable and eating me alive. 



I tried posting this to /r/depression and it was ignored. Posting here my posts are either ignored or people start talking, then suddenly disappear. I am all too used to it, but I thought people were here to help, not forget and move on leaving me to hope for a response only for it to never come. I would expect this if it wasn't a help forum, as I am all too used to it, but here it just makes no sense.
