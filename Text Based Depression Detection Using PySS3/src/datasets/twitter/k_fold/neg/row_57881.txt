Next to tomorrowToday I became
Next to tomorrow
I walked across the stage
And took my diploma

All those days I cried 
In the counselors office
Wanting to die
Are finally over

It's all finished now
The long days of high school
That made want to shoot 
Myself with a rifle

It's a fresh start; 
A detox
A sort of beginning 

The first chapter
In the book 
that I will soon write in

I will walk my OWN path;
Beaten or not
Because today's now tomorrow
And tomorrow's looking up.
