A huge letdownI REALLY wanted to participate in a paid clinical study but I was too honest and said I did have depression/anxiety when they asked.  
I'm not sure how it would effect the results in any way.  I fucked up and now I'm not eligiable for 6 months acording to them.  
I hate my life and I wanted to do something completely new but now I can't. 
Everyone keeps pressuring me to do things.  I feel like ending it but I am too much of a coward anyhow, so I remain trapped in my sad life.
Someone please talk to me?
