Lost all the feelingsI mean, I still have some, but they're just faded. 

Me and my mom have just returned from our trip to Europe. It was good (although, extremely tiring and stressful), but now i'm back to my grey life. And studying again. Goddamn studying. 

I still have to choose themes for two diplomas -- i'm recieving two higher education grades at the same time -- and got no idea what to choose. Also, it's about a time for my third attempt to pass a very difficult exam (i don't know the particular date, but it may be set quite soon).

And I have no will, no emotions, no power to cope with all of it. 

Talking to people just tires me more. Thinking is extremely difficult. 

The more I live the more I think that I've already done all I could do. That there's nothing more to do with my life than just end it. 

I still got many good people as my friends. But i'm still feeling alone. I want to be alone, but cannot live without their support. That's so dumb. I think that i'm just a parasyte that uses them to cope with his own nothingness. 

I want to end it all. I'm afraid of pain. But heck, if I will no longer exist, what will change? As soon as I graduate, I will become a useless lump of meat with empty head that has no future.
