What's the easiest suicide method other than a gun?I've officially given up, I don't want to be here anymore, everyday I wake up wishing I hadn't and I just want to end it all. I want to kill myself but Im horrified of putting myself through an incredibly painful moment just to have it fail and have my life get even worse, I don't have access to a gun and can't get one so I want to know what the next best thing would be, I was planning I overdosing tonight but I heard that overdosing almost always fails and causes lots of pain after, so what would be the easiest and most painless suicide method other than a gun. Also before anyone tries to tell me that I shouldn't do it, why not? Everyone hates me and so do I, and I've already hurt myself alot so I'm in even more perpetual pain anyway, so please just let me end it.
