back back back againwhen i was 16 i tried to kill myself unsuccessfully. I was in the closet at a catholic high school, where I had no one. The student body was violently homophobic and the faculty actively egged them on. I felt alienated from everyone around me, including my family and my 2 friends from childhood. I would go days without saying a word to anyone and began to lose touch with reality. I began to get involved with men in their 20s and 30s just to have people to talk to, and with that began drinking and heavy drug use. After two years of this I lost it, and made my first suicide attempt.

I came to several hours later and realized what I had done, and realized that I had failed. I was able to muster the strength to take things day by day, never telling anyone what I had done. Eventually I began to meet queer people my own age, and feel loved. I had a network of friends surrounding me, and was able to function, and eventually thrive. For a time I would even describe myself as confident and happy.

This year I am 22. I still have never told anyone about my suicide attempt. I am away for school, and I spend most of my time alone again. Iâ€™m starting to fall back to my old vices, and it has been impossible for me to expand my network. I feel like Iâ€™ve grown too far apart from my old friends, the steady flow away from each other has been heart breaking. I havenâ€™t been able to connect with new people in the same way. Every attempt to connect leaves me frustrated and feeling more alone than ever.

I feel like no matter what direction my life goes in, this loneliness will stay at my core. I am learning that I am exceedingly difficult to connect with. I have an intense desire to be loved but am not particularly loveable. Any affection that I have found/will find along the way will be shallow as long as I remain this disconnected from everything around me.

After this journey I realized that there is no permanent healing for me, and Iâ€™m having trouble finding the drive to continue living with the reality that my life will be spent alone.
