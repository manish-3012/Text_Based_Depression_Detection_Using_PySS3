Teachers are so dumb.They donâ€™t understand the role they have. They are supposed to make the shit you are supposed to study at least appear interesting. Noooooo, instead they read whatever the fuck they prepared for the nth time and then chastise students for not understanding.

I understand not all teachers are like that, but it does not take many. He called me a waste of time, a disrespectful, stupid, lazy, waste of time. In an online class, while I was presenting a project I worked hard on. Why? Because I was taking too long. The worst is I believed him, and some little part of me still does. And it is the last fucking straw. He never taught us anything, everything in that project I had to research on my very own and then he calls me a waste of time. 

Next week I have class with him again. I plan to blow my brains out with my dads shotgun. Just give him a show of what a waste of time really is. I just hope I can make someone record it.

Anyway, Iâ€™m leaving this here as a sort of reason.
