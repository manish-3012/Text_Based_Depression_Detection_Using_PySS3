I am worthless and not good enough to be a girlfriendI am done with life.  There is absolutely nothing of value for me to live for.  The only reason anyone wants me alive is for servitude.  People want shit from me but Iâ€™m just a vending machine to them.  A lifeless rectangle to take what they want from and walk away from.

Iâ€™m sick of thinking I found my soulmate and being absolutely in love just for them to one day wake up and decide â€œI donâ€™t love you anymore but I want to still keep you around as a friend because you make me laughâ€.

Iâ€™m just a dancing fucking clown to hoo hoo and ha ha for your amusement and then get thrown away.  And if I have any problem with this arrangement Iâ€™m a creep because â€œwhy canâ€™t friendship be good enough am I only worth sex to you?â€

Fuck it all.  This world does nothing but gaslight me, use me, abuse me, and throw me in the fucking trash.

Iâ€™m an ugly worthless tranny who will always be ignored or thrown away in favor of people who are pretty and can pass.

Iâ€™m done living this one sided life.  Other people benefit off my living - I donâ€™t.
