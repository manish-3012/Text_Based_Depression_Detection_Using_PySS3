My therapist cut me off and itâ€™s got me suicidalI was seeing her pretty consistently this whole year, and Iâ€™ve been doing very intense work on my trauma.  However, I had a habit of not showing up to sessions sometimes due to my depression.  This whole year I was going consistently, and itâ€™s helped a lot. 
In the past three weeks, I did not show up because my depression was going off the rails, and I had no energy. 

I was attempting to reach her the past few days to set up an appointment, and she finally got back to me telling me that sheâ€™s going to have to stop seeing me due to my inconsistency. 

Iâ€™m really crushed and just broken down because of this.  My suicidal thoughts and ideations have been increasing in intensity the past three months, but now I would say Iâ€™m at a 9.2/10 in terms of wanting to end it. I realized that I shouldâ€™ve honored my appointments, but I just feel so damn worthless now that even my therapist cuts me off. 

Sorry.
