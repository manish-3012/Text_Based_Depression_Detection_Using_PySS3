I lost at life im pretty sureI suck at my job and will most likely get fired (thanks adhd!), my parents are about to get divorced and don't care about me anyways, i just bought a car outright with my whole bank account and it broke after three days of driving, all of my friends slowly drifted apart, and me and my girlfriend are about to break up. It's literally just wake up, go to work, come home, go to sleep and there's no point whatsoever in continuing. There's actually nothing left making it worth it. Legitimately the only thing that can keep me happy is the joints under my bed, and even they are starting to just not do anything anymore. I haven't fully decided to go through with it yet, but if everything really ends up being as bad as it seems, I give up. Been depressed since 14, and it just never went away. I hate the world and just dont want to deal with it anymore. I'm just finally over it.
