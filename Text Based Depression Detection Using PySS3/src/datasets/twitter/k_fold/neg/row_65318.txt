Please help meI have been posting in this subreddit a lot. I want to kill myself. I donâ€™t want to die I just want school to end. I hate going there. It causes me mental pain every time I have to get out of bed, hours and hours before I would on a weekend. It never get enough sleep. I want it to end. I hate school. I wish it would just end. It has caused me severe depression for a few years. It is causing so much more harm that good. I donâ€™t remember a single thing Iâ€™ve been taught this year. I cant Stand it anymore. I want to kill myself because I want it to end and Iâ€™m too afraid to tell anyone.
