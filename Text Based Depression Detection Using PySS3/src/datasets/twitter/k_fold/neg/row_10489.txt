really sadim an 18 year old boy and im not as into sex as many of my peers or even my girlfriend. It may be because of medication, it may be because i was taken advantage of sexually on multiple different occasions, or maybe it's just who i am. either way,  whenever my girlfriend wants to havr sex and i dont, she gets mad at me and i start to hate myself even more than usual and right now im really low. 

I used to have a bad opiate/pill addiction but ive been clean for awhile. this morning i was sad because of the previously described situation and took a bar and a half of xanax. truth be told, im not at a HUGE risk of killing myself,  but some kind words would mean the world to me right now.
