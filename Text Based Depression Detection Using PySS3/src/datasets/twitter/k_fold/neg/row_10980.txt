Everyone would be better without me.I am ugly.

I am stupid.

I am unlovable. 

These things keep running through my head every day. I want to disappear. I want to be gone and unknown and start a new life, where no one knows about my failures and shortcomings. Where no one knows what a pathetic loser I am.

I feel like such a burden to my parents. I have had the privilege of being close to them throughout my life, but I am so tired of being a burden to them. Every time I bring up my anxiety and depression I feel terrible for causing them any stress. I don't want to burden them with my personal problems anymore, but I have no one else to talk to.

I'm only here because of the cat. She needs food and likes to cuddle with me, so it makes me feel like the world isn't over yet.
