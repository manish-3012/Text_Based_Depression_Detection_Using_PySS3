I am so done...I'm done with living..  I told myself to just wait till tomorrow. Maybe something good will happen tomorrow... But the problem is, nothing good ever came. And now I'm starting to think it never will. I still have multiple oxy and Adderall pills left... Definitely enough to kill me... I'm just done. No one cares. Nothing will change.
