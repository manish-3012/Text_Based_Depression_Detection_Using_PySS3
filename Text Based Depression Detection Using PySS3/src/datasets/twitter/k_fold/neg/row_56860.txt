Why live?If half of the time I just lie in bed resisting the urge to self-harm and wishing I could end it and the other half is a constant struggle to love myself and accomplish even the smallest things (thanks to my anxiety), is life really worth living? Even the â€œgoodâ€ days are mostly neutral, I never feel like my life is how I want it to be. I donâ€™t feel like this is sustainable, and I hate the idea of living like this for the rest of my life. Maybe I just need to find the courage to accept that death is the most compassionate option for myself and itâ€™s the best I can really do, as terrible as that night seem. Idk.
