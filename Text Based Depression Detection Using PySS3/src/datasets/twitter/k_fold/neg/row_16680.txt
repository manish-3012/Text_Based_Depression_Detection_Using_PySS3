Planning to attempt suicide tonight. Maybe someone will see this.Iâ€™m 15 and canâ€™t do it anymore. Tonight Iâ€™m going to down 100 pills of Advil and jump off of the bleachers at my school. Every day is just the same boring cycle. I have no hopes or dreams for the future. It feels like every day I lose a part of myself. The world is constantly getting worse, and I know I donâ€™t want to bring a child into this world. I believe that I will be reborn somehow into a world that I canâ€™t comprehend. I told my mom that I was going to kill myself tonight, and the only thing she told me is that â€œit will get betterâ€ and if I wanted to do something today. I donâ€™t know if it is destined for me to die tonight or if she just canâ€™t even think of a reason that I should keep living. I feel like I have lost compassion for everyone,  I canâ€™t remember the last time someone has made me laugh or made me feel some strong emotion. I am so tired of everything and just want to not think anymore. Go somewhere where emotion doesnâ€™t exist. I feel so hopeless, and I donâ€™t even want to become happy anymore. I would rather just die than spend years putting in effort to make myself just feel ok again.

Even if I donâ€™t die maybe this will change something. Break the cycle or do something to make my life meaningful again. Maybe tonight while Iâ€™m standing at the edge of the bleachers, able to take a few steps forward and end it at any second, Iâ€™ll realize something. Or maybe Iâ€™ll feel nothing at all. The people that I consider friends and family probably wonâ€™t even exist anymore once I die. 

This is just me venting my sadness and anger at everything. I know itâ€™s just a bunch of depressing gibberish. 

Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m so selfish.
