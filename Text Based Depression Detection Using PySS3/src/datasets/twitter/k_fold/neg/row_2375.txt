i feel stuck and it's slowly killing mewarning: angsty

i'm a decently young person, so every other person that i've told my worries to waved it away as a phase.
i've been feeling like this since maybe 2nd grade, when i had first realized that i wasn't nearly as amazing as the other girls.
it's gotten worse now that i've moved to another school. the little comments about my thighs, my weight, my face, my attitude, they make me sick to my stomach. no one besides my dad in my family even has insurance, so i wouldn't be able to get access to medicines, therapy, etc. i'm just stuck in the endless cycle of feeling good about myself, then my self-esteem dipping down lower than it's ever been. all of my friends are these wonderful confident, smart and gorgeous women, and then there's me. i feel disgusting next to them, and they haven't treated me the same after i told them about my old cutting habits. i just feel so alone, and tired, and sick of the way i am. i just want it to end, or even just poof out of existence. my mom would be so angry with me if i had died. i can't. i just really want to hear some opinions on what i should do. i don't feel like i could confide in my mother about it, because she isn't much better off than me; since she has explicitly threatened to kill herself if i even touched a razor again. (my dad doesn't know) my father would send me away if i told him. they both feel like depression is a means of gaining attention. i don't want to go to the school about it since tomorrow is my last day anyway.. i'm always being monitored by my parents one way or another, so i'm not able to speak to the hotline about it. (i don't even have a doorknob on my door so i can't lock it.) and when they aren't home, i end up panicking and breaking down in tears when i start venting about it, and hang up.
