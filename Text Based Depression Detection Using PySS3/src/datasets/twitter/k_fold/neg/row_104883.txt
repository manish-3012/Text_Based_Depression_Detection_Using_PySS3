I got ready upset and wrote about it in a group chatFor note, Maggie is my best friend, ex, and the chats organizer. Shes my world even after she left me and we're still close. 

"I'm really sorry for everything I do wrong and for not being good enough ever. I really want to make you guys proud but it feels like all I do is annoy you and get in the way. I apologize for not dying sooner and for putting all my problems on you guys. I'm selfish and stuck up and rude and obnoxious and i know that and I wish you would just scream at me to fuck off and die because I gave a feeling thats what you think in your head. I hate myself for even imposing myself onto you and wish I could just erase myself from everything you guys didnt have to be bothered with a worthless shithead like me. I've know you all for so long and I left once and feel like I should leave again and end myself without having to worry about this chat but I'm too scared to lose you guys. Honestly I with maggie would kick me and scream at me for ruining everything like I always do. I love you guys but I'm scared you dont love me back. I hate this feeling and want it to go away but when I need you guys you're rarely here for long enough to help or you dont know how to. I try to put myself down and basically abuse myself so maybe you guys dont hate me but I fail at that too. I hate being alive like this. I'm sorry."

Honestly I need help but when I ask from them they seem to forget in minutes...
