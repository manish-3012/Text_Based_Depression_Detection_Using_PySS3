I am afraidI have no reason to keep living, I am sad and lost. I am heartbroken and the idea of a future seems colorless. I don't know what to do, and my mind keeps entertaining suicide, like it has for years.
 
I am afraid. I don't really want to die, I just want to be happy and feel hope for the future...
