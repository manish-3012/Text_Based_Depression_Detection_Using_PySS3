I wish I wasnâ€™t hereMy existence is by no means important to anyone other than my mother. Sure if I were today the community would scream in agony of â€œThey were always happy and cheerfulâ€ or â€œYou could always looked to them to see a smile.â€ I matter to NONE of these people. Everywhere I go, I try so hard find people who will talk to me, who will invite me to do things, who will just treat me like a human being. I get up, call mom, finish class, take a nap, eat, watch tv and go back to sleep. Everyone says â€œoh you can do this with us, or you can do thisâ€ but I never get the follow up. Anytime I do hang out with someone, its like this whole charade of trying to fit into their schedule. 

I even see it in my youth group. Isnâ€™t church the one place you can come together and feel accepted, loved or wanted? I have been at this church for nearly 10 years. It was great growing up but now that Iâ€™m grown itâ€™s like I mean nothing. I say â€œI can help with thisâ€ or â€œI can do thisâ€ and they say they donâ€™t need my help. Then 10 minutes later they will put in a group chat (which includes everyone BUT me, and only know what goes on because my younger brother is in it) that they need help with the thing that I offered. Iâ€™m not a bad person, Iâ€™m not annoying, or over bearing. I always try to think of others, I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m so alone. The only social interaction I have is in my college classes and thatâ€™s it. I donâ€™t think I want to die, I just want to matter to someone. This existence is meaningless. I am noticing deficiencies arising from my lack of belonging, and they scare me. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m too the point I wish my dorm was haunted or I was possessed or something, there would at least be something else other than me. 

I just wish I was never born, Iâ€™m essentially a fleshy ghost, but without the perks.
