42 summers is not enough, but psychological pain is too muchthinking about doing it by end of month, crippling depression and anxiety missed with some hardcore regrets, have pushed me to the edge. just don't want it to effect my family (mom currently is battling cancer) and coworkers,  but might just have to do this crazy thing. I have been researching methods, repercussions, afterlife, karma, and reincarnation lime crazy for last 1.5 months. Don't want to do it but my OCD is driving me nuts and need relief, but worried about long lasting soul implications. 

I would never recommend doing the deed to anyone out there in reddit world--please don't do it, its not worth it. Please let me convince you not to and why.

but for myself it almost looks l like  destiny, the last 3 months have had me spiraling out of control emotionally with illnesses, and on the brink of bankruptcy, financially. Long lasting deep seated family issues have risen up and my father has recently disowned me in a way, I am beat down. Going to make it look like a car accident, or just use a rope or bridge.
