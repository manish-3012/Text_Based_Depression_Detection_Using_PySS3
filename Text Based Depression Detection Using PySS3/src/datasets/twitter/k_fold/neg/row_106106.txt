Check the more urgent posts first please, I'm not in immediate danger.Sorry for the title, there are just other people that should come first. I just need to talk about this to someone who can understand.

I've said pieces and parts of this a few times before, but I need to just lay it out on the table... it is very likely that I am going to (try to) kill myself in June. Why the delay? Because I'm waiting on someone to make a decision that effects me a billion times more than they think.

Before anyone wastes their time reading through the whole thing, id suggest that if you don't like dealing with relationship issues or are going to berate me about growing a pair, you just stop reading here.

I started actively talking to this girl that I was somewhat friends with for a while about six months ago. It started out simple enough, talking about college and how the days were going, things like that... after a little bit, the subjects started to change and get more personal... she told me how she wasn't happy being with her boyfriend but didn't know how to break up with him and that a lot of her dreams had been intimately involving another guy, which was worrying her more. I told her I'd try to help if I could and to not worry about the dreams as much, because she couldn't control them. Well, one night a week or so later, she started talking to me on skype and asked what I was up to. (A little background, I've been depressed since I was 13 and severely more so since 17) I had spent the whole day locked in my room doing absolutely nothing but thinking; I didn't want to lie, so I admitted that I was trying to find the slightest reason not to jump off my roof and was coming up empty. She immediately started freaking out and called me, saying, among a jumble of other things, that I was the guy that kept popping up in her dreams and that she really wanted to talk to me in person about it. To save some time and space (because I really doubt that anyone actually wants as detailed an explanation as I've been writing), we did talk and end up together, I supported her throughout her telling her boyfriend that they were through and telling their mutual friends (most of which now hate me) what had happened. We really hit off and things were great (or so I thought). I had/have a very rough time with nights, as that seems to be when my depression kicks in the most. She would sit with me through them and tell me that things were going to be alright, and I believed her and trusted her. I did realize that it was a lot of stress that was being tossed her way, which she didn't need because she already had enough from college... but instead of letting me know that this was becoming an increasing problem, she stayed quiet and only told her ex (whom she was still occasionally in contact with). 
Things started going downhill. Part of me knew that they were but didn't want to believe it. I was trying to do everything that I could to make her happy, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something that she wasn't telling me, so I brought it up. It turns out that she was becoming "confused" between me and her ex. That really fucking hurt. She wanted a break where we could just be friends so that she could finish up the last semester and sort things out for herself... I tried to understand but I honestly couldn't and in the end, I agreed to the break. 

It started out fine (considering the circumstances), but the change was quickly noticed. She barely talks to me now, we're lucky to have ten skype messages back and forth (the random text I send is rarely replied to) a day, usually consisting on me asking how her day is. The replies seem forced and I fear that I'm annoying her, so that cut down the amount of communication even more. I understand that she is very busy right now, but it's pretty obvious when someone is flat out ignoring you. 

When she has been back on the weekends, she'll spend nearly the whole time with her other group of friends and her ex. She's also been staying at his house every night that she's been back (not uncommon, the whole group stays there occasionally because its a large house) which bothers me more. I get to spend maybe an hour or two with her before she goes back off with her other friends and eventually goes back to college at the end of the weekends. 

She did suggest a few things to me when I asked if there was anything that I could do to help my chances of her getting back with me... to work on dealing with my depression, to find more hobbies (I was apparently too codependent), to get out with friends more... I've done all of these things since then and she said she can't think of anything else. So now I've pretty much exhausted the changes I can make, but it still feels like I'm drastically losing the one thing I've ever loved permanently.

I called her last week and pretty much asked her if I was wasting my time because I know that I basically don't have a chance in hell, but she said that she hadn't thought about it at all yet, so I wasn't. I am now holding desperately on to my last shred of hope and I'm not going to let go of it until the decision is made. That's the only reason I'm still here and if it gets destroyed, then I'm out.

I try to help out on this sub when I can, and I've seen this sort of thing time and time again here... and I always feel bad because I have to skip those posts... I honestly don't know what to tell them because I can't even help myself. 

The amount of loyalty, trust, love, and care that I've given her was all that I had left. On the night we seriously connected, I had nothing. No hopes, no ambitions, no future, just a death wish. I thought that this was the push I needed to get my life finally going, I had something to work and fight for, it gave me the hope that I'd never had and a sense of purpose. If she's gone for good, not only will I have just as much nothing as I did on that night, but I'll also have the knowledge that I let the one thing I ever truly cared about walk away because even my best efforts aren't good enough.  

I've been wearing this content suit and happy mask for six years. Sure, some days the make-up has to be thicker, and some days the mask falls off, but its the only thing I know how to wear. Once June rolls around, I'll finally be able to retire it to the closet for one of two possible reasons. I apologize for the length of this post, despite everything written, I still feel like I haven't done this feeling justice (if any words ever could)...

Have a great day...

Edit: I'm going to sleep now. If there are any replies, I'll read them when I wake up.
