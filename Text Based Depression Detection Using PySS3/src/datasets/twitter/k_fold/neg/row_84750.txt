How do I escape these thoughts?I'm struggling really hard right now trying to hold my life together. I have no family or friends in this city. I left my hometown and my friends/family a couple months back and traveled across the country to this new city where I knew no one. I'm really introverted and don't get out of my apartment except for food/work. Negatives thoughts are plaguing my mind and affecting my reality. I can no longer concentrate and have constant brain fog due to this. 

I have a girlfriend in my hometown who is suppose to be moving up with me but I just found out she hooked up with someone else and now I'm just losing it. I just wish I could sit down with someone and explain my situation.  I have no one right now to just let relay my thoughts to and I'm really afraid that if this goes on much longer I am going to end up killing myself. 

My thoughts are reflecting my reality right now and I wish I could just erase my mind from all of this and start over again.
