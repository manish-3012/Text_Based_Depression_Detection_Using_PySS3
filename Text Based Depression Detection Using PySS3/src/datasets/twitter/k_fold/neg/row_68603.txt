I was told basically I shouldn't be suicidal because I'm "pretty" and talentedI could have done so many things in this life. But I had to be suicidal with talent. What's the point of being talented or even attractive when you want to die everyday.

"You're too pretty and young to die" 

First off I didn't know my life was more valuable because I'm "pretty" which I don't believe I am. If I was ugly does that mean I should die? 

Second, fuck my abusive parents for fucking my whole potential up .

I want to die I want to die. I'm tired of this condensed pain. I can't help anyone or even myself.
