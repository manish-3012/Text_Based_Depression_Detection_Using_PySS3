Iâ€™m finally calling it.Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was 15, Iâ€™m 21 now &amp; I think Iâ€™ve officially hit rock bottom. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to about this because I know anyone I talk to would try to stop me &amp; I get it because I would do the same for them. But I canâ€™t take this anymore. Every day I wake up wishing I hadnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve already planned on when Iâ€™m going to do it &amp; how. Writing the letters to my loved ones is going to be hard. Iâ€™m just nervous that theyâ€™re going to remember me as being selfish for taking my own life, even though I see it as it would be more selfish of them wanting me to be around when I have been feeling like this for years. Iâ€™m not looking for any feed back, I just came here to vent. Iâ€™ll probably post one more message before I actually do it &amp; update you guys on how writing the letters went. Thank you whomever for reading
