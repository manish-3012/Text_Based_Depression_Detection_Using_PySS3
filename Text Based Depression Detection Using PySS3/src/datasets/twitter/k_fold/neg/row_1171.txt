Day 3Hey guys, 

I'm surprised I'm still doing these updates, I honestly thought I would of given up after like one or two posts. This is a new achievement for me. 

First of all I just want to say thank you for all your support and concern, Ive had a lot of messages asking if I seen therapists or psychologists and yes, plenty! Tbh I think it's countless how many professionals Ive seen for my mental health. 

Anyway today was pretty unsuccessful. I didnt go to work, I slept all day and spent all day on my pc playing The Division and lying to everyone I know. I was suppose to see my ex tonight for a movie after work but I told him I was working too late and wasnt feeling up to it. Another guy from work who is obsessed with me also asked if I would see him for coffee and I ignored his message. 
Seeing people makes me so uncomfortable. 

I blocked both of them on my social media, including steam and just played games all day. 

That's it. My day was a typical day for me; ignore everyone and distract myself with games. 
I thought about death only once today and it was about how I'm going to tell my Mum. She hasnt contacted me directly (except through legal letters) in about a month so I'm sure she won't care I'm gone or already thinks i am. Eh, I might leave it alone and not tell her. 
I also need to some how work up the mental strength to go outside and simply get a note pad and pen so I can start writing my goodbye letters to those who I feel needs one. 
It's silly that I have to mentally prepare myself to be in public, I get so anxious and think everyone is staring at me or judging me. I feel so stupid. I can't even get groceries, I usually just get food delivered but it chews through my cash. 
Anyway, I said I wouldn't make this as long as I did yesterday so as always, good vibes to you all.
