I need help telling my fiance I'm suicidalI really don't want to leave them but I feel like I have to. Every second that ticks by is overwhelming and I'm trying really hard not to hurt myself. 

I don't want to go to the hospital or make it a huge deal but I need help. I want to tell my fiance but they are at work and I don't want to worry them. But they are the only person I trust. What should I say? should I just not tell them? Even if I wait until they get home, I'm afraid they'll overreact.
