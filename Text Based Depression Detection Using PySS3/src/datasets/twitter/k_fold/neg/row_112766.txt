The thoughts wonâ€™t stopThereâ€™s no day when the thought â€œI should kill myselfâ€ doesnâ€™t pop in my head. When something unpleasant happens itâ€™s the first thing I think of doing. Even when Iâ€™m not doing anything I just go deep in my thoughts and end up thinking Iâ€™m better off not being alive. 

I try to fight it, but I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t escape my own mind. 

I hurt the only person who cared enough, and I donâ€™t expect him to forgive me, as I canâ€™t even forgive myself. It made me hate myself even more than before.  

It gets worse everyday. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll survive this year. If only I have the courage to end all of this.
