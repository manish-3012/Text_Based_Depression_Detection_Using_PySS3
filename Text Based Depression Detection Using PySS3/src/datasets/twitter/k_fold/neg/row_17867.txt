I am in troubleI am thinking this year may be the year. It's time. I have never known anyone to have as much failure who has tried as hard as I have to get well. Every time something seems like it will turn the corner for me, and I put my everything into it, I'm back to square one. I'm stuck in a pattern. I feel discarded by society. If people really could understand maybe they wouldn't hate me. But maybe there's nothing to understand and the reason nothing has worked is because I'm an actual piece of shit. Like I'm just not a good person. To my core I am never going to get better because this is actually all I am. Nothing to work with. It's matter of time now. I think I finally crossed into the territory of ending it. I think people will love me unconditionally after I'm gone. They'll forget all the bad times and remember me fondly. To be liked and accepted is all I have ever wanted. The more hateful faces I see the harder it gets to be hopeful. I am genetic trash and I need to end this waste of a life once and for all.
