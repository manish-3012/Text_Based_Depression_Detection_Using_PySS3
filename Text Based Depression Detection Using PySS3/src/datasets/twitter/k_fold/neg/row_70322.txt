I wanna die todayI have this seething anger inside me that keeps telling me to kill myself. It's like pulsating rage. I just want to hurt myself violently. I get these imagines of smashing my head into the corners of a table or putting holes in walls with my head. Putting a bullet in my skull feels like the ultimate goal but I don't have guns

Thinking about it feels so good, I just want to go through with it.
