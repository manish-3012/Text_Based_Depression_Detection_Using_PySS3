the meaningless existence of lifethis is a thought I have been struggling with for a while. to be alive for a year requires the burning of fossil fuels and extraction of tons of resources from the earth. these resources good be used to keep animals that could be of value to science alive but instead are going extinct all so my dumbass can be alive who will must likely never do anything significant in my life time I will simply be an average Joe like any of the over 7 billion humans on this planet who can easily replace me when I die. In the grand scheme of things it would be more beneficial if I took a gun to my temple and pulled the trigger.  the only people who will miss me are my parents who I have little to no respect for those people who put me through hell for nothing and best of all when in dead I would never have them on my conscious. when I'm dead there will be eternal harmony I will not have to go through the pain of being alive any more and why would it matter the sun will still rise in the east and set in the west one of the 7 billion disposables will take my place. dying looks to be the best option I will no longer be a waste of space/resources and my pain will be no more and copious cycle of work,survive,sleep, and repeat will be no more.
