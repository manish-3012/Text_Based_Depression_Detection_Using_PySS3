Suicide plango ahead and laugh, go ahead and goad me into doing it. really, its totally okay. I've had so much thrown at me this year that it doesn't matter anymore how much nastyness, invalidation, indifference, disregard, etc that i deal with. sometime next year, i plan to jump from the seattle aurora bridge, taking with it all the hatred towards me from the people i've known, and turning it to unbound cheer. "Hes dead! YES!!!" is what i believe what'll be said alot. thats good. if theres at least one thing i can bring, its happiness from me dying.
