Don't read, I'm just venting.Oh my God why am I still alive, after everything I've fucking done. It was my fucking fault. Everything was my fault. It's my fault. I shouldn't have done any of that oh my God, I should die. I really should die, nobody deserves such a terrible person in their life. It's my fault. I did it, I was the one. He was right, he is right. I'm not the victim, he is. I'm a dirty attention seeker that deserves to die. I want him to beat me up and kill me and torture me because I deserve it, I'm terrible, I'm sure everyone wants me to die too. I shouldn't have. I hate myself, I want everyone to hurt me. And now I even have a fucking PTSD diagnosis because of what happened. I'm not the victim. I'm not the victim. I'm. Not. The. Victim. It's my fault, it's all my fault. I'm just pretending. Fucking attention seeking whore just die. I'm disgusting. Do whatever you want, I wish you were here to beat me up. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm a bad friend. I shouldn't have told anyone. You were right. Do anything you want. Please kill me. I'm sorry.
