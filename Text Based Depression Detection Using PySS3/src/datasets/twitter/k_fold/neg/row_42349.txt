Trying this againI want to tell my mom that i dont feel right here. Whether its depression or dissociative disorder or something. I constantly forget that i have scars on my arm from cutting. i didnt want to reveal them until now. I havent told anyone besides a close friend. Even then i just told them i cut myself. I dont FEEL anything about it. I dont know how to explain it. When i was doing it, i only felt frustrated that i wasnt bleeding enough. After, i just fell asleep. Now its just an inconvenience, the scars.

How do i explain myself?
