g*d grant me the strengthFirst of all, my title is shit. I dont even believe in God. If there is a god I dont believe in their ability to rule. They fucking suck.


I digress....I'm only here to say that I dont deserve to be here. All I do is hurt people. I wish I was brave enough to hurt MYSELF so badly that no one else would suffer because of me. 

I dont ever harm anyone physically...but I'm so jaded,  so bitter, so fucked up in the head, that anyone that gets close to be is singed from the heat of my rage. I dont even know what the fuck I'm angry at. I guess everything? I was abused as a child in every way you can imagine and I literally hate myself. I hate myself for feeling so dirty, so useless, so pathetic that I couldn't even defend myself. 
I hurt ppl. I'm. Not worth anyone's love. Ppl always leave because of me. I deserve it. All of it. 
I'm trash. I wish I was brave. I wish there was a god to grant me the strength to end myself....

Sadly..its just me. And I'm no god.
