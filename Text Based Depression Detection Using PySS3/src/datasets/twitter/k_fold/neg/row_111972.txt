I have mosaic Down Syndrome, sick of my lifeI wish I could be normal like everyone else,  well almost everyone,  but I'm not,  there isn't a single day I don't feel depressed about my condition. I've tried therapy,  different psychologists,  meds etc.  but nothing ever worked. I just don't want to look like this anymore, damn,  I'd do anything to have a normal face,  regardless of how attractive it would be, incels cry all day because they're ugly,  they don't understand they're still normal,  healthy and accepted by society.  I wish I could go out and enjoy my life. The reason why I'm alive is that I didn't want to hurt my family,  but now that my parents are dead,  I can do it and nothing is going to stop me. I don't even know why I'm writing on here,  you won't do  any magic, just like no psychologist did, I talked for hours about my problems but that was all I could do: talk,  talk and talk. I was born looking like this and I still do.
