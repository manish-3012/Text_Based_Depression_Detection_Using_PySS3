Does anyone here have work related suicidal feelings?Im not wired to live in a society that is structured this way. I cannot do the same old job everyday, from early morning to early evening, 5 days a week. Im just not wired for it. Its insane to me. Ive had plenty of jobs, im good at them im very capable, im just not consistent., which makes having a working life impossible. So I cannot survive in this society. Its embarrassing.
