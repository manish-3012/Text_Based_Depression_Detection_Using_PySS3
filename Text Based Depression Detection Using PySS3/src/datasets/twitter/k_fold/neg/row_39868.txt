I really don't know....This is an alt account, of course. 

I really do not know what to do any longer. The past year has been one of the single worst of my life (Adult and childhood). I am in my mid 30's and have been treating my bi-polar disorder since I was 15, and for most of that time I had a really hard time getting a handle on it. Things started getting a bit better about 5 years ago, with the right combination of medication, therapy, and a lovely woman, who I fell in love with and married. I have been very stable for a long time.

The past two years have seen my Father's rapid decline into Early onset Alzhemiers, my Mothers Cancer coming back (Resulting in her being on her deathbed as we speak with almost no time left.) My dreams of completing my education going up in flames, A severe car accident which left me with a really messed up back and right leg which cause me to be in pain most of the day, my financial situation going from bad to worse, my parents going through a really rough time with their money due to some really bad people taking extreme advantage of them while Mom is dying, My oldest son coming to live with us and having major issues of his own... the list goes on, and Im not trying to sound like a complainer or whiner, but I just cannot take it much longer. 

I know that there are plenty of people who have it even worse than me, and I feel guilty for feeling this stressed over my problems, but I have tried and tried to make the best of all of these situations, only to have more and more piled on me. 

I am honestly afraid that if something doesn't "break", I'm going to.

Help.
