I need someone to talk toHey People

I have been doing great at all sorts of things, school, sports, job, you name it and i have always been a kind and caring person who's always willing to help. But what  i never told anyone was the fact that my family downright despises me, no matter what i do.

Everytime i get to hear what kind of a dissapointment i am, that i'm a financial burden or worse yet, that they would be better off with me in the grave. I chose not to retaliate and just tried to ignore it but at one point, i just couldn't take it anymore.
