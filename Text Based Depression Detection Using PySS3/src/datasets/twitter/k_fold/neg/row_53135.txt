IdkIdk what to do I have felt so alone recently Iâ€™m in my second year of college have a new back problem so I lost my ability to work out and play video games all the time which was my only escape from reality and hobby. I feel extremely depressed. I honestly think the only reason I havenâ€™t killed my self yet is because of my girlfriend living with me but I feel like I canâ€™t depend on just her so I do weed to suppress my feelings and keep my depressive thoughts to my self. But doing this I feel worse and worse everyday,  went from being happy every now and then with a simple life of just being with my girlfriend and playing games and going to the gym and doing my school work to being locked up all day doing homework and talking to my girlfriend while sheâ€™s here and then when sheâ€™s not I just smoke weed and listen to music trying not to cry all the time because I feel so alone. I donâ€™t know how to even tell anyone how I feel because I donâ€™t want them to be mad at me for having a life with no tough struggles but I feel like I want to just over dose on sleeping medication every day so I wonâ€™t ever have to wake up and live this life. I feel like such a drag to everyone around me who gets close to me idk what to do I just want to end it all already.
