im so close...i just want to kill myself so badly. i started cutting a month ago and it's the only that's helped me feel better, along with starving myself. it's about control with me. im just a stupid 16 year old kid who cant do anything and probably wont ever move out of this extremely dysfunctional home.

my parents would rather chug alcohol for 8 hours a day, wasting all of our money, and just COMPLAIN about how they hate everything. because fighting + complaining is the only way they know how to cope with their deeply repressed trauma.

my dad makes $130,000 a year but we still never have food in the house. the food I make is all just stuff i happened to find in the pantry so like. why not starve myself at this point.

im so lonely, ever since i started online school after some pretty bad teachers ruined my school life ive been so alone. i never go outside. its come to the point that im excited to go to the grocery store every 3 weeks for an hour just so i can leave the house.

my plan was to kill myself on january 18th but im not sure i can hold on, i wanted time to sell some of my valuable stuff so I can at least leave my brothers with something but i dont think that's happening.
