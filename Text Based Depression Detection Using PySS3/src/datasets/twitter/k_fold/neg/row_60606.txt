Tired and sadIâ€™m tired and sad of my life. Iâ€™ve been depressed since age 11. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide since a very young age. Iâ€™m not sure how to cope with this but year after year itâ€™s gotten worse and worse.
Iâ€™m not sure if it was the way I was raised or if itâ€™s just me but Iâ€™m so alone. Iâ€™m scared and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore and the pain hurts and Iâ€™d like for it to go away. Itâ€™s like a knife stabbing into my stomach it hurts so much.

Iâ€™m thinking about hanging myself soon or slitting my throat open. Maybe even a drug overdose. Iâ€™m ready to die. I canâ€™t wait!
