The stress is too muchi feel like everything is out of my control. i need a life line. tonight is only the second time iâ€™ve seriously considered it, not just a fleeting thought or impulse. i have the pills, iâ€™ve researched the effects and dosage needed. i canâ€™t bring myself to do it. not sure that thereâ€™s a real purpose for posting this, just didnâ€™t want to feel so alone anymore.
