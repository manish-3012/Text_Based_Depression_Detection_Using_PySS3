I need helpMy abusive ex who I was stupidly on and off with for the past 4 years succeeded in getting me fired today. I feel so defeated right now. Work was one of the last things I have left and I feel like this just pushed me to the edge. I'm so close to just ending things tonight and I don't know what to do.
