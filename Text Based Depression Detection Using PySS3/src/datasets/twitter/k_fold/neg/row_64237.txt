Iâ€™m an ugly failed tranny and I need to dieI mean why does it matter so much anyway?  Maybe death is nice.  Everyone always wants to scare me away from death or guilt me with the â€œbut think about your parentsâ€ kind of crap but maybe itâ€™s not so bad.  

Thereâ€™s just nothing for me in life.  Iâ€™ve given transition about 3 years and I still look like a man, still canâ€™t afford any surgeries or anything other than hormones, Iâ€™m 32, I make little money and it was a huge struggle just to get that much, i canâ€™t seem to lose weight no matter what I do, I donâ€™t pass and am ugly as fuck with no sense of fashion or energy for make up that wonâ€™t matter in the end anyway....

Thereâ€™s just nothing going on for me in life.  Thereâ€™s no point in dealing with it.  I donâ€™t enjoy life.  Itâ€™s just a bunch of heartache and chores.  Iâ€™m sick of having nightmares every night and waking up crying every morning.  Iâ€™m sick of being an ugly monster.  Iâ€™m sick of being made to be embarrassed about myself any time someone looks at me or I go out in public and get laughed at and made fun of.

And letâ€™s be real - if I donâ€™t die today or whatever and live the rest of my life hereâ€™s all that will happen: Iâ€™ll get older and die anyway either from some jerk out tranny bashing, from cancer, or from old age.  Iâ€™ll get more and more poor and wonâ€™t be able to take care of myself at all.  Iâ€™ll be completely alone as whatâ€™s left of my family dies eventually and Iâ€™ll have no family of my own to love or spend time with or create a new generation of. 

I donâ€™t want to go through the rest of my life as an ugly aging alone man-beast in a dress monster just to die alone and poor anyway.

So yeah, I think Iâ€™m gonna do it.  Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time thinking about it.  Figured Iâ€™d give transition a try because dysphoria has always been rough for me and thought that I should at least give r a try if I was gonna die anyway.

But experiment failed.  I look nothing like a woman and Iâ€™ll never be accepted as one.  Every time I see myself in the mirror I want to kill myself.

So fuck this cruel joke of a life.  Life has seemingly gone out of its way to be the polar opposite of anything good that Iâ€™ve ever wanted or worked for - so why keep fighting a losing battle?  I gave it a good solid 32 years.  Thatâ€™s plenty.
