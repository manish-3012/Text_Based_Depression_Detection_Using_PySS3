I want to die but suicide scares me.Thus is a cross post from /r/depression because I don't think anyone even saw it there.. 

Recently I've been thinking more and more about wanting to die. When I'm not keeping myself busy it's constantly on my mind. I've thought about writing a letter and killing myself but the thought of it scared me. The closest I got was taking razorblades from the bathroom and staring at them, and pussying out when I thought about cutting my skin and the thought of anyone having to see me dead.


Fantasised for long time about dying of natural causes, but at the same time I've quit smoking and started eating significantly better, along with avoiding doctors visits despite my chest/breathing noticeably declining. I'm not sure if I'd call an ambulance if I couldn't breathe or thought I was going to die.
