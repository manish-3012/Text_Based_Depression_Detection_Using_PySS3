Feeling completely worthless, covering deathI am 19, on medication for OCD, which I have been battling for eight months, and have found success with medication for a few weeks. Now that I am back to â€˜normal,â€™ in a sense, my extremely low self esteem and perceived value of self, which is low, came back. OCD made me hate every fiber of my being more than I already have before, due to my lack of intelligence and a absence of any skills. I cannot find joy in anything that I do anymore. Hobbies started to feel like chores again, I feel like such a disappointment to my family most of the time, and I wish I had the courage to end it, and the indifference to my friends and family. I want to be in peace, I have no purpose here, no right to live, yet my friends and family want me to stay around. I am usually trusted by friends with things going on in their lives, but I am not a reliable person. I cannot offer any intelligent advice, have extreme difficulty understanding to some degree, and struggle to make my friends comfortable. I have no idea why someone would trust me or want to talk to me in spite of being such a terrible, unreliable friend. I did not ask for such a responsibility, so why me when there are tons of qualified others out there? I just wish no one cared about me so I could go in peace, I feel so uncomfortable with myself, I loathe myself, I have no idea as to who I am, or why I am here.
