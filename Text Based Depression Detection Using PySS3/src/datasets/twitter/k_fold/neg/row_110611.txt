DUI and I want to dieNot looking for pity, just need to get this outta my system.  I got a DUI last night, and before anyone chews me out for it, I know. It sucks. I wasnâ€™t the one driving but the driver has too many offenses so we switched places since this would be my first offense and I would get an easier sentence. I slept on a cold slab which I know I deserve and had to get bailed out with my last 100 bucks. 

I know Iâ€™ll be fine, logically. I know Iâ€™ll make it through this from seeing everyone else do it. But Iâ€™m terrified that the this is the last straw for people in my life. Iâ€™ve been in the hospital for suicide attempts a lot this year, and every time I fuck up, people put more distance between us. 
Through all my failures, I just donâ€™t know how many times I can keep disappointing people or just proving them right about who I am. 

I want to kill myself. I want to go back to cutting the shit out of myself. I want to feel pain, because Iâ€™m so numb. I want this to be over with. I canâ€™t fail again, because I canâ€™t be that person who just canâ€™t fucking get it right. And I donâ€™t want to be the attention whore I seem to be because I keep failing. Every fail just makes people think more and more that Iâ€™m just trying for attention. My anxiety and depression are having a dumb ass battle with each other. I just wish I could run away and forget about all this shit, but the only way I can ever get past it is by killing myself.
