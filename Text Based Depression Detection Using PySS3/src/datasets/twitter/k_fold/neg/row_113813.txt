We live in a cruel new world, everyone wants to take everything from you, then you become a slave.. it isnâ€™t worth going on.For anyone half educated, we now live a new existence where the world unfortunately does not care about you as an individual, they simply see a dollar sign, once they rape this part of you they will kill you anyway.. this new life today simply isnâ€™t worth existence, I have a plan and I will take action on it, my own demise will hopefully teach the world this is not the way humans can exist in it, I plan my suicide soon.
