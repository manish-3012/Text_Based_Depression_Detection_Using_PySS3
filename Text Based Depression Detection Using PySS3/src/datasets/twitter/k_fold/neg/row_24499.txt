DrivingI want to be so reckless. I feel nothing unless I'm doing something bad. 
Driving home from work and my brain is  screaming  at me to NOT drive into the person in front of me. To not drive off the side of the road. To not do it. "Stop stop stop" it goes. "Don't don't don't don't fuck fuck fuck". 

Why can't I just let go alreadyyyyyyyyyyyy
