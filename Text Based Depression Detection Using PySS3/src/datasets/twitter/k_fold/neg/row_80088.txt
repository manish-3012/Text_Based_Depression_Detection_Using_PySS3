I was pretty patheticI don't know what to say, just that I wanted to leave some sort of mark here. I'm mostly pressured because in doing horrible in school. I'm very sorry for my teachers because I trouble them alot with many absences and late turn ins and no turn ins at all. I was a shitty person. I responded with spite or some sort of negative emotion when others spoke to me. I tried changing but it was kind of hopeless. Sorry bro, sorry other bro, sorry mom. I've already made a note on my desk. I'll never know if everyone I wrote to will see it. Hopefully I wouldn't live to find out. I'm sorry. I don't want a funeral. It's too expensive. It's be just fine if people could come to my room or something. I don't want to take up more money after I'm dead. I don't want to be any more useless after I'm dead. Sell all my shit or use it. Now mom can sleep in my room.

Thanks for the amount of years you've given me. Sorry. I'm also sorry for the dirty body. You'll have to put up with it I guess.

Edit: chickened out, had to go to school. I was running out of time and thought if I had to go anyways, I'd rather go without wearing a scarf or somethin'
