Whatâ€™s even the point?Society is so fucked. Go to College they say. Slave away for 4 years paying ridiculous prices to get a job and pay off the debts. That is, if you can even find one. And whatâ€™s it all for? Weâ€™re all gonna be dead one day and it would all be for nothing. I want to just end it all early and not even fucking bother with all the stress and bullshit.
