Everyday I want to dieHi, I don't really know how reddit posts work but whatevs. Things that are about/make me want to kill myself:
- There is not a single moment when I don't want to die ( be it happy or sad)
-I don't understand why you can't decide for yourself if you just want to die already
-I hate my whole existence
-I hate my body ( in the "it's fucking ugly" sense and the "i hate feeling/touching smth" way)
-I wish my parents never met
-I wish they lived her life
-I can't get out of the house
-Everything is my fault but it feels like I don't want to fix anything
-I'm 21, but I feel old and I'm scared or getting older
-Old people are disgusting
-I couldn't bear seeing myself even older
-After 30 life is over
-I'm exhausted, it's like every part of my skin is flawed
-I can't sleep, my mind keeps telling me some monster is there
-I have to touch every single fucking thing 3 to 11 times
I may sound like a whiny bitch and I may be one, but I really want to die fast and painlessly somehow. I may add things later if I'm still around.
If you don't like the post, delete it. Idk if you can do that though?
