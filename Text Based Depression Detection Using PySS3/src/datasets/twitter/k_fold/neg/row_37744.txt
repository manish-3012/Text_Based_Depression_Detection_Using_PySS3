Not because I'm sadI don't know if I'm in the right place, but I've been looking for just an outsider's opinion I guess. I have turned to a friend and was met with what can only be described as the most stupid response to a suicidal person: "If you killed yourself by dildo, you'd be a legend."

I want to plan the way I die. I'm not sad right now, and I'm not saying this'll happen tomorrow, this week, or this month. I just feel so sure one day I'll take my life. I don't want it to be the only choice, but my choice. While the goings good and the tide is high, I want to leave the party early for once.

Living isn't something I enjoy in general. I've had such a great life: I've seen 30 countries, met truly wonderful people. I can truly say my time here has been okay. And that's how I want it to be. The falling apart is impending, the great is at an impasse. The good will always exist if you look for it.

But my suicidal tendencies are going to catch up with me. Depression has loomed overhead for so long it's become a constant fixture. So instead, I'd like to meet them halfway.

If I give up my trip to Thailand, I can start the proceedings. 20 pills; 2 liters of alcohol. I do realize I'm romanticizing it all, but that's what I want of it: romance. Beauty in the terror cycle. I'm not rushing into anything in hysterics; rather I want to float into it and be enveloped by the law of the universe.

Do I make sense?
Has anyone else felt this specific way?

I apologize if I've inconvenienced anyone or if this was the wrong place to put this.
