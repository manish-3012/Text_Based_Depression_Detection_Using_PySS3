I don't see any way outI don't really want to die. I just want to stop feeling so tormented every day, and I don't see any other solution. I've had anxiety for several years, and it eats me alive. All day, every day I feel like I'm being tortured by all the 'what ifs'. I'm paralysed from doing anything. I feel like all my friends secretly hate me. I think my partner is going to leave me. I think I'm a burden on my family and they'd be better off without me. I'm afraid of getting cancer. My house catching on fire. I'm terrified I've made mistakes at work.

I am in my final year of university and also run a small website development business. Recently I took on a big project for a friend of mine which I KNEW was too big for me, but out of sheer arrogance and desperation for money I took it on. I'm now supposed to be delivering it and I know there are issues that I don't even know if I can fix.

I only have like 4 friends and this is someone I respect so greatly. I know I can't deliver the project knowing there are issues, that would be wrong. But I'm going to let him down and it makes me feel sick. The other option is delivering it but I am so scared that it will get hacked and I will get the blame and be sued. I've worked so hard on this fucking website, put everything else to the side, and I've still failed.

I study law, and it has ruined my life. Everything I ever want to do, I just see potential liability. I am afraid to try anything because I am just so afraid of NEGLIGENCE. 

Nothing makes me happy anymore. I feel like life is a cruel game where we're all controlled by money. Honestly, I don't see how I can get through this. I just want to go away and have peace.
