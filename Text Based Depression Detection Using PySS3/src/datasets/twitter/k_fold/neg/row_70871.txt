â€œBecause your friends and family would miss youâ€ is not a good reason to keep living.They wouldnâ€™t even notice Iâ€™m gone until weeks later. Everyone thinks I donâ€™t like to be bothered anyway, If I disappeared everyone would just think Iâ€™m still asleep in my room.


My life has no significance to begin with. Everyone just keeps me around because of my AGAB, thatâ€™s the only reason. 


I noticed I donâ€™t have dreams anymore of the future like I used to. Itâ€™s probably because Iâ€™m gonna die soon. I know Iâ€™m going to die soon, I have no reason to live past 18 anyway. This is my existence.
