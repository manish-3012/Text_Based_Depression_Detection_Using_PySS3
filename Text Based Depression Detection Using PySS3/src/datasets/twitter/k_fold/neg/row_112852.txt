HelloI don't know why I am doing this nor do I expect anything. I guess I just want to share it. *sigh*

I am just sitting here from day to another one. I am so exhausted that all actions in my life come from others. I have gone through a lot work to reach this point where I can let others some what help me and that I can some what be myself.

Despite all of that I feel like it is too late. I can see answers shining in horizon and all I would need to do is to work and trust and hope, but I just can't anymore. All advancements in my life have happened due others and I can't just be burden for others not the amount of time it is required to set things right.

Now I am just doing nothing and fighting the though of death. Every passing day it sounds just so much more sweeter and I have been majorly living for others last 8-5 years. The excuse that you will hurt others is losing its meaning rapidly.

The finish line is shining, but I have nothing left to reach it and can even barely stand still. To be honest I don-t even want to finish it. I just want to rest and not feel awful and pain all the time. I am open to any dialog.
