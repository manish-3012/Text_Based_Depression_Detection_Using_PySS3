I donâ€™t want to give up my depression and suicidal ideation because it keeps me from being anxious.No matter how depressed and suicidal I become it is always easier for me to deal with my depression than my anxiety. Because when Iâ€™m anxious I become a different person. I get so irrational and delusional that I get really close to losing my mind every time. That isnâ€™t an exaggeration. My depression makes me feel like shit but at the same time the feeling paradoxically makes me happy. Something about depression just feels so warm. Itâ€™s like home. Maybe itâ€™s just the feeling that if life does end up being a total dumpster fire I still have a backup plan. I know thatâ€™s not healthy but itâ€™s still better than the panic attacks.
