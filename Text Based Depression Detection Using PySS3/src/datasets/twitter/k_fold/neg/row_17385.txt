Reading and writing tonight....The thoughts and ideas. Possibly my imagination is running a little wild. Regardless, I'm feeling really slimey. Sick to my stomach realizing that my narcissist religious crackpot, ex husband was/is a closet bisexual.

That my lil sis, same! A closet narcissist and bisexual minus the religion. Fuck she didn't need it though. Lil sis had my Ex to do that talking for her.

So now! Dozen years later, with all the mumbo jumbo, gender switching, hocus pocus, stage show drama, who lies best wins bullshit....the whole lot of y'all are probably narcissist closet bisexuals too!! Teaming up to tag team any person they can. Even family!!

GAWD!! DAMN!!
