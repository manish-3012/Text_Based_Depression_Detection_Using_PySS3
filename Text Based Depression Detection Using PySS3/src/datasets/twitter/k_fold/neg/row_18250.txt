A student died at my university, but it should have been me. I'm horrible and can't even deal with my idiotic first-world problemsI just found out I did horribly on my GRE subject test I spent months studying for, feel completely horrible about myself and terrified about getting in to graduate school. Taking the GRE and application fees are a huge expense for me and I'm scared about paying off my student debt. I've felt worthless and been suicidal multiple times during college but I always tell myself my problems don't matter (because, let's face it, they don't in the grand scheme of things and I'm in the first world.) This January a very well-liked student died in a bus accident and all I can think about is how it should have been me. She had so many friends and people were completely devastated when she died. She was a wonderful person and all I have going for me is that I'm "good at physics," but apparently I'm not because I can't even do the GRE right. I posted on /r/depression and the commenter told me to just "stop caring about what other people think" and to just "find some motivation" and basically told me that I don't have real problems.

I mean I should probably just fucking kill myself, I can't do anything right and I have no friends and I can't even deal with the easy problems I do have.
