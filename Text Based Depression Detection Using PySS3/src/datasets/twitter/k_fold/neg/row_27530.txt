Meaningless universeI'm not quite suicidal, though I've thought about it several times. I created this throwaway account to hide my identity. Anyway, I basically just find life completely meaningless.  We're just living organic tissue, natural processes combined in a particular way with a particular form.  Most of us won't be remembered for very long after we die--even the most famous people are eventually forgotten or only remembered by a few academic types.  And of course in time the world will end anyway--probably sooner than later, though at the latest in 5 billion years when the sun expands. So it will be as if we never even existed, any of us, ever. Just a bunch of cold space and mindless matter going through the dull clockwork over and over again.

Now I have a friend who is on the verge of suicide. And here's the worst part--and which contributes to my own thoughts of suicide: I can't get myself to care about him or his life that much. I find myself somewhat indifferent, though rationally I know that I should care and should be doing all I can to prevent his suicide. My attitude, strange enough, is that if he wants to do it he should.  I know that's wrong, rationally, but the emotional attachment to him or to anyone else is either not there at all or is there only in small amounts. So I am an empty shell of a human, living an empty meaningless life in an essentially meaningless futile universe.  Why not just kill myself? And let others do the same?

Now like I said earlier, I'm not totally on the verge of suicide myself. Because I don't know if I have the guts to do it. Plus, in my view now, living is just as meaningless as suicide, so why not just live? At least for now.
