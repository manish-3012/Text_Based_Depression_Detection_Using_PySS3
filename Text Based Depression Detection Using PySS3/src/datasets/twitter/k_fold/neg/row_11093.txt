Sigh...Every now and then I suddenly feel the urge to kill myself. I don't know if it's become a habit where my thoughts automatically jump to it... Deep down inside, I feel like I'll never do it and wish I could find the 'courage' to just go. 

I feel like... No one can help me because I myself don't know what's wrong or why I suddenly feel this way. I suspect a combination of many factors which no one can confirm for me. 

It feels worse that my reasons for being sad are not justified. Maybe I'm just... Looking for attention? 

I wish I didn't exist... Everyone's life would be so much better... I promised I wouldn't do anything 'silly'... But today I feel so close...
