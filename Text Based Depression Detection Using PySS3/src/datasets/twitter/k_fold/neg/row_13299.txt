What's so wrong with wanting to die?The title pretty much says it all. I am unconvinced that the world would be worse off without me in it and so why is it such a problem that I want to die instead of prolonging my existence? My urge to kill myself is never going away, so why not just get it over with instead of waiting and then doing it at a later date?
