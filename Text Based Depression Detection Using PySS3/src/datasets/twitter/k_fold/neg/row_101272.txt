So I'm sitting here in my car with everything I need to kill myselfI'm in a bad living situation I can't get out of. I'm flat fucking broke because of it, too. Have few friends, none particularly close. Debilitating depression and social anxiety. Parents know I'm suicidal, I think they care but they're shit at showing it ("Just tough it out" "Don't be dramatic" followed by "I was trying to help but I guess you don't want that" when I said that's not a great thing to say to someone in crisis). Honestly the dramatic thing really shoved me from suicidal ideation to "okay well I guess I have to actually kill myself for my mental health problems to be valid in their eyes."

Wish I could get some weed and dinner first, but there's not much point.

I used to work in mental health. Mandatory reporters have to report someone with a plan and the means to carry out suicide. That's me right now. Kind of weird to realize that.

I hope someone takes care of my cat. He's the main reason I made it this far.

So what's everyone else up to tonight?
