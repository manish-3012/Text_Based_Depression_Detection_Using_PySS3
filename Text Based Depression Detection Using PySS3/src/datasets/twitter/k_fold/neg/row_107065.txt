I'm planning on ODing soon.Iâ€™m planning to OD some pills soon. but thereâ€™s something lingering in my mind. Iâ€™m not scared of dying itself. I'm scared of the afterlife. See, I was raised, Christian. I used to believe in God, however, I'm now Agnostic. Itâ€™s just that, the idea of Hell was hammered into my mind by my family and even though thereâ€™s a chance it doesnâ€™t exist, I'm scared I'll go there when I die. I'm scared I'll suffer there for eternity. but since I'm taking the cowards way out, I deserve to go there, right? 

It doesnâ€™t really matter, right? Iâ€™m a monster, and monsters deserve to go to Hell, donâ€™t they? 

Sorry if I didn't make much sense, I'm just really tired right now.
