I am sad and lonelyI really don't know how I came up to be like this. I was a really happy kid with real dreams and goals. But now it's like everything has fallen apart. You know sometimes you just wish to escape from this world. I have disappointed the only people who love me i.e. my parents by not being good in my academic career. I look like fucking Jabba the Hutt with all that extra weight and my skin tone is dark. I can't even talk to people because I ve been ignored by most of them. Recently I tried talking to a guy I had a crush on by dming him on insta and it took me real huge guts to say thank you to him for something he did. But the moment I saw him face to face he ignored me. It was like he was disgusted with me. Experiences like this make me wonder am I so fucking ugly that no one wants to talk to me? My insecurities has had a huge impact on my self esteem and confidence. Sometimes I just feel like killing myself and disappearing from this world. But I can't let my parents go through all this because of me. I can't break them like that. I want to die but I can't.
