I'm gonna kill myself soon.This post will probably be taken down. I've tried posting about my depression else where asking for help and nobody responds ever. I've actually been downvoted for asking for help. But I just cant do it anymore. I hurt people. I don't want to but I can never do anything right. I can't love right. I can't be a good friend. And now I have this monster headache because I can't sleep right. I just want it all to go away. And no this isn't me asking for help. I've tried that before and it didn't work. This is me saying what I feel. It might help someone. Eventually. Probably not. But there's a chance. Idk when I'll do it but soon. I can't think anymore. I feel weak. Idk what happened. I just want to feel normal again.
