Friend basically told me to kmsMade a promise with my last attempt in December that I wouldnâ€™t let my mental health get that bad again. Itâ€™s not now, but itâ€™s... definitely not good. 
Lost the job said friends dad got me because of my going blind in my right eye makes me scared to drive. Canâ€™t drive to work. Told me that I promised I wouldnâ€™t let it get this bad again, and to stop making promises I canâ€™t keep.

Little does she know I would do it in a heartbeat if my brothers wedding wasnâ€™t Saturday. 
I might just do it afterwards though. I hope I just have a heart attack or something natural takes me, so my family doesnâ€™t have to deal with me anymore once Iâ€™m gone.
