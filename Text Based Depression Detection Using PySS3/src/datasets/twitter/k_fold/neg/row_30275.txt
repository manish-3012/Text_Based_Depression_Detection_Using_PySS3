Killing Myself is my Only Option.I don't feel good anymore. I want to do nothing but die. I quit grad school. I don't want a future. I want to die. I'm killing myself one day while my parents go to work. I've got a plan. It'll be over soon.

I don't care if anyone will miss me. You'll feel bad if I leave. I'll feel worse if I stay. Don't tell me it can only get better if I stay alive. I don't want it to get better. I want to die.

I sit around and do nothing. I can't do anything anymore. My guitars are all rusting. I haven't written anything in months. I don't want to touch anything. I sit around all day and count my mistakes. 

My ex wants nothing to do with me. Neither does her mom. I don't blame them. I hope she can forgive me or at least forget me. I mean she's already with someone so she's doing fine.


I'm in treatment. I have depression (surprise) but in all honesty I don't care anymore. Even when I feel happy I think about killing myself. I don't want to take my meds anymore or talk to my doctor. I want to die. I see no reason.


I've tried killing myself a few times but that was more just getting used to the thought. I'm ready to try something more drastic. Something painless. Something permanent. It'll be like sleeping. But forever. If I could sleep more I wouldn't kill myself. The sleeping feel no pain.

Goodbye. You're a better person than I ever will be.
