If Accutane doesn't work I'll kill myselfAbout a year ago, I'd say I was relatively happy. I'm a depressive, so I'm never THAT happy, but I had a good future ahead of me. And then \- my face broke out really randomly in acne, like completely all\-over\-my\-face terrible. No one can tell me what caused it. I'm 19, so this is totally out of the blue. This resulted in a hospital stay, me taking time off from college, a break up \- and now I will be stuck with my parents doing nothing the whole summer. I'm taking Accutane and praying that will clear it, but I can't shake the feeling that this has completely ruined any romantic prospects for me. If Accutane doesn't work, I really think I'm going to kill myself. I can't take this humiliation.
