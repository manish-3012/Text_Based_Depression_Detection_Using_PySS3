I have no future, better off dead. Truly truly truly...I've been chronically unemployed for many years. I've never had a job. I did volunteering for a few months, but I had to leave because I was experiencing ongoing domestic violence. The majority of my life has consisted of the poorest excuse for a father ever!

I dislike going outside very much, people are always judging the unemployed. A shame, because I certainly don't judge them. When I say judging, I'm saying that I get looked down upon like dirt. 

The manager at my volunteering place was very cold and rude + a racist. I have no friends. My resume looks like shit. I've managed to land interviews, despite having zero references. I never get past the interview stage. My answers must be so stupid. I can feel employers laughing at my resume and laughing at me if they see me. 

I'm too broke and poor to study anything, and maybe that won't lead to a job either. I live in a small, really boring country town with nothing to do.

My life is over and there is zero hope for me can we please appreciate that some people aren't cut out for this sad world?
