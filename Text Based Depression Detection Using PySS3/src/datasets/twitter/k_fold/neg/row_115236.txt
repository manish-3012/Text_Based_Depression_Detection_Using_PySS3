Fuck MondaysGod. It never stops does it? 
We really do spend our entire lives working to get meaningless pieces of paper or a digital number in our bank accounts so we can pay to live on this earth that we didnâ€™t even have a choice to be on. 

I spend more waking hours at work than I do at home and Iâ€™m just supposed to be okay with that? Grateful for that? Itâ€™s bullshit. Iâ€™m tired. 

When Iâ€™m home, all my time is spent catering to my work schedule. Gotta go to sleep early, because I have work. Got to get up early so I can spend an hour getting ready for work. Cant spend too much money on the weekends because I need it for gas to get to work.  Wash my hair and braid it for work. Make my lunches for work. Prepare the house on Sunday for another work week. 

And you canâ€™t quit! Society isnâ€™t made so you can survive off of a healthy amount of work. No. You have to be there 8.5 hours a day 5 days a week. Or else you canâ€™t afford a place to sleep at night that you barely get to see because youâ€™re at work all the time. You canâ€™t afford a phone to keep connected with the digital world. You canâ€™t do anything without money. God forbid you get sick or hurt. No one is going to help you without money. 

Itâ€™s a bullshit system. 

Iâ€™m tired.
