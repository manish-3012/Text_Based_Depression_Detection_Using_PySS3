Done.My father hates me. My mother is sickly. My relatives are controlling. I feel like I dont have any friends. 

I dont blame them. I'm a shitty person. I deserve everything that's coming my way. 

I'm too scared to die but I want everything to end. I know nothing good's going to come my way anyway. It's always been that way.
