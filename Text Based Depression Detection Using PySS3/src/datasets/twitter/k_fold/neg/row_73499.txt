I don't know where my life is going at this point (14/M)Just got out of an extremely emotionally abusive relationship. I thought that would be a freeing experience but now I'm just worried about the mental state of my ex.
The bigger issue is that I hung onto that relationship for so long that I lost sight of myself and I don't know who I am anymore and where the old me went. I feel my life is never going to get anywhere and that I'm a lost and empty soul. I don't know what to do. I just need answers.
EDIT: Just to be clear, my ex was the abusive one in the relationship
