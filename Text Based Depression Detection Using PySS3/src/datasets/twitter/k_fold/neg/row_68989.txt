5 years of life together. Over. She took everything and the dog. Iâ€™m lost.So 5and a Half year living together with my ex. Me mid 30 M.   I opened up about being depressed. 
She took everything of hers while I was at work and ghosted me.   Took our dog too. 
Itâ€™s been a month. Iâ€™m on some SSRI for about a month. 
I guess Iâ€™m trying to talk to anyone honest.
