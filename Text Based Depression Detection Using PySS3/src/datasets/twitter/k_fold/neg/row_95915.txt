Friend arranging to acquire gun, has already taken prior forms of intent as well.Hi Folks,

Tell me I am not crazy to be freaking out about a friend. (I assure you this is not me, veiled.)

(First off: Friend is safe at the moment, for the night. Also, I hope this is the right subreddit â€“ seems as close as possible.)

_Details:_

- Friend is a long-term alcoholic.
- Friend got seriously drunk and swallowed pills 1-2 months ago.
- Friend got seriously drunk (again) and swallowed pills last week. 0.4 BAC.
- Friend has spoken of getting a gun.
- Psychiatrist spoke to friend while I was there and he was concerned that friend may need to be held against friend's will. From what I contributed (as friend allowed me there during talk) suicidal thoughts were only when friend is drunk.

_Today:_

- Friend tried to withdraw a few hundred dollars at an ATM. (no dice - too large funds request.)
- I found texts on friend's phone where friend was trying to arrange gun purchase.
- Did not work out today.
- Meet-up looks scheduled for tomorrow.
- I know the location as planned for moment

I feel like this friend has gone too far with these actions. This friend has a good job, but nearly lost it and is now overwhelmed, which is not helping. Nearly losing place to live. This is just way, way too close to possible now. What further confirmation am I seeking here?

Anyone just give me some input.
