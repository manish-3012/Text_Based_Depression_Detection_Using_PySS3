I don't know what to do.Im 16 and i dont know what to do, I am suicidal. But i dont know if i want to wait until i head off to a different country for university or just take my life in the next year. 

Even though my parents dont accept me as a gay person and try to change every part of me, i still dont want to leave them in a situation like that and i dont want to have a religious funeral either. On the other hand I can kill myself while im here and just be done with it already. They dont like me either way so why does it matter. 

I have some close friends but im sure they will forget about me after a month or two. 

I dont want to die, but i cant do anything either. My grades are terrible and i lost all hope for a succesful life. I had dreams but they seem so unlikely i just accepted that im a pile of rubbish.
