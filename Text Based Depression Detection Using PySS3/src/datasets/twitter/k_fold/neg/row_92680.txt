I can't stop thinking about itI don't have many friends (really only 2 kinda) at college and girls haven't liked me since high school. I was thinking of doing it all day and I couldn't get it out of my head for a while now, and I'm just so angry all the time. I hate my classes, I hate how girls who act interested in me then aren't and my friend called me fat so I'm here now, I'm not in danger but I took 2 shots of rum on a weeknight and feel like a loser. If I'm a virgin at 19 I'll be one forever most likely, and not having friends just makes life not worth it, not that I'll kill myself but I'll probably start self destructing in terms of substances etc now
