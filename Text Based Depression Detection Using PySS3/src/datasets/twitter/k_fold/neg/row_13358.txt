Worst big 5 combination. Help.Hi,

My big 5 factor tests show the following scores.

O,C,E,A: very low, percentile close to 1

N: very high, percentile close to 100

Does this mean I am doomed? Have I lost the genetic lottery? Is it worth to even live? I do not see a way out. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
