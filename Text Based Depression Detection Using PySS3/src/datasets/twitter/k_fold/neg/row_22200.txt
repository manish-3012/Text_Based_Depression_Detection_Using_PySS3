I canâ€™t tap dance anymore Iâ€™m tired and my feet are broken.I (blackf20) live in an all white community with my white family. Day in and day out all I see is white people. I interact solely with old white people who constantly use microagressions or just are blatantly racist or ignorant. Iâ€™m financially confined to this life for at least another year. I canâ€™t stand it. Iâ€™m alone. The only true communication I have is with my friends on FaceTime and itâ€™s not often. Other than that Iâ€™m completely alone in my own world inside my head and itâ€™s killing me. Iv been living like this for 3 years. At points it was getting better and I even got a special anthropologist therapist to help me cope with this predicament and things were good but recently Iv started relapsing into serious suicidal thoughts. This time is different. I see it as my only option. No one understands me or what Iâ€™m going through. No one really understands how mentally straining this is. I canâ€™t smile anymore and Iâ€™m having daily panic attacks whenever Iâ€™m in public spaces. No one around here seems to understand how much race matters and how different the world I live in isâ€”how differently Iâ€™m treated. Im at a breaking point. My only option is to end my life. Even if I move I feel like Iâ€™ll be too fucked up to form healthy relationships with anyone. I feel like a burden and I just want to end it all. I think Iâ€™ll be ok for a few days and Iâ€™m hoping I can pull the mask back on but who knows. Iv never had so much intent to actually kill myself if things donâ€™t get better.
