Alone and suicidal     I've been suicidal and dealing with a variety of mental health issues since I was 15. Five years later I'm no better, maybe even worse. I have treatment resistant depression, I've tried 20+ different medications. None helped, most had horrible side effects, some even made my mental health worse. My body is covered in self harm scars, I can barely resist the constant urge to start cutting again. 

     I moved states recently to escape. The town I lived in was really small and I went through some heavy trauma there. Everyone knew everyone and I had no way to escape all the toxicity and horrible people. I have no friends here, it's just me and my uncle. I'm still so so depressed. I even had electroshock therapy done and I still haven't gotten better. People say it gets better, but not for me. Medical treatment, therapy, nothing ever changes. 

     I am miserable. Alone. Suicidal. Depressed. Anxious. I have OCD, PTSD, insomnia, vicious nightmares when I do sleep, I can barely maintain basic hygiene, much less get better. I drink way too much cause at least that numbs the pain somewhat. I've made more suicide attempts than I can remember after memory loss due to some of my treatments. Nothing ever works. Without a gun to the head I'm stuck being alive. I hate it. I hate existing. I lost everything back in April and after my years of mental health issues I'm done fighting.
