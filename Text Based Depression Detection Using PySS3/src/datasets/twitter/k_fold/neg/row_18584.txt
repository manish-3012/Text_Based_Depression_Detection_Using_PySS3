S.O.SI'm am gonna be honest and blunt. I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since about freshman year of college and now I am a Senior. There are a lot of issues I have been dealing with. The past few years with the dances I have always wanted to go. But my best friend never wanted to and I've always felt bad so I never went. Since this was my senior year I really wanted to go. And I kept asking him if he wanted to go and he kept saying no. He knew how much it would have ment to me and how depressed I was that I could not go. He said he will help me feel better and we will do something for tonight. Later that day he gets asked by a girl he likes (girl ask guy dance) and said yes. I really felt hurt and betrayed. I decided to go and I asked him if he could at least drive me and he said no. So I had to ask on of my other friends and I showed up to the dance with 30 minutes left. I just wanna kill my self. I feel so hirt and betrayed.
