I need help but dont know how or where to look.Iâ€™ve been suicidal before, and Iâ€™ve been very close to doing it before too. No actual attempts though.

But now more than ever, I feel like Iâ€™m just so done with everything. Iâ€™m worn out and dont even feel alive or human anymore. Iâ€™m just so tired of living. 

One of my biggest issues that effects me every single day of my life is that Iâ€™m extremely insecure. It makes me paranoid and almost delusional. I recognize this and understand that what I feel may not actually be real but I canâ€™t help feeling it and it becomes a reality in my mind. These insecurities make relationships hard. 
My last relationship was my first and only, because my issues are too much to handle. I canâ€™t trust, I canâ€™t believe them, and I canâ€™t open up to them. Iâ€™ve been hurt while emotionally vulnerable and I never forgave. 
 I know I need professional help but I donâ€™t have money for that. Itâ€™s a damn shame that I donâ€™t make enough money to help keep myself alive. 

Whatâ€™s worse is I have no one to talk to, as there arenâ€™t many people out there who would understand, I donâ€™t have many friends who would understand, and I have a very judgmental family who would only make fun of me for being  both insecure and suicidal.

I donâ€™t know what to do. I doubt the suicide helpline will offer anything useful. If you know anything that might help, let me know.
