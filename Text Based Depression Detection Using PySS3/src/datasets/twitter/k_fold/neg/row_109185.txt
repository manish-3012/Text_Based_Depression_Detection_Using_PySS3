I havent felt this bad in a long time I made this account because i was googling how to overdose on my meds and i found this thread.

Moved in to a new apartment in november. Roomates from high school. New job, warehouse grocery picker, earn a grand every 2 weeks. My good friend from college is back in town. I have so much to look forward to; potential love interests, my baby gecko growing up...

I just don't understand why i still feel like killing myself. Why my self harming behavior has returned. I can't communicate, i feel like the people in my life don't really care for me because i keep trying to reach out but nobody has the time and everybody has something better to do and someone better to do it with.

Im afraid to tell my friends what ive been thinking about. It'll either hurt them badly or they wont care at all, and i dont know which scenario is worse. I can't afford to check myself into a hospital. I lost health insurance when i changed jobs and i womt get it back til 90 days into my new employment. I'm in constant pain from my impacted wisdom teeth and im constantly on otc painkillers to cope with it. 

I tried reaching out to a friend today. I went to his house and told him i was feeling overwhelmed by my job. He listened for a bit, then got a call from his mom and left me there to go shopping with her. 

I waited all night for him to come home because i really needed support. He never showed, so i drove home, only to find him there hanging out with my roomates instead of me. Im never fucking good enough for him i guess. He always leaves when i show up.

 I  bolted myself in my room and started cutting. I dont know why?? I know it's so shitty for me to do this. Its never deep enough to do any real harm. I'm in no danger of bleeding out and i dont plan on cutting deep enough to do any real damage. 

And then i remembered my zoloft. 90 day supply of 100mg tablets. And started wondering what would happen to me if i took the whole bottle. Starting to wonder what would happen if i dumped the whole thing down the garbage disposal and quit taking it cold turkey so i dont have it around anymore to even tempt me. 

Im so fucking tired and ashamed i cant control all my extreme thoughts and emotions in any degree. Im so tired of being alone and not ever having someone to physically hold me and tell me that im loved or im worth it. I feel like im imploding. I need help i can't afford. I can't be bothered to feed myself or leave my bed.

 My friends are openly posting shit on social media like "uwu if u ever feew depwesswd come tawlk to me cuz ily" and then they fucking dip whenever i actually come to them for help. Whats so fucking wrong with me that im not worth it? Not worth a hug or support or time. Why do i have to get to this point? Whats it gonna take for someone in my life to listen and care?
