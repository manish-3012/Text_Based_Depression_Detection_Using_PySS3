Living after AttemptingI never thought I would try and kill myself, let alone know the immense guilt I would feel if it didnâ€™t work. 

I remember having a series of horrible days - including being dumped by a guy I really liked &amp; fighting with some of my closest friends - and just deciding it was my time. I felt like the universe was sending me constant signals that I didnâ€™t belong anywhere and things would be better if I was gone (as clichÃ© as that may sound). I didnâ€™t write any goodbye letters, maybe subconsciously knowing that writing letters would realize the mistake I was making and how much it would hurt the people I love. 

I woke up the next day in an absolute daze trying to comprehend what I had done. I had class that morning, and I could barely keep myself from breaking down crying. I felt broken far beyond repair. I didnâ€™t leave bed for weeks. 

This was about 3 weeks before the world shut down (February 2020). Quarantine gave me ample time to just sit and think about how tf I could continue living knowing this was my new reality: that everything I do in my life from this point on is only because I didnâ€™t take enough pills. Every time Iâ€™m hanging out with friends or finishing up a shift at work, I just feel like there is this dark energy looming over me reminding me that I was once willing to abandon this. 

I donâ€™t want to tell anyone, and I havenâ€™t, because I donâ€™t want them to treat me differently or blame themselves or worry. As a result, I have no choice but to internalize everything and numb myself with marijuana. 

Iâ€™m gonna try going to therapy again someday, I hope (I just really donâ€™t like the idea of doing therapy over Zoom). Any other survivors out there? What the fuck do I do now ...
