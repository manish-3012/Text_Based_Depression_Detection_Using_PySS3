I have a date set, I am planning on jumping from a high bridge, quickest way hopefully. I ll be taking myself and by myself out to few places I enjoy one last time. I am going to post how I got here.I am a 28 F, I found this subreddit through r/raisedbynarcissists and as the title entails, one of my parents is a narcissist. I am a victim of child abuse, of course by this parent, but that's not where it ends. My extended family I lived with growing up also abused me(I had to go live with them since my parent is a registered child sex offender). 

Despite all this, I spent the last 3 years getting help. Therapist, groups, and medication, yet it has not done much for me. I have also graduated with high honors in the last year. From personal experience, that wasn't worth much either. I made every effort to improve my life and move on, but here I am and it's not much different. I called the suicide hotline, was put on hold for 40 minutes and then the line was cut.  

This morning set the final straw for me, it's why I have a date set. The amount of psychological pain I am in and the feeling of being invisible. The feeling of always being behind despite working my ass off. I am always helping others, listening, caring, yet it never comes back in return(is karma really a thing?). 

This will probably get lost in all the posts, it normally does. My voice, my cries, it's almost never heard anyway. If you did read this, thank you. This is my last attempt to reach out. I ve tried everything else from friends, doctors, and therapists. It's a shame that I feel like I have to post on reddit to maybe even get a trickle of someone caring enough to listen. I basically feel like I am sufficating mentally since I have no one to reach out to.
