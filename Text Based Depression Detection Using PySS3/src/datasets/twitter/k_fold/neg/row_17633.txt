im better but im rly scared ill rebecome that person againI had suicidal thoughts for a long time i ve seen myself as a piece of shit that's not worth living i made a chart were i would put the pros and cons of killing myself the only reason i didnt do it was that i would scar my little sister for life and my mom would say it was her fault so i kept on going for 6 years and now im 18 and i actually getting better i started working out showering etc but 6 years of not careing its not something you fix in a week of running the reason that im better is that a girl that i know for a while seems to care a lot for me and im rly scared that ill go back it feels very good to be able to go out with some friends without feeling like a dont belong and acting goofy to dont seem quiet but im petrified at night because i think that ill become that person again and that this is created by a dopamine rush or by being in love and that ill pass when it passes
