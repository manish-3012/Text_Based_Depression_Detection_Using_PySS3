I have no more concern for my well-being.I don't know if this is a phase that will pass. I don't know what to do with myself. My life has no value, and it's so tiring to make value for myself when I always fall short.

I'm not sure if this is some sort of existential angst, rather than actual depression. I don't know if I'm sad enough to see a doctor. All that I know is that I'm so alone, I'm battling codependency issues, I have no support system, I have nothing to live for when I wake up.

I feel like I have to undo so much of myself and I don't know where to start, and everyone has everything worked out for them. Because whenever I ask for help, they're just so tired of my shit or give out short responses.

I don't know what to do.
