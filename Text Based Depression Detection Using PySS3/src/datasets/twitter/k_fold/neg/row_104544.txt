AloneNow that my counselor found out about my suicidal thoughts and almost had me hospitalized, I'm realizing I'm even more alone than I thought I was. No one is supportive of me getting help. I have no one to talk about all of this with. I really only have one friend but we never get into conversations that are deep like that. We just hang out and joke. I thought I needed people before, but now that I'm going through all of this, I know for certain that I won't make it if I have to do it alone...
