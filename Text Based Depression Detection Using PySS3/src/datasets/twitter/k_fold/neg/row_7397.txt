I lost the love of my life simply because she wanted to move on with her life and find herselfI was a bad boyfriend in a lot of ways. I've had terrible thoughts while in this relationship. Thoughts of cheating. Thoughts of a better life without her. Thoughts of selfishness mostly. But deep down I knew that was just the evil side of me I could have followed but I didnt. I was loyal to her. I gave my all to her. I loved her more than any human I've ever known. And in the end it all stopped just because she wanted to do her own thing. Because she wanted to find out who she was as a young woman. And I dont have those ambitions. I know who I am. She made me realize the person I am. She taught me what it really meant to love. And I have no purpose without her. I can come up with some superficial thing about how life is worth living for so and so reason but it's not the truth. Life is worth living because of the people we have in our lives. And I just lost the most important person. The most important reason to live. I feel I've peaked. I've reached the person I connected most to and now it's gone. I'm empty inside. All the things I've loved dont matter if she isn't around to experience them with me. I drunkenly text and call her like a fool, begging for something that is lost. To kill myself over a girl is so cheesy. So fucking stupid. Yet I've never felt more sure of this feeling. I truthfully dont want to live anymore. I've been through hard break ups before too. I know how it feels. This one is different. I just dont want to feel numb anymore. All I do is cry. I can't enjoy anything without her. She made life bearable.
