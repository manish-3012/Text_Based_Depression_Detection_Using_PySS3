Iâ€™m going to kill myself.Probably the 50th time Iâ€™ve said that on here. 
I truly think itâ€™s going to happen. 

Iâ€™ve been IOT for 6 months, two hours a day, five days a week.
Medical leave from work for 6 months. 
Waiting to find doctors for 6 months. 

I hate this world. I hate the healthcare system. I hate being forced to live around assholes and an egocentric society. 

Iâ€™m going to kill myself, not because I hate me, but I have everything Iâ€™m forced to live and be around.
