my happiness was temporarythese past couple of months iâ€™ve been at one of the lowest points of my life, i felt so worthless and i wanted to end it all.  the day after i reached my breaking point i somehow felt better. it was like all the things iâ€™ve been bottling up just completely escaped my body and i felt free for once. i was okay for a few days and i really thought i was happy again. but iâ€™m not and i wasnâ€™t. all week iâ€™ve felt like shit and i thought about how easy things would be if i was just gone. that happiness was so temporary and i spent months waiting to feel like that again. whatâ€™s the point to all of this? people say the pain is only temporary, but it really doesnâ€™t feel like it :/
