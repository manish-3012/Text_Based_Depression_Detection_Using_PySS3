I've been having suicidal thoughts for four days now and I get closer and closer to following through.Two nights ago I took a bunch of sleeping pills and drank a bunch

Last night I cut myself and drank a bunch

Tonight I played around with a belt to see what would work best.

Guys I feel like I'm getting closer and closer and I think I need help soon. The pathetic thing is that I have pretty much everything in life going for me and I'm still like this. I don't want to die but every night it seems easier and easier to just let go. Shit, I might have died tonight if I'd figured out that belt. 

I have a feeling I'll be gone in the next week or so without help. That's not a threat or a cry for attention, I can just feel my mind slipping away and know myself well enough to tell.
