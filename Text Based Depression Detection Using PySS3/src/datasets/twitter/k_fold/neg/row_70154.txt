Suicidal when drunkLately I've been drinking a bit more than usual. A mix of Christmas and also having brewed a big batch of beer, which enables me to drink more than usual since I live in a country where alcohol isn't sold in stores after 6 o'clock, which means I have ready access to alcohol when I would not usually.

And I'm getting reacquainted with that terrible old feeling of always feeling like killing myself after I've drunk a lot. Is this normal? I just get this feeling of not giving a damn about anything and throwing myself into trouble. I'm not suicidal when I'm sober but this is starting to worry me. I had a patch like this a few years ago when I would regularly try to kill myself while drunk using plastic bags that I'd put over my head when going to sleep. It was a dark time and I don't want to go back there. Any advice? I'm a bit lost about what to do or who to go to. I guess the rational thing to do would be to stop drinking. If so, tell me and hopefully I'll listen to you guys.
