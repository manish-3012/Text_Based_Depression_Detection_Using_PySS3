I've decided to do it. I just don't have the courage yet.I've tried before, but I've never had the courage to finish it. Thoughts of suicide are constantly in my head, they have been since I was very young. There's no way around it. I'll hopefully get the courage and find a way because I can't wait much longer for life to give me a reason to change my mind. I can't do anything I used to like. I can't even eat anymore. Everything makes me sick. I'm an entirely lost case, this is just a last ditch stall.
