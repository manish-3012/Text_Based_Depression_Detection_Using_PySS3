TauntingAre you bored yet? I am. Constantly reminded of what a fucktard I am wherever I go. I want it to end but I have to be strong or whatever the fuck the OTs said. Being in the moment sounds like horseshit. Iâ€™m stuck in this body and I want out. Itâ€™s excruciating counting minutes, hours, days and weeks. My childhood dying. Feeling so alone. No contact. Iâ€™m the toxic one. An endless loop of hell.
