I started writing my suicide letters.Letters because I plan to send some to my family and some close friends through the mail. It's gonna be too late when they read them anyway. I won't kill myself anytime soon, but I know I will eventually either by the end of the year or the start of next year. 

My reason? I hate living. I hate my life. I hate who I am. I hate whom I've become. I hate me. I just don't want to exist. I want to disappear. I want peace... and the only want I get true peace is when I'm dead. And also because life always fucks me when things are going well. Every damn time, life fucks me. I like to say to myself that God is a bully who doesn't want me to be happy. Oh well.
