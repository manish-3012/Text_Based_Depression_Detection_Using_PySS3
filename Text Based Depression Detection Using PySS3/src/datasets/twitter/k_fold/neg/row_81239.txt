I put a noose around my neck today.Iâ€™m tired of life, Iâ€™m tired of trying, Iâ€™m tired of worrying. I wish I was high all the time or sleeping. I want to put my mind at ease.

I put it around my neck out of curiosity and almost did it, I almost kicked the rolling chair. But Iâ€™d knew Iâ€™d fail. I used a belt that was made out of that seatbelt material, it probably wouldnâ€™t have done the job. Not to mention the only way to string it up was closing it in the top of my door. The door probably would have snapped off the hinges. 

I just wish I had a ton of drugs to take to end it. The only gun available is at my parents which would have been disastrous. I wish I had an easy painless way out, like a button that would make me go away. Donâ€™t praise me for being brave, I didnâ€™t do it because Iâ€™m a coward.
