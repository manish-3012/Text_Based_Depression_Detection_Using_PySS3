Ima be honest, just really want to hugIm 16 and I do hug family and shit, but like I just want the feeling of someone hugging you, not because theyre obligated as family or an ironic joke from friends. 

Man, I think the prospect of that hug is the only thing that keeps me goin'

Fuck I just want a long hug with someone that I've built a relationship with.
