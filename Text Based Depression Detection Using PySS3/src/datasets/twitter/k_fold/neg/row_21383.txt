I donâ€™t want to leave my child behind but....Iâ€™m crying as I write this. Iâ€™ve been hurting for some time now. I keep pretending that everything will subside and that Iâ€™ll go back to how I used to be, funny, free spirited, and energetic, but as the years pass Iâ€™m completely forgetting who I once was. 

My childhood was not ideal, I grew up in a very abusive household, but still managed to make something of myself despite the odds. I used to never let anything get the best of me, but now I feel like Iâ€™m carrying the weight of the world. 

I ended up marrying my childhood friend, and heâ€™s a really great father, but our love life has diminished. We barley go out on dates, or if we do our child is with us because he doesnâ€™t want burden anyone else with the responsibility our our child (which is understandable). We barely go on any dates and sometimes I feel like just having sex with him is a chore for me. 

My child is my world, the reason why I keep holding on! But lately, I donâ€™t think I can anymore . I keep thinking of ways that I could just end it. I feel like they would be better off without me.
