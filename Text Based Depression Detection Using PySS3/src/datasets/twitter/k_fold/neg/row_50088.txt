I feel like I'm losing the fightIt's gotten to the point that I don't feel hopeful anymore. I don't try and look towards a happy future. I don't see how it could ever get better. All I see is continuing pain, depression and loneliness.

I always wondered how people could say they're happy in life? Just how?

Is it bad that I honestly don't think I'll make it to the end of the year? Maybe not even a few months from now?

If so, I really hope someone in my life will remember me.
