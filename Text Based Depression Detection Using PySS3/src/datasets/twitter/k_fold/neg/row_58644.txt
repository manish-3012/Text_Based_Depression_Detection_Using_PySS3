Not good enough26, worthless. Wife left me, friends hate me. Even my best friend who is my roommate sees me as something she needs to take care of. Pretty sure once my school money comes in I'm going to pay off the last of my debt, then buy a gun and end it. Wife used me for her and her boyfriends pleasure, got raped on my first date after breaking up. I'm weak and not worth a damn. All I'm good for is hitting or sex. Parents see me as a disappointment and I don't blame them. Co workers hate me. Honestly just looking for encouragement. I know everyone will be happier with me gone, I'm just too selfish to do it. If I dont its just going to continue this cycle of abuse. I've tried therapy and even they say I'm a lost cause. Doesn't help that I'm ugly af too.
