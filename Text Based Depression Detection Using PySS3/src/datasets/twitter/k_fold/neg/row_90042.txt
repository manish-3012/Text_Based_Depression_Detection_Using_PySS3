72 more daysI've decided. 72 more days until I hang myself. I know how to do it, I have a plan. I have the items and I have the will. Now, I've set a date. 

6 may 2016

In between then, I'll be in Europe. I'll be seeing hopefully some of the best sights and meeting friends for the last time.

I can't take it anymore. The pain, the hollowness, the hopelessness.

All my friends are moving on with their lives, and I'm left behind with this depression. I have no one I can trust and no one to talk to. My head shouts for me to find help, my heart knows none will come. Why bother. Don't be a burden. You're not worth anything. Living each day hurts. So much.

72 days.

Please. Help.
