Just an ugly tranny, ready to dieThere's not much to say really.

I'm a 32 year old tranny; ugly, miserable, friendless, poor, and an abject failure at everything I've ever attempted. My birthday brought it front and center that I'm totally irrelevant. I am and have always been the biggest problem in my life, and I think it's time to die.
