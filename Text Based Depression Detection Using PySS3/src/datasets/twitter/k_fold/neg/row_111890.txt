Tonight's the nightI already wrote this note for my family, and though I'd share it here, why not, right?  


This isn't the first time I've written one of these, and even I am unsuccessful I suspect it won't be the last. I've known for a long time that this is how my life would end. I tried to fight it for a long time, even deceived myself into thinking I could beat it for a short time, but the reality is that this is who I am. Something inside of me is broken and I am tired of fighting it. And I'm tired of being tired.   


I'm sorry for the pain this is going to cause. I don't want to hurt anyone. It's just not enough to keep on for others anymore. I know I'm selfish. I know I'm a coward. That's on me. I don't blame anyone else. This isn't anyone's fault but my own. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.   


"Small paragraph about what I want to happen to my body and my dog" I'm sorry it had to be this way. I love you all.
