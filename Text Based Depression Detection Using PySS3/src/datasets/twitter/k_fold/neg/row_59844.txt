When you do it to yourselfIm going through a separation right now. Married for over 11 years with two awesome girls. Unfortunately my wife and I grew apart and started to neglect each other.  We became shells of what We once were. We don't know of it's going work out or not. I still hope but I don't really now. 

I feel like I can't go on without her. I don't want to lose my marriage. 

Every passing day, I think about ending it. I feel like I don't want to be here anymore. I remind myself that my girls and my wife would be devastated but the hurt, the loneliness, it's unbearable.
