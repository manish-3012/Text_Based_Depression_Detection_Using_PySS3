Trigeminal Neuralgia is HELL on this EarthI've finally been diagnosed with this for my eye-cheek-gum searing pain and discomfort! [https://youtu.be/MDaMsJz8Rp4](https://youtu.be/MDaMsJz8Rp4)

I'm starting on the first-line medication today. I hope this works. I've been going insane and sometimes suicidal because of this strange disease.

Fun fact: Reading on this disease I've learned that it's sometimes referred to as the "suicide disease". I can confirm it's a totally fitting name, as I've been driven to decide that I'll have to kill myself if this pain doesn't stop.
