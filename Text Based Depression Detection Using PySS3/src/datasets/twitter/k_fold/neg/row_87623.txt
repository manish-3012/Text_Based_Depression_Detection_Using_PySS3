I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm just really down right now.I know I've made progress and things could be worse but I'm here again... It's like I can't think and things are just hopeless. I didn't get some assignments in on time and now that'll probably bring my down a letter grade. I know I'll still have an okay college GPA but if it's not my best... then I'm stupid. But I can't do my best because I feel like this, I can't focus. I'm tired. I shouldn't be but I am. I know it's just the first semester, it's just undergrad classes. It's just these few classes. Just a few more weeks and they'll be done with. If I'm not getting A's then I suck. I shouldn't be here. But if C's are my best then that means I'm subpar... if that's all I am then why bother. I can't do this. I'm fucking weak. I have to cram for a ton of class work this week. I've been so anxious that I just talk and talk when people ask me how I am doing. I sound like a total idiot. I say stupid things then I hate myself for it. I just want to quit.
