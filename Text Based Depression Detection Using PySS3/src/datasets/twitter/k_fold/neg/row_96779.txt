Iâ€™ve decided to end my life in April if Iâ€™m not happier by thenIâ€™ve gone a lot of my life feeling empty and passionless. Even though I have a few friends and loved ones, the numbers seem dwindling and it becomes harder and harder to make new friends out of a school setting. Iâ€™ve lived in financial stress for years. Filled with grief and regret for failed connections with people. Some failed friendships with people out there that I care a lot about and love but theyâ€™d feel resentment and apathy towards me if someone asked about me to them. The people in the house I live in will be gone on vacation in April. I love my dog, feels like heâ€™s been the only one there for me and I know him going to a third home will be hard, with me being his second owner. I hope to leave him with my brother around that time so heâ€™s not trapped in a house with my deceased body. The faster this happens the faster the few people in my life can move on and live a more peaceful life.
