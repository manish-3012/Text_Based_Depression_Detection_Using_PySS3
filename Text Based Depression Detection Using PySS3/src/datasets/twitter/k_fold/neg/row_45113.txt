I wanna die so bad today, is it in the air or is it extra freaking strong today ?It's another bad BAD brain day and I've been crying like I got shot in the stomach all day, and people or family I had to see today I faked such a bad smile with tears in my eyes. My life is terrible you guys. I have nothing. I wanna die I wanna die so bad. I'm crying while I type this, I'm so lonely I'm tired of living in this repetitive life of the same thoughts. I'm on Zoloft and a sleeping/anti depressant but I have no relief every day I can't believe are actually able to go on and live life. I'm too scared to kill myself but the mental pain is getting out of hand. No one truly knows how much pain I'm in. I'm only here for my mom and sister.
