help. i'm feeling suicidal tendencies again.I'm six months clean and I've been proud of myself for that. But an argument with my sister really triggered me today. My parents sided with my sister and I feel like no one's actually listening to me, that my feelings are invalid. I really, really want to die. I don't think my family ever really appreciates me. I don't have anything in my life other than my family and I feel like they're becoming the reason why I want to off myself. I'm certain that when I die their lives would very much be peaceful without me ruining everything for them. I really, really want to die. I am such a burden to my family.
