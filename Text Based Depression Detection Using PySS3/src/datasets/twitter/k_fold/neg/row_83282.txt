What to do with my suicide notesRecently I wrote a suicide note to two people who mean the world to me. Thankfully they never received them as at the last moment I opted out (of suicide) and went to the ER and was admitted to the hospital. 

However I still have those two notes and don't know what I should do with them. Part of me wants to ask these two people to join me as I burn them (unopened), then another part of me says to just throw them away in silence and not say anything more, and part of me wants to keep them as a reminder that I am stronger than the pain. 

If you've ever been in this situation I would like to know what you did with your notes that were never delivered.
