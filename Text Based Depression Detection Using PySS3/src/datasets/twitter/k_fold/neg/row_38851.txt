I feel like Iâ€™m living for other people and am in so much painMy mom and my boyfriend love me very much. I love them and never want to hurt them but I am in so much pain everyday. I am treated terribly at work and my job is incredibly difficult yet doesnâ€™t pay well at all. I am barely making ends meet and deal with abuse on a daily basis. I have jumped from job to job and am finding that the industry I work in is littered with negative, catty and spiteful individuals. I donâ€™t have experience in any other field and it will take me two more years to complete my degree. I think about killing myself everyday. I already have a detailed plan and have had it for over a year now. My boyfriend talks me off the ledge when I start seriously struggling but he has been out of town and his phone is broken. I tried to call my mom and it went straight to voicemail. I feel really alone and have to go to work AGAIN in just 6 hours. I spend anywhere from 8 to 11 hours a day feeling miserable at work just to come home and sleep and do it all over again. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I hate my job so much that I consider killing myself or at least harming myself to the point of hospitalization just so I do not have to do it another day. Because I have had so many underpaid, soul crushing jobs, I worry that this is just what life is and that I will always feel this way. People always say that life gets better and I want to believe because I donâ€™t want to hurt people who love me but I canâ€™t see any light at the end of the tunnel. Without my boyfriend or mom, I would have ended this already.
