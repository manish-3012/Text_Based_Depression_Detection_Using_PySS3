Sooner or laterFell into depression late 2017 haven't got out since. I've had a great run l made it 22 years so far and have had a mostly good time, I'm at peace with dying. I stopped eating and drinking 10 days ago and have been using the internet to keep myself entertained as my body slowly gives out, this is probably it, sooner or later I'll be gone.
