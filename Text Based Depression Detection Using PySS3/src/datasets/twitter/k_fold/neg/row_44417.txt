Planning on killing myself on SundayI feel like I have nowhere to turn so thought I would turn to the world here to just get my thoughts out. On paper I have a very good life. I have a good paying job, no debt, great friends, and a boyfriend who loves me and will likely propose to me soon. Yet I feel horribly empty inside. I don't feel anything typing this, just numb. And when I do feel something, I feel like I'm on fire and I can't handle it. The emotional and mental anguish is so much. The feeling that I am worthless is overwhelming and I feel like I'm either numb or fighting tears (in public) or bawling my eyes out ( in private) and there is nothing else. The only times I can sort of get by are when I'm with my boyfriend. I've resisted doing this sooner because of him, but I can't do it anymore.

One thing I should mention is that one of my closest friends passed away from suicide a couple months ago. This was so devastatingly hard on me; i couldn't sleep or eat right for weeks. Even now it's still hard. My emotions are too intense and have pushed some people away because of my struggles and because I am not happy enough. Im dragging down the people I love and I don't want that. My boss at work told me I need to be more positive (or else), and putting on a charade has been emotionally exhausting, but he doesn't care how that impacts me. I am tired. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for almost two years. On and off with the depression but the anxiety is always there. I have been in regular therapy yet I still feel this way. I feel trapped, like I have no one to talk to, because they don't want to hear it or it would mean losing my job.

I can't go on like this. I am so tired. I am currently in a country where it's pretty much impossible to get a gun. But I'm back in the States (American expat) this weekend for a wedding Saturday. Sunday is my day to easily acquire a gun and have that be the end of it. I'm just looking for some peace for once.
