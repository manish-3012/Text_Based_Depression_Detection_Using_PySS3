An excerpt from Kate Bornstein's book, "Hello Cruel World: 101 Alternatives to Suicide for Teens, Freaks and Other Outlaws". Has a couple good points in it. http://web.mac.com/katebornstein/iWeb/Hello_Cruel_World/Goodies_files/HCW_Lite_101.pdf

I haven't read it, but it seems like a cute book written by a good-hearted lady.
