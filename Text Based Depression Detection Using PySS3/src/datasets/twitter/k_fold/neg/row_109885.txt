I feel so alone, I don't know what to doI'm a 20 year old male. This all really started back in May, when I screwed up and left my job (with no notice) for a new opportunity. That new opportunity lasted 2 days and I left due to it just not being for me. Ever since, I've tried finding a job to no success. That has slowly eaten away at my mental health, making me more depressed than I usually am. 

I guess it started to rub off onto my girlfriend, too. She tried telling me that I haven't been the same person twice, but I didn't listen. She kinda left me last week, I don't know where we stand. She told me I need to get a job and get help... She was really the only thing keeping me sane. 

I've talked to a family member about possibly going to the hospital because these thoughts are starting to get to be too much... she agreed that my girlfriend is doing the worst possible thing she could do, but anyway. I might either go to the hospital or call my psychiatrist's office and give them permission to call said family member to help get my medicine situation sorted out, because I'm obviously not taking the right medicine. 

Any advice? I feel so lost.
