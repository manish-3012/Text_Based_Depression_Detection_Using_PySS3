Need urgent medical/legal advice - please heloAs with many my original post was going to be a pic of my newly acquired puppy but circumstances have changed and now i am desperate and need help. Sorry for the long post but I've seen some good come out of these communities and am hoping someone can help us out. I have a close family member living in florida that suffers from borderline personality disorder (new diagnosis), bipolar disorder and has TBI (traumatic brain injury). Has attempted to commit suicide several times and the last time was very close. These are not empty threats! Also can be abusive (not physically that I know of) to spouse due to condition. Constantly in and out of hospitals and has become extremely capable of convincing doctors there is no problem just to get released. Been admitted 3 times over the past month and increasingly more suicidal and abusive. Separating from spouse so no place to live atm but, even though abusive, obsessed with spouse and with getting back together. Does not respond to any pleas to calm down or see reason. Being released again in a day despite the whole family's (who live abroad) cries for help and explanations of past events over decades. Apparently hospitals can only hold people for 3 days max (baker act) but then they are free to go unless doctors declare them unfit for society, a danger to themselves and others, but like I said, after decades of dealing with doctors this person is extremely capable of convincing others he is ok so I don't think anyone believes us when we explain the severity of the situation.
I don't want to do this but I've resorted to start taking legal action to hold hospitals and staff accountable if anything happens. I just want to ensure the safety of this person (and spouse). Everyone is turning this into a legal thing saying they can't hold a person against their will, even if that means releasing them to the streets with nowhere to go (last time they wanted to do it at 7pm!). It took less than 24 hours from the last release for something to happen. Also was told I can go to court to attempt to attain guardianship, but that takes months+ and in the meantime the person would be released. We're willing to cover all medical bills. Needless to say that holding someone in a clinic against their will or having them institutionalized is not what i want but I don't see any other way to ensure their safety. 
Is anyone a lawyer with experiences in cases like these?
Anyone a doctor whose dealt with these kinds of patients?
How do I ensure this person's safety?
What do i do!? I see times running out and I'm desperate. I live abroad and have flown in to help and would take this person with me to be treated abroad if I could but off course that would also have to be involuntary. 
Please please please, can someone help??
