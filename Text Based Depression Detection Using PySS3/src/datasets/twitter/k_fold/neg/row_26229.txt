In the middle of getting helpI wanted to post here for a long time
First time was months ago, but I still had a plan I wanted to try then to maybe find happiness.
Then again 2 weeks ago when it failed, and I wrote my first suicide note, but I came up with another plan. A few days ago it too collapsed and I realized that I will never be happy. I've been trying since then to find the best method to die. But in the end I called the suicide hotline. They told me to visit a hospital and I did. They advised me to get admitted and I did, yesterday. It's too soon to know if it will help me, but I think I feel better with this decision, though right now  I'm still sure that I will never in my life have anything good. Maybe if anyone is interested I can share the results of this endeavor after it's over.
