Pointless.16 yo from singapore. I got held back in school for a year. I can't pass this year. My life is pointless. My family have given up on me and frankly I can't blame them for doing so. Simply being alive is being a burden on my family. I'm just so lost, what should I do with this useless life? I don't deserve to be alive.
