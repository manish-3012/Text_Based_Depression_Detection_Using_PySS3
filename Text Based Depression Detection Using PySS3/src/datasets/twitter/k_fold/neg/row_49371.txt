Feel socially or emotionally confined? Express your self at /r/IAmWeird :).Heyo SW, I'm a bit of a strange fellow and usually spend most of my days containing myself. SO, I built an outlet that I thought someone here might like! [/r/IAmWeird](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmWeird/)

Here is the description I made for the reddit, I think it does it justice:

&gt;**Welcome** to the sanctuary of the strange. Here, you may express your inner weirdo and experience that of others.
&gt;
&gt;This is a place for people (and various other lifeforms) so try not to post things that are just strange pictures (those belong in [/r/wtf](http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf)) unless you're involved somehow. 
&gt;
&gt;Here, you're encouraged to suck up the spot light for a while by just being yourself! 
&gt;
&gt;**Don't be shy**, we're *really* accepting!
&gt;
&gt;If you did not come here to embrace the oddity of ones humanity, please advance to [/r/normal](http://www.reddit.com/r/normal). 
&gt;
&gt;Do not pass go. 
&gt;
&gt;Do not collect 200 karma.
&gt;
&gt;**Enjoy your stay!**
&gt;  *We have fleas.*


It's a bit boring at the moment, so I was hoping one or two people might be interested in joining me by being their strange selves? :)

Thanks a bushel!
