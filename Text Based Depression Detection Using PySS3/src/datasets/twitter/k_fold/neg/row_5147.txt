I suppose Iâ€™ll just go thenIâ€™ve given all I could... donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever know how to love healthily. I seem to either be too much or not enough. Idk what to do with myself anymore. Iâ€™m just gonna go then I guess. I try to communicate my feelings to others but I think Iâ€™m just too needy, too mentally ill, too unstable. I always fall in love with the wrong people or the right ones at the wrong time. I guess I am too demanding. Maybe I need too much love. Maybe Iâ€™m just a black hole. Maybe I just need to die finally.
