WhySometimes I actually question why I am I alive . I can't do anything for myself  and I actively beat myself up . I have no intelligence in any of my classes whilst others zoom ahead and look clever whilst i break my back and get nothing out of it and it was the same as last year. I have depression and anxiety due to school and I'm on Prozac that I'm still waiting for to kick . Even though people love me my head honestly tells me that I'm better of if i wasn't born or if i kill myself and sometimes i actually agree with it as i am as useless as a paper cup and i also have thoughts that aren't mine and bother me. I dont enjoy anything anymore ,  not even my favourite sport which I find an absolute mission to pick up the will to go to.
