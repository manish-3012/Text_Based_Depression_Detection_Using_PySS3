I am so evil and worthlessFuck throwaway accounts, this is the real me.

Despite being raised in a comfortable environment with nary a want in sight I find myself far beyond the edge. I've lived with an aching sense of emptiness and lack of emotion for over 15 years now, despite only being 22 as of this April. I hate myself for even beginning to feel like this for what I have and for the fact that there are so many people in this world who are far worse off than I am.

My mother is sympathetic and tries to help and all I do is shun her away with what little bit of emotion I have left, anger. I have been through many sessions of therapy and many antidepressants and yet I feel I have no place in this world. The only thing that is keeping me alive is the debt I yet owe to my parents from my college loans, which are still piling up as I somehow trudge forward. Despite being on my way to becoming a pharmacist, I have no hope for the future and would rather just end it all here.

I have been close to suicide before but at this moment I have a knife in front of me. I feel like ending it all at this moment despite my debts. Despite the horror I know I would inflict on my family, everything just feels right. I am such a worthless creature that I can't even take into consideration how others would feel.

I can't feel love.

I can't feel anything.

I am an absolute husk.

I wonder if I'm even really alive.
