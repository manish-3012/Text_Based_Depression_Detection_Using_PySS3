am I just unlovablethis is my second time using Reddit, Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m doing it wrong or something. I donâ€™t know what to do. Im twenty, Iâ€™m bipolar, I just got diagnosed with bpd and a long list of other mental health issues. I think all of my friends have abandoned me. Iâ€™m so attached to my best friend but he doesnâ€™t care about me anymore, I asked him if he wanted to hangout on Halloween because we have done something for it for the last 3 years but he doesnâ€™t want to. He knows Iâ€™m suicidal but itâ€™s like heâ€™s given up on me. I donâ€™t blame him, I have to. I really want to kill myself on Halloween. my other friend started talking to me again after a month of saying nothing, so itâ€™s giving me a little hope I guess, but I almost donâ€™t want hope. I just want it to be over. Iâ€™m so fucking tired. Iâ€™ve been institutionalized before and that worked for a little bit but now Iâ€™m back to the same point I was before. I almost did it six days ago, I had the pills and everything set out and almost as soon as I was about to go for it my mom walked in. Iâ€™ve been cutting severely, Iâ€™ve self harmed for about two years but never have I done it this much or this deep. I just feel so fucking alone. Iâ€™m so fucked up and everyone knows it but no one cares. like am I that bad of a person that when Iâ€™m obviously on the verge of death my closest friends donâ€™t give a shit? please I just want to work up the guts to finally do it. I canâ€™t handle being abandoned anymore. I donâ€™t want to be alone.
