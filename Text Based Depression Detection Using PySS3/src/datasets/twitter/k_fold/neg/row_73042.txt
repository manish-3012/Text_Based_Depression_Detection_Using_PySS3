I'm not sure why I decided to come here.I have issues with talking to others about my problems, but i'm having a hard time just holding everything in.. It's been about a year since i've been to therapy, and about 6 months since I've stopped taking Cymbalta.  The problem with trying to explain what is happening in my life is that there are so many layers upon layers of issues that it's like a fucked up sitcom.. You have to tune into all of the episodes to know what's going on. 

I have been feeling increased urges of suicide. I'm too afraid to talk to people about what is going on in my life. I've tried really hard to reach out to people but I end up falling short for fear of embarrassment of my awful home life.

I used to be a focused and promising student. I have a lot of talents and a lot to live for. I have a wonderful boyfriend who has tried so hard to help me feel confident about myself again. I know i'm pushing him away because I just don't think I can be helped at this point.

I want to crawl into this comfortable hole that i've made for myself in my head. I want to sleep for days on end. I'm selfish in saying that I want to commit suicide because I know there are people out there who love me dearly... I don't know why i'm writing this. I don't know if anyone can help me because what I need to do most is help myself.
