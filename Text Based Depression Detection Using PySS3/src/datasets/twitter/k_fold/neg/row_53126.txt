I wrote a note, I bought some rope, I'm watching tutorials on how to tie a Hangman's knot...I'm losing my god**** mind...I really don't wanna die, but each day, I'm slowly becoming convinced that this is my only way out of this pathetic life. I've been depressed for 10 years, and there's no end in sight to this soul-crushing pandemic. Worst of it is, if I tell anyone IRL how I feel, they'll send me back to the ICU, where I could get sick with the virus and die anyway! I could also be stuck with people much more unstable than me, and be at the mercy of another bureaucratic, power-tripping doctor that looks down on patients. Enduring that again is worse than death, IMO.

I've been holding on as long as I can; give me one good reason to keep holding on further...
