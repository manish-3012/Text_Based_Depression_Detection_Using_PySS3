Life is purposeless.The irony of this is that I am such an anxious, paranoid person that I find myself staring at this screen worrying about whether whatever I post will be "good enough" to put here, paranoid someone will recognize me, and generally...I don't know, I've never written anything upfront like this, so forgive me for making little sense.

I can't handle life. I can barely stand being in the same room with other people - I can barely think, and can't concentrate. I hate when people talk to me. I can't deal with conversations. I've essentially locked myself in my house for the past five days and procrastinated doing the only thing I really have to do - make a phone call - because I can't handle it.

Nothing has meaning to me anymore. No people or activities make me happy; I'm enthusiastic about nothing. It's pointless to continue living this way, but I don't know how to change. I've been depressed for years now, and I assume I'll be this way until the day I die. This is one of the worst low points I can remember having, and I can't do anything, I just can't, I can barely get out of bed. I find myself thinking about suicide, even though I know I'd be too much of a coward to go through with it, because I don't want to deal with myself. I fantasize about it more frequently than ever, though, and I'm going to get rid of the useless extra pills I have lying around the house so I'm not tempted. Really the only support is my boyfriend, who I have been 85% open with, but I don't want to be a burden on him, and I know I am, so why am I even still here...
