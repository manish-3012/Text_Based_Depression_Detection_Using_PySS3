Mind keeps returning to the lake.I live several hours away from one of the Great Lakes. And itâ€™s been growing more and more in my mind to skip my pointless job and just drive up there, chug a bunch of booze, NyQuil, melatonin and just swim out until I pass under. Maybe leave a note or video explaining why.

No body to feel bad over for the people who want me around because itâ€™s what theyâ€™re supposed to want. No mess for some sad shlub to clean up. They can hold a dinky little memorial service and be home in time for more important things. In a year itâ€™d be like I never was. Lives moved on, time keeps churning and they wonâ€™t need to think of me anymore. I wonâ€™t persist on for them to all come to resent me, they wonâ€™t have to ignore my messages, they wonâ€™t need to roll their eyes at my whining about how truly evil this world is. 

Iâ€™m not brave enough yet, maybe I never will be but more and more Iâ€™m just sitting looking out at the lake.
