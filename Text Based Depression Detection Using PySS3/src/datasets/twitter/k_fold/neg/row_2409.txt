just need to finally say it in full where someone will hopefully understandI don't know even really how to start to say this. I'm a bit of a mess  for as long as i can remember i have had extreme issues with mecidal professionals and anything that has to do with them, everytime i have to go to get dental work done or even something as simple as a physical, I get violent PTSD its like my body and mind just shut down completely,   i shake, i hyperventilate and then it turns violent really fast and i have no control or memory of it when it happens,  now i'm a big guy (6'4 230lbs)  it scares most doctors when i get like this understandably, but when it happens and i'm amaware thats its happening i get extremely vivd images and memories of being tortured to death by medical staff although its hasn't actually happened to me in this lifetime, its so real i can remember the smells even right down to the taste in my mouth when i died.  so going to hospitals triggers that "fight or flight" response in me and I truly feel like im about to die every single time, so getting to today, i havent been to the dentist in years  and my dental health is laughably terrible i'm only 24 and my teeth are basically falling out, so i forced myself to try and get looked at and it happened again, i freaked out as soon as i was in the chair, i screamed, shook,and even knocked the doctor and three nurses to the floor trying to calm me down,  i have no conscious memory of doing it, but they all insist that it happened.  I can't be helped, so much is going wrong with me and i can't fix it and worst of all no one that i talk to understands  i just get the same "we all have to do things we don't want to do" speech  and i'm told to "get over it"   it hurts me down to my soul, even now an hour after this all  happened i can't stop shaking, I feel like there is no place for someone like me, i can't get help for my health, I can't even take fucking eye drops,  so i've decided killing myself is the only way out of this, i've come to terms with it and its the only option i can think of
