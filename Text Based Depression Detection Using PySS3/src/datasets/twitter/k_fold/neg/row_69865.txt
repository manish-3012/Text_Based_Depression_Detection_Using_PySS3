Iâ€™m not suicidalBut I do black out and come back to doing 90 in the wrong lane or taking corners at 80. I do wake up from nightmares in a cold sweat and canâ€™t figure out if Iâ€™m relieved or disappointed because it was still better than reality. I do scream at the top of my lungs in my head so no one sees.  I do make constant jokes about how sad it is I can go a week and not speak a word out loud.  But Iâ€™m ok.  Iâ€™m not suicidal.
