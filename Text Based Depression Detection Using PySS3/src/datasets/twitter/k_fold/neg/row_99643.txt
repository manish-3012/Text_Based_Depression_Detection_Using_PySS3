endlessly hopelessWhen you're in such a fixed mindset of misery it's so hard to get out of it. I absolutely see no future for myself. It feels like it's all over.  I only see myself working a minimum wage job, I don't think I could ever have enough energy for a career and so, there no point in living. My relationship with my family isn't enough to keep me going and I feel a little guilty for when it comes to my friends. It all feels so awful. Therapy is doing all it can but doesn't work and so does meds. I have nothing going on for myself that makes anything seem hopeful. No hope in sight. 

Last year at this time, I was in the same state of espair and it hasn't gotten any better. Only worse, now I'm just so distant from anybody and I dont have the capability to make any sort of connection, any friend. It's awful. It's gotten the point where I've actually written letters to my family and friends. Where I actively think of methods of doing it. 

Nothing makes me happy anymore, sure, I laugh at times and smile but it's nothing compare to my feelings of suicide.  Music is the only thing that has kept me afloat now that my bikes have been stolen so I have no sense of happiness. Everything else is a distraction. 

I only plan to give it 2 more years for other reasons, completely unrelated to having any sort of meaning, just business. 

If I could it end right now, I definitely would. I honestly just want to fucking die.
