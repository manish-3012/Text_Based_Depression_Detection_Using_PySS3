There's just so much and I can't stop cryingIt's New Year's Eve and I can't help but reflect. There's so much I need to change about myself. I'm overweight, short-tempered, immature in my thinking/reactions. I receive no respect from my siblings, friends, and elders. I have made some seriously stupid mistakes in my past that have ended with me in a less than mediocre graduate school that will seriously affect my future career opportunities. I want to be more well-read. I want to get involved in the three or so hobbies I'm interested in. But I can't. I just can't. With all that and trying to get high marks at school to make up for my past mistakes, I just crumble under the weight of all I want to take on. Throw in a sibling who's clinically depressed, who brings about endless amounts of stress and torment to our family, and a several-year long LDR with a woman I plan to marry but can't as our plans have us finally being with one another in another 6 years, there's just too much to take on. I've tried time and time again to make progress, balance my life, change my attitude, but everything falls apart after a few weeks at which point I fall into my cyclical rut of depression where I lock myself up in my room for days, crying, regretting, hating myself and this life I live. At 23, a guy like myself should've come along much farther than I have. And many have - most of my friends actually. They're all excelling, fit, making huge strides in their professional and personal lives. And here I am, the fat, lazy, unmotivated moron who can't seem to make a step of progress in any damn direction. I deal with my jealousy now not by motivating myself to achieve goals, but by saying that everything that happens is all moot as I only have several more decades to live. It'd be nice if it all just ended.
