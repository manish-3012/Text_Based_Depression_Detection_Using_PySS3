I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up.I've never made an attempt on my life, and honestly don't know if I ever could,  but I constantly dream of being killed by someone or having unexpected health problems. I feel like if I have no part in my death, then my mother won't blame me or herself for what happened, and she could find peace. Life has begun to rapidly grow painful for me, and I think I've begun the process of isolating myself from my friends and family. I've lost interest in many of the things I once found fun, and nothing I do seems to help. I just want to stop suffering, but I'm too much of a coward to do something about it. While I've had these feelings for years, I feel that the past couple of weeks have been the beginning of the end for me. I don't particularly know why, but every day is increasingly harder than the last to slug through. I'm not sure how much more I have left in me, but I feel that I'm draining fast.
