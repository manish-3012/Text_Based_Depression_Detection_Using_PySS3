Make the pain stopMy life is empty, i have no friends or love life.  I feel so dead. All i feel is sadness and anger. No one loves me no one will care im gone. No one cares for my art. The only thing keeping me from doing it is method. I have no pill or sharp objects accept a pocket knife, i dont know how well that will work if i try to cut my wrists. I have a letter written out and dcided where my money and belongings will go. Im just fed up. Im so tired. The pain will end once im gone. Ill finally be free. Im going to be free of the pain. This cruel lonely life will be over. No one loved me no one cared. Im so happy, im going to be dead soon and it feels so great.
