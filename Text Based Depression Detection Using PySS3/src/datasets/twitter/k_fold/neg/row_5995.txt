I let myself ride out 6 months of varying degrees of mania until it quite literally ruined my life. Iâ€™m now unemployed, have $60 to my name, less than 1/4 tank of gas in my car, lost all of my friends, had unsafe sex (a lot), and then got raped and strangled until I almost died. Now, I want to die.Iâ€™ve fallen into a deep depression. A soul crushing depression. I knew those fucking serotonin receptors would give out sometime, but I didnâ€™t think it would go from call the cops on myself bad to complete despair. The sadness was so hollow and thorough and complete. Iâ€™m on day 2 of no sleep fueled by chainsmoking cigarettes and weed with a Xanax tossed in for the agoraphobia Iâ€™m now dealing with along with the depression, so thatâ€™s nice. I wound myself up all day to try to go get food. I took the Xanax. I waited. I was ready. I even drove there. For my card to get declined. So now Iâ€™m down to my bills which is $60 total. I accepted my death when he was choking it out of me and something fundamental broke inside of me.  Now Iâ€™m only afraid of if my suicide attempts *donâ€™t* work. About the pain, further possible disabilities, regrets, what Iâ€™ll put my family through and have to be around for, if Iâ€™ll become too anxious and call 911. I have so many scenarios in my head. Im not even seeing my service dog in training as enough to stick around for. I know my sister will take him in for me. Iâ€™ll ask her to in my note. He will be a great companion to someone who can actually exercise him appropriately.
