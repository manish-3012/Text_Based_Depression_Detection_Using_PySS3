Paranoia and DepressionI don't feel secure talking about this with anyone I know, but I feel like I need to get this off my chest. I've been suffering from suicidal thoughts since I was about 11. I'm now 17, and I've been in homeschool for about 2 years. It's difficult seeing friends because we moved to another state, so I don't know anyone and I can't hang out with anyone. I've started suffering from Hypochondria lately, and I'm frightened to go outside. I've been inside for about four months (besides when I get groceries), and I had the chance to visit my old friends back in the state I use to live in; so I did. When I hung out with them I had a panic attack because I felt like I wasn't wanted there, and Im pretty sure my anxiety has gotten a lot worse. It's also very difficult for me to do simple everyday things such as eating, because I'm paranoid of parasites or diseases. I feel like im going insane but I have no clue what to do.
I don't enjoy anything I use to enjoy really, such as art. I really wish I could enjoy it but all I can do is sleep. I don't know how I'll make it through the summer; because I won't have school to distract me from my paranoid thoughts. It's just such a struggle living, so I have no idea why I'm scared to just end things. Thanks for reading.
