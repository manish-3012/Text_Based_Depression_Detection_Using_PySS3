Iâ€™m really afraid now because Iâ€™m not afraid anymoreI know itâ€™s confuse but I feel that I could do it at anytime and it really scares me...
I keep thinking I must not kill myself, some time ago I was afraid from the pain and hurting my family feelings but right now I really donâ€™t care, the only thing that keep me alive is imagining my fiancÃ©e alone with my 2 dogs, struggling in life, it really breaks my heart and Iâ€™m afraid to leave her. 
The fear of waking up one more day is higher than the fear of death.... I canâ€™t deal with life anymore, just there is no point, really... I want to go. 
I failed in my job in my fiancÃ©eâ€™s family company, I got a degree but canâ€™t find any job, everyone just keep telling me I donâ€™t fit, well I guess I donâ€™t fit this world anymore... I canâ€™t do anything right.
If I had a gun I would be dead right now, for sure 100%. But in my country is really hard to get one.
I called a doctor to see if I can get professional help but I donâ€™t have money... whatâ€™s the point of this world? I might die because Iâ€™m a failure and got no money to get help? It just no sense, it just make my mind worse.

Idk in just typing random things, but I really need help, I want to believe there is another way to bear life...
