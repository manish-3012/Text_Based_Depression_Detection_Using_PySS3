Not Attractive. Lame excuse?No girls ever find me attractive.
I can't blame them...
I'm a nerdy, overweight, unconfident 29 year old who is barely making ends meet while still trying to figure out how to break into the career he wants.
Nothing about that really screams attractive.
Is that a stupid excuse to want to commit suicide?
I know people say it isn't everything....but love was always a huge goal for me.
