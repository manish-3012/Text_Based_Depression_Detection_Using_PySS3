I'm so tired.I'm so tired of life. Honestly I've tried so many things to make it work a d it just doesnt anymore. So what's the point. I'm never happy and I don't enjoy doing things I used to. And the one thing that kept me alive for a while isn't there for me anymore. I'm just done. I don't know what I'm gonna do or when I'm gonna do it but I know it will be soon
