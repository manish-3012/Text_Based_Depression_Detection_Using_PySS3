I'm tired of being worthlessI'm tired of being a failure

I'm tired of not having a single redeemable quality

I'm tired of being incompetent at everything

I'm tired of being an idiot

I'm tired of being annoying

I'm tired of being unlovable and unlikable

I'm tired of not being able to keep a job for longer than a few months

I'm tired of my mom providing for me (and she's tired too)

I'm tired of being lazy

I'm tired of having no friends

I'm tired of hating everything about me

It's such a fucking shame that the only way to stop it is by killing myself.
