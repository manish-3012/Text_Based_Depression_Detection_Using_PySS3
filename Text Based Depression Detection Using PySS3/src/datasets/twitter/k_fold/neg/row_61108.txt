Beyond depressed. Help please?Something is seriously wrong with me. I'm nothing but depressed anymore. I've gone through so much and I feel like I constantly feel nothing but pain. I used to be such a happy person. My life is falling apart. I lost a close family member, my dog got diagnosed with cancer. I recently broke up with my boyfriend because his family hates me and I felt it would be the right thing to do. Now I'm regretting it and he says he wants to stay single. My heart is broken. I'm loosing everyone I love in my life. I only have one friend who is always busy with her job. I find myself constantly alone with no one to talk to. I try to make plans with other people but I always get blown off or ignored. I don't know what to do. I try to be strong but it just never works...
