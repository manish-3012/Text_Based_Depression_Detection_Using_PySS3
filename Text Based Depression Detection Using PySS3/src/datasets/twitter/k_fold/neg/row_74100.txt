I don't know why I can't do it.A lot of people are saying that my brain knows better than to let me put myself in harm's way, whether that's trying to stab/cut myself, jump in front of a vehicle (or onto train tracks), take a ton of painkillers (a lot of irony there), get a rope and tie a noose then hang it somewhere, head to a bridge somewhere, the list goes on.

But I feel empty. Either empty or just depressed, depending on what's going on around me. Even when I'm with friends, no matter how much they try helping me out.

I thought I could care about people. I thought I could trust them. But a lot of them made me realise that opening up or letting people in, it's usually a bad idea. They just add to the list of reasons to end it all. Last few months have been hell. I feel like I no longer matter any more, and I've been proven right a lot.

I know I shouldn't be using my main reddit account to say all this but it's the only one I use, I've stopped caring to the point where I can't be bothered with throwaways anymore. Probably helps that I feel like a throwaway in general.

Why can't I just (literally) cut loose? Why can't I make myself suffer? Why do I try too hard to be nice to people and let them in, only for them to make me feel even emptier than before? Why?
