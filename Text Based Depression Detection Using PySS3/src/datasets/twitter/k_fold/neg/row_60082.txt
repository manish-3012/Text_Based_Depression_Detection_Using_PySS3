I'm sick of this cycle, I really want to die.I have been to doctors, and they have found nothing wrong with me besides IBS. Apparently that is the cause of all my problems. It's why I'm always restless, why I always have anxiety attacks, and why I can't stop my mind from racing. 

I recently lost my job and have missed out on 2 jobs.. I guess it looks strange when I have to ask them to excuse me while I run to the bathroom and use it. I have no money because I blew through my savings paying bills. I have another interview tomorrow but what's the point? I can't even afford anti diarrheal medicine so it's a guarantee I won't get the job. I'm just done with this cycle. Wake up (after my long night sleep of 30 minutes) use the bathroom. Attempt t eat something... use the bathroom. Watch 20 minutes of a show, use the bathroom. 

I've been to the doctor and they said its definitely IBS/anxiety, but so what? I'm close to homelessness, I would rather be dead than homeless shitting in my pants. I am just so angry that this is my life now. I want it to end. I actually went to the store earlier and tried to steal some medicine for anti diarrheal and , of course, I stopped to run to the bathroom. This is the ultimate low point of my life. Unless I win the lotto (kinda hard when I don't play) or some random relative dies and leaves me money, I don't see this improving. What's the point when it only gets worse? It's gotten to the point I fantasize about someone breaking into my house quietly and blowing my head off with a shotgun while I sleep. 

Tell me one good reason I shouldn't when homelessness is 100% the next step for me. I don't really have much family and I've become kind of a hermit over the years, so not really anyone I can ask for help. No medical insurance and no hope for anything. I don't even have a fucking cell phone anymore. Internet will be out in a week or so.. I'm surprised it's still on now it was due a few days ago.
