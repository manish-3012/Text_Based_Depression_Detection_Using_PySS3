I don't know what to do, but I'm just done...The last and only person that gave a crap about me and that was there for me every time, stopped caring about me the moment she got in a relationship. We were best friends for multiple years, and things started to look good again, I was able to enjoy life. But the moment she got in that relationship, she was just... Gone... It's only been a month, and we beraly talk or see each other. And every time we do, she's just not enjoying it herself anymore. I feel useless and I just want to end my life. I'm done. The last person i cared for and that cared for me is just gone...
