always tiredI'm 23, and though I've had a good life it's what lies ahead that keeps me up at night. I'm alone; hopelessly and unescapingly alone. I feel like I'm at the bottom of a deep well, and try as I might I cannot climb out. Every night I seem to find myself in the same position. A knife in my hand and a question on my mind. What if? On one hand I don't feel like I could really carry through with it, my family would be distraught and my coworkers would suffer as a result. I love my family and my job so I feel like I couldn't do that to them. But could I really? It would be so easy, I have sharp knives and things to hang myself with and in just minutes I could be free.

At the end of the night what do I have besides myself and the ever-present, darkness? I honestly try really, really hard to change it. I put my anxiety aside and, shaking like a leaf, go out to socialize with local groups in the hope of some small tinge of light in the dark. But there's nothing, I'm sidelined and marginalized and discarded while the cliques retain their patterns. I don't blame them for this, it's only natural to stick with the people you already know, but am I so worthless? I don't know what to do because I've already tried everything that everyone says is supposed to work. Everything I touch fails. I feel so unimaginably tired, physically and psychologically exhausted. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.

I want to believe it gets better but I don't know how. I want to just be free.
