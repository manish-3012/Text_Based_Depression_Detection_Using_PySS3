My boyfriend(34m) makes me(26f) feel crazy.I started working at a restaurant serving, a job he got me because he knew a manager, and now he wants me to quit. Iâ€™ve been there for 3 weeks. 
A couple days ago I went in for a 4pm shift and didnâ€™t pay out my last table until around 9:20. I didnâ€™t clock out until 9:45, after my side work and having my end report checked by the closing manager. My bf says it doesnâ€™t make sense to him why it took me so long from them paying out to me clocking out. And heâ€™s scrutinizing every minute of my time. 
He wants me to quit today or else he doesnâ€™t want to be with me. I donâ€™t mind quitting because itâ€™s just a job to get me through the holidays, but heâ€™s making it seem like Iâ€™d rather stay at the job than be with him. 
Weâ€™ve been together over 5 years. 
Iâ€™m at a point where I just want to kill myself from all of the emotional rollercoaster heâ€™s put me through. I donâ€™t even want to try and break up and move on living life without him or stay with him and continue this ugly cycle he puts me through all the time. I just want my life to be over. Im so miserable now. I hate what my life has turned into and I donâ€™t even recognize it anymore. This isnâ€™t me and I donâ€™t care to restart and find myself again. I just want everything to stop. But it never does. I just stay and deal with this so called â€œloveâ€. And if I donâ€™t itâ€™s because I donâ€™t â€œlove himâ€. It feels like Iâ€™m in a living hell sometimes. How did I fall in love with this? Iâ€™m so confused and frustrated with myself to the point I just want to go numb and never come back.
