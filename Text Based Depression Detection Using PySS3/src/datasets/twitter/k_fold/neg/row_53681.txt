My teacher saw me writing a suicide note.She had us write in our notebooks about whatâ€™s going on in our life and I was gonna do it that very same day. I ended up writing 4-ish pages about how I was going to do it and thatâ€™s what got her attention. I canâ€™t even write 40 pages about the fucking French Revolution but I can write pages upon pages about this so she read it. She told my parents and now Iâ€™m going to therapy but it isnâ€™t helping. The worst feeling is wanting to kill yourself but being to weak to actually do it. When will it end?
