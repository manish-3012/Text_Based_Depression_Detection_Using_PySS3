I want to buy a bottle of vodkaand drink the whole thing in an hour, and drink whatever else I have lying around. I'm so tired and I want out. I've been going good- I've been getting more exercise, taking multivitamins, got re-accepted to college, going to therapy weekly, not struggling financially, have good, solid friends/family and connections. But it doesn't matter. I've thought about quitting my job and finding something less stressful. But it doesn't matter what I do, where I am, because it's always been me and not my environment. Environment can contribute of course, but even if I was in my personal utopia, it's still there. I was suicidal as an adolescent, I was suicidal as a teenager, I'm suicidal now as a young adult. The depression always comes back; I can't run and I can't hide.
