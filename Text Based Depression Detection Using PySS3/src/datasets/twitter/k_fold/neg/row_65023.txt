I'm doneI've been dealing with social anxiety and depression for so long now and I just don't feel motivated anymore. I'm not doing anything with my life and I'm too scared to do anything. I'm weak so why not just give up? I lie to my therapist and say I'm not going to do anything to myself but that doesn't feel true at all. Me saying one day I will kill myself I just don't know when feels so much more true but I'm too scared to do that because I don't want to go to the hospital. I just don't know what to do anymore. Why do people want me to live if I don't even feel like trying? If I have all these problems that probably just stress others out more? and its hard to trust anybody really. Everyone has given up on me in the past. My parents. grandparents, step mom. The only person I have left is my aunt and I'm sure I just upset her. Yesterday her boyfriend say that me and my cousin don't do anything so that just made me feel even worse. So today I told her that why do she still hang out with him then? Shes in the other room now talking about shes feeling upset not sure if its about that specifically or what but I know shes going to give up on me too. If I say she isn't it just feels like one big lie. I really don't want to die but it just feels like it'll be the only thing that'll bring me peace in this world problem is I'm too much of a wimp to do it. On Tuesday I was almost able to kill myself but I try fighting it. I ended up calling a suicide line and that stopped me but I just don't want to do it anymore. The last two times I called I felt like the people didn't care. I feel like almost everyone in this world only cares about themselves. If I die people will move on. Sure my family may be sad but they'll move on too and thats the only people it'll affect. It doesn't feel like its worth fighting because it just comes back every single time. Sorry if I didn't make sense in what I said.
