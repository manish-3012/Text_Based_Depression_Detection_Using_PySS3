Posted this on another less positive subreddit, but I would like to get other opinions.I'll preface this by saying that I do have a mental illness (medicated), so some of these things could be just the bipolar talking. However, I do feel like I'm thinking clearly. I'm not highly emotional thinking about this like I used to be.

I don't ever say things like "kill myself" or "end my life," or even "end everything." Those are first and foremost too explicit for my taste and secondly I view suicide as leaving life rather than ending or taking it. It just makes the pill easier to swallow.

Six months ago my ex-boyfriend attempted suicide. I won't describe how, but I'll just say that there would have definitely been a lot of collateral damage and his attempt boiled down to sheer personal terrorism. He's been stalking me ever since. The point is he talked a lot about killing himself in the aforementioned explicit sense, and I want my death to be different.

I study music at the collegiate level and I'm in my third year. I'm starting to question my decisions and money might keep me from pursuing a second degree. My original plan was to study through graduate school and teach music at the college level, but my passion is dying, if not already dead.

At this point, I can only see myself living an unfulfilling life in a line of work that I hate with no way out. I've already tried to leave everything once but it didn't work (obviously). Since then I've reworked my plan and I'm trying to set a date.

(I understand if this post gets taken down.)
