Reaching out to a friend: yes or no?I'm very much thinking about killing myself. Have been for years. It's only getting worse. Recently, I have realized I am dead inside, and there is no life for me. The outside things that brought me down in the past are still present, but I realized even without them, I am nothing. I don't want to fight for help, and I don't want to wait around for a future. I would like to be done.

I have one friend. We've been very distant the past three months. I'd like to reach out and talk to him, though I don't even know what it would be about. I don't want to ask him for help. I don't know what I want. But, I somehow want to let him know how bad I'm feeling. Even if I let him know, I don't want to continue living.

The problem arises because we have been distant. He has emotional problems himself and has had bad experiences with knowing people who committed suicide in the past. I figure, the farther away he is from me, the less we talk, the less my killing myself will hurt him.

If I reach out, it will cause him great distress up until I'm gone. And, after, I'm pretty sure he would blame himself. I think the correct answer is to not reach out. The only positive to reaching out would be to help alleviate some of my pain or distress, but I would only be selfishly adding on to his.

I suppose I'm just looking for opinions.

*And, while I do incredibly appreciate any replies, as I have no where else to talk about this, please refrain from telling me you love me, that killing myself would be a waste of my talents, or that the world is beautiful. None of this is relevant, and all of it makes me feel terribly ill.
