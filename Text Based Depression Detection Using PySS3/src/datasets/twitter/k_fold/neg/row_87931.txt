I donâ€™t know what to do.I havenâ€™t been happy in months. Life has been getting worse and worse. Iâ€™m too scared to ask for help from anyone I know so iâ€™m turning to anonymity on the internet. I canâ€™t really say that iâ€™m completely suicidal, but iâ€™ve been thinking about it now more than ever. Things keep getting worse and worse, and iâ€™m not sure what to do. Someone to talk to, or any advice would be so much appreciated.

Iâ€™m an 18 year old male and have no one else to talk to.
