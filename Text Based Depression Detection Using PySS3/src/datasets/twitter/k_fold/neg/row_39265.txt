I feel like I'll never put my life together againI was sexually assaulted at my old school.  At first, I hid it. But as I opened up eventually, I got a lot of negativity that made me feel I'd done something wrong or wasn't handling it appropriately. It became really hard to get out of bed and eventually my life was just ashes.  My home life is not supportive in terms of family and friends just can't be there.

I feel like I'm getting further and further away from the life I once wanted and there's no way back.  I once had a promising future and it's just gone and I like don't want to be here anymore. I don't really have many friends anyway. My personality is unique at best. I feel like the world would be a better place if I wasn't in it. I think my parents would be happier.
