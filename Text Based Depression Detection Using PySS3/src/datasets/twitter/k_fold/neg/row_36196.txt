I want to leave.... but thereâ€™s stuff to do.This summer has been hell for my family and I. I turned 20 a few weeks ago yet it feels like a life time ago already.... 

My best friend called me out about sleeping in late and I finally told him about my depression: since then heâ€™s been avoiding me when he can- before weâ€™d hangout whenever we could. So much for wanting to talk about it huh?  

My Dadâ€™s eyesight has taken a downhill fall and needed surgery a few days ago; since then my Dads family has been badgering us like crazy. And my youngest uncle whoâ€™s 54 and still lives with my Grandparents bitched me out after requesting space. Told the three of them Id block numbers if they yelled at me again in my own house for no reason. 

Meanwhile, my dog passed away from cancer, our company is closing...

I donâ€™t really want to end it... Iâ€™ve just been in so much pain for these last 12 years and things have just gotten so bad these last 6 months. I want to be happy again. Iâ€™ve been clean since Freshman year.... I really donâ€™t want to go back again but it feels like my skin wants to peel itself away. 

I know I wonâ€™t have the guts to end it. 

I just want to be happier. I wish I could get help but Iâ€™m broke right now. 

I know things get better... but when is it going to get better for me? Iâ€™m worn out.... Iâ€™m tired but canâ€™t sleep. And when I do... itâ€™s nithing but nightmares.
