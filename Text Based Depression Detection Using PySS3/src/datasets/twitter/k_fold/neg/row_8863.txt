Let's band together and share your theme song.Share a song that best describes your life or how you are feeling right now. This hopefully will serve as a good distraction and a way to share and possibly find new music for us to relate to.

My all time life theme song is "Hurt" By Nine Inch Nails but I feel a more affinity for Johnny Cash's version.
