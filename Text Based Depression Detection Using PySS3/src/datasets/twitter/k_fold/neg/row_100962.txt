I want to dieI want to die. I've been thinking about it everyday recently. I want to leave everything. I can do it. I know how. I know how to hide self harm marks. I'm not scared to do it. I just want to fucking kill myself. Sometimes I plan it, the exact time. I want to do it today. I think I could do it today, at 2 am. No one will be awake. I could find some ibuprofen and take the whole bottle. No one will be awake to stop me
