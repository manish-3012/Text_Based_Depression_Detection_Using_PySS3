Iâ€™m so tiredIâ€™m a trans woman. A tranny. Ive been on hormones for almost 2 years but I still donâ€™t â€œpassâ€ which is actually being seen as a woman. I probably never will. Instead Iâ€™m a freak, and I probably will be forever. People stare at me everywhere I go and everyone calls me â€œheâ€. I canâ€™t keep this up, and everyday I have less energy to stay alive.


I have a little .22 and I of course wouldnâ€™t use it, but I thinks about it. And tonight Iâ€™m drunk and Iâ€™ve been thinking about it a lot. The biggest thing stopping me is I know small calibers are less likely to be successful, and more likely to leave me brain damaged but alive. Idk if I can keep doing this
