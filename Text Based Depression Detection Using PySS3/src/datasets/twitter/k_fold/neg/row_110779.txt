feeling ungratefulA mental health talker came to my school a while ago. He cut off his legs as they were useless to walk on and got bullied for it when he was a student. He didn't suicide because his brother wanted to help him do it and he realised the impact on his brother and family. 

I have an average life. Married parents, siblings, school. Our relationship is a bit rough but I guess somehow they do care for me. I tried improving my life. Doing hobbies, cleaning, studying but it all seems so pointless. School, job, marrying, kids, retirement- I don't want this :(

I won't come to a revelation suddenly like what suicide survivor stories or mothers who have their newborn baby, and be cured. Depression comes back to you. 

Yes I'm young but I know life gets even worse when you hit thirty. I don't know anyone genuinely happy at this age and over. There are more bad things over good things. I want out of this, I don't want anybody to remember me after my death. Yes I feel guilt but I'd rather take my own life than to slowly waste away.
