Today I feel really sadIt's been a wild rollercoaster of events lately, and it's been hard to handle, from my family and life itself making life really unbearable and hard to live, to losing the one and only reason that I've lived for and pushed so far, the person I love. It's hard to fight these suicidal thoughts, and sometimes I really lose will to live, and it's been getting more and more difficult to fight the feeling, the thoughts, and especially the pain of losing you. Recently we made up and agreed to start again, from zero, but it hurts acting so differently and I'm so impatient for us to go back the way we were. You cannot even tell me that you love me, you feel it's too intense at the moment and you barely reply to my messages. I write you lines and lines of text, but you reply as if I didn't even write anything. I just don't know how to react, or what to say. I send you voice messages, but I honestly don't even know if you really listen to them. It's painful to not be able to be by your side, to not be able to hear your voice, to make you happy and know what's on your mind, to not have you say that you love me. Maybe I've been moving too fast, ever since we agreed to start again. I say too much, I express my feelings too much. But how can I not when I love you, and love isn't just expressed in the romantic way, love is being dedicated to you, caring for you and wanting your best more than anything in this world. You're my everything, and I love you so much, you've no idea. But I don't know how to react to what's going on, and it's painful, but I'll do my best to continue being understanding, though it hurts, you still make me just as happy, even if right now it's by thought, since we didn't even talk yesterday. You're my reason to keep going, and I owe it to you last week wasn't my last week. I love you .
