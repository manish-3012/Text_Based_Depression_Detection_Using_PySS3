A temporary solution...I woke up this morning at 4 am,  out of my brain with stress and thinking the only possible solution to my problems was to kill myself. 

Took a bunch of valium. Feel awesome now still don't know what to do,  still think I should die,  but like,  feel so much better. Too drugged up to bother even hurting myself. Took some more later on to keep the feeling going. 

Obviously,  can't do this every day.  But god damn,  for right now its effective.
