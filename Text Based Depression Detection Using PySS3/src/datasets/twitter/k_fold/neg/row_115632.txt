I should have been selfish from the startPeople **warned me**, they told me I should've **cared the most** about myself, that **caring more about the rest would doom me.**

**I didn't listen to them.**

**They were right.**

Selfishness is the key to **happiness**, of **survival**, of ensuring our **own benefit** the most... 

Anything other than that is **punished by life.**

I know that saying this is selfish as hell... But I guess I can be selfish once in a while.

I lived half my life living mostly for others, and, in the end, it didn't matter.

Almost everything I did **never mattered.**

Once a tool, always a tool, I guess.

Now it's too late to be selfish.

**Never set boundaries, never stood up for myself, always acted as a submissive person and so on... **

And an used too just **gets discarded, since it can't do anything anymore.**
