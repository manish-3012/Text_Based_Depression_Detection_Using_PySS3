I just feel like I've hit a dead end.I can't think of a single thing in my life that's good or on a trajectory to something good. I'm shit at school no matter how hard I try, I can barely understand Maths and my foundation is so weak it's unsalvageable. My hours are long and so is my commute home, I get back home just before dinnertime on most days and I'm so tired. I don't have any hobbies, skills or impressive personality traits. I have no real friends, and my family is horrendously dysfunctional. I live in a country I absolutely cannot stand, and it'll take a long amount of time and tons of hard work to get the opportunity to move out. No one ever listens to me or respects me. I hate the way I look, speak, think and act. I just want to die but I have no choice but to live out every single day of the same depressing crap over and over again.
