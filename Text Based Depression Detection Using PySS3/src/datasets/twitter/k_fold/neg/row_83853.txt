A program for the suicidal?Don't you think there should be a program (like assisted suicide) that helps the suicidal? I've been through it all. The therapy, exercise, finding hobbies but none of them help. I'm over it but I'm too scared to do it. It's like my body won't let me. If assisted suicide was offered I could die with in a peaceful way. I just can't understand trying to keep people who don't want to be here anymore.
