Listening to Chopin - Nocturne Opus 9 no. 2 against the backdrop of my lifeI feel like taking the exit now. Everyday I long for something unreal. I should not be here anymore. I long for something real. Why should I still exist? I love life but every second is another longer time spent without an answer.
