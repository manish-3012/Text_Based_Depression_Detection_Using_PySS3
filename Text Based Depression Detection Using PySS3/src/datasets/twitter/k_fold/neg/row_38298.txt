The final nudgeI've been having suicidal thoughts and self harming since I was 14, I'm now 16 and pretty much had no reason to live, waking up every day with no fucking clue why I was doing anything, something good finally happened between me and the girl I liked for a long time and tonight my own twin sister told me she was being romantic to put it nice with someone else &amp; I think I've finally come to the realization life isn't meant for everyone and I think this is the final nudge I've known I've needed for a long time to finally get the balls to kill myself, not exactly sure how I'm gonna do it but I plan on at least leaving some notes behind for some people. Sometimes life just doesn't work for some people and that's okay
