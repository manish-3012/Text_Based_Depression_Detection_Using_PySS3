The AlmostDo you ever feel like almost, since covid 19 started i been strugling i have read storys here that shows that other people than me have it more hard, but still i am tired you know, tired of almost succeding, almost of always loosing to some one else, always being 2nd. Almost having a good life. My life its full of almost you know i just cant do it no more, what would be ironic is that i almost succed too in taki g my own life, i feel like trash, useless, almost a person, almost always the 2nd i am at my limit guys i am sorry i though i could do it but as i write, i took too many blows, no more please, as i write this i am crying tried to talk with mom and all she said was "dont cry get over it", my friends ignored me, seems like they really want me off this time i dont wanna die guys but i cant do it no more
