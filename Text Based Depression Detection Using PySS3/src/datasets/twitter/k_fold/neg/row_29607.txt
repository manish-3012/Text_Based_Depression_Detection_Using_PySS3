I feel like I need a breakdown.I don't know what to do. I've posted before, and I appreciate so much just knowing someone is hearing me.  

I took everyone's advice. I finally, *finally* went to a professional for help. It was a terrible experience. I won't go into detail here, but if you're curious, check my recent comment history.  

There's something messed up with our society where I feel you aren't taken seriously unless you have a breakdown. That was my original plan, to do something dangerous. To get help by putting myself in a situation where I'd be forced to get help. But I didn't. I controlled myself and talked to my husband about my thoughts and feelings and I did things the right way, I made an appointment with a professional.. and it was terrible. I got no help and no answers.  

I can't afford a breakdown though. The shitty two hours I spent with the doctor cost me $200. And I don't think I can put myself through that again, emotionally. I just want to hurt myself, I'm angry and lost. I feel so drawn to self-destruction. I'm so torn over whether talking about it is a good idea.  


I can't even get my thoughts straight.
