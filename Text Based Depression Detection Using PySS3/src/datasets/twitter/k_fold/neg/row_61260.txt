Continuous thoughts about suicide&amp;#x200B;

I am 24 yo guy, wasted my life from 18-23, decided a change was needed and I wasnt going to kill myself. Lost 30 kg in 6 months, stopped smoking both weed and cigs, train twice a day and eat healthy. I try to improve the relationship with my parents and genuinely try to better myself. 

I went for a drive yesterday and my dad came with me. I told him about my suicidal urges recently and he has been worrying about me and has been a pillar of support to me. At a certain point in the drive, I drove past a sort of cliff which I never considered as a possible option of suicide. If my dad was not next to me I would have driven straight off. I found this very strange. The thoughts of suicide are getting more and more vivid. It used to be something I thought about excessively yet the thought of actually committing the event was somehow distant. 

It is not distant anymore. I am thinking of at least ordering the rope online. I used to feel like I did not have the courage to hang myself, I don't feel that way anymore. I feel like it is a matter of time before I drive off that cliff. I don't want to hurt my parents. It would crush them completely. My mother is dying of cancer and my father is doing everything right. He is doing everything he can to help me and my mother. Only a despicable person would do that to their parents. But I just feel so guilty, useless and rotten to the core. I would like to be another person for a day just so I can come to my home and smash my head in with a bat. I try to better myself and be a humble person, but I deserve to die and burn in hell for eternity. I never thought that the idea of hell could come as a relief. The thought of me actually being able to pay for my sins gives a level of comfort. I've been crying for about 2 hours which I find somewhat disgraceful.

My dad made an appointment with the doctor which is due for in about an hour. We'll see how it goes, thanks a lot for reading!
