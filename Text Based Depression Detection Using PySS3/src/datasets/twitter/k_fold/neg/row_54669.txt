A few more days left and a perfect suicide plan. This attempt will not be stopped.Sufffered with PTSD, chronic depression, schizophrenia and anxiety issues all my life. I've managed to become rather successful, at least considering my handicap. I can't take it anymore and now have a full plan. I am about to lose my house, wife already left me and took my daughter, which was the only reason I'm still alive at all. Was taken to jail for domestic issues. About to be taken again. Will lose my job, car and everything else I own. I have a protection order so I can't even go home. I'm broke, foodless and living in my car. Facing possible prison time. Depression has gotten to be too heavy. Called the suicide hotline and my situation so bad they really didn't have any advice. I have a prefect relaxing plan to die by the ocean in Seattle, carkeek actually. I'll do a bunch of drugs and continue to do them as I slowly need out of my wrists, all the while the last sounds I hear will be the calming ocean waves. I tried cutting my wrists a week ago but friend found me. I'm done crying for help. I may check into hospital before I do. Haven't decided yet. 
I know people here understand the pain, which is why I thought about posting. I've written a ill book about my life so my daughter will know what lead up to this. 

I see no hope, nor does anyone else. I will be high and die on my terms, and I think everyone should go like that. 

How sad... homeless and broke in a new Mercedes. Irony and a fitting poetic end.
