Trying hard to stay alive and need recommendations for things that help.I'm currently going through a very bad spot where I can't stop thinking about ending my life. I'm trying to do everything in my capacity to try and improve my mood but it doesn't seem to be making much of a dent. 

Things I'm already doing:

1.Sleep before 11, wake up at 7 everyday.

2.Use a SAD light for an hour as soon as I get up.

3.Do a round of WIM HOF breathing exercises.

4.Mindfulness meditation .

5.Go to the gym for 1 hour running with heart rate at above 80 percent of max.

6.No sugar, dairy. gluten, coffee, etc. Pretty much only eat a few things: Sweet Potatoes, Spinach, Kale, Tuna, Steak, Chicken Liver.

7.Intermittent Fasting. Eating all my food in a 4 - 8 hour window.

8.No hot showers, only freezing cold water for 10 minutes.


My situation is pretty bad: Problems started with Body Dysmorphic Disorder at 16 and I have severe depression as a result of it. I'm a 30 yo male, no friends, no relationships ever, unemployed, and have IBS to top it off. A lot has happened along the way, but I just don't have it in me to write it all down. Don't really think things can get any worse and I really feel like it's over for me. I'm pretty much only living because I don't want to hurt my parents, but the pain is so intense, I'm constantly breaking down and thinking about dying.
I'd appreciate anything anyone can suggest for things to do that might help.

Thanks.
