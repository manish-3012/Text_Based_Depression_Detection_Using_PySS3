Why I canâ€™t give upNow Iâ€™m not gonna give my whole life story, I just would like to journal a few things on a sub Reddit that is appropriate. I have depression/anxiety/adhd, which all of these effect me in different ways combining with themselves. Today my car got a flat tire, and died to where I need a jump, it took me about 6 hours in total to come up with the courage to walk inside a gas station to figure out I need to change a tire and not just pump it with air. I am almost 20 years old and can barely do the small things in life or take care of small situations. I havenâ€™t cleaned my room in months and I hear about it from my mom all the time, I have to do the dishes daily and chores which many people might think that itâ€™s very easy to do all those then have a day free of whatever you wanna do. But I cannot wake up, I canâ€™t come to, anytime Iâ€™m in the moment I canâ€™t do it, sit in bed for hours Bc I canâ€™t get up, play video games all day and cant clean my room or do the dishes, I have a hard time showering every day. I wear the same clothes for about 2-4 days in a row. I cant get a job, either I donâ€™t have the motivation to find one or I make an excuse Bc I donâ€™t want one deep down. I know I need one I know I need to do everything on my own in which I can see while not in the moment, if I look a week into the future I know where I have to be, I can see myself completing my tasks but just procrastinate literally everything, I canâ€™t put my mind at ease, Iâ€™m always stressed, always need some way to take the ease off, if thatâ€™s through drinking or drugs then thatâ€™s just how it is. I have the what to do down, I know what I need to do. Itâ€™s the how to do it that is so hard for me, how do I muster up that motivation to get one task done.
