Iâ€™m planning to hang myself either by the next few days or tonightIâ€™m just posting this out here just so people know Iâ€™ll probably be gone by this week. No oneâ€™s gonna read this or care anyways. Iâ€™m done living life, everyone thinks Iâ€™m a violent dickhead and probably wonâ€™t care that I hanged myself in my room. Theyâ€™ll probably laugh about it. 

The past three months have been rough to say the least. I try to feel better but every time I do something else just knocks me back down, as if some celestial being just wants me to quit. If it is, I might as well die. No one will care anyways
