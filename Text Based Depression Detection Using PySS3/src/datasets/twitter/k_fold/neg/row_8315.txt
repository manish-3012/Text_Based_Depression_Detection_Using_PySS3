Violently degradingConscientiousness and separating thoughts from action (e.g. defaulting towards inaction) has gotten me far.

But i've thought about dying every day for 11 years now.

I've started cutting myself, in public bathrooms even.

I stopped talking to my family and it's been pretty great.  It's amazing that they aren't getting under my skin anymore.  I don't think I'll really feel free until they're dead, but I hope that I'm really not that mean.  I miss the idealized fantasy where my dad doesn't work 120hrs a week.

Beyond that, I don't exist.  I used to be popular for a year or two, now I can't get a single person to hang out with me.

Flakiness, Netflix, and Political Correctness.

I used to have swaths of people telling 'just wait, it will get better.'  I didn't believe them, and decided to prove them wrong via the scientific method.

It hasn't gotten better.  At most, every girl I come across now just tells me abt all the other guys she's having sex with.

I can compete with these people if I wanted, I could be 'popular' again.  I know what it takes.  But it's a fickle facade, and why do anything when anhedonia keeps you from reaping rewards?

There's nothing I want, and nobody wants me.  The violent framework I've had to adopt to survive scares them all away or creeps them out, because no one likes what they don't understand.

The only thing I have left to take is my life.  Most days I'm glad that no one has been able beat me to that, but today I'm kind of wishing someone would kill me so I don't have to spend the effort.
