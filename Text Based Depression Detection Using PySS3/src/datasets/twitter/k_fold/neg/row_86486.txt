Does anyone else feel like this is just pointless?I'm 20. I've been living with this mental illness since I was a child and it got continuingly worse and worse and worse. I've had 3 traumatic experiences, all of them were traumatizing me on a daily basis for years, 2 of them were co-existing. 

Going to therapy, trying to recover just made me realize how pointless all this is. Recovering from all of this to live a life worth living somehow will take decades. I am absolutely convinced of that. What is the point? In a few decades, when I'm old and fragile I can finally say "I've made it. I am happy now." Live for a few years more and then die. With my whole life lost. 

Is it worth struggling everyday for decades just to experience a few years of relative well-being? I don't think it is. I'm pissed off there is no option for assisted suicide in my country. 

I get that it's irrational to allow depressed people to kill themselves but this is WAY beyond depression. Sometimes I get a few minutes of hope. Where I feel sad but hopeful. Those are the moments that still keep me alive. But deep down in those moments I still know that they will pass just as quickly as they came and that there is no hope. 

Fuck all this. Fuck everyone whoever assisted in my trauma who helped it grow. Fuck those who decided to watch and do nothing. Fuck those who knew but decided it wasn't as bad and that I never needed help.

I wish there were guns in my country that I could kill myself with. Why does every way of suicide have to be painful? Why can't I just end this suffering? 

What I thought about was emigrating to some remote place up in the mountains where I could just dissociate in peace, do nothing, just sit there and meditate. That is the only option I see that would make my life durable. I think this is a dream coming closer and closer.  But then again, I'd probably get psychosis up there again lol
