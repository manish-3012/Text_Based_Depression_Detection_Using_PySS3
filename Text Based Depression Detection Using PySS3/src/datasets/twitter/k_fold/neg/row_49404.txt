Something I wrote when wanting to kill myselfI never learned to love myself.
I bet itâ€™s more common than I think.
If every human has a heart,
Than Iâ€™m sure they have felt this beat.

The agony of waking, staring into the sun.
Wondering if this day, could be the one.

These thoughts make me lonely.
A burden I donâ€™t wish to share.
Staring into my roof,
Fumbling reasons to care. 

Searching for causes, 
Of this disease with no cure.
You can tell me itâ€™s my father,
And I may agree â€œsureâ€.
Or possibly itâ€™s that one time
And Iâ€™d say â€œfineâ€.
Cause at the end of the day,
I still want to die.
