My body is a prison. Iâ€™m tired of all the brain surgeries.I am 25F And I have a pain disorder called trigeminal neuralgia. Itâ€™s also called â€œthe suicide diseaseâ€, so you can guess why Iâ€™m here. I am tortured by left sided facial pain that is one of the worst pain disorders known to medicine.  

Iâ€™ve already had 2 craniotomies for this. I had brain surgery in February for this pain, and had a lot of initial pain relief. 2 weeks to the day after my surgery, I was in the shower and my mom found me on the shower floor screaming from the pain. She called an ambulance and I had cerebral final fluid POURING out of my nose. I was again in so much pain, not TN pain but different and very close to the level. I ended up having an emergency brain surgery because of the CSF leak and the bone wax they used to put my freaking SKULL together was failing!!! I coded TWICE during the second surgery and again after in the ICU. My mom came to be with me for my surgery from another state and she was fucking traumatized from all this. It ended up taking a team of  4 neurosurgeons you repair my skull, one of them said heâ€™d never seen anything like this. 

To make things worse, the pain is still there. I have a new boyfriend of 4 months who I ADORE but now he has to see me constantly in pain. The pain was less when we started dating, I thought I was over the hill. Heâ€™s literally asleep next to me right now and he just makes me so happy, but itâ€™s all tainted by tortuous pain. I would be the happiest girl in the world to have him sleeping next to me, but I canâ€™t be, because of the pain.

Iâ€™m having a radiation surgery this Wednesday to try use radiation to kill the nerve at the brain stem so it doesnâ€™t hurt as much. My boyfriend lives 5 hours away from me And 2 hours away from my neuro hospital, so Iâ€™m staying with him for a while to get through the radiosurgery and so he can support me. Heâ€™s a saint.

My main neurosurgeon has also noticed that some of the places in my brain where CSF fluid is due to the surgery is expanding, and I just am too emotionally exhausted to even think about that right now. I guess because I wonâ€™t know how much of a problem that will be until my imaging before my surgery Wednesday. 

You wanna hear the worst thing though? To me? Sometimes my ex-fiancÃ© would have to literally INTENTIONALLY HURT ME  by hitting me in the head over and over again during the worst episodes because it literally distracts me and makes the pain more manageable since all my pain senses arenâ€™t focused on the lightning in my face. Like, who actually lives like that? How fucking sad that my ex-fiancÃ© has to literally hurt me on purpose because I just hurt so bad? 

Itâ€™s hard for me to really fave and admit just how much I hurt every day. My job is a hospice caregiver. It is my deepest calling to heal hurting of others, not be a prisoner of it. It just doesnâ€™t make sense. I donâ€™t like to admit how much pain I am in, but everyone around me knows without me having to say anything. I spend hours just sobbing and screaming into a pillow because I just canâ€™t help it. I had a bad tooth abscess in high school and I thought that was the worst pain ever. GOD what I would GIVE to be suffering from that right now and not this. It is beyond imagination. I canâ€™t believe my entire life is wasted on this. 

I am having a rough night. Thank you for listening. I wish I wasnâ€™t so trapped in this body.
