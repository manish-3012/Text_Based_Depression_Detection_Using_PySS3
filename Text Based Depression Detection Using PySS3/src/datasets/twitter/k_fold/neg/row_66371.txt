Not much left for me to live for(19m) I'm tired of everything always bringing me down. I have goals and interests but have no interest in pursuing them cause in this void of a world I'm completely alone. I mean there are "people" in my life, however they don't know the real me or don't understand who I am. The relationships I actually put effort into never work out for me no matter what I do. No matter what happens it always seems that I'm the problem  and I should just remove myself from this world cause all I've managed to do is just be unique and cause diffuculty for the ones around me. Don't know how long it's gona take but I won't last very long ay this rate. Probably gonna end it by the end of next month.
