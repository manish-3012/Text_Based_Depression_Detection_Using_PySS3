I need to dieI am 29 years old, and a complete failure. I go to group therapy twice a week but all i do is talk and the therapists nod and are empathic. I dont think therapy works. I have a strong sense that i need to die now. I've converted to Islam 10 years ago and i met the love of my life 5 years ago. I would become a second wife, his first wife knew he would want to marry again before the marriage and accepted this she said. But she didnt really accepted it, she was very mean to me and very upset and thus i felt very guilty. I also felt so insecure about my body and my personality that it didnt work out and we never got married. Its now been 5 years later and i am still heartbroken. I know it is pathetic. I am filled with hatred and jealousy for this wife. For me they have the perfect family. I have none. I consist only of hatred in my heart. I hit myself and shake in my bed at night because i dont know what to do with myself. So much jealousy, so much hatred, so much loneliness. I know its stupid, but my heart does not follow. I also keep on bothering these people with e-mails. I am a stalker. So i think i need to die. But i am very scared of hellfire. I dont think ive any connection with God anymore so i dont think it will matter and i go to hell anyway. I hope there is only darkness after i die. But i cant do it still, its such a huge step and i chicken out every time i want to do it. But i know i need to die as i am a horrible person. Im thinking now tomorrow i have to drive to therapy again and i want to drive off the highway against a tree but i am afraid i wont die and end up in the hospital. I hope i find the courage tomorrow to try it.
