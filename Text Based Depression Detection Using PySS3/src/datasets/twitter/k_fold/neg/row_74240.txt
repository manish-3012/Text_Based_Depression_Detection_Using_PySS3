Suicide CorrespondenceI''m looking for help on my suicide notification. It's not a note. It's just a correspondence I'm sending out to a few people just beforehand.

Also, I'm a 'targeted individual' (the electronic thing, not schizophrenia) so I'm having a hard time rationalizing the message and how to :speak' to them. Meaning, I'm not mentally ill but no one understands this technology yet. So I feel like I need to blame it on something that they are able to understand.

I don't want to perpetuate the crime though.
