I need medication or elseI really need to find sth to stop feeling so bad.
I wanted to go see a doctor to get anxiety relievers medications but I can't let my parents know of it'll be worse for me.
So I tried to look by myself for any unprescribed anxiety medications but it's too confusing to choose between all those and having to wait at least a month to see results.

I used to wonder why would people take drugs,  drink alcohol or just jump off a cliff but now I think I finally understand
 
I don't think that they are any durable solution for me.
