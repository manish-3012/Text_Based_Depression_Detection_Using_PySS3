I can't get rid of the emptiness anymoreAs stated above, I just can't stand the void inside me anymore and don't find a reason to live. I've always had a rough and rather shitty life to live. I already made a post some time ago on /advice about my situation and it just keeps getting worse. If someone reads this and actually cares for whatever reason and also wants to read my story feel free to do so (I would link it but idk how). If someone has a tipp how and why to continue living, if it is only pain and I am talking about me waiting till my life is over rather than living it and starting to think about speeding death up and half trying it already.
If you did read all of this you are an awesome person and make other peoples life better and might even save them, maybe you can do the same for me somehow.
