Won't look at this after I post it.I attempted suicide 7 years ago. I was ready to leave. I was so mad at myself for what I did. I felt towards myself what I know everyone else felt toward me. It would just be easier without me around to constantly disappoint and let people down. Sure it would hurt everyone initially. But a few years later everyone would move on. And I'd be remembered for the good times. Instead of now being reminded of the bad ones. It's been a very hard fight since then. I've lived in the darkness and am constantly thinking about how much if even it'd affect the people around me. I like to think they'd be sad. I'd like to think theyd regret not being here for me. But the truth is. I'd just like to not think about anything. I'm spent. I'm a shell. I'm self destructing. Slowly. Suicide isn't killing yourself. It's not caring if you live or die.
