I'm heavily considering an overdose on PropranololHi. I'm really at my worst, I have treatment-resistant severe depression, severe generalised anxiety and Asperger's and am weighing up the odds of a Propranolol overdose working.

I have 103x 40mg tablets (4120mg), but have read that they're very lipophilic, so I've ordered some food, which I'm treating as my last meal.

All I want to know is: is there any pain involved and how could it go wrong. I've read some of the medical literature but haven't seen many posts about propranolol or beta-blockers specifically.

The only other things I have are a small amount of paracetamol, a bit of hyoscine butylbromide and a lot of diclofenac sodium and ibuprofen (at least 150 tablets combined) - I would have assumed propranolol would be my best bet.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.
