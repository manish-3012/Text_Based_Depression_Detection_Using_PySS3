This always makes me feel better, and I'd like to shareI hope nobody minds me posting something preemptively positive here.  I won't be offended if a mod wants to remove it.

I browse SW off and on.  Maybe one day I'll have to post here for myself on a non-throwaway account.  Hopefully not.

Anyway, I wanted to share this picture.  When I get those feelings I look at it and can't help to feel a little better, and it's that little bit that counts.

I know it's fantastical and fictional but still, there's a core truth there.
