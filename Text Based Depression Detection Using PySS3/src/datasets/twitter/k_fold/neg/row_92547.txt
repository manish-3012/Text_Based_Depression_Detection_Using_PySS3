...i donâ€™t even know if i want to post this but i feel like iâ€™m going no where in life iâ€™ve never dated a girl irl but iâ€™m watching all my friends progress while iâ€™m stuck my online friends have ceased to talk to me it seems and i have to text first and i donâ€™t even know if i want to tell my irl friends that iâ€™ve thought about slitting my wrists iâ€™m sure most of the people here donâ€™t care but i figure itâ€™s better to get this off my chest where nobody can see.
