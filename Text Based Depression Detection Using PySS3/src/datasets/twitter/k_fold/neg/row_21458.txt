She will never love me.I love her so much, for six years I've been obsessed with her. I'll never be enough for her. She deserves better than me and I know we would never work but she is always in my mind and dreams. For the past 7 months, I have had a dream every night about her but they always turn into nightmares, I no longer want to go to sleep at night. She really is devastating me. She goes out with some asshole, who is a better than me I guess. I used to love music but every song now reminds me of her. I went out with another girl recently but I ended it quickly, as I couldn't focus on the girl as I was just constantly thinking of her. I cry myself to sleep every night and I want to die. I will never be with her and i cant stand it much longer. I want to die, When i die she may love me.  - Just to note im not fully suicidal but it think it's getting there.
