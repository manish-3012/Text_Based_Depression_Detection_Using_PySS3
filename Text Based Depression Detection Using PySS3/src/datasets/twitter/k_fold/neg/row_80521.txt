LostMy sense of reality is completely gone. If anyone compliments me about anything I immediately think they are lying to me out of pity. I question all of my thoughts and actions now, never really trusting my own feelings. I have a BS in physics but I struggle finding work because I doubt my abilities at every turn, which I'm sure comes through in interviews. I used to be in grad school but I ended up failing out. While I was in undergrad I got amazing grades but my confidence problems started between undergrad and grad. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time which didn't help (thankfully I'm out of that now). Im a tutor right now but the pay isn't the best and is dependent on kids being in school (spring break for me this year was rough). I would love something more but it feels like there are no full time jobs out there for me. I have to go off my parents insurance this year and I have chronic medical conditions that require biweekly doctor visits and many prescriptions. If I can't take my medicene I will die. I'm worried I won't be able to afford insurance by myself. I feel like if I can just find a decent enough job then I can get insurance and save my life. But I also don't believe in my abilities enough to find such a job. So I feel like I'm just waiting around to die in June. And it really just begs the question: why wait?
