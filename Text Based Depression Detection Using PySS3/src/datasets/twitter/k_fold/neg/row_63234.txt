I'm really really tired. I don't want tod this anymore.I'm just patiently waiting for my mother to pass away so my death wouldn't bother her. She's the only person in this world who cares about me, and that's only because I'm her son not because of my nonexistent qualities. And honestly sometimes I see her a chain or a bother for preventing me from killing myself. 


I've been staring at my phone for 2 hours thinking of what to write in hopes of delivering the message I'm trying to, and this is all I could come up with. Even my cry for help is pathetic.
