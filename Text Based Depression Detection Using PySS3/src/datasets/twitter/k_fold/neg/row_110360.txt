Lost the will to liveHello there

I've had it with my life, I simply want to stop existing or you can say I've lost the will to live, funny to say I was never like this I was the one always pushing people forward/having a positive attitude about starting over I've done it over and a over with a go getter attitude and a smile on my face, but today it's different i'm writing this with my mind fully intact and i'm of sound mind not crying not being emotional about it I just finally took the decision that I should end my life why would I? if the past 31 years taught me something is that i'm a failure in every aspect whether it's work i don't have a steady job i keep jumping from one company to another for the slightest reasons/My family hates me they don't say it much but I can feel it or at least they just don't care if i'm here or not I don't believe it would make that much of a difference my mother keeps saying that i'm useless to them anyway/relationship LOL i've been with many girls too many to count anyway and i finally came to the conclusion that no woman in her right mind would be with me I'm unbearable just like my mother says always short tempered and impulsive they just say this is due to my ADHD but I just know better no woman will ever love me for being who I am

Recently i deactivated all my social media accounts switched off my phone so I can focus on more on how am I going to do it also to avoid anymore pain coming from having to deal with my friends, family members I've been researching suicide methods for a while now but i'm scared that i'll fail and i'll have to look them in the eye while they're giving me pathetic looks or asking me why did I do it? I don't really want to be in this situation, my father before me committed suicide in his own way by refusing to have a heart surgery that will basically save his life and kept on going for 8 months dying slowly by smoking and living pretending everything is OK, the thought that my father had to endure all of this pain just to die makes me even more depressed they say it isn't true that he wanted to do die but I know better, i don't want to have to wait till i get a chronic illness and die i just want it to to be over with I just hate my life and wish to end it all, I've acquired over a 100 sleeping pills and my plan is to crush them all into an alcoholic beverage  and drinking it, I hope it works and that I don't wake up in a coma in some hospital.
