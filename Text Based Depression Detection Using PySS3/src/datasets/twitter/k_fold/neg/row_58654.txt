Jesus Christ, guys, you are not helpful.As a semi-suicidal person(I don't want to be alive, but I don't want to die, I just want for an accident to happen to me, but I'll save that for another thread later) I can quite honestly say that only a few rare comments(like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/18ua12/give_me_courage_to_do_it/c8i90gq) one) can actually provide any help and discourage some people from making a final blow. In the majority of cases, it's comments like:

&gt;stay in this world. There are soo much things you didnt do or saw. You have the honor To live. Go out. Walk around listen to the birds watch the beatiful nature. No one ever could take you the beatifulness of the nature. Life is wonderful. Set a goal. Try to do things you would love to do. Hope you will be fine again. Everyone will help you and with this post you shows that you want help. There are soo many people in the world that want to be your friend.

&gt;You should try going for a walk. Think of nothing but the birds and others sounds of nature around you. It will clear your head. Also find one person who you trust to listen even if it's not your family and talk to them about your problems. It will get a big weight off of your chest and you may even find that they don't hate you as much as you think

&gt;Such infinite minutia to enjoy on this planet. We are on the cusp of witnessing an awakening of minds to each others, a true understanding of life, and not distractions.

&gt;You are not unwanted, you are not useless, and You are obviously not stupid. To be honest, I don't trust meds. Never have, never will. Worked for a few people I know. I never needed them.
I'm sorry you feel so down. You shouldn't be unhappy. I know that feeling of losing control, and it happens to all of us. Depression is hard to deal with, but death isn't the way to deal with it.

And so on. Let me clear something for yourself - we do not want to do anything. We don't want to wait. We don't want to see unseen. We don't want to enjoy nature. The only thing we want *is to feel happy*, and usual human activities *do not make us happy*.

See, the average human mindset really differs from depressed and, especially, suicidal person. Average humans starts his day by waking up, stretching a little bit, saying hello to sunshine and everyone who lives nearby him, and then proceeds to do his chores. Suicidal person is woken up by feeling intense pain, both physical and mental. He lays on his bed. Maybe for a half of hour. Maybe for an hour. Alone with his thoughts, his hatred on life. And if the intense urge to go to the toilet defeats him - he stands up, barely resisting to scream from soreness in his limbs and eyes. 

See the difference? 

By the way - being suicidal does not makes you highly knowledgeable about the topic, either. Every one is suicidal for their own reasons.

**EDIT2:**I wish I could change the title. From one of my replies:

&gt;The community is very nice and strong. I like it. But it is not always helpful, and it is not helpful quite frequently, and that's what I'm talking about.
