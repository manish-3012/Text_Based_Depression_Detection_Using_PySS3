I feel genuinely uselessI'm going to college for the sole purpose of not getting kicked out of the house. I have zero motivation to actually do well in any of my classes outside of a passing interest in maintaining a decent GPA. Classes are getting hard enough that I can't really scoot by anymore, plus tuition was 6K this year. I keep trying to think about the future for motivation, but I don't see anything in my future. I haven't had any friends for the past few years, I don't even remember how long it has been. I have zero social skills, zero marketability, and I don't feel like I'll ever get out of this. I'll remain a leech to society, as far as I'm concerned, and I don't think anything I can do can fix the way I am. The greatest contribution I can make is to just end it all, and I think about this daily now.
