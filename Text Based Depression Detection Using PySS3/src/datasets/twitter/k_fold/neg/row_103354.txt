Iâ€™ve been cursed with the ugly diseaseApt of older people or my friends will Iâ€™m pretty but I know they do that out of pity. If I was maybe Iâ€™d feel good enough to stand the sight of myself in the mirror. If I was maybe I wouldnâ€™t be insecure being around my friends. Iâ€™m a fat ugly bitch with a face no one will ever love.
