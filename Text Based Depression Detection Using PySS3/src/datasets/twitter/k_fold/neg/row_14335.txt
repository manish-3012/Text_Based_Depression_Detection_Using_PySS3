I'm this closeI can't breathe; I'm choking on this lump in my throat. I want to be normal. I want to be happy. I want to love, be loved, to smile and mean it. I want to be able to do that one fucking thing right but even that's too much to ask. I tried, didn't I? Did I?

I've spent a long time thinking this through. "This'd work, that'd work". I've tried twice. Both times I failed. Third time lucky, I believe they say.

"Think of your family. How distraught would they be?" Not very, it would seem. I fought a fucking war to get on therapy because I wanted to fucking try. It took me in hospital to get on therapy. I'm not making that mistake again. I don't know what I'm meant to do that I've not already tried.
