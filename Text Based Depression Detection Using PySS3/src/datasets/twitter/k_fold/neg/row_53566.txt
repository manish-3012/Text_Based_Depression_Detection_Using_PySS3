I'm not sure how i can live. i needed a place to express this.I don't want to talk to anyone in real life about this. I need a place to vent. Everything is beginning to seem insurmountable. 

I'm autistic, and i really don't think i can cope with life. What is just a little difficult for other people is impossible for me. I wasn't able to cope in school, everything was overwhelming and I couldn't organize myself. 

 I'm almost 22 and i still have no qualifications. Getting a job, even a part time job feels terrifying and impossible. I don't see how i'd be able to manage it.  I'm really unable to navigate being social. it's tremendously difficult for me to maintain friendships. Last year, two of my closest friends decided that they didn't want to talk to me anymore. They asked me to stop speaking to them. It has affected me really badly, i think it might be my fault, but i'm not sure. i trusted them completely. i've been unable to let it go and have developed a lot of anxiety. 

I had a terrible time with depression after i left school when i was a teenager. it consumed my whole experience. i think it nearly killed me. It was the worst pain i could ever imagine. I'm beginning to feel like that again. I am still able to go through the motions, but i'm starting to feel hollowed out. Noises and lights hurt my skin. I'm worried about a relapse. I know I wouldn't survive it a second time. 

i have friends now and i know that they care about me, but i'm not sure i could really explain anything to them. I don't think i want to anymore. I don't see how i could cope with any real pain in my life, being so sensitive to everything. I don't see a future for myself. i don't have any plans, I don't want to do anything. the thought of actually living is terrifying to me. i don't want to be in pain anymore.
