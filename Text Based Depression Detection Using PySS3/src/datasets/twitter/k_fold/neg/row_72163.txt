I think Iâ€™m gonna kill myself next weekToday I had a realization. A bittersweet realization. Iâ€™m going to kill myself one day, and I think I will do it next week. I just hope I build up the courage, though Iâ€™ll most likely force myself to do it. After years of struggling alone through depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts etc. I have come to the conclusion that this is what my life is and this is how itâ€™s always going to be. Iâ€™ve reached out for help several different times through several different ways, but nothing ever works and now Iâ€™m done. I say itâ€™s bittersweet because thereâ€™s a part of me that does want to live and see where life would go or if I would actually ever accomplish anything. But I think itâ€™s safe to say that Iâ€™d much rather die than continue to live this life. For the first time in a long time I feel at peace, like Iâ€™m in control of something. I can finally be in control of something in my life. I might make a post saying goodbye before I do it because well, for the past few weeks Reddit has been my only source of joy and Iâ€™ve met so many kind people on here. I know this is kinda extra and I actually didnâ€™t have to do this, but I guess Iâ€™m just trying to share my feelings, like Iâ€™ve been doing on here. Thankyou for reading if you read this far, and you donâ€™t have to try to convince me to change my mind, I think Iâ€™ve made my decision. I just hope it works, but Iâ€™ll probably update if it doesnâ€™t or if for some bizarre reason I change my mind or chicken out. Thankyou for reading thisâ¤ï¸ just wanted to get this off of my chest I guess because I have no where else to share it really.
