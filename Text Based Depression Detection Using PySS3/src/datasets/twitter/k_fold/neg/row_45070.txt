How to help a suicidal friend across the country from me?So I personally am not depressed, but one of my best friends who I have known for years is. About a week or two ago, he told me that his depression has gotten worse and he attempted suicide, and I talked with him about it hoping it would make him feel better, but I feel like I didn't do much. He is thankfully still here but I am beginning to worry for him. Me being west coast and him being east coast I don't really know what else I can do other than talk with him about his problems. Is there anything else I can do if I fear he may take his own life?
