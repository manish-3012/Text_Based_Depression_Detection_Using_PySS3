Someone, please take care of my animals.3 cats (2 that are &lt;1 year: and one that Reddit saved, you guys are awesome), an 18 yr old cat, and a 3 year old Chiweenie. I cannot continue like this but they are the most important things in my life. They need love. They deserve love.m

I understand what my passing will put them through and I am truly sorry for that, but I cannot continue with this life.  

Fuck worker's comp, fuck my friends that say I've changed because of my injury.

I didn't ask for this but these were cards I was dealt.

I'm sorry for not being stronger. I feel so much shame but after 6 years of this, something that was not my fault, I cannot find it in me to go on.  I have been decimated by the CA worker's comp system. I lost everything and I don't,  I can't continue.

It's been 1.5 years since I've seen a comp doctor. I suffer from PTSD, severe depression and severe anxiety.  

I am a shell of the person I used to be.  

I've lost everything and I have nothing at 33 yrs old.

Just make sure my animals go to loving homes. That's all I want
