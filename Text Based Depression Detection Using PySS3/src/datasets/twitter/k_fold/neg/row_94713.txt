I don't knowA student at my university committed suicide a few weeks ago.  I didn't know her at all but it's really shaken me up.  I can't confidently say "no, I am not considering self-harm or suicide" anymore.  

The intrusive thoughts are there.  "You know, you could just take that entire Costco-sized bottle of ibuprofen."  "What would people say if I killed myself today?"  I never had intrusive thoughts like these ever.  I don't know if it's a valid concern or if I'm just worrying about not wanting to be suicidal.

My counselor today asked me what I live for and I couldn't give an answer.  I don't find any joy in anything at all.  I feel like a worthless waste of space.  I don't do anything for anyone.  I don't contribute to friendships or family.  I have a net negative impact on the world, and I don't even experience anything positive from it.  The fact that I couldn't name anything really freaked me out and I can't stop thinking about it.

I feel completely hopeless.  I realize that tomorrow I'm going to wakeup and feel just as pointless as I did today, and the same will happen on Sunday, and Monday, and so on.  I can't imagine myself living life or doing anything, even just a few months from now.  I'm supposed to start medical school in the fall, and I have no idea how I'll ever have the motivation and concentration to handle the work, or how I'll make friends, or how I'll keep my cool around sick and dying people.

I don't think I want to kill myself.  I don't want anyone to miss me, or to cause pain, or for anyone to talk about me if I was gone.  I just want to disappear, plain and simple.  I want to not exist and never have existed.
