I feel like the invisible man.Sometimes I donâ€™t want to die. Death seems so scary and gives me anxiety but not today and not for last few months. 
I feel like Iâ€™ve gotten more and more invisible everyday. The more depressed Iâ€™ve gotten the less people see me. Maybe Iâ€™ve done it to myself, I donâ€™t know. 
Everyone always has something better then me. Everyone. Maybe Iâ€™m just so sad I bring nothing to the table anymore. 
I spend so much time being in my own head, Iâ€™ve lost my best friends. 
I feel like it would be easier to not feel sad, to not feel like a let down, a failure. Right now I feel so sad so lost so incomplete that being dead would be the same empty void I feel but without the sadness. 
Kurt V said it best â€œEverything was beautiful and nothing hurtâ€ and thatâ€™s all I want right now is for nothing to hurt.
