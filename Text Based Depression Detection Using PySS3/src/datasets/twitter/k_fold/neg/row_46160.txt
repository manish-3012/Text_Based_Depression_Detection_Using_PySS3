Family isn't the reason I'm still here.I've been suicidal for 2 years, 3 attempts and one nearly worked. I'm not really sure why I started feeling like this. I haven't had in-real-life friends in quite a while, probably a year-and-a-half. So maybe it was that, feeling of loneliness.

My family aren't supportive and I rarely speak to them. The only think keeping me alive is the fact that I'm scared of death and as of late, I'm not even that scared of it anymore. I'm not sure how much I want to die anymore, I just don't want to have this mindset anymore.
