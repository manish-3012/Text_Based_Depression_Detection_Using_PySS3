I'm tired of lifeI've had a sit life so far. From growing up super poor in an abusive family, to watching friends die or get hurt bad, to being basically destined to be alone for the rest of my life. It won't be tonight i need the supplies but I've been thinking about this for a long time. So hey im just another asshole on the street that is officially tired of life, AMA! T minus 24 hours and 5 minutes.
