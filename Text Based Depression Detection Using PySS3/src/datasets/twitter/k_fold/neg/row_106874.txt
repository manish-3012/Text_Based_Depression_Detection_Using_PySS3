I'm so tired of the waitingI go from having horrible anxiety to just wanting to die every week. Every time I talk to anyone, they just say "wait it out and you'll feel better." What's the point of fucking waiting it out when I just go back to feeling like I want to die every single time. It gets worse and worse and nobody seems to even care.  I know it's not their responsibility to make me feel better but it just hurts worse every day and there's nothing anyone including myself can do about it at all.  I've wanted to kill myself since I was 12 and I'm 20 now, this problem is never going to go away until I die.
