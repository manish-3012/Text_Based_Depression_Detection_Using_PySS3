I don't know what else to do.I've battled with depression and suicide for a long time now. Back when I was a kid, I had a brother that died and I had counseling for a long time because of it. It almost ruined my life. It's been 10 years since, and for better or worse, I've been doing pretty good. I've got a job, I've traveled, I've learned things, and overall not a bad life. But it's always been alone. About a year ago I met this amazing girl. We were damn good together, and it seemed like we wanted all the same things in life. She moved in about 6 months ago. Fast forward to 2 week ago. We had a really big fight. She left and started living with her ex-husband. I did tons of apologizing and asked her to move back in. For the past 2 weeks of her not being here, there's been this sadness about me that I haven't felt in 10 years. We talked again just yesterday, in which she made it clear that she didn't consider us to be in a relationship, and the only way she would even consider thinking about starting up again is if I support her and comfort her for the things that she wants. My first reaction to this is feeling manipulated, in which case I do the exact opposite of what she's expecting. And that is making me feel like I'm crazy. I spent all yesterday a crying heap on the couch, and she takes that as a selfish act and adding stress to her life which is not what she needs. 

I need her in my life. I'm not looking for "Oh, there's plenty of other girls out there" or anything around those lines. I need to know if I'm crazy or not. I need to know that I am compatible with, or part of, this world.
