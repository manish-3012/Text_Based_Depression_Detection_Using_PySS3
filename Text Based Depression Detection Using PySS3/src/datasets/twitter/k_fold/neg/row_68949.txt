iâ€™m gonna fucking kill myself, no one fucking cares about me and iâ€™m actually done. iâ€™ve finally snapped:)donâ€™t say u care abt me, youâ€™ve never even met me. you donâ€™t know the first thing about me. sure, you might care a little bit about someone dying, but thatâ€™s just bc itâ€™s in ur DNA to care. humans are built with empathy for other humans. were made to be at least a little sad when someone dies, regardless if we knew them or not. you donâ€™t really care abt my life, though, you just donâ€™t want a dead person on ur conscience. and i get it, really, but itâ€™s too late for me. some people arenâ€™t meant to get better.

i honestly didnâ€™t think iâ€™d make it this long. iâ€™m not going to a mental hospital bc my eating disorder got bad again and iâ€™ll be forced to eat three meals a day and wonâ€™t  be able to do my workouts, so iâ€™ll just get more depressed. i have no friends and my family doesnâ€™t care about me, my therapy and PHP program arenâ€™t helping me anymore. i feel so empty and lonely all the time, like iâ€™m in a deep pit. my derealization makes me feel like iâ€™m going insane, and fuck i probably am. anyways iâ€™m done with this life, it wasnâ€™t meant for me. see u on the other side
