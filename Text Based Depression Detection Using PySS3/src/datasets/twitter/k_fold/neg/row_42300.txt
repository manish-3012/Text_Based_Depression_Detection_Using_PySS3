Struggling with legal stress, fearSo, to keep it brief, a few months ago I found out I was being investigated for something that I had no idea I'd done. Accessing material online, you can use your imagination. It put me in a state of total shock and it took me weeks to start functioning again.

Like a lot of people, I've spent a lot of time online looking at things in quantities that probably aren't very healthy for me, but, none of it illegal. I know for absolute definite that I've never intentionally accessed anything of that nature. Regardless, the information the police have revealed to me seems credible, so I feel terrified. And since I never expected this to happen, there's years worth of browsing history on my computer. I'm not attracted to that kind of thing and I fully understand the stigma associated with it, which makes me even more mortified by it. I now feel guilt over looking at totally legal porn because that's all I remember doing and I feel like that's what I'm being investigated for. I guess it doesn't help that it's kind of a very private thing you don't talk about so there's some shame associated with it anyway. It's extremely confusing and I have to keep consciously reminding myself that it's not about that.

They estimated that the investigation will be completed within about a month. I have had on and off suicidal thoughts through this. I don't think I'm brave enough to do it right now. There is no need right now. But I feel like there's a clock rapidly ticking down on me being able to continue with my 'normal' life.

I'm scared.
