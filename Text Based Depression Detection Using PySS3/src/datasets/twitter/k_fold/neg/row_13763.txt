Sad, tired and just want to ventEver since I was a kid, I've feel like I'm really a woman in a man's body. I don't know if it's because it seemed like my parents would pay more attention to my older and younger sisters, or because I just hate the stigma about how men have to be strong and can't show any emotion. Well, I'm a very emotional person, and most times, I really just want to be held and told that everything's going to be fine. Instead, I'd cry and wish everything would end. 

Personally, it feels cruel how I ended up. I want to be in a relationship, but I'm emotionally and physically abusive. I've destroyed thousands of dollars worth of equipment. I want to be average, instead I got gynecomastia along with a tiny dick and balls. So, I try to fill the hole with extravagant spending, and try to fill my life with shallow happiness, but at the end of the day, I'd still lay on my back, feeling empty inside. I'd think of where I want to be in the future and I'd see that I want what I can't have: someone to share my life with. I'm working hard right not to graduate college, to have a decent future, but I'm just feeling tired. Why am I working so hard, just so I can work in the future, and still die old and alone? Sometimes, I want to just attach an oxygen mask to a helium tank and sleep forever. Maybe that way, I could skip years and feel happy.
