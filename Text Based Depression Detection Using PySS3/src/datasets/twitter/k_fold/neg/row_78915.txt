Still not sure if I should dieJust a little sample

I didn't start out with too much, I wish I could just be like the other people, with perfect mental health, I hate living with my condition, I don't even know myself anymore so I choose to drink my problems away whilst hiding my drinking from family and friends, I hate living my life, why couldn't I be born into a different life, a stable household and functioning family.

Everyone I talk to says it gets better, this is not what's happening. For the past 2 years I've tried everything I could to get ahead only to be held back by social anxiety, shitty parental support and I guess plain old bad luck.

I was served a shit hand, it really won't matter if I'm gone, if anyone stopped to check in on me maybe I'd feel like I'm worth something, well, I hope you start to talk about me to all of your friends for attention, start to pretend like you care, you're all just as selfish as me.

I don't care for the daily grind anymore, getting nowhere in life, doing nothing with my limited time on this earth. 

I wish I had a good job and a car, then I could believe that I was making a difference and not being a fucking leech to the system, I could drive places and get out of this fucking house every now and again

I hate my grandparents for being such lazy, self destructive, hypocritical selfish pieces of shit, especially when my grandmother takes her frustration and problems caused by a lifetime of knowingly making bad decisions and not giving a fuck about the future out on me, and blames me and other people for everything wrong in her life instead of taking responsibility for her actions, fuck you, you lazy angry bitch of a cow

I don't really have much to leave to anyone because I'm such a poor cunt, I guess I'll just have to leave you with the burden of my suicide.

I hope I was a good son, brother, mate, partner, grandson, student.
No one could have done anything to stop me feeling this way, I'm too scared to say anything out of fear for being judged as weak or crazy.

I'll catch you later, have a great oneðŸ‘

I'm not sure who I'm going to leave this to, or when I'm going to do it but i hope my method is effective enough to make sure I'm dead before someone finds me and the ambos come
