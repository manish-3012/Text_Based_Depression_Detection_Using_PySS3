I THINK I'VE LIVED LONG ENOUGH!My birthday is in a few weeks and I think by then would be the right time to end my life. I'm trying to decide how though (whether by overdose, self-inflicted damage, jumping in front of a fast moving vehicle, etc).

I honestly have nothing going for me. I feel like I'm reaching a dead end in my life. At each age group, I've always had something: elementary school, middle school, high school, college, etc. And now, I don't know what else to do. I'm about to graduate college, but nowadays, a degree hardly means anything. These aren't the 90s or early 2000s, so you need to get real with me on this.

I can't afford graduate school or a car and in terms of getting a job, I always get the cold shoulder because of my limited (meaning hardly any) work history. If I can't support myself by now, then what does that say for myself? And I'm not looking to seek out government assistance as I have been on it for quite some time and I still feel limited by it.

How do I expand my horizons? I don't know where to go from here. It just amazes me how many people are able to be consumers and how many have jobs and yet I can't even land one that is below my requirements. In addition to that, it depresses me even more that I have to apply for a job below my qualifications. The idea is depressing and the actuality of it is as well. I'm on a downward spiral and it doesn't seem to end. HELP!
