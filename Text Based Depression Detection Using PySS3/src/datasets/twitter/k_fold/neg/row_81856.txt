I cant stop thinking about how much better iâ€™d feel if i was deadmy anxiety is causing me physical pain. iâ€™ve been throwing up constantly, always have headache, stomachache.. sharp pain throughout my body whenever i have even a small amount of stress. my mind keeps filling with thoughts that i wouldnâ€™t feel pain anymore if i just died.
