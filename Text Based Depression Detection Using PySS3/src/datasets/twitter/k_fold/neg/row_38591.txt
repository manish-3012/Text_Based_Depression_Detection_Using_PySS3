I want to admit myself *sorry itâ€™s so long*I want to but I feel like im not, I donâ€™t know, bad enough? 

Pretty much all I think about everyday is suicide. All the different ways I could do it and stuff like that. I know I have access to pretty much everything I would need from what Iâ€™ve planned in my head and most days I really want to go through with it. 

My anxiety gets pretty bad some days. I get anxious whenever I leave the house so I usually try to stay in my room or only be out of the house for a little bit. I havenâ€™t had an appetite for months, Iâ€™ve lost about 10lbs I think. I canâ€™t sleep, it either I wake up in the middle of the night and canâ€™t go back to sleep or Iâ€™m like half asleep the whole time Iâ€™m sleeping(which isnâ€™t very long) so itâ€™s not a very satisfying rest. 

Iâ€™m failing school, Iâ€™m just so tired. I canâ€™t focus, itâ€™s not even just school, I canâ€™t focus on anything! I used to love reading, now I just donâ€™t enjoy it and canâ€™t focus when I try to get back into it. Canâ€™t even watch tv, not interested in anything. 

My panic attacks are getting worse too. Last night I had a pretty bad panic attack about school, some other stuff happened that kinda escalated it but I ended up with a pounding headache, scratched up face, and puking my insides out. It was mostly stomach acid and water cuz I have a hard time eating. I can usually handle my panic attacks by myself without bothering anyone but itâ€™s getting harder. 

I havenâ€™t washed any laundry in like 4-5 months maybe. All my dressers are completely empty, I have 3 over piled baskets of dirty clothes that litter a big chunk of my room and 1 basket thatâ€™s halfway filled with cleanish clothes. I tend to wear the same clothes for days or weeks on end. My nightstand and bed are covered in like trash and stuff. I know itâ€™s gross but I just canâ€™t do it. 

Sometimes I do things that I know I shouldnâ€™t be doing, especially with strangers from the internet. I donâ€™t meet up with them but I do make plans to just in case I ever wanted to get away from everything. I send pictures and say things that I would never normally send or say(sexual shtuff). Iâ€™m kinda really obsessed with using fake names and stuff, I use my real pictures but different names. I feel like I can be whoever I want and itâ€™s really addictive to me. But anyways, Iâ€™ve been doing this kind of stuff since I was like 7/8, kinda strange. 

Sometimes I think Iâ€™m going crazy cuz I think I see bugs out of the corner of my eye but when I turn to look nothing is there. Also, I feel like I hear things that arenâ€™t real but like idk maybe Iâ€™m making it up or something. 

I talk to a therapist occasionally and I am on medication for anxiety and depression, not really doing anything for me. I know somethings might not work out and you have to try different medications and stuff like that but Iâ€™m so tired of waiting. 

This isnâ€™t how I wanted this to go so sorry if itâ€™s all over that place or doesnâ€™t make sense, I get it just kinda turned into more of a venting type of thing.  

But back to my main point, I want to admit myself but I feel like im not, bad enough? I just feel like I donâ€™t really have a reason to feel the way I do and that I just feel stupid for being sad and stuff over nothing. Could they even help me in there? I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Is it something that I should even bring up to anyone or is it useless? What do I do?
