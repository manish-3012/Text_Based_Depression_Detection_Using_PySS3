Around family again but Im still lonely and suicidalI dont usually get suicidal when im sober but I cant help but stare at this new box of sleeping pills and want to do it. Ive been hiding in my room at my grandparents house crying all day. 

Ive been alone for a couple months at my apartment and Im finally back here for the holidays and I feel even worse here with my family around. I feel like such a lonely fucking loser who only has her fucking grandparents and mom to talk to. Seeing all my old school friends spending time with friends and bfs and some of them even having kids already. Seeing them get married and get houses and Im 21 and unemployed and on academic probation and my self esteem has went to shit and to add the cherry on top of that, when i came back and saw my brother he basically yelled I was ugly and I actually felt prettyish today. Im so scared to leave the house because I dont want to be judged which is why i havent left my apartment in months prior to today. 

Im not sure if I want to kill myself and have my grandma go through three deaths in December ( 2 covid deaths of her mom and brother) but I cant keep myself alive and suffering so that other people are happy. I truly think that tonight is my last day though.
