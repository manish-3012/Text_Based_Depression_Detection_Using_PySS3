I have so many things to be happy about, but I need to die, the urge is eating at me stronger than ever..I think I became a regular on this sub.. I'm so sorry for all of you who are struggling, I wish I could take the pain away from each one once I go..

My poor parents, who wished to have a child so much, who showered me with love and affection, who gave so much, I am so fucking sorry for them, because the last thing I want is to cause them pain.. but I can't anymore. Mommy, I can't, my love for you is endless, but I've tried meds, I've tried talking, I just don't want to hurt anymore.

You guys are all so wonderful, I honestly, I swear I wish none of you had to go through this.. my heart breaks for all of us.
