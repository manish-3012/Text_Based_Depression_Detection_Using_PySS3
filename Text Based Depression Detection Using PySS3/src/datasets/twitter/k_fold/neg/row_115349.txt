I'm going to die aloneI go on dates occasionally but it always ends the same way. With the girl saying she doesn't see it going anywhere. There must be something wrong with me. I am always a gentleman. Pay for dinner, open doors, walk on the side closest to the street. I have a good personality. It must be because of my weight. I just don't want to exist anymore.
