I'm done.I've been in therapy for 3 years.  I've gone to inpatient.  I've tried numerous cocktails of meds.  I've got only one friend, I have my kids 50% of the time, I have a dog and cat.  But it's just not enough.  I'm struggling just to keep my head above water.  I have no interests, no desires, no goals.  Responsibilities have been the only thing keeping me going.  I'm tired.  It's time to get everything in order so I can go through with it.
