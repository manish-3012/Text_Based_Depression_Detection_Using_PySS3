I'm empty but still suffering, numb but in pain.I don't want to make you listen to my sob story or waste your time. I think I'm finally done and I'm crying but I'm also excited and I think I might be happy. I can't wait for it all to be over. 
I have a plan but I am wondering how hard it would be to simply cut one of my major arteries with a extremely sharp razor.
