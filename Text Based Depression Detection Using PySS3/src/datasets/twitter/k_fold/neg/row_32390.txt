I just feel numb at this pointI don't know what to do at this point honestly. I want to die but I'm too afraid and apathetic to actually go through with anything. I'm 24 and still live with my parents, I hate my job, and I'm physically and emotionally abused nearly everyday by my almost 30 year old brother, who doesn't live at home but just hangs out here all the time, I guess to torment me. I'm lucky if I wake up before noon on any given day, since I work at home. I can feel myself slipping. I'm getting worse at everything I do. I've always struggled with my weight and now am the fattest I've ever been. I'm so ugly and unlikable and I basically never leave the house so showering is an afterthought at this point.  I self harm frequently and the scars have only gotten bigger at this point because I want someone to notice. I have no friends except for one who lives an hour away from me and I can tell he's tired of listening to me complain about my life. My parents hate me and resent me for living at home still and constantly telling them I need them to stop my brother's abuse towards me. No one will miss me when I'm gone except for my dog and even she'll forget me in time so I'm trying not to feel bad about that. I wish I could change my life and genuinely try to make things better but it's too hard to even get out bed, much less try and make a change for myself when I know there's no point to it.
