I can't buy a gun, and now my suicide plan is fucked.So in Ohio, if you've been to a mental institution involuntarily , you can't buy a gun and i've been twice already. My plan was months in the making and now it fucking crumbled. Now, because of this damn world, i have to inflict even more pain on myself by either hanging or jumping. Awesome.
