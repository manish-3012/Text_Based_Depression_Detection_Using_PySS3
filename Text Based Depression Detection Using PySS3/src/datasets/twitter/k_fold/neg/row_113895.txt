FEELING ON EDGEI'm feeling extremely on edge like I just want to hurt myself very badly or end my life. I don't know who I am anymore, or what to do. So many fucked up things have happend and I've been pretending I'm okay for a very long time. I'm trying to fight the urges, it is so difficult. I just need to vent, I feel so alone, so worthless, like no one gives a fuck if I died any day now. I hate myself so much and I feel like I'm going insane. I'm so lost and broken and scared. I just want to cry, scream, lose control. But instead I have to act okay and pretend and smile. No one knows how I feel, I keep it all to myself. I'm scared one day soon I will end my life.
