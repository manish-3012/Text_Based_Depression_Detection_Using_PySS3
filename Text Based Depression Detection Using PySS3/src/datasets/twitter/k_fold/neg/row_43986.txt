I am not compatible with lifeEven the most mundane things any human being should find easy to accomplish, I find extremely hard. Eating is hard bc I suffer from eating disorders, talking to people is hard bc of my severe social anxiety (not that I talk to people anymore, I hate all humanity with burning passion, can't help myself), I even seem to have problem with the easiest things like dressing for the weather. Everything is a struggle for me. I live in extreme poverty because my anxiety and not being able to handle loud noises makes it hard for me to find a job. Also, the only person who loves me unconditionally is dying. My life is a living hell, I can't describe it any other way. I know that a stronger person would be able to find some way out but I'm weak feel like giving up. I'm leaching off of hard working mother who hates me because she sees me as the parasite I am. I'm so tired. I want to leave my physical body and just fly away. Sorry for such a long post, I know no one wants to read this crap
