A moment of your time fellow redditors...It's been many months now that I've been struggling with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. Initially I felt as though I was blowing small things out of proportion and failing to see the bigger picture. I tend to be the kind of person who internalizes all their problems and don't really talk about any serious issues with anyone else. I'm not really sure what I would accomplish by making this post, but I guess it's a cry for help..

I feel like my best days are behind me and I don't really have anything positive to provide to society. I feel useless and all the potential I saw in myself has dissipated. I just feel like I'm a burden to everyone around me, and the facade I put on of being "normal" is just too much to bear now. Forgive me as I'm not completely sober right now and my mind is rushing with numerous thoughts. The only thing that's keeping me from following through with the act of suicide is the mess it would leave for my family and friends, but I've been doing my best to slowly cut off ties and alienate myself; in hopes that it would lessen the aftermath of my last act as a conscious being. I've spent months.. no, years abusing drugs to alleviate the feeling of hopelessness, but even that is now losing its effectiveness. I've read a lot of the self-help stuff regarding this issue, and although it provides temporary assurance of the value of my life, it doesn't take long for that to disappear and reality to set in. Once again I have no clue as to what this will accomplish, but it is cathartic to write it all out. 

Thank you for your time.
