What is it like after contemplating suicide and nearly attempting it?One of my friends was went through an episode and was nearly committed to killing himself. He wasnâ€™t in the process of it and lived, it was just that he was basically one thought away from doing it and on the edge of: keep living or attempt suicide. I just want to hear if u guys have experienced the same things directly just so I can try to understand whatâ€™s going on from that point of view
