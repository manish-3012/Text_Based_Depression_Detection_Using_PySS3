Would people envy a 30yo outcast shy loner with $250K net worth or pity him?I'm 32 with a $250K net worth which according to online calculators would place me around the 95th percentile for NW in my age range. While that may be impressive for a man if everything else in his was normal, that's not the case for me

Other than that high NW and the fact that I've traveled to nearly 10 countries, I don't have much going for myself. I've been bullied and ostracized many times in school and in the workplace. I have many gaps in my resume due to being fired or quitting early jobs due to being bullied. 

Also, while that NW and my $100K job may seem like a lot, for people who also work as software engineers at my age, alot of them are making at least double that since they likely don't have any gaps in their resume and weren't bullied out of jobs

Also, I still struggle with shyness, depression, social anxiety, and literally have no friends. I just have acquaintances I've met from meetup groups. I've never even had a girlfriend. More girls have shown my pity than they've shown romantic interest

I believe I have pretty severe PTSD from all the past bullying. I've seen numerous therapists and none of them have really helped.

Alot of times I struggle with even having motivation to live. I've literally met only a few people who have been as shy, friendless, softspoken or depressed as me

I'd like honest feedback as to whether people would actually be envious of me or whether they would pity me and look down on me, similar to how society pities/looks down on the homeless, men who have minimum paying jobs, etc
