Wishing I wasnt such a fucking cowardThe pain is excruicating. I want to scream but i have to swallow every ounce of anger. I cant show any negative emotion. I wish if I did kill myself was quick and painless and guaranteed. I'm tired of being a failure and this feels like the only thing I can finally succeed in. It feels like everyone is glamorizing their pain and im in constant fucking agony and when I share that I am it gets glossed over and no one cares. Im done. I wish I wasnt such a coward and would bite the bullet and let myself go.
