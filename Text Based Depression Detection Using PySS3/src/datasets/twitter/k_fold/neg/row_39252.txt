No will to live past 20I donâ€™t think I want to keep living past 20... I can barely look in the mirror without feeling disgusted, to the point I spend days without showering. I will never be able to achieve my goals and I feel like I failed my younger self? Like, Iâ€™d be disappointed of becoming the shit stain I am. My parents put on some lip service on how they love but they leave me hanging out fundamental stuff and Iâ€™m pretty sure they would be better off without me. I donâ€™t see any possibility of me leaving home before 25, and by then my dream will be basically impossible. Hell, I canâ€™t even have a job to move out because of the freaking pandemic going on.
