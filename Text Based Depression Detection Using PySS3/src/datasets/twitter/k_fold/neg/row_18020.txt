I must as well, I'll never get a girlfriend, I'm 19 and never kissed, had sex, smoked, clubbed and have no friends because they all moved countries and now pretty much spend my lonely nights at home by myself, yep fuck it, I'm going to die tomorrow. whats the point of living if im only going to suffer, shitty world, shitty society, shitty standards, shitty epxectations all for a fucking girl, fuck off, oh and shitty system. fuck everything.
