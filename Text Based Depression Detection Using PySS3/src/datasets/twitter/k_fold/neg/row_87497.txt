What's wrong with me , please HELPTRIGGER WARNING ) 



I know I have always had problems but now I am paying more attention to it , I feel lost , I don't know what's wrong with me.

- I always was the weird kid , during elementary school , I remember walking in the road , I didn't know how to properly walk , so I kept staring at other children and I come up with conclusion : "everyone has his own walk " so I ended up walking in awkward way , I noticed people staring at me , I didn't care.

- I was the second smartest kid in class but I didn't know how to make friends , I ended up being so much energetic and talking about stupid topics that didn't interest any one , I ended up alone since I destroyed every friendship I have for being " possessive " and treating anyone who tried to steal my friends like so badly , I guess I deserved it , who wants to be friends with such a horrible kid .

- Since childhood until adulthood, I lacked the concept of dignity , personal space , telling people that I should not tell about my personal life , this led my parents , siblings and anyone to be furious with me . 

-  When I was 8 y.o , my uncle harassed me ( not sexually , but it was gross act ) , I didn't do anything , I was like a robot , I did anything he told me to , I told my father he laughed at me and told me he was just kidding , I told my mother and she flipped and told her family , they don't want to see me , I never was close to them so I didn't care .

- I have weird reactions for certain situations , I don't feel anything when someone touch me in school , this led the students to bully me and throw things at me and poke me with needles , I didn't feel anything .I noticed that sometimes my reactions where slow , sometimes I say the most stupidest idiotic illogical stuff especially when I am tired in school , or when I am home , my family find it strange and they tell me that , they think it is a childhood habit, ex : hey ! I mixed milk with cheese and now I have yogurt !((16 y.o )) when I was having dinner with my family , this habit or whatever it is , made me humiliated in high school , " idiot kid " even though I was one of the smartest kids and I did get awards...etc It is just didn't make sense.


- I was walking with my grandmother , I saw an accident and a dead body with blood all over the streets, I left my grandmother , I did go back to the house , sat there and had no reaction , years later , I still can't find any feelings regarding leaving my grandmother there , or my reaction to the whole situation , I noticed that is not normal when I talked about it .

- I used to laugh in situations/words that I should not laugh at , in high school , we studied this fictional sad story about war and death , I was holding my laugh at the most tragic scenes , the teacher and few students noticed my expression , they give me the most hollow stare , I didn't feel anything , I know I should not laugh , but I could not control my emotions and I hate myself for it.

- I find myself attached to many things and I find it difficult to adapt , like when there is a new teacher , or certain places  .

- I hate public places , I get so scared when people look at me , I want to run when this happens , I don't know how the world works , what are banks ? How can I manage bank account ? Should I go to hospitals ? 

- I have trouble remembering names , especially my classmates .

- I am good at remembering anything bad that happened to me in great details .

- I like doing the same things that I like over and over , anything as long as I feel " I am here " like reading , listening , staring at the sky .

- I used to have dreams day and night about my perfect family to run from the abuse until I get headaches , but soon it becomes nightmares if the abuse was severe and made me heartbroken.

Backstory : 

I was the middle child .

My parents hated each other as long as I can remember , they used to tell us about their dark family secrets and tell us to not tell the other partner about it , when we tell my parents screams , break things , and laugh at each other , this carried for years as long as I can remember .They complain , everyday from my birth till adulthood , screaming , breaking thing is necessary , I used to hide under the bed because I thought it is safe .

My mom blamed us children for not getting divorce .


My parents treated us like toys , I remember my mom was hiding from my father who ordered her to delete his number , she shut the door , we were with her , where did she put the phone ? In my pants in front of my siblings , then some sense come to her and she take it back to hide it elsewhere , I didn't feel anything .

My parents didn't talk with us , my brother used to get out and have fun with his friends , same with my sister , people liked them , so are my parents .

My mother used to bath us / clean us after we pee until we were 9 y.o , this make our family members make fun of us , I remember her once " checking " if I was a vergin me the 7 y.o , I don't know if this molestation or not , even if it is , I probably will be in denial in my whole life .

My older brother started physically/emotionally abusing me , my sister was ashamed from me , she was afraid that people will know that I am her older sister .Our relationship is better now.

My father grabbed my chest once when I was cooking for him while my  , mother ,brother and sister were outside .At the time , I thought every father did this to his daughter , I didn't talk about it to him and never will because I will be thrown outside , I told my mother , she believed me , then years later she called me a liar .

I have no family , literally , my mother/father side they hate us , my parents ....can't find the word to describe them .
 
I have no friends , no one .

I always imagine/dream that I throw my self from the window of my house  ever since I was child because I thought I will not hear , feel anything anymore , I will be at peace but I didn't because of my religious background . 

I feel like I am a broken human being , I don't belong anywhere .

Is there a name for this condition ? Knowing what I am maybe will help me understand myself better .

Thank you for reading this weird post.
