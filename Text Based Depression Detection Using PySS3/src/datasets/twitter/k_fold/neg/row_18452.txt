Does anyone else feel this way?I'm not currently suicidal and am not sure that I ever really have been. In my worst times I mostly just wish I didn't exist but occasionally wish I could die/imagine what would come after. I've never, though, harmed myself or had a plan of any kind to kill myself.

Even so, I've realized that despite currently being relatively satisfied with my life, I would not be surprised at all to look in a crystal ball and find out I'll end up purposefully killing myself one day. I live in an area with a lot of guns and in my happier times I'm really glad that neither I nor any of my family have access to guns because I'm kind of scared of what I might do to myself in my darker times. Does anyone else get this way? Relatively content but still feel the darkness at the back of their mind?
