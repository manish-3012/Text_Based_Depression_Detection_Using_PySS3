My List, My Reasons, My Inevitable Suicide.Hey, guys...this is a little awkward, and kind of really not like me. But this is it, I want to explain - actually, I need to explain, at least to some random stranger on the internet. I'm well and truly sick of life; everything is hard, nothing is worthwhile and everyone, everywhere is hurting. I just don't see the point...at all. So, here's what I did - I created a list. Just a general kind of bucket list sort of thing. In the list, are things I could do to help myself; things I could experience, help I could get, etc. 

The reason I made this list, was **because** I actually do want to help myself. I wanted to get better and live and love my life. But, I've also given this list a countdown. The reason for this countdown, was that I didn't want to waste more time then necessary to change things. I don't want to waste time chasing happiness that probably won't come. So, here's the go, I have until next year around this time to get things better. Of course, I'm not expecting my entire life to fall into place, I just want to find something that'd be worth it. Something that could actually lead me to question whether or not suicide is truly the answer. As of now, I have more "reasons" for suicide then against, but I digress. 

I'm not really sure why I made this post, maybe I just wanted everyone to know I'm giving myself a chance, one last hurrah to see if it's actually worth it. Hopefully, it is...but unfortunately, it probably won't be.
