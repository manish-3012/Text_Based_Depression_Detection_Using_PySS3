What nowTwo months ago is where this starts. I've had depression for years, but this is where I feel i can't hold any longer. It's probably all my fault too. I mean... I was fired for drinking on the job at the liquor store, I wrecked my car while hammered, and to top it off... the love of my life leaves me. The job.. the car.. fuck those. But her... She was my glue. For my last three years she has been everything. My only real girlfriend. My confidence, what little there is, has been shattered since. I can't push myself to actually try to fix myself. 22 years of life and no true accomplishments or goals. The only thing I've managed was to nab some beautiful unlucky women that I didn't deserve only to let her slip away. Maybe my fat and idiotic self deserves this. 

What's next? There's honesty not much else I see. Working all my life in some job I'll hate? Is that really better than death?
