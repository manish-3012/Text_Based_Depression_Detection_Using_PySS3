Four letter word.Took my ugly 

Made it lovely 

Left these demons 

Out in public 

Show me Love is...

More than a four letter word 

More than a four letter word


Can't ex-plain 

what you see in me 

Heal my scars 

with new memories

I've been my 

biggest enemy 

Over looked 

All the little things

Times when you

shoulda been with me 

I spent mine

with the enemy 

Love me 

through the monotony


I've been trying to

Stand on my own 

Fighting the weight of the world 

all around me

But I feel alone
