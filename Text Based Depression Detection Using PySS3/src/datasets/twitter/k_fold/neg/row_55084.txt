Sometimes, thereâ€™s just nothing left to do. Dying is my best option; Iâ€™m just waiting for the right time.So, Iâ€™m homeless. If you can name a resource application, itâ€™s either not an option or Iâ€™ve already applied. My counselor keeps giving me pointless homework. Iâ€™m sheltered with my friendâ€™s in-laws over the holidays, but after that I have nowhere to go. No one wants me in their house. No one wants me. I feel abandoned by my church community. Every effort Iâ€™ve made to improve my situation is futile.

I just canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t seem to bounce back. Iâ€™m planning to opt out, I just donâ€™t know when.

Right now, I just wanna talk. I have some friends nearby, but Iâ€™m worried that if I disclose my thoughts, that then Iâ€™ll definitely have nowhere to stay.
