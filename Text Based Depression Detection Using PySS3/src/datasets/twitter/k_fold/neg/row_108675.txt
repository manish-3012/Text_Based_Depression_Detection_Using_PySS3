I'm going to take my life and his.Last summer I was dating this guy. I really liked him and he liked me and it was nice. He made me feel great and was an amazing first boyfriend. Did and said all of the right things. We spent a lot of time together and not only was he my boyfriend but my best friend. 

He was over my house one day and we were sitting on the couch watching a movie. We were home alone. I was trusted and we never did anything like kissing or sex. I was 15 and he was almost 18 and I thought we both weren't interested in it. I figured out pretty harshly that he was.He asked,"We've been dating for a few months now and I think we're ready to move to the next level . Do you want to?" I was confused at first. Do I want to *what*? He meant sex. He was on top of me in the next moment and that happened so fast. Then I said no. He kept continuing to take off his pants and I thought he didn't hear me. I said it louder. He must've heard me. Then he was in me. It wasn't nice and romantic and hot or anything like I've read it wasn't like movies. It was terrible and hard and by that point I was screaming for him to stop and trying to push him off me and he just covered my mouth. 

I didn't know who this guy was. It wasn't the guy I liked so much and it wasn't the guy that was so sweet and watched Disney movies with me. This guy was so... scary and strong. 

 It happened and I wish it didn't . I wish I could get past it. But, wishing won't do anything. It's been almost a year and I keep reliving it. All the time. Not just everyday. But. Different times thoughout the day. I would be with my friends or at school and I would randomly get terribly vivud flashbacks. I can't escape it. In my dreams when I am awake. 

I hate myself for letting that happen. I hate myself so much. I feel worthless. I am worthless. I don't want to live anymore. But why should I be the only one who doesn't live anymore. Why not him? I want to take my life... but I want to take his too. 

I know it would be terrible. I know I shouldn't think like that. I shouldn't want to... murder someone... but what if he does it again? Shouldn't he pay for what he did? I am depressed and I have no way of coping with this and I want to die, while he is happy. He graduated and is happy and it is not fair. It would be so easy to end that. End him. 

I'm just ranting. I can't picture myself actually hurting him. But I can really picture myself hurting me.
