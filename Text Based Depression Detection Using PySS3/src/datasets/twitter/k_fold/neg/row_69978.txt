My girlfriend is already in touch with other men and I'm doneI've failed I know that. But I dont get how she replaces me tha fast.. She does with him what we have been doing, what I introduced her too. And she even added someone else. I fucked up, but this just shows that I'm not really worth anything. The pain I've felt throughout thepast 3-4 days has been on a different level, I can feel physically how my heart hurts. I dont want to say that I couldnt survive this, but I dont want to. I've had enough... I've endured so much in my life, worse things, but this feels like the last rope has been cut. I'm in a free fall for the last 3 days and I dont even care about anything anymore. I'm currently bleeding on my keyboard because I did a deeper cut thatn usual. Not fatal though. I dont want to be dramatic. I just didnt even bother to put something on the wound.. 

I want to thank everyone who has talked to me in the past few weeks, even though I deleted a lot of my posts. I've read some nice things and uplifting experiences. Also the people who PM'd me: Thank you. It always made it a little easier. 

But I'm at the end of my strength. Dont be like me. Dont destroy everything you love. Be better. 

Wish me luck and courage.

Good Bye.
