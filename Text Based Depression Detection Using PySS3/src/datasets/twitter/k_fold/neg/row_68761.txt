Iâ€™ve wasted so much time wanting to kill myself I became a failureI never thought that at this time I would still be alive. Iâ€™ve been crying every night for the past couple of months trying to muster up the courage to kill myself but I donâ€™t have any. I never went to college because I thought Iâ€™d be dead by the time Iâ€™d have to even think about it. Iâ€™m working a dead end job that I canâ€™t get out of. It feel like at all times of the day I think about killing myself. Meanwhile, everyone I know is doing everything I wish I could do. Theyâ€™re all happy with good jobs or in school happy with all their friends and significant others. I wish it wasnâ€™t like this but I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything I can do anymore. Iâ€™ve wasted everyoneâ€™s help, everyoneâ€™s time, and everyoneâ€™s patience. I canâ€™t say how sorry I am for being a burden.
