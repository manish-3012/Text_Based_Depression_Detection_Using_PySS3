Am I Faking It?I've been having increasingly frequent thoughts of suicide for increasingly insignificant things. I can't say I'm worried, but it feels like it's getting worse. I don't know where else to go. All I can think is that everybody who's gone through with it is brave and I'm just a fucking pussy. It's all so pointless.
