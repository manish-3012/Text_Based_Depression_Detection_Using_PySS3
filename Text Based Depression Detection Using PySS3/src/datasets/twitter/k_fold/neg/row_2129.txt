im abusive to my family and it's time for me to leave I have no one to call. Hotlines will put me in the hospital. I cannot call my old therapist anymore. My new therapist has not returned my calls this time or the last. 
My husband hates me. If I get overwhelmed or angry I'm being abusive and he yells and berates me for as long as it takes for me to run and hide in the bedroom.
I'm abusive. I'm a bad person. 
So I'm going to cut my femoral artery with an x-acto knife and bleed to death while my husband and son are in the other room.
I'm currently getting help. I've been getting help. I'm not someone that can be helped. I see a psychiatrist, I'm on meds, I see a therapist for dbt, nothing will help me not be a terrible human being. I can't do anything right.

Edit: I'm just a stupid fucking borderline so no one will ever take me seriously.
