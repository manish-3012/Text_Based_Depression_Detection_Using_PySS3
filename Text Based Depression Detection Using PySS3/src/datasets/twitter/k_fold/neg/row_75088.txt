Suddenly, I'm strongly considering it.I'm a 23yo male. I've had a lot of pain in my life but for the majority of it I've endured and coped through numerous failures and fuckups. I probably drink too much and ruin friendships because of it. Everything in life is kind of culminating on me - I just had one of the best nights of my life two nights ago, and then last night everything became undone, leaving me with unbearable pain. Not only did I lose a connection I had sought for so long and finally received, but I humiliated myself at the venue where I was finally establishing my music career. The past month and a half before this I had finally regained hope and clarity for my future, and now it has all gone away. That pep-talk voice inside of me is now completely silenced. I owe little pieces of money here and there that are going to catch up to me, and I'm broke with no way of paying. I have a court date in early June for a drunk in public that I received because I was drugged at a bar, and I believe I will go to jail since I am on court probation already.

I don't have any religious beliefs so I do not fear any retribution if I make this decision. My family has never been supportive and my father is very unstable and a driving force behind a lot of my negative feelings. I don't have any friends I can talk to - I've tried all day today. Looked through my phone, tried to explain my hopelessness and despair to a couple people. Neither of them really continued the conversation. I just feel like I have no avenues to explore, no higher education and I refuse to live my life laboring at jobs I despise and am disrespected at just to go home and be miserable and alone.

So tell me, Reddit. Why fucking not.
