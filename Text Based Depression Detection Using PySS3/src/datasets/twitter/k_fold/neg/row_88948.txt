suicide and life choicesfacts: i hate living, i can kill myself because one person needs me (she also wanna die) so i keep myself '' strong '' and lie everyday for her best

problems: We depend on her family, we dont have our money yet, and we live on Brazil, for dose who dont know, Brazil is in the current economic crises, no jobs, no oportunities

skills: i know how to write very good, i can make stories with a blink of an eye

the point of all this: well, as we did not have much option, I decided to start stremar games to see if I stood out and got some attention for who knows how to make some money, at least internet we still have, everybody always said that I it was funny and I should try ... so I'm trying, but I feel that all this pressure to produce and always be online is making my suicidal thoughts worse, and if I do not want to stream? and if in fact I want to write stories, do a manga or a novel or even a great book, I do not have that right ?? you think I have to do what makes me good (but do not give me money) or do what gives me money (but it kills me inside)
