I don't think I can make it much longer :(So things are looking really bleak... while not obligatory, I do consider suicide justified since the nature of my problems is not at all temporary, and since things are as bad as they are. I am really sad, unhappy and scared. I have the materials to kill myself and I have been on the verge for several weeks. I just can't make a firm decision to go through with it. I don't want to live like this anymore. I wish I could talk to someone or that there was somewhere I could go for help, but I don't want to get committed, don't want to be forcibly drugged and patronized by uncaring state mental health workers. I don't have very much confidence in the mental health establishment to be of any real help. I just wish there was something I could do to pull myself up out of this state but I just don't know how. I am imminently suicidal.
