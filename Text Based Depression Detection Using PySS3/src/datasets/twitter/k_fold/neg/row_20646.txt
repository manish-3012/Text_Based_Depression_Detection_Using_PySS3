Iâ€™m tired of all the lonelinessI am constantly lonely. I donâ€™t have any friends at school, as I am online. I have some online friends tho, but they usually fail. I am constantly saying weird shit to others in text. When I say weird shit in text or try to joke around I am always seen as weird, and people usually just say â€œwhatâ€, â€œI-â€œ, â€œuh-â€œ ETC. That shit honestly gets old. It constantly happens, with all the friends I make online. I canâ€™t even find someone with my common interests online. I am constantly the one starting conversations, and then answering the question, repeat. They never ask me anything. It is just me asking them and answering with â€œlmaoâ€ or â€œlolâ€, even though I am not laughing but trying to make the conversation less tense. When I open up to my friends about my depression I am usually ignored or given shit advice, but atleast they tried to help me, since most others wouldnâ€™t. 
I also fucking hate hotlines. They literally have the same bullshit responses when I try to tell the my story â€œyOu aRe sO bRaVe fOr cOmInG hErE tOdAyâ€, or â€œyOu mUsT hAvE iT rOuGh, HaVe yOu BeEn CoNsIdErInG sUiCiDe?â€ That shit gets so old. I never really had or currently have anybody to talk to my problems to. I donâ€™t really have a father or mother figure considering both of my parents are abusive. I donâ€™t have anybody to look up to. Literally nobody knows me at all. Nobody knows how depressed I really am. I am just sick of it.
