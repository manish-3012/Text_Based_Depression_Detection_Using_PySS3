Hate my life so incredibly muchI'm 16 and I have no one who cares about me. All I do is sit in my room the whole day only leaving to go to the bathroom because I have nothing. My only friend I have is distant and were not close at all. My parents love me but they would both hate me if they knew I was trans. Life is too awful to deal with. All I do is waste away in my room, I don't even do school. Nothing interests me anymore so I can't distract myself like I did fot years before this. It feels like every second is hell
