Ive been off my meds for 2 weeks.I decided to stop taking my antidepressants altogether. I had bad withdrawals, and still do. This is the first night i craved suicide. I don't want help anymore. I want it to be over. This is bullshit. I just convinced the girl of my dreams to ask my best friend to prom. If he says no she'll hate me forever. If he says yes ill hate myself. Im not making it to prom. My date is going to have to go alone. I don't want people to be sad, so im going to dissappear first. Just drive until i find somewhere else to exist. I can't live like this. If that other place of existence has to be in the afterlife, then that's where you'll find me. I already attempted a few weeks ago. Painkillers made me pass out, and i woke up to 3 cops in my room who promptly searched me and took me to the hospital. Just let me die. Please. Im sorry mom, i know if i kill myself you'll never forgive yourself and never know what you did wrong, but the truth is nothing. You're amazing, and i love you.
