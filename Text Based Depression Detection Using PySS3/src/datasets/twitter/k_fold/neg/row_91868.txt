I just want it to endI just want to disappear and bring a conclusive end to my suffering. Iâ€™m paralysingly fatigued and numbed out and somatising constantly. Different parts of the body tighten up randomly and uncontrollably. I see no reason to be here. This has gone on for many years with no end in sight. Nothingâ€™s getting any better. I canâ€™t even remember the last time I was asleep. Iâ€™m doomed for eternal misery. This is no life to live. Fuck this shit.
