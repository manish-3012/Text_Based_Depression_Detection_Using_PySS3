Failed my 6th suicide "attempt"Just before 20 minutes I failed for sixth time to end my life. Its "attempt" because I don't actually try, I just sit here with the rope and think and do nothing. I tried 2 times jumping off 12th floor, while drunk, because I thought that alcohol will make it easier to jump. Other 4 times were hanging with rope. I always prepare all day, thinkig that is my last day and wait to become dark outside, so I can hang on tree outside without anybody see me. I just got on the tree the only thing I had to do is to tie the rope around the branch I was sitting and 'jump' from it. Then I heard some cars and thought they will save me before I die and I will only have brain damage. Tomorrow i MUST do it. I can't live anymore... :(

Any advices for courage?
