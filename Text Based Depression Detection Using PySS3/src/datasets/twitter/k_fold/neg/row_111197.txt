Struggling to thinkBroke down in my favourite coffee shop today. Doubt ill feel able to return. Im really struggling to think and just wanted to post to see if i could find some grounding. Sooner or later there wont be a single place im comfortable going to. I dont see anyone else balling their eyes out in extremely public places. Why do so few people care. Am i really that unapproachable. Fought the urge to climb the steps to a rather tall car park today. Really hard not to come away thinking i should have done it.
