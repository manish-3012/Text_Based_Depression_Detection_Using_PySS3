I am so tiredI want to die, but I cannot leave my little brother in this house with just my parents. 

Today my dad woke me up and said I wasn't allowed to go to a nearby Christian university because "when I'm around Christians, I'm either obnoxious or a liar". He constantly says that I'm insulting his (catholic) religion. I'm not. I swear I'm not. My mom acts the same.

They constantly yell at me for not being independent, but refuse to let me do anything by myself.

My brother and I are both in therapy for anxiety and shame related disorders.

I'm so tired. I have bouts of depression and I'm done with this.
