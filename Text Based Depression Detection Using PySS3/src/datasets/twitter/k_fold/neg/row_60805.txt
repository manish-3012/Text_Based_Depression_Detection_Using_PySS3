I think I'm useless.I have never enjoyed life, and even though I'm only 19, I feel like it's been a long drag. Everything has been horrible for me, and I'm never happy.

I suffer from pretty bad social anxiety and I dont know why, I've always struggled to talk to even cashier's at stores and restaurants.

I have never had a true relationship, no girlfriend or anyone to call my partner. I wouldn't even know where to start.

I'm overweight and ugly, I use acne medication and bathe at least once a day but my acne condition has only worsened and I've gained 50 lbs in the last year.

I feel like my life isn't that bad but at the same time these thoughts are definitely real. I don't know if I could ever kill myself, I'd rather just somehow not exist.
