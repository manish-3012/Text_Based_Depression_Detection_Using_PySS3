I just want to be doneI feel so alone. Nobody wants me here and Iâ€™m just a burden to everyone. I donâ€™t drive because getting behind the wheel gives me a panic attack so either my stepmom drives me or I take an Uber. I didnâ€™t go to college because I barely made it through high school without killing myself. Honestly Iâ€™m 22 and I thought Iâ€™d be dead by now so I did nothing to prepare for my future and Iâ€™m paying for it. I just want to stop hurting. I want to stop feeling. I canâ€™t do any of this anymore. I canâ€™t think of a single person that benefits from me still being here. Theyâ€™d all be better off without me.
