I miss being excited to see someone texted or realize that I existI'm nearing the point where I just go numb and loose all emotion and motivation. The only thing stopping me is my only friend but they're too busy to want to care about me... or they just hate me which is more likely.

I don't want to die... I just want some support. No one wants to give it to me and those who do have made it worse for me. How stuff like this makes me feel is so intense I just want to cry... I'll have to die if I really loose my 'friend' though.

I miss when I was social and had so many people loving me, and now I'm left with no one. Seeing anyone has texted me would make my day, which happens rarely and now no one wants to talk to me.

I'm better off selling myself to someone so they could make use of my useless ass, I hate so much. None of this makes sense, I'm sorry
