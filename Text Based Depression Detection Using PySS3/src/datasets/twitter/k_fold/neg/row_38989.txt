I would like some adviceHello, you all beautiful people. Im 23 M, and i wasnt been doing so well. Well mostly opositive. My father died this year, also my grandfather and my cousin. I still have my mother and brother. I myself graduated college with financial degree, but im strugling to find a job in my field because of the lack of any social skills, i never had much oportunity to practise them and i cant work under pressure very well. I avoid people in general, and after few months most employers write me off. I been working in some low paying jobs, security guard, wharehouse operator in store. But im  from eastern europe and i get paid very little. Having hard time sustaining myself, cant afford a car, barely have any money for food after rent. The only hapiness i have left in internet. But this year after 3 funerals i really feel broken. Also i have a gf, but now she lives in different city and i havent seen her for awhile and dont want to burden her with my problems.
So yea, this is the only place i can share my story, dont really have any cash or will power to visit psygologhist. I was thinking of emigrating to another country, but i dont really have any contacts or skills. I really feel useless and have no motivation anymore. If anyone is interested, no i dont drink, do drugs or use any medication. But now every night i cant sleep, because i cant stop thinking that im just simple looser, that will end up with a rope around his neck and no one will care.
