I messed up and now I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m being laughed at or what.Iâ€™ve always been fairly unconfident in how I am in public, even when I know Iâ€™m fine, but recently itâ€™s been really shit.


Iâ€™m pretty sure everyone in my area saw something embarrassing that happened... 
Like reputation destroying. Anyways, now I see people glance at me occasionally and shit. Alone thatâ€™s just kind of sketch and I get weird about by that. 

Whatâ€™s truly different about this time is the context and how, legit, Iâ€™ve heard people go, â€œis that him?â€ Or look at me and laugh. Either way, itâ€™s pretty fucked. 

Sometimes itâ€™s girls and you think, â€œare they checking me out,â€ but then you get the laugh. Other times itâ€™s a guy whoâ€™ll occasionally be blatant about being amused. Understandable if they know but I canâ€™t tell.

I canâ€™t pretend to be confident and completely ok let alone act like what happened didnâ€™t happen 100% of the time. It doesnâ€™t help I wasnâ€™t that way before either... 

To top it all off, I donâ€™t have any friends Iâ€™m currently in contact with and pretty sure Iâ€™ve been ghosted/left by the few I was. 

Iâ€™d confront it but I donâ€™t want to come off as insane because I know for a fact Iâ€™ve thought this way before and been wrong sometimes.

Itâ€™s always weird when you feel like your soul is dead. Unfortunately Iâ€™ve become well acquainted with it. 

I still look people in the eye and walk straight but ... itâ€™s rough to hear a person look at you and laugh or make a snide comment whispered or literally insult you to your face and you be too confused to figure out if itâ€™s because you are looking unconfident and weird (due to you thinking about they know) or they actually know. 

Itâ€™s a horrible fucking loop I canâ€™t break out of. Whenever I try something kills my confidence and security like the thing today: 

Guy and his girlfriend looks at me along with some group of girls. 
Girls laugh a little in the background. Guy says to his gf, â€œis that him?â€
The butch bitch turns around and fuckin stares at me. Turns back when I glance at them. 
Then I catch em fuckin staring at me again later I guess confirming who I am.
