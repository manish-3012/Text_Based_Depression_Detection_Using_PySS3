No hope leftit has really gone too far , i cant get this anymore ... pain is so much , nowhere to go , no one to get help , this is a fight that i will never win , i know no one is in my side... i have no desire to future or anything already lost mind 
i know that this post wont be cared but i just want to say : i tryied my best , i tryied to be better person , hoped for better days ... no one , no one was in my side , nothing changes ... it is already decided , inevitable ...
People who usually cared always sucked 
Wish there was a another option , i just dont want to hurt to anymore . Just want to end this agony
