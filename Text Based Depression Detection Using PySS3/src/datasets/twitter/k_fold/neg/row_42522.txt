Trying a new strategyHey /r/sw,

I know you're not allowed to tell me to go off my medication, but hear me out. I've been trying out different medication combinations for about 5 months now. I've tried 2 SSRIs, one SNRI, and lithium. The SSRIs made me manic, the SNRI and lithium helped but killed the creative part of my brain. I told my psychiatrist that I didn't think I could keep taking them for that reason, and he refused to listen to me. He wouldn't even consider the possibility of trying any other meds, or changing my diagnosis. He diagnosed me as major depressive, and refuses to listen to me when I describe manic episodes in detail. I guess I'm just fed up with the whole thing now. I was happier while I was self medicating. I used a low dose of Adderall every day (less than 10mg) to keep me constantly hypomanic, and life was awesome. Now on my current meds, I am constantly on the depression side, and life sucks. I went off my meds a week ago, and I've been relatively stable. Haven't crashed yet... I feel like I'm at baseline for the first time in months. Something tells me self medicating is wrong, but it works. Does anyone have any advice for me?
