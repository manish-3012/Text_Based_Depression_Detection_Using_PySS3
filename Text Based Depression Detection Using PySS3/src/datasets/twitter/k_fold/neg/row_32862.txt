Is it moral to commit suicide if your loved ones want you gone?I have a panic disorder/agoraphobia, and it prevents me from doing a lot of things. I was blatantly told by my mother (whom I live with) that she canâ€™t handle me anymore. I donâ€™t blame her, I have no job and have issues just leaving my room. I want her to be able to live her life without having me as an obstacle, and she wants the same. She tells me often that she canâ€™t stand who Iâ€™ve become, and that she wishes she had someone else for a daughter. I think my brother would be hurt hardest by my death, but everyone else would get along okay.

Is it wrong to kill myself when I know some people will be hurt? Wouldnâ€™t it be just as wrong to live and hurt people too?

For the record, Iâ€™ve been in therapy and am on medication. I really want to change and be better, but I donâ€™t know how. Suicide genuinely seems like the only fix.
