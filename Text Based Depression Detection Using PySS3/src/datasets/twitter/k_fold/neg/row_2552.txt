I just want to end it all- I'm autistic
- I'm the toxic element in common in all my failed relationships
- My high school ex-classmates still talk about me and make jokes and fun of me
- My parents are abusive and they stalk me to abuse me more
- I have ADHD
- I'm trans but my body is far too changed to pass and no surgeries would change it
- I'm 22 and I have no post high school education
- No one believes me about my parents' abuse
- I can't keep a job
- I was born ugly
- I have medical problems I can't attend because I can't afford them

I just want to end it all
