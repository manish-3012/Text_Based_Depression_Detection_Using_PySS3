I just don't really know how to keep going anymore.This is just insane, having failed my physics exam retake and now there is going to be a math exam soon that I am not even allowed to do and I have absolutely no idea how to deal atleast with these things normally on top of everything else. I am pretty sure that if I die, nobody would really notice or care about something that is random like my death in this world, so I guess dying for shouldn't be that much of a deal. Living is immense pain and my parents didn't even asked me if I wanted that pain before I was being born because there is no such option available.
