I find myself inventing reasons to keep on going.I don't want to live anymore. It's to painful to live like this but I find that I keep making up reasons to live just a bit longer because I can't go through with it. Right now it's that I want to see Deadpool when it comes out. I know it's stupid but it's basically the only thing keeping me going at this point. After that might think of something new or I might just do it. I don't know.
