I just want to be happyI started struggling around 3 years ago. A lot of that time has felt like living through hell. There have been some good moments but they are completely overshadowed by all the hell. October and November were the worst months this year and things looked  like they were on the up. I had been really badly behind with all my work, and everything was overwhelming me. I got close to ending it all multiple times, going to scope out bridges etc and have been contemplating harming for such a long time to have true control over something but I have only just resisted the urge. Anyway the reason I am posting this is because tonight I have broken down crying and Iâ€™m starting to lose all hope. I made it about 1-2 weeks without crying or having panick attacks but now I fear that is coming back. I am so lonely and most times I try to do the things I know will help me, I fail. I guess Iâ€™d love someone to read this and maybe at least acknowledge it or something. All I know is Iâ€™m losing all hope again and Iâ€™ve fallen back down. Itâ€™s so hard to wake up everyday and get through it all, I donâ€™t wane to die but maybe itâ€™s the only way things will change? Thank you very much if you took the time to read this. And yes Iâ€™ve talked to people about it and it hasnâ€™t helped for more than a couple of weeks at the most
