Struggling to find will to live after dogs passingHi, this is my second Reddit post so Iâ€™m new to this, but I am really just posting this to vent, as the closest therapy appointment I could get isnâ€™t for another two weeks. Also, I apologize for spelling or grammar errors, Iâ€™m actually a good writer but Iâ€™m extremely emotional, so itâ€™s hard for me to focus. 

I just lost my beloved baby at the ripe age of 13/14years old (he was a rescue theyâ€™re not sure how old he was), and I am in complete and utter despair. Itâ€™s been almost two weeks and I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m getting any better. Long story short he was showing some symptoms of anemia so I took him to vet and they wanted to charge over $1,000 for blood work x ray medicine + visits and I am only 22 years old and currently unemployed. I scheduled an appointment for a couple days later with my regular vet who would charge me at a cheaper rate. Moved the appointment back ONLY ONE DAY because my dog was doing so well and my friends came into visit and I hadnâ€™t seen them in months. Again, he was doing fine this whole week I went to my last week of work. The only time I go to my boyfriends house for only a few hours , after I left him completely fine (he ate all his food drank all his water and managed to go upstairs to take a nap), he passed. He died of either heart failure or heart cancer and he also had a stage 4 heart murmur. 

I blame myself so fucking much for listening to my friends and not taking him to the vet and being cheap about that ER visit. I know he was 14 and he lived a good life and he was bound to go sometime and I know thereâ€™s no good time for your dog to die but fuck man, this fucking hurts. I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy. I am laughing one moment, then I automatically think about him and Iâ€™m a complete wreck. I am in tears writing this. I donâ€™t see the point of waking up in the morning. I go to bed at 4 am, and donâ€™t get out of bed until 5 pm the next day, and just repeat that vicious cycle. Nothing brings me joy. My apartment is empty without him. I feel like I am driving my boyfriend away with my moodiness and inability to grieve properly, but he insists Iâ€™m not. 

My family isnâ€™t supportive either. My brothers apparently just bombard my dad with misinformation about how I didnâ€™t always take care of my dog when I was in middle school or high school and sometimes they picked up some of the slack, which is exactly what I need to fucking hear right now. My dad is being an asshole telling me that people die everyday, and that I shouldnâ€™t be sad with all thatâ€™s going on in the world. And heâ€™s not wrong. There are women being sex trafficked, people losing their loved ones to covid, refugees fleeing from war, and Iâ€™m over here distraught about my elderly dog? Really? Thatâ€™s the worst of my problems?

I donâ€™t know guys Iâ€™m feeling extremely hopeless. I donâ€™t see a light at the end of this tunnel. I just feel like death is all around and weâ€™re all going to die so whatâ€™s even the point of being a good person? I try so hard to be a good person and help out in anyway that I can and this is how the universe pays me back, having my dog die the one time I leave the house for a few hours at night. The only reason I havenâ€™t lost my shit is because I talked to a pet medium and she told me heâ€™s going to be reincarnated into my next dog and some other stuff about him that made me feel a tiny bit better. Probably the reason why Iâ€™m suffering so bad is because I do believe in karma, the universe and reincarnation, so I donâ€™t understand what I did to deserve this. 

Again, this post was really just to rant, but if anyone has any tips or words of encouragement, theyâ€™d be really appreciated.
