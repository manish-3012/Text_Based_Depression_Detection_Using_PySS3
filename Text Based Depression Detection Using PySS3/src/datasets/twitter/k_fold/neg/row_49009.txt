I'm a miserable, pathetic coward.I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for so long. I put a semi-colon tattoo on my wrist thinking it would keep me from following through. but i'm realizing how selfish it is to stay alive. everyone i know would be happier without me.

my mom resents me for my views. when i came out as bisexual she told me she hated me, that i'm going to hell. she considers me her biggest failing as a mother because i didn't turn out how she wanted.

my best friend has abandoned an activity we used to love doing together because he made a rash promise not to do it again until after he did me a favor. he would rather give up a favorite past time than do me that favor.

all my friends avoid me. make excuses not to talk to me. i don't blame them. i'm needy and pathetic.

my partner really does love me, i think. but i don't make him happy. i want too much attention. i need too much help with everyday tasks. he's a loner stuck with a socially impaired, anxious, depressed, ugly fat disgusting excuse for a human who wakes him up in the middle of the night sobbing because someone's hurt me and i don't know how to handle it.

i don't know why i'm posting here. i know what i need to do to fix everything i've fucked up. but i'm so scared. i'm so weak.
