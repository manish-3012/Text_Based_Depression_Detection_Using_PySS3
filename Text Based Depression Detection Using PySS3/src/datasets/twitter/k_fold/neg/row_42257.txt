Update: I failedI just couldn't do it, the pain was too much. How am I such a failure? I got nothing left yet I still can't do something so simple. Now I just look ridiculous as I over-fed my cats (so they won't eat me), replaced their litter, and filled up an extra water bowl for nothing. I should just give myself a motivator next time, like scheduled texts to my family or something so I won't hesitate. I  need to realize that there's no going back at this point. Btw sorry for making this place my personal diary, every time I think it's over, something stops me.
