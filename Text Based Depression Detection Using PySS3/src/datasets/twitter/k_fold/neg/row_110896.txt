Iâ€™m just so fucking tiredEverything I do feels like the wrong decision. Everyone Iâ€™ve known probably seeâ€™s me as a disappointment. The future once bright now feels like a never ending dark tunnel of pointlessness. I thought I never would have have these thoughts again. I thought Iâ€™d never have the urge to do it again. Itâ€™s just fucking routine at this point, getting through every single day with a blank face hiding what Iâ€™m actually feeling cuz if I donâ€™t Iâ€™ll be banned from my vocational school. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m holding onto at this point. Itâ€™s all just so exhausting.
