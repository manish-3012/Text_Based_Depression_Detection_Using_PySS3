Feeling like a bit of a stopgapI'm married with two kids, I have a steady job, we have a house, car and wotnot and we have relatively nice stuff. Why then do I feel utterly pointless? I feel like the only reason I exist is to bring home a wage and do things that need doing. I'm a placeholder, a source of income, a warm body to move things around and be in places where a person needs to be. 

It feel like it I were to up and vanish, but those things I do were still in place, nobody would notice or care.
All my decisions around the house are either undermined, flat out rejected or sometimes on a rare occasion they are begrudgingly accepted. Usually in front of the kids which is a super lovely sensation. 

I don't think that the world would be a better place if I removed myself from it. I don't think it would change one bit. I know it wouldn't. 
My wife has recently been to the docs about low mood and depression type stuff and I have been bending over backwards to help her, to accommodate her needs. Not once have I been asked how I feel. Not once. By anybody. Is that selfish of me to think that because I feel instant guilt when I do. 

Just recently I took a bath and I wondered what it would be like to just open up an arm and let nature take its course. The only thing that stopped me was guilt over how selfish it would be. 
Even typing this I'm thinking "what am I so upset about, other people need help so why tie up resources...why bother other people" 
I'm sorry for the tl:Dr on this one.
