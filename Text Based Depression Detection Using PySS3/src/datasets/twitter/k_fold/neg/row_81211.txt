I am not going to beg for money. I am not going to panhandle. Suicide has it's dignityPussy motherfuckers worrying about grades and their ex. Sucks to be you.  I am more concerned about how the fuck I am going to eat in the coming weeks.

I am not going to beg for money. But I already have in a way. 

My friend died of cancer about a year ago. He got off easy. 

He died with dignity.  I have to be some toothless homeless person who lives for fucking ever.

Come and get me death.  I am not afraid.
