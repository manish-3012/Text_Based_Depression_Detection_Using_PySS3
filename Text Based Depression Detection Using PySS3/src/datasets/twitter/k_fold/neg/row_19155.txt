Physical health 10/10. Mental health 1/10.Iâ€™m sorry, but mental health is downright difficult to treat. Personality disorders are awful. The behavior and thoughts donâ€™t change. I will have to spend my whole life fighting my natural personality because of how destructive it is. Itâ€™s like fighting an addiction, but the addiction is my thoughts and behavior. Personality disorders are awful awful awful. The depression and anxiety is second to the personality disorders. Itâ€™s probably as impairing as autism, bipolar, and schizophrenia. I feel you sufferers out there. And paying for treatment is downright stupid. It feels just like those addiction clinics. Itâ€™s an insurance game. They donâ€™t care to do their job well. Iâ€™d rather pay to read a book from a world renowned leader in the field then go to a therapist who doesnâ€™t try to help. These therapist are expert BSers. And I am making mine sue me to get any fucking money from me. If you arenâ€™t going to try to help me, you arenâ€™t getting any money from me. I hope the US recognizes why the suicide rate  keeps climbing in America, and itâ€™s because of how terrible the mental health treatment is and the fact that we have to go into large sums of debt to get bad medical treatment.
