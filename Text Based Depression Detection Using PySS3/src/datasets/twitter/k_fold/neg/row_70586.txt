life is mostly bad hate iti hate everything omg i studied in advance for that physics test but i think im only gonna get some low B and my hw score is screwed in that class i have this triple integral test coming up in calc next week and i have 3 sections to master still i hate my parents they never bother to ask whats wrong all they do is say just study dont focus on anything else and then all they care is about my brother his figure, his friends, his studies all my mom talks about his him him him and then they say oh your so lucky you have a brother yea a brother who only uses me to play games on my phone then call me antisocial and darkskinned in front of my face i hate my double standard family i hate their guts

but on the good side ive gotta say i do have a loving boyfriend and ive heard that some distnat cousin of mine had a white girlfriend( im indian my bf is indian but my parents are against dating) so that gives me hope in case i um get caught

also my skin is getting better a bit
and grades are all above B except for calc 3
