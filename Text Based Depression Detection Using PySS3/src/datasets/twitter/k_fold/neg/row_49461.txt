Surrounded by people but alone. I just can't relate to others and I so desperately wish I could.I want someone to get me. Someone to know me a long time and be there still. Someone who knows better, likes me, and it's not fake or for some agenda. I constantly and inevitably mess it up with people and it's so tiring and stressful. I can't even pretend to relate and understand. If *that* is something I have to learn explicitly and I haven't learned it by now, 21 years old, I'm literally never going to learn it. How to connect to others and have relationships and just be a person. I don't get it and I wish I could. I'm an energy of anxiety trying to pretend, I'm no person.
