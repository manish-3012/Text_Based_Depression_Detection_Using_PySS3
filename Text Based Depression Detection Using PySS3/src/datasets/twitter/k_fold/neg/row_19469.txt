AnxiousIâ€™m feeling really anxious right now, i donâ€™t know why, itâ€™s all these thoughts, that nobody cares that i donâ€™t have friends that nobody would notice if I died, Iâ€™m scared of living scared of making a wrong decision, Iâ€™m a disappointment to my parents and I wish I could die I hate myself, everything about me is a mess
