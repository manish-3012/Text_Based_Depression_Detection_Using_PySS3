I just want to end it todayIt's easy, I have a knife. I can  put it on the fire for couple minutes to make it easier to cut my wrists. I can end it. And having this freedom makes me fearless and anxiety free. Knowing that I can end it in any second makes me feel happier . 

I don't know man. I don't see a reason not to do it.
