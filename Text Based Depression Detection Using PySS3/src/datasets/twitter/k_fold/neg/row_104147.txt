THERE IS HOPE: I tried to kill myself, and now I'm thankful every day I'm alive.I was in my late 20's, I had a ridiculously stressful job, single, no friends, and no life to speak of. I was massively depressed and I wanted out. 

I couldn't be talked out of it and just didn't care. I  sold all my property, informed my landlord I was moving out, tidied my house, sold my car and paid off all my bills. I wrote my last will and testament and proceeded with the act.

It didn't work. In the process, I seriously hurt my back, damaged my neck and lost the vision in one eye. I was in hospital and was later moved to a mental health unit. My depression went on for over a year afterwards and I still wanted out.

Then my life changed. Just like that. I decided enough was enough and I took a stand. I left my stressful profession and moved to a minimum wage job with minimal responsibility, found a partner, changed my name and removed the negative aspects of my life and completely started over.

I, literally, think about that moment when I tried to end my life every single day and I'm thankful I'm alive. I'm living proof that IT DOES get better. IT WILL get better. You just have to believe in yourself and take a little time to weigh up your options. There is ALWAYS something that can be done, ALWAYS! to make life that little bit better and by taking these little steps you're changing your entire destiny.

All the love in the world,

A
