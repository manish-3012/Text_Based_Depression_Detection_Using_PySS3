i have a good lifeI am sixteen and I have a good life.

I have a boyfriend who loves me and spends way too much money on me. A tolerable family with a decent income and two siblings who care about me. My grades aren't shit. Around the eighty percent average. Sure I'm probably going to get kicked out at the end of high school and sure, I'll probably never get into any respectable program or get a job but look, other people have it worse. I have a pretty great life.

But I just can't stop, cutting and ruining myself and staying awake every night to wonder what the fuck I'm doing here. Having more than so many other people, and yet still wanting to die. Knowing I will hurt people but still wanting it. Knowing I have much to live for but still looking for death at every opportunity, praying for an accident to take me.

I'm not depressed. I've never been abused. I'm just a shitty, apathetic person who doesn't deserve to live.
