Will it ever be worth it?I wonder a lot about whether or not life is actually worth it. I am a female and I had a pretty rough childhood and i feel incompetent in many ways. I have no talents sadly. I also constantly worry about money all the time due to my dadâ€™s gambling addiction. I am pretty attractive need to fix a couple of things physically though. But besides that, having a lot of partners as a female makes less desirable. I sometimes feel ashamed of my past and I know I can never get rid of it which upsets me. I also canâ€™t help but care a lot about looks and money and popularity. Itâ€™s kind of hard to let go of the idea that Iâ€™ll always be a female loser. I feel like I donâ€™t deserve life.
