A few "almosts", never pulled through. Decided to give this a shot.I'm an early 20's student with, what I believe is, nothing left to live for. I don't see me actually living past the year, and never have done for a while. Suicidal thoughts are always there, ways I can do it and how I could stop myself.

I know it's very unhelpful to say this, but "I've been through a lot". I won't go into detail, but I'm now 100 percent certain that lives would be better off in the long term without me existing.

I have no redeeming qualities about myself. Whenever I try to fix something, it ends up more broken, whenever I'm sure there is something positive about myself, it's either taken away or exposed as something negative. Of course my family would be saddened by my passing, and I love them dearly, but honest, my death seems like a huge benefit to them in the long term. They don't even cross my mind when I try and commit suicide, in those cloudy hazes when I think "This is it".

I've never told anyone about my thoughts or that on more than one occasion I've been one swift movement from my death. Thrice it's happened, things that I've thought could have ended it. From jumping off of things, to drinking things I shouldn't. 

Suicide seems so simple. It's not even a case of "Will I, won't I", it's just a case of "when". It's inevitable and unavoidable. Sometime this year, maybe even this week, I might end up doing it. The only thing that pulls be out of these "almost" situation isn't even emotional. It's just that I want to do it alone.
