What do I do??I'm sorry to bother people here. I need advice, guidance, etc. This may be choppy or rambling and too long, and I apologize in advance for that. I'm just typing very quickly. I am a college-aged male, if that helps.

 Recently my life has taken a turn for the worse since I dropped out of college for numerous reasons, including (but not limited to) the uselessness a degree would prove to me in the long run and being a victim of a relatively minor (but thoroughly embarrassing and disheartening, as it was in front of people who didn't even care, some even laughing) sexual assault. I have never told a single soul about this until this post. In grade school I was regularly bullied, so it's nothing new. Just some icing on the cake, I suppose. 

Anyway, I was basically kicked out of my house because of my dropping out of college, and I went on to rent an apartment. During this time I became very lonely and depressed and began to have frightening thoughts in my head about what anything really means in the long run, and what part I play in anyone's life other than my own. Shortly after, I was forced to pick up another job (one I hate and dread going to) because I was running out of money quickly. 

A few months ago I had to move back in with my parents because I could no longer afford rent. They were disappointed but ok with it. Now, I love my parents (so let's get that out of the way), but they have no faith in me when it comes to my goals. This obviously leaves me dispirited. It just seems like people as a whole don't seem to care until they spot something they deem to be wrong in my behaviors. I'm always incorrect, I'm the child in the room, I have "faulty" ambitions, etc etc. Anyway, my thoughts began to take another turn for the worse, in which I began to resent people in general, as I have lost faith in them a great deal because of the previous sentence, stuff I went through in grade school, all that happened in college, etc. They have betrayed me and made me feel absolutely worthless, even my supposed friends.

Everything I've written so far has been a massive understatement, and there's more that I've left out, but I'm just trying to get it out quickly, since I need help quickly.. because it all culminated in a massive breakdown tonight in which I yelled at my parents (badly, I'm ashamed to say) about how I really feel about humanity at this point in my life. I said that people are evil and will take any opportunity they can to betray and hurt you if it serves them. I said that nobody takes me seriously and that I feel worthless. I said I'm sick of being stepped on by everybody and I have no purpose in life. And just a whole bunch of other truly awful things out of anger, that I didn't really mean.

And now, as if it was the last thing on a list to be crossed off, I've crushed my parents, who, while stern and strict, have given me EVERYTHING and mean everything to me. I've made them feel terrible because of things I said, whether they were true or uttered in anger. And now I am broken. I don't know what to do. I'm lost, and I feel like I have nothing to live for. I have no friends, I've now pushed away my family, and I have nobody. These thoughts in my head are going to drive me to hurt myself.  I feel like I'm evil. I don't know what to do.
