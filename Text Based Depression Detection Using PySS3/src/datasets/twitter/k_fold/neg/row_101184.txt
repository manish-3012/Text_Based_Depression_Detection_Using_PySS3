Not being able to describe how I feel, vagueness and uncertainty is killing me.I go on journeys inside my head my therapist asks me to describe it and I canâ€™t. Unsure if hearing voices or intrusive thoughts or if it makes a difference to distinguish it. Iâ€™m on antipsychotics and anti depressants Iâ€™m not sure if theyâ€™re the right ones. I spend all day in bed when Iâ€™m not working. I got low labido and interest in everything.
