I donâ€™t see the point.I donâ€™t even know what I want from posting this, but I am at my limit. Thereâ€™s too much going on in my life to deal with and I feel like it would just be a burden to explain at this point. The main thing is, I canâ€™t handle it. Iâ€™m 19 and in college and I canâ€™t find a reason to get out of bed anymore. I donâ€™t find joy in anything, not even drawing, reading, or video games. I hate being alive and the only thing thatâ€™s kept me here is my boyfriend. Iâ€™m starting to resent him because of it and I despise that. I donâ€™t know what to do. I went on a long walk and took a break from writing this and Iâ€™m still as lost as ever. I couldnâ€™t even think straight, my mind just jumps from useless thing to useless thing. Itâ€™s like it doesnâ€™t stop. I stopped taking my medicine and thatâ€™s obviously contributing to how I feel, but I felt hopeless before I stopped taking it too. Everyone treats me like Iâ€™m lazy and Iâ€™m not trying hard enough. I just want to give up.
