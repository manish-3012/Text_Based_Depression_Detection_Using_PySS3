Iâ€™m still hereI had leaned forward for a few seconds and my vision was going sort of blank, but I could see tiny specs of white and a ringing in my ears. I started to feel relaxed. Next thing I knew, the bucket I was standing on broke in the middle, and I fell right through it. It was a pretty small and flimsy bucket. I fought and kicked around for a good 1-2 minutes thinking it was over and choking in the process. Fucking terrifying. Luckily, I was in a shed, and I managed to loosen the rope off of the supporting beam. All I could think about was how my family was going to feel and what an idiotic idea the whole thing was. I walked back to the house, feeling shameful, lit up a smoke. I lived to see another day. This was about half an hour ago. All I can think about now is that I wished it had worked.
