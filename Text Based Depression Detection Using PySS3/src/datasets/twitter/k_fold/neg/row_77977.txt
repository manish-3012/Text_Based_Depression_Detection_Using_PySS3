You're WelcomeThat's the only note I'm going to leave: you're welcome. Killing myself would be doing the world a favor. I live at home with my dad and sister at 22 because I can't afford to move out on a hostess' s salary. I can't get a better job because I don't have a driver's licence after failing the test three times. I've only got one friend in town and she's moving away soon, plus she does so much for me regularly (driving me around, buying me food, putting up with my existence) while I can do basically nothing for her. My very best friend is also my ex girlfriend, we've known each other for years but only ever online. She broke up with me because my emotional issues and depression were too much and were causing her grief. I think I'll always love her but she never wants to date me again, and doesn't want to be "best friends" anymore either,  just friends. 

My family is very poor, I know that my death (plus the savings in my bank account) will help everyone with bills. In fact, I can't think of a reason not to kill myself. The only reasons I can think of to stay alive are selfish: I'm looking forward to the ff7 remake, I want to open my christmas presents, I want to make my best friend care enough about me to /want/ to be my best friend again. But those are selfish, all things I want, not things that will benefit others.

Reasons I should end it: financial relief for my family who hates me, freedom for my ex who I think only stays my friend out of pity, if I do it now my friend can go to my funeral before she moves, the bosses at work don't like me and I think they think I'm incompetent. 

I have a plan, I just have to obtain heavy ankle weights and vodka, then wait to be home alone. I'm not going to leave a detailed note, but I wanted to get it all out somewhere. Thanks for listening, sorry for taking up your time.
