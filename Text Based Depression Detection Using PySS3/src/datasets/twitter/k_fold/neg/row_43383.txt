Stuck and Having Bad DreamsI feel like i'm going nowhere. Im 18 and all my friends are moving out and looking at houses to rent and everything. Im saving my money for a surgery i need and to move to a different city once i graduate, so im still at home. 
But i feel like I'll be here forever. Everyone else moved to new cities too and they didn't have to save for it. everyone else is going to school and working and they're not fucked up the way i am. Nobody else feels lost or stuck and i do. 
I feel broken. 

And i keep having these dreams. Im in my high school english class and I just feel hopeless. We're reading hamlet. I don't see a way out, everything outside the room isn't real. Everyone around me is my friends. My girlfriend. They're absorbed in the play. 
A blade appears in my copy of the play. I grab it. I roll up my sleeves and slash my wrists. It's like a hot knife though butter. I pull my sleeves down as blood pours out. Nobody notices. The blood hits the floor, the sound is sickening and nobody notices. The room starts to spin, things start getting dark, and nobody notices me. I put my head down on my desk and close my eyes content with the world. 
And then i wake up. 

I don't see the point in living right now. I don't see why i can't make the dying part of that dream a reality.
