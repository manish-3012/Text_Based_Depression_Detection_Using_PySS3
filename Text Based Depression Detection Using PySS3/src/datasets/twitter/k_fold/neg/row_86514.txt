I don't want to exist, but I don't want to die necessarily either.I swear some days the only thing keeping me going is my daughter.  She's three, so intelligent, incredibly empathetic, and has such a zest for learning and life.  Knowing that if I were not here for her and that she'd be in the hands of my abusive ex-husband is quite possibly the only thing that keeps me here.

Between breakups, sexual trauma, not knowing what the hell is going on with my classroom this next year, starting a masters program, and moving back in with my hoarding parents while in my 30's - holy fuck this is exhausting.  That was just 2020.  Also add in DCS issues, whatever madness COVID keeps throwing at us, and the political powers at be treating school staff and students like pawns in some twisted game of chance.

Again, I don't want to die.  I just frequently wish I didn't exist.  I keep going for my kiddo and my students.
