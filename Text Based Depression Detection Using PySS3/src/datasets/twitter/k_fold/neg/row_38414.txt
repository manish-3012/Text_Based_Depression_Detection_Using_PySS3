IM DONE, FOR REALIm at a dead end right now not caring a bit anymore, I cant take care anymore for myself and dont see the use of it. I JUST WANNA END IT ALL, I dont see a reason why not. Everything went the wrong way for me and im not able to do anything anymore, im so tired, so fucking tired of breathing and acting like I still care at all, I just wanna fucking die, who can I trust? NO ONE, the person I loved left me, the person I was left me and theres no going back because of serious injurys and im just fucking done. I dont have control anymore in my behaviours, I just dont see the  use anymore...
Why can life be like this, life just wants me to kill myself. I feel so fucking alone on this world with my problems that only I can fix but im empty and out of energy. I just dont know anymore, I should just fucking hang myself because I cant let go and move on its too much.
