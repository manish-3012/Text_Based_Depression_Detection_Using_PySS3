Please stop telling people to just go outside now.If one's suicidal it doesn't mean they have any right to potentially compromise other lives. Not to mention the numerous countries on complete lockdown, where being spotted outside your home could result in intense repercussions like police violence. Of all the empty advices, "go for a walk/into nature" is one of the absolute worst rn. Stop.
