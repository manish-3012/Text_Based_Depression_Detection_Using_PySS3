I have a shooting headache, I hope it is brain tumorI don't see any point in existing. Life is too much of a chore. I just want to call it a day now, forever. Nothing makes sense, nor did it make from the past 15 years. I want to bang my head so hard to the wall for once and ever that I don't want to find the trace of my existence ever again. It's too much. :(
