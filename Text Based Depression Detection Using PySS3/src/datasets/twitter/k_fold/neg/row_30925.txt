I don't want to be awakeI just want him to like me back... Why can't I not have feelings for him. I want a life of no romance but I gave in for him and now he's done. Why did I give in? Ive always prided myself for not having romantic feelings but he made me feel different. I thought it was real. I've never been so vulnerable before. I am weak. I am tired of daydreaming happy endings that will never come true.
