Tell your friends you love and care about them.Donâ€™t know why Iâ€™ve decided to come to reddit at this point in time. Iâ€™ve been sitting here doing nothing for the last 6 hours, and got work in 30 minutes with no sleep.

Iâ€™ve lost three friends in the last 16 days. Two in a car accident, and another who just hung herself on Halloween night. I had 4 missed calls from her, on what Iâ€™m assuming wasnâ€™t long before she committed to it.

This is someone so pure, and so full of life, who never showed her real, true feelings to me. She was dealing with her own demons, and maybe if I had known and reached out, sheâ€™d still be here. Maybe if I had been awake, and answered that phone, sheâ€™d still be here. Maybe if I asked her how sheâ€™s doing more often, sheâ€™d still be here. Maybe if I let her know how much she meant to me and how much I valued her as a person, sheâ€™d still be here.

Iâ€™m just typing this to vent, but I canâ€™t stress enough how hard this is to deal with. The people you really care about, tell them. Some people can cover up how they really feel very well, so Iâ€™ve learned. But, maybe, just maybe if they knew they had someone who truly cared, it could all be different.

rest easy, queen
