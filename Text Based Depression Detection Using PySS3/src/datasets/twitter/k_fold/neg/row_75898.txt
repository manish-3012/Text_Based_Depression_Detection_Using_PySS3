On my way to work I fantasise about jumping off a building.My job is a bit mundane, although people I work with make it bearable. Still whenever i wake up my first thought is "fucking fuck, how good would it be to die". I have to throw myself into work to forget about it. 

I'm going to end up friendless one day. If that day comes, I will most likely go on shooting range and blow my head off. 

I'm too lazy to have a future - I refuse to go to college since I hate studying anything and nothing interests me.
