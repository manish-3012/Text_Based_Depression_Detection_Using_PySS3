Iâ€™m alone in every possible way and I just wish someone could be there for me.I have not been diagnosed with anything. The way I am is just normal for my age (Iâ€™m 13) but everything just sucks. 

I have a few friends from elementary but now in middle school, I talk to them less and less and keep finding myself distancing from them. We rarely have anything in common and I have to fake react everything. Even if I did have great friends at school, just the thought of being with them outside of school is scary and I hate that feeling. I want to be alone but I hate feeling alone. I just go along with everything to make it quick. 

Everyday I wake up in bed and can barely force myself out of bed. I canâ€™t bring myself to worry about showering,brushing my teeth, going to the bathroom or doing important homework unless it al gets really bad. I want to be in my small, crappy room, listening to music where it is my only outlet.

School work has been driving me crazy and I canâ€™t even complete anything because Iâ€™m so stupid. I get distracted and canâ€™t focus clearly during class. When I even miss any part of the lesson, whether itâ€™s my fault or not I start to panic because I worry about my grades. Missing class is my biggest fear and if I do I get mad at myself and injure myself without even realizing it. I hit, cut, scratch and stab my self with anything thatâ€™s near me. Luckily nothing has ever left a scar except this one time out of rage. I worry about my grades so much and canâ€™t even accept Bâ€™s yet I give up during the work. I canâ€™t keep up with it all because they hand out so many big projects and although we have enough time I always wait until last minute. I donâ€™t ask for help from anyone because I donâ€™t want them to think lower of me or seen as a failure but I canâ€™t count on anyone else to help. It always has to be my way. Why?

Thereâ€™s more reasons but Iâ€™m just tired at this point. Iâ€™ve been having these suicidal thoughts around two years ago yet havenâ€™t started injuring since earlier this month because of a pack of blades I found in my molds drawer (thanks mom). I canâ€™t wait until Iâ€™m older and just drive away and let go of myself completely. I first hesitated because I didnâ€™t want to hurt my lol form my sisters passing but at this point, Iâ€™m desperate. I tried to reach out to her because I may have had social anxiety but nothing is ever done. She forces me to go out now so I will face my fear and it will eventually fade with age but Iâ€™ve been this way forever. 

One day, hopefully, Iâ€™ll get my shit together. Iâ€™ll get a job as soon as possible and save up to get an affordable job. Iâ€™ll ride that baby up to Fred Hartman Bridge and just look at the view. And then I will let go. Nothing will hold me back.
