Avengers Endgame triggered thisI've been through some shit. Was sexually/physically/emotionally abused by my father and severely neglected growing up. My family sided with my rapist/dad and the sexual abuse was an open secret in the family. I have no one now. I've been homeless. I've been raped. I've been stalked. I've been in an accident that I shouldn't have survived. I've lost too many people and my emotional scars make relationships impossible. I've been struggling with anorexia for 10 years. I'm not able to make myself leave bed to go to work or school anymore. The few friends that are left rarely bother to interact any more because I always cancel plans. I'm too anxious to leave my house most of the time. I struggle chronic pain. I've been diagnosed with PTSD. I can't have sex or romance because of PTSD. I can barely have friendships. The only thing that has been keeping me alive for the past 8ish years has been looking forward to seeing Marvel films. I feel closer to my favorite super heroes than to most people I know in real life. I feel safe feeling close to these characters because they will never hurt me. But, my favorite character died in Endgame and I honestly don't have anything to look forward to now. For months I've suspected this would happen since the actor's contract was up, but at least there was some slim hope that he might live and cameo in future films. Now he's gone and there are no more films I'm excited about seeing. I'm not looking forward to anything. My health is just getting worse. My PTSD symptoms are getting worse. I've begun to feel that, like him, the only possible conclusion, the only way to rest, is death. I haven't stopped crying since seeing the movie. I guess I might feel better if there wasn't a part of me still planning on living. It would be easier just to give up. I know the world will be okay without me.
