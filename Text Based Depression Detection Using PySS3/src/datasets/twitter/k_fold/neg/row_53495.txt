I donâ€™t think I can live anymoreEverything is just shit. All my friends disappeared or hate me, and I feel so alone. My entire life has been a train wreck and I just want to be happy 

Iâ€™m isolated at home and social media is the only way to interact with people. But everywhere I go I see transphobic garbage making fun of mylife decisions. It hurts me because nobody will ever love me for who I am and I dont know what to do. Iâ€™m probably going to be murdered young since so many trans people are murdered. Iâ€™m scared. 

Nothing makes me happy anymore. I tried all my favorite hobbies but they donâ€™t do anything for me. I finally got my braces off and my straight teeth donâ€™t even make me happy. I just want to smash them all out of my mouth. My family doesnâ€™t make me happy, my dog doesnâ€™t make me happy, music doesnâ€™t make me happy. Even the idea of getting top surgery doesnâ€™t make me happy anymore. 

I feel broken. I want to be happy again but I canâ€™t And it scares me. I just want to die already so I donâ€™t have to be scared anymore. I donâ€™t know how to make myself feel better. 

Iâ€™m in constant pain and I think itâ€™s time to just give up
