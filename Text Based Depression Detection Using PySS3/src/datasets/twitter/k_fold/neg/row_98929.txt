Ideation - A Question.I hate myself. If I'm not telling myself that I am wishing I could die. I beg God to kill me. What is kinda weird to me is that I frequently think about actual suicide daily, yet I can't quite seem to follow through. I desperately want to die, but not by my hand.

Meds make it easier to not cry nonstop but meds do nothing as far as death obsession and suicidal thoughts. 

This is also not something that happens once in a while. This is a daily occurrence and has been for years. I've not told anyone one these things outright though I have alluded to it to one friend and even more vaguely to my wife.

Here is my question. Has anyone else dealt with this on a daily basis for years?
