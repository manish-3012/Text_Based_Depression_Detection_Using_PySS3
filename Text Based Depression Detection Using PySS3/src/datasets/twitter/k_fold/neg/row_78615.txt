I don't wanna liveI would first like to say I am not trolling. It may seem like I am because of my name and my past activity but I am not. Please take me seriously. This is 100% how I feel.

Every morning I wake up and I don't want to get out of bed. Eventually I do and when I look in the mirror, I hate how ugly I am. It makes me not want to exist. This is the main reason why I have social anxiety and I hate being out in public. I have no friends who I could talk to or hang out with. It feels like I'm not wanted by anyone. I hate living like this. I seriously consider suicide everyday. I have no friends or family that would care if I go.
