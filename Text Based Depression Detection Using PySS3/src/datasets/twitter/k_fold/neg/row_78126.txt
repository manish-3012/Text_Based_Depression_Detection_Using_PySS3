Life has no meaning, no motivation.I have no motivation to do anything. Everyday I sit in my room and play video games or watch anime. That's about 12 hours a day I waste doing the same two things every day. I have no motivation to do anything else. As well, my brother put things into perspective for me. I used to be a good pitcher in baseball, but then I just quit sports because my coach was an ass and turned me off of baseball. Nobody I know personally knows that I have suicidal thoughts and am very depressed. I don't want them to know because I don't want to speak to a counsellor, and if I do tell them then everyone would look at me differently and I would be treated differently too.

I have a good family and I have very few friends. I just feel like a burden to everyone I talk to and that the only reason why people talk to me is because they pity me and feel sorry for me. If there was a quick and painless way to kill myself I would absolutely do it. My family would get over my death as well as my few friends. I am quite young but I know that nothing will improve in my life because I barely have the motivation to get out of bed. The depression physically hurts and I just want to drink all the alcohol I have and hang myself.
