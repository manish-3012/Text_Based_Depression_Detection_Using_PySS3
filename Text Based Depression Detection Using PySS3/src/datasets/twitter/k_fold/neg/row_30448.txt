I need to talk to somebody....Basically I just can't deal with the constant pain and sadness. My type 2 bipolar depression is getting worse and I've pushed away anyone close enough yo help me. I hate my life and what I've done with it. I can't get back all the mistakes I've made or all the hurt I've caused and I was thinking about ending it tonight. Then my dog came over and cried with me. I still want it to end but now I just feel guilty.
