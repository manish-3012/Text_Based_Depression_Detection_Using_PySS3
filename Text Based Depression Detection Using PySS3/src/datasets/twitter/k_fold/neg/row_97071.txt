Anyone done anything with their lives after 30?30th birthday today, still haven't achieved my goals, in fact I feel I've got further away. No close friends, lost my job as a designer and just wake up everyday without any ability to motivate myself to even have a shower.

Fuck going on benefits, but I have 0 motivation and I'm not exactly going to gain energy with age.

Just curious if anyone else has hit this plateau and if its worth trying. Life seems like I've maxed it out.
