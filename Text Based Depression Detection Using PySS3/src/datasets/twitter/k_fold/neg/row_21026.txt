I've been planning my suicide for monthsI want my death to be unknown. For months I've been thinking of ways to kill myself and no one would discover my body for months or weeks. I don't want my family to think I took my own life, I want them to assume I was abducted or something just to give them false hope I'm out there somewhere. I know its selfish, but for me, its better than blamming themselves for "not being there for me".

I once thought of running away somewhere far since my parents never even notice I left the house sometimes. Save enough money to rent a transient or a room (they dont acquire records here in my country as long as pay immediately). Go off into the sea or forest and end my life there. I was thinking poison, something undetectable, or probably cut myself and let the animals devour me or let the waves take me away. Burn anything that will identify me, passports, IDs, anything like those. I just want to leave this miserable life undetected.
