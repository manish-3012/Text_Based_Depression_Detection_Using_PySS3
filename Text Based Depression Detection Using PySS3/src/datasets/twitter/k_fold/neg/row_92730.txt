Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m going to survive a whole year.Iâ€™ve just felt like garbage for so long and Iâ€™ve tried to improve but have failed at every turn. Iâ€™m still a piece of trash and a waste of space. Iâ€™m starting my senior year of college in a couple weeks and the thought crossed my mind, what should I do after that? And honestly I havenâ€™t thought about it for so long because I never thought I would live this long. I thought I would have finally toughened up and just offed myself a long time ago. And honestly Iâ€™m still not sure Iâ€™m gonna make it that long. I feel safe today and now but Iâ€™m not sure I can make it through a year of being me anymore.
