Most people that want to kill themselves are guys. Woman are smart enough not to put themselves in this position.But here I am living my pathetic life. 

From the morning till around 5, Iâ€™m anxious &amp; contemplating suicide, but itâ€™s too cold out to do anything outside &amp; I donâ€™t want to do anything wrong &amp; cause brain damage. 

I feel like a murderer to myself because even though Iâ€™m not dead. Iâ€™m dead inside &amp; I killed my self a long time ago. 

I literally chucked my 20s out the window. I had no plan for my life. I just lived day to day putting myself in bad situations. I woke up a couple years ago, but still couldnâ€™t get myself back on track. 

I called home at 23 crying &amp; i just donâ€™t know why that family adopted me if they had no intention of caring for me as an adult. They couldnâ€™t help me with college. Wouldnâ€™t even let me emancipate myself. 

But I canâ€™t blame my â€œparentsâ€. I know it all comes back to me. I shouldâ€™ve prepared. I shouldâ€™ve known better. I always wanted to be successful. The tv became my parent. That was my guide. 

I thought I was good when I left home at 18. I thought I could carry myself, but Iâ€™m realizing that Iâ€™m a huge burden. Iâ€™m a huge burden to myself, to society, to my mother I met 2 years ago, to the couple of ppl I know from church. Iâ€™m just an empty void that no one wants to be around. I have nothing good to say &amp; I can barely crack a smile. 

I donâ€™t know how this happened to me. One minute I was doing my thing &amp; the next moment, Iâ€™m in despair. Life goes fast &amp; time is the most valuable thing we have. I wish I valued my time more. I wish I didnâ€™t do a lot of the things I did. I know God forgives all sins, but we will always pay the penalty. There is always a penalty. Always.
