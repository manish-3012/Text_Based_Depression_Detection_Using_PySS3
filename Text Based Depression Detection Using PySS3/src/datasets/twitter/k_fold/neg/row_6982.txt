nothing.i have no one. everyone i thought was there left me. am i guilty of pushing people away? maybe. my dad doesnâ€™t give a damn about me. im a 23 year old teenager when he and my stepmother come to mind. i do not like them. i would not care if they died. they played huge, huge factors in my mental being ruined intentionally (on her part) after my mom died at 10, and never showed remorse. i was always told to â€œquit mopping aroundâ€ when i was 11 -12 by them. couldnt even grieve. went through my teens confused, im bisexual and i wouldnâ€™t dare tell anyone. id really be shunned from the only 2 people in my life, my grandma and uncle. all my friends left me over the last two years. i have no close relatives outside my uncle and grandmother. 
i have no one. everyone i thought was there left me. 
i know for a fact i played a part in those who left me lonely. 
how can they stomach me wanting to die, constantly complaining about not having a purpose daily?
how can they stomach suicide yâ€™all and someone with a negative outlook, someone with an eternal dark cloud over them? 
i made the closest friends of my life, (at least i thought) in my short stint in the military. 
we shared stresses. pain. 
i never connected with anyone in my life like I did with these guys. and it ended like everything else. im so use to loss. my anxiety has only gotten worse and my suicide hotline profile has only grown this year. ive never been so lonely, yet so numb to the pain of it. 
all while knowing many people would love it if i killed myself right now. this year has been very hard. my fears have heightened. i spit on the ground as a cop passed one day, and now i just believe he took it and might frame me for something. my mind is everywhere and i have no one to turn to but a hotline. 
i know it ends bad for me. 
i know there will be celebrations. 
i know i canâ€™t save me from myself.
