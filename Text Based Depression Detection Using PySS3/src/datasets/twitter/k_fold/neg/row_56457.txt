I've done everything I can and it's not enoughI can't do this anymore. I don't want to go through another holiday season alone or giving things away to strangers. I want someone with me, who wants me. I want to get something for Christmas. But I won't. I never have, never do, never will. I don't have any living family, no friends, no social media followers. No one. 

I can't do this again. It doesn't get better for me. Maybe I'm selfish and this is the universe telling me I deserve to die. Well... I guess 

I'm only posting here because after I take my life, no one will even notice or know. I just wanted someone to know.
