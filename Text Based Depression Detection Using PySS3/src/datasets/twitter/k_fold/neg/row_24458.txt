Never gets better. Never.Posting because im very alone and I need to express myself. Everyone lies about it getting better. Life is suffering. Its been over four years now and nothing changed. Im still depressed and hopeless. I hate myself, I hate my life, and ive accepted death is the only way out of pain. I fucking hate life. I get no genuine care or love. No nothing. I think im gonna attempt sometime this week maybe. No shaming or lying can change my mind. If your gonna comment, lets have a discussion not a talk down.
