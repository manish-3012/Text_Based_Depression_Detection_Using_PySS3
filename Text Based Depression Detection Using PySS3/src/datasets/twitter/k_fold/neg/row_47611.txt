I want to die so badly. But I canâ€™t bear to leave behind my younger siblings &amp; puppy.I turn 26 this month. I canâ€™t figure out what brought me to this point but I have been wishing to not exist for the past few years now. I see no point in living on to experience more pain. But I am terrified of a painful suicide and also my little sister has been having similar issues, I canâ€™t be the reason she is pushed over the edge. I feel so helpless and lonely and unloved. I want it to end...
