I'm 21 and really need someone to speak to pleaseI'm 21 and I'm at rock bottom I feel so shit everyday that I hate waking up in the morning, I'm just so lost with life that I dont know what to do.

I've got alopecia and ally hair is falling out and I'm scared even more is going to because it just seems to get worse my confidence is non existent and I'm also gay and hating that I ever came out very dated one lad since I was 17 and that's it. Is it me am I a horrible person that no one actually wants to speak it explains a lot. I never go out and dont have friends just work all the time pay Bill's and go to sleep I dont have any motivation to even feel happy these days I genuinely just dont want to exist but I'm scared of doing it too my family but I just dont want to be here anymore theres so much more going on but too long to type ðŸ˜”
