My death is getting closer. There's only a few days left and I'll be gone and I'm not joking.I'll do it.I know how and when it will take place.Today has been one of the worst days I've experienced. I feel so sad and mournful.I'm as usual wishing to cry out and cry and cry all the fucking day over and over. I don't feel like doing anything nor I'll do in the short-run. I don't want to do anything but crying and resting in my bed or better off, resting in peace just after I've killed myself. I hate myself and I hate this stupid world I've been forced to live in. I'm full of hatred, mostly towards myself.I'm just ridiculous. It is no wonder why people don't give a fuck about me.I got it a long time ago. I can't get anything I want.ANYTHING. Everything always goes wrong and I'm just tired of being always victimized by everything and everybody. I hate you! I hate me! It's all about hate. I'm wishing Wednesday comes.Just after doing the exam I have to take that day, I'll kill myself. There's no way out.Just pain, sadness, hate and disgust.There's nothing positive in my life nor have been for years. Now, I don't give a fuck about anything.It's all over.So why shouldn't I end it now?
