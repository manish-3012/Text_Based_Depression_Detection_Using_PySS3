After a 7 year+ Iâ€™m done, itâ€™s time to do itI have been hospitalized multiple times. I have seriously attempted countless times..., Iâ€™ve already failed today at not cutting myself, less than two centimeters deeper and itâ€™s all over.. no waking up in 4 days in a pool of vomit and a phone with no notifications, no historical while fighting my best friend for the scissors Iâ€™m gonna slut my wrists with.... no one will be home in two week, no one can save me.... Iâ€™ll take any reason to stay but in 30 minutes  Iâ€™m going to end it... I wonâ€™t fail this time
