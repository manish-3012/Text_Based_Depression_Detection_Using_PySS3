keep getting blockedvented to my friend, overreacted, it reached someone else... i was trying to keep my pain private so it didnt hurt the other person. too late now. ive hurt even more people. had the cops called on me, luckily theyre stupid enough to just leave. being in a psych ward is my biggest fear lol. i dont have the strength to get up or move or do anything. i only care about my friends and the ones ive hurt (a lot of them are my friends) i dont care if anything happens to me i just want them to be ok
