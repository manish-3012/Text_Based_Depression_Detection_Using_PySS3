i feel like there is no longer any escape, there is only one optionI am really at my wits end with expenses and debt. I've tried so hard to do something about my debt but I have had so many other expenses recently that I just can't even pay my bills anymore. I can't borrow anymore, I can't do anything. I can't get out of this debt and I can't pay my bills and I can't put anything off anymore or I'm at risk of being homeless or having my debt collected. I don't want to be hounded for money I don't have anyways. I don't want to never see a doctor or be able to deal with my mental health. I can't look forward to the future at all. I just can't deal with this anymore. What the fuck am i supposed to do. How do I borrow enough money to live on and still be able to pay that off. I feel panicked and completely done. I just can't deal with this anymore. I just want it to end.
