i miss her.i miss the way she used to laugh at my stupidest jokes, i miss the way she ran her hands through my hair, i miss the way sheâ€™d bury her face against my shoulder whenever she hugged me, i miss the way she used to say my name, i miss the way she held onto my arm when we were walking in a crowded place, i miss our conversations, i miss the smell of her perfume, i miss her voice, i miss her laugh, i miss getting notifications from her. i miss the way how she made everything alright without even noticing it, she was my saviour, my best friend, and the one for me. 
sheâ€™s gone now. i guess i couldnâ€™t give her everything, i couldnâ€™t treat her right. she has moved on. she doesnâ€™t care anymore. sheâ€™s with someone else now.
sheâ€™s gone and sheâ€™s never coming back.
