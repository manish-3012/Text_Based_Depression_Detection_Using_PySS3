It feels like thereâ€™s no painless way to do itI canâ€™t just take a pill and go. I donâ€™t want to feel the pain of the knife going in, I donâ€™t want to od as it hurts too, physical pain is a bitch keeping here, the emotional one is easier to deal with, ik Iâ€™m selfish but it wonâ€™t be my issue after I go

Donâ€™t give me encouraging words, it wonâ€™t change a damn thing, either way Iâ€™m not brave enough to do anything (and donâ€™t tell me Iâ€™m brave for staying)  if you want to give me anything then tell me how die without physical pain
