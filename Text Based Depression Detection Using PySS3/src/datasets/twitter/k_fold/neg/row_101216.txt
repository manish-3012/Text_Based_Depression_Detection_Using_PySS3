Last night I tried to commit suicideI just want to vent. I don't understand I was doing so well. I finally taken up hobbies I have always wanted to do. I was getting out there with my life trying to better myself. Then all of a sudden my memories came crashing in. I tried to enjoy my hobbies and my relationships with people but nothing seemed good enough. I have these memories and experiences that shaped me into this person I cannot stand. I keep trying, trying and trying to change it because I really want to but always go back. I have trouble excepting my life the way it turned out, the events I can't change and who it shaped me into. I can't have decent relationships. I can't have the courage to do things. I'm afraid of everything. I'm so emotional yet like a stone to others feelings. 
Im so lost. I don't know who I really am anymore. 
I have fallen back into it again and felt this urge ready to leave this life. I had broken up with my boyfriend the day before my attempt. The day of my attempt, I felt this shade of darkness never have I felt before. I cried at everything I did. I cried while eating, working, walking, using the bathroom, and just everything. I knew at the end of my night, when I got home what was gonna happen. I was thinking about it these past few days but that day, that day was the time. It was perfect. I had this shade of darkness making me feel like I was dead already. I got home and took my knife out and started cutting. It hurt to much and probably failed cause my knife was so dull. I decided to get drunk and do this to numb myself. I became too drunk. I started drunk texting my close friends goodbye. I almost texted my mom goodbye when a good friend of mine called me just in time. I was somehow in my closet, drunk, cutting myself, while talking to a friend on the phone. He was pleading me to put the knife down but I didn't want to. I cried that I can't make it stop. I don't want to live anymore. I suddenly started having a change of thought because I became aware. I started feeling ashamed. I got off the phone and my boyfriend called me begging not to do this and we can start over. I still wanted to die but talking to them made me stop and I passed out drunk in my closet. I woke up today with the worst headache. I had class but didn't show. I woke up feeling ashamed and embrassed. I still felt dead. I should have been dead.....It was hard to go about today normally. I didn't feel here. I felt better as the day went by. I still went to work. I laughed and joked with my co workers. They have no idea. I took the box cutter home from work. My friends reached out to me today because this is out of the ordinary for me. I don't know what I'm feeling as I type this. I'm sure I'll attempt it again.....just not sure when. Hopefully, it will go better. I want help but I need more than just advice. I feel broken and lost. I'm at the lowest point in my life. I feel like I can't get back up.
