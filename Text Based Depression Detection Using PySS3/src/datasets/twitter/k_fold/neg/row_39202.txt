Everything feels really quiet rnI've been crying for hours today, I feel so cold and dead, I can't find a way to justify my own existence, I've been so numbed by this madness it felt like my hearing gave out on me today and I just fell asleep because I felt so dead and lifeless. I don't know why I feel like this, I don't think I really have a good reason to. But my madness won't stop and its tormenting me so much rn. I just want it to end.
