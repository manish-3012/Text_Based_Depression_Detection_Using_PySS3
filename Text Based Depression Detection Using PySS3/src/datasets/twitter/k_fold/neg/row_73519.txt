Should I write to my friend before I die?I really don't want to sound like an emotional attention whor.e though and I have a tendency to do that. Can someone please just tell me what to say, if anything at all? I really want to say goodbye without him feeling like he has obligation to do anything or say anything. I have nobody else.
