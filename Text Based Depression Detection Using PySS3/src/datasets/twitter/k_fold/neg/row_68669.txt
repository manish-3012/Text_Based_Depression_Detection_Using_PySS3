I can't take it anymore, i just want to die..Im tired of feeling horrible everyday i wake up at night i feel horrible with millions of suicidal thoughts going though my head and i really can't take it anymore. Life was never really good. yesterday i went down my stairs grabbed a kitchen knife I held it up to my chest and just dropped it then my dad saying "life will get better" no the fuck it won't my mom calls me worthless trash that was not suppose to be born i know dad &amp; mom im useless,  worthless, even how many times you  try and comfort me it doesn't work.. I then proceeded to tell my dad and mom that I've been thinking about suicide then being told "don't your worth it " by my mom and my dad saying "you will get better it is just a temporary problem" no it fucking isn't I've been stuck in this hell for long enough and i plan on ending it all tonight.
