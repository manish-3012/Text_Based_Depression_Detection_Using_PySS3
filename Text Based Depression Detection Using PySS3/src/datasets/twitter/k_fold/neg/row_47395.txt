I don't know if I can cope with existenceI can't work to survive. I can't cope with that kind of existence. I seriously can't. I can't make it through suffering and sacrifice.  I don't know what kind of life I could cope with. I feel like I'm sinking into the abyss, and the only way to make it all end is to die.
