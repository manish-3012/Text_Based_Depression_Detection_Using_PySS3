Enjoying these last few momentsI have a feeling that I'll be gone soon. 

All of the prep work is done; my notes are written out, my belongings are going to those who deserve them, and I have enough medication to make it happen. 

I'm feelingâ€¦okay. I've enjoyed what I could, and suffered what was given.

I hope whatever comes next is better, be it an afterlife, reincarnation, or blissful nothingness.
