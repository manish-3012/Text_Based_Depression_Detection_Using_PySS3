Thinking of killing myselfI keep thinking about killing myself.  I'm in a temporary job and a generally poor career situation.  I do not see there being any real chance of finding more meaningful work any time in the future.  I have spent over 15 months job-searching with no end in sight, even after trying to build job skills, network, have professionals retool my resume, etc.  I have little hope that things will change.  Even if they do change, I don't know that I *want* them to.  I expect that any of the jobs where I am applying will eat up much more time than my current position.  At this point in life, I'm not sure I could handle that.

At this point, the only real reason I can think of for not killing myself are how my death would impact my dog and my parents.  I think most other people who know me would be able to get along fine without me.
