So... where do I actually get help?I *really* suck at these posts, Iâ€™ve tried several times and never had a response. Iâ€™m just drawing closer, and closer to biting the bullet by the day, and despite trying whatever I can in my arsenal itâ€™s a failing battle. 

Iâ€™m 22. My first depressive thoughts, and suicidal idealisation was probably around.. 8 years old? I know why I am the way I am, I was neglected in some ways as a kid, unbeknownst to my parents who truly did try, they just didnâ€™t have the knowledge to really raise me right. Interestingly, my younger sibling now has the opposite raising where they are coddled and spoilt. 

So what brings me here? Hopefully someone is still reading, Iâ€™m terrible for rambling (maybe itâ€™s due to a lack of friends to talk to). I **really** need help. Every single thing I do is a battle against this desire to end it, and my latest attempt to completely rewrite my life is starting to crumble, and Iâ€™m about to be caught under the rubble. 

What have I done to help myself? Letâ€™s make a list, and hopefully you can spot something Iâ€™ve missed to help me. 

- Spoken to family, didnâ€™t go well, my family outside my immediate is a mess of Methamphetamines and Alcoholism. Immediate family cannot, or does not want to grasp how I feel. 

- Spoken to a doctor. The first time I was put into SSRIs (which I gave up on prematurely, a big regret) and didnâ€™t get much from. The other times Iâ€™ve been redirected to Mental Health teams, including a case manager, psychologist, therapist and psychiatrist, all of which have ended poorly for me. That ranges from being ghosted, gaslit and disregarded. I have done a lot of my own extensive research and canâ€™t find a category I fall under, and maybe thatâ€™s the issue. Iâ€™ve since been denied medication and further help. 

- Improved my diet. Gone vegetarian, tried intermittent fasting, calorie counting, liquid diets. While Iâ€™ve seen drastic improvement in my well-being, Iâ€™m yet to achieve any sort of benefit mental health wise from trying any of these. 

- Excersise.. I go to the gym, and I donâ€™t get the sense of satisfaction everyone talks about. I have a gym partner who always mentions how awesome it feels to not only see but feel our gains and improvements but it means nothing to me. If anything it feels disgusting to be working out. I dislike myself and my own being. Why would I try and chisel it up? Mask my flaws? It feels fake and dis genuine. But I do it anyway. 

- Meditation. Been there, and I actively try to meditate daily. I donâ€™t see or feel the net benefits what so ever, it simply makes me more tired. 

- Giving myself purpose and direction. Iâ€™m now studying and at university. I donâ€™t like it, I feel like working towards anything in this world is a waste of time and effort. I really just want a log cabin in the woods to dwell in. 

I donâ€™t really know anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m being launched towards an early self imposed death, and whatâ€™s troubling is that it no longer scares me. Itâ€™s comforting and welcoming. 

My last ditch attempt is Iâ€™m going to go camp deep in the woods with just the bare basics for a few weeks, without any of my vices, or electronics. I donâ€™t think it will help (and I promise Iâ€™m not just being negative, Iâ€™m a very objective thinker) but hey, gotta try. 

I donâ€™t know where to get help anymore, and I donâ€™t think people like me are salvageable. Perhaps my existence is just one of many intended to end short, to impact people and wake them up to the expanding issue of mental health, caused by this modern dystopia we live in?

Any advice or anything really is appreciated. Even just an acknowledgement of reading I guess. Iâ€™m just feeling tired and over it now..
