Criminal Conviction for HarassmentI'm lonely. I tried to contact my ex a few too many times and now I'm facing a criminal charge. My court date is this week and I feel sick. I feel worse every day. She wrote a 5-page Victim Personal Statement about how scared she is of me. The only person I'm a danger to is myself.

I'm a high functioning autistic male in my early-20s with anxiety attacks and I cry myself to sleep every other night. I've been suicidal since I was in Primary School. I don't want to live. I've been at peace with suicide for years now. I'm not emotional about it, I'm not sad about it. It's just something I know will happen. I fantasise about it. The thought of a rope around my neck is what gets me to sleep at night. 

Nobody can tell I'm autistic, but they can tell I'm just a little bit weird, so I get treated like a regular person. So nobody actually knows how to interact with me. Other autistic people are too weird for me, and normal people are too normal, leaving me a lonely limbo. 

I went travelling last year to Greece, and all I wanted to do was go home. I wasn't home-sick. I was bored. Nothing interests me, and nothing ever has. I like my special interests, and I like to be at home. Everything else is shit to me.

I'm that kid everyone knew there something wasn't quite right, but didn't realise until it was too late.

I don't see any reason to keep going. I'm 22, and if life goes like this, I don't want it. I'm posting here, and I don't really know why. I know what I'm feeling isn't meant to be "normal", so I guess I'm trying to let you all enlighten me
