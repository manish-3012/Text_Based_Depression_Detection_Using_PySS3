I'm not okay. And I'm okay with thatI've accepted it. I'm not okay. I don't think I ever will be. I've tried. I've fought. I don't know why I should keep trying and trying when pain is the most familiar emotion. And this is all okay. This is all shitty and it sucks but that's okay. 

I'm not sure what this means. I'm not sure what I'll do. I'm not sure what I feel. I'm not sure about anything except that I'll never be okay. Alright. I'm done typing.
