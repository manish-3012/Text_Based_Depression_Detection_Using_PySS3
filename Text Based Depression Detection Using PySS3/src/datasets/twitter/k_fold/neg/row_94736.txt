Iâ€™m so tiredIâ€™m only 20 years old, I shouldnâ€™t be this tired. I lost my job because of the corona virus, had to start working overnight stocking at a grocery store(still thankful to be working of course though)anyway this isnâ€™t even what started it. My girlfriend broke up with me about 2 months ago, we were together almost 5 years. Painfully enough she still lives with me because I keep telling her she doesnâ€™t have to move out, she literally works 8 hours a week now and Iâ€™m working 40. I got her a job at the grocery store I work at, she quit after a day. She has a different job too but like I said theyâ€™re giving her 8 hours a week. Even before this corona virus I was paying rent/600$ water/50$ light bill/200$ internet/50$ while she paid both of our phone bills/150$. She brought someone home from tinder last night after I asked her to be respectful of each other and if we were to see other people to not bring them here. But she did anyway and I feel violated but we talked afterwards, after I had went home on my break and found them and told him to get out. She says nothing happened and I doubt anything did since they had weed smoking stuff set up but still, I wouldnâ€™t bring a girl back to our place and hang out with her there. But yeah we ended up talking again after that and I told her it was okay to stay here(again) what the fuck is wrong with me. I keep letting this girl run my life and I am just obsessed with her, I would do anything for her. Sheâ€™s a bad person though, sheâ€™s done things. Things I canâ€™t say here cause Iâ€™m scared of legal repercussions. But damnit, why do I love her. I want to drive my car and never come back, I need to escape. I need to go somewhere where no one knows my name, I just want to be happy. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m even saying and if youâ€™re still reading this just know I am probably crazy and there are many details into this. I just feel so hopeless. I only have my dad in my life and thatâ€™s it. I lost my mom and my sister to drugs, so I feel like I have some sort of attachment issues because I feel like I literally cannot function without this girl. I know itâ€™s bad to need someone but I feel like I need her. And that she needs me, and I would do anything to make her happy. Why am I like this.
