no one can helpi post here too much. i dont have anyone else to go to. my loved ones are tired of me. i need to be saved but only i can do that, but i cant either. my boyfriend takes my medication with him to work so i cant overdose while hes gone. so i guess I'm going to hang myself. not sure what else to do. im scared to die but anything is better than this. i dont know what to do i am so lost and so alone
