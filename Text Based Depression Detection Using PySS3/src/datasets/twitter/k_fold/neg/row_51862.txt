Is anyone there?I'm done. I'm so ready to give up. I have everything ready. I'm so incredibly weak that I can't even lie down in the bed I made. I'll be doing everyone a favor. I won't burden them anymore. It's so stupid though. I"m never going anywhere in life. Fuck I'm even to lazy to get simple schoolwork done. There's no place in this world for such a fucking failure like me. I'll stop disappointing everyone and I wont hurt so fucking bad anymore. Everyone wins. But I need to stay. Some people put some misplaced trust in me and now I'm stuck in this hell. I want to tear myself to pieces and cut until there's no clear skin left but I lost my blade. Fuck. Is anyone there? Does anyone really care?
