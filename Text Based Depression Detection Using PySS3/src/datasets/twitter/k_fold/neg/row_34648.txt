Hello SWI'll just dive right in to this.

I've been contemplating suicide for almost two months now and plan on ending myself before the year ends. I've been struggling with depression for over a year now and was recently diagnosed with D.I.D., both of which have made my life a living hell. My parents are abusive, I feel further from my friends every day, collapsing into myself. Back in August my soulmate left me and ever since I've been plauged with PTSD-type flashbacks of when we were together. About a week ago I started hearing voices and hallucinating, I haven't gotten a diagnosis yet but I suspect it might be Schizophrenia. My health has been failing rapidly over the last few weeks, and every time I close my eyes I feel like I'm not here, like I don't exist. I don't see the point in going on and I don't care about wether there's an afterlife, and wether it's better or worse than life as is. I'm toxicly aggressive and it's ruined almost ever friendship I've ever been in. I just don't give a fuck about anyone or anything anymore. 

Not sure what prompted me to post this, but whatever. I'm not killing myself tonight, however I wish I had the courage to. If I had a gun I would have shot my brains out already. I've come to terms with the fact that at the end of the day all I'll be is another statistic and I would rather leave than give any more. I haven't told anyone in my life about my suicidal thoughts other than my shrink. I want to work up the courage to tell my best friend but I don't want to run the risk of losing him too. 

tl:dr I'm fucked in the head and too weak to get help or end it
