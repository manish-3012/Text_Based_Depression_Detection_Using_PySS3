I'm sitting in my car a the top of a parking garage.I have the pills with me. 3,000mg Benadryl. I didn't write a letter. I wanted to call my parents and my siblings. I had it planned out. My phone was at 30% when I left my last lecture. It said 20% when I got to the top of the garage, but then it died in my hand. That would happen to me. Why the fuck wouldn't that happen to me.
