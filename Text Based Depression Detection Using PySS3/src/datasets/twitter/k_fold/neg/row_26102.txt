I hate my face. Iâ€™m so ugly and disgusting to look at. How am I supposed to be confident when I have this face and canâ€™t even start a conversation??Itâ€™s not just girls. Iâ€™m always the awkward faggot who tries to butt into conversations just to hopefully be interesting to the people around me but instead it backfires bad and I end up looking stupid. Iâ€™ve even been told that I butt in to much.

Please stop with the confidence bullshit. If you arenâ€™t good looking you are already a target of gossip and if you try to socialize you are a weirdo living a worthless life. I have nothing in my life that I care about. I have to keep pretending like Iâ€™m ok but this face and this body predetermine the outcome of every possible interaction I have. I posted on r/RateMe and got destroyed.  I have never been happy.

Goodbye. I decided when Iâ€™ll die but am happy I have the courage to finally do it.
