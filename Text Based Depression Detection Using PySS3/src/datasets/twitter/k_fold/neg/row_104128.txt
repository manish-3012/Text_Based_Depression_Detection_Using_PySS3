im no longer suicidalI cant believe it... I cant believe this! Right after school ended I felt like such a dumbass. Past me decided it would be better to play fucking video games instead of doing homework, getting me Fs for half of the year. It wasn't even that I was dumb, I was in a few accelerated learning classes, but I was a dumb fuck when it came to spending my time. I was so scared I failed and was going to retake it. I decided that as soon as I found out I failed, I'd kill myself. I just didn't think I could handle the embaressment. Today, I recieved my schedule. I burst into tears seeing I was in 9th grade. I was spared! I'm not letting this happen again! I don't want to die! I'm finally awoken, and I know everything will be ok...
