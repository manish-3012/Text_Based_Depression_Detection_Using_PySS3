Can't SleepIt's too hot and all I can think about is how much I hate myself and how dull the box cutter on my desk is. No, nothing will happen, even if I'm making this melodramatic post.

But I still despise myself. It feels too late. I'm 24, no job, no love, a virgin.... I'm not someone worth salvaging. Why bother? It's clear I haven't made the most of my time, even though most of it was wasted on fighting religious beliefs when I should have spent it figuring out what I like or on finding love and sex. All I can think about recently is how I want to find someone who's also inexperienced and share life and sex with them. Someone as curious and exciteable as I am who would love to have saccharine, cute, but depraved, kinky sex and then sit naked with me  and play video games or something.

I hate myself for missing out on 10 years of love and sex for nothing. Just to let myself stay in an environment that fucked up my mind with ideologies I didn't believe and then to work myself to death in a major that completely drained me of whatever enjoyment I had in the subject. Another year and a half now spent "recovering" from a life full of shitty choices and betrayed expectations in a town of limited options. I wish that razor was sharper. 

It's funny that I feel so much closer to death when I'm less depressed. That sense of lethargy is almost like a defense mechanism. You feel like you're fading and you don't exist anymore or you're not a "real" person, but getting up is too hard, let alone orchestrating your own death.  Now that I'm arguably "better", it seems so much easier to just end it.

Tomorrows another day I guess. I guess that means I have more time to fuck up and waste my life. Who knows, maybe I'll even die somehow. That'd be nice.
