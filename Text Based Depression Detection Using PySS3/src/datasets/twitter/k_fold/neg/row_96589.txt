I keep struggling and then Iâ€™m slammed down again I canâ€™t keep doing thisIâ€™m 33/F
   My parents are dead. My brother died in 2007, dad died 5/2013 and mom died 12/4/16 and I was her full time caregiver. Long story short my siblings from her side did absolutely nothing. They made life hell for me. They criticized  my care for her and made thing so hard. I no longer associate with them. At one point I was suicidal. 
My other sister is severely mentally and I love her dearly but I canâ€™t rely on her for emotional support.
My damn dog died 3 mths after my mom
My best friend dropped me...when I wouldnâ€™t give her mone for a vacation . 

I tried to change my life, tried to be positive move to a new city. Got a promotion. I thought something good was finally happening 
But now in the past 3 days I totaled my car and my new dog as of today may have cancer and I have to wait 3 days to know. This whole 14 mths has meant nothing 

I tried to talk to a friend and his advice was I wouldnâ€™t blow money on a sick animal.

 Everything I try doesnâ€™t work out, everybody around me leaves me or dies. I thought I was doing better but itâ€™s all lies. Iâ€™ve cried for the past 4 hrs so hard my face hurts. Iâ€™m so scared if my boy dies Iâ€™ll have to join him. I donâ€™t want to be alone...I wish I had one person to be with me. 
I donâ€™t want to go to work tomorrow
I have no one else to talk to
