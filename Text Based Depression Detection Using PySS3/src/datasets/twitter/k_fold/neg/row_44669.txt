i just want to sleepi donâ€™t even think iâ€™m depressed anymore. iâ€™ve been taking my meds iâ€™m ?fine? iâ€™m just over it. i donâ€™t feel cut out for the world weâ€™re in. i donâ€™t feel like i have a real future anymore. i genuinely donâ€™t see the use in even trying. if iâ€™m just going to be unhappy...why bother? i know this is basic but literally what is the point what is the actual point. i just want to go to bed! thatâ€™s my happiness! i just want to go to bed forever and not worry about working or providing for myself or doing the dishes or talking to anyone or getting dressed theyâ€™re all just CHORES. itâ€™s all optional. i wish people saw it as optional. but they donâ€™t, so if i kill myself they will be sad. worst part is, iâ€™m so fucking lucky. my family is well off and mostly loves me, i have good friends and a great boyfriend but FUCK i still canâ€™t be bothered with any of it. i donâ€™t understand how people worse off than me can stand it. i canâ€™t stand it. i donâ€™t care if iâ€™m pathetic. it doesnâ€™t fucking matter!!!! i hate that to survive on this planet youâ€™re just supposed to push and work and sweat and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s good and moral and honorable that doesnâ€™t make any real sense just fucking let me sleep i hate it so much i want to be either lazy and shitty and selfish and alone or i want to be dead.
