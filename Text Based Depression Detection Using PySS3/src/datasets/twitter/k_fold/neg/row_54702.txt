Kinda just doneIâ€™ve been having suicide thoughts since year 4, I am currently in year 12 now. I have had multiple attempts, Iâ€™ve tried to drown myself, poison myself, starve myself to death and Iâ€™ve tried slitting my wrists. My first attempt was in year 5, and they have continued since, my most current attempt was 2 months ago, and my parents found out (since I tried slitting my wrists and they came home early and found me bleeding), they got really mad at me and were like why are you doing this, is it for attention, are you going through a faze, and other stuff. I have a really great boyfriend who is always there for me and has kept me going this last year, but I donâ€™t want to be pulling him down, he is so great and he deserves so much better. I believe that if I die everything will be better, honestly, my parents donâ€™t need to handle my shit and neither does my boyfriend, plus Iâ€™ve been wasting years of my parents money on psychologists and psychiatrists which I donâ€™t even tell the truth to because I donâ€™t want my parents knowing Iâ€™m not fine because they donâ€™t understand.  Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m just having a little rant and getting some things out, I plan on going soon, because I no longer can handle the guilt I feel and how I feel so lonely all time.
