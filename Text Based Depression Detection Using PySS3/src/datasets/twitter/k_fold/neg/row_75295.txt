I almost killed myself yesterday.The weight of my situation has become so heavy I felt like I couldnâ€™t go on. I was passed out Monday drugged and drunk on the floor of someoneâ€™s apartment that I donâ€™t really even know. Iâ€™ve been living with mental illness for so long and last night it all caught up in a flood of overwhelming thoughts. 

It was so scary because I have wanted to die but never actually tried to kill myself. I was laying in bed about to when the overwhelming urge came across me to call my sister. Thankfully I am here this morning.

This is not like me. I am not this person. I am bright and full of sun. 

So today Iâ€™m choosing to kill my old self. The self that makes terrible decisions and never loved herself. Iâ€™m throwing out all my booze, sageing my apartment, and having a ritual to put that part of me to pass. I want to be healthy. I want to feel warmth again. And damnit I will.
