I don't want support I just want a place to say how I feel.I have been with my gf for about 4 months and she is all I live for. I do anything and everything I can for her. I am a bit over protective so I worry a lot about her and other people. It feels like she is avoiding me and I tell her how I feel but she just says not to worry. Idk what to do. If she leaves me I will actually have nothing to live for. Nobody else cares. Idc if I am a pussy or a bad person for wanting to die from this. It feels like my whole world is being slowly ripped away from me and Idk how to fix it. What would you do?
