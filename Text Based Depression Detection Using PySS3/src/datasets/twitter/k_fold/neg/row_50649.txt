Never thought so hard about it beforeMy life is a ruin. Yes, I'm like a phoenix, rising from the ashes every now and then (likely Bipolar II). But most of the time, I am burning to that sorry heap of ash. I know things will get better again if I do not end things now. I also know that things will go downhill again, for no reason. After 7 years of this torture, neither I nor my doc(s) have any clue as to what triggers this. Tried many meds, to no avail. Tried non-med things such as altering the lifestyle, eating habits, and so on. Doesn't help.
Right now, I am at the very brink of taking 8 times of what is considered the maximum dosage of a sleep med I have, hoping I will never wake up from that again.
It would shatter my family. But if I keep on living, I will keep living in neverending agony. I don't know what to do. Will I finish this tonight? I don't know.
I don't even know if I'm trying to find the courage to do it by posting here, or the weakness not to do it.
