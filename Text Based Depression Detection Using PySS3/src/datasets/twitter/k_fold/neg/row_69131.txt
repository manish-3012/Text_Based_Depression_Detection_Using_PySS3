I need help. I need someone.Is there anyone here that I could talk to without being faced with people who don't understand what it feels like to want to kill yourself. I haven't told anyone my plans yet but I think about it every day. Every day gets worse and worse and the feelings towards it get stronger and stronger. I feel like I have nobody who truly cares about the way I feel. My dads an alcoholic who I never see. I don't have contact with my mum anymore since she left when I was seven. I don't know who I am anymore. I have lost all feelings of happiness that I once had. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't want to live. I've been rejected therapy from a doctor who was simply too lazy to give a fuck about what I was saying to her. All I have left to get me through is alcohol and the little self motivation I have left. Every night I hope that I never wake up in the morning. I don't know where else to go...
