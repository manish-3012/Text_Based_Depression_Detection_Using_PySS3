Just need some helpI have been dealing with suicidal thoughts for years. While I have never gotten the courage to do it, I think about it all the time. Every day. I am 31 almost 32 and I think maybe 90% of the time since I was about 16.  Today is no exception, its just one of the harder days to get through.
I am on medication, I have been to therapy, I have tried just about everything. I just don't know what will help anymore.
I dont want to reveal too much, because last time I posted on reddit looking for some help, people were terrible to me. (it was under a different subreddit) so I just thought I would give it a shot and see if maybe there was someone out there who cared enough to listen.
