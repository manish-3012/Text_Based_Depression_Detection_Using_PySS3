Too anxious to get helpI WANT to get help, I accidentally bawled my eyes out 4 or so years ago when my step mum mentioned that she used to not want to live anymore and she ended up finding out i had made plans to end it and she took me to the doctors and all but I ended up faking that I was ok because it was so boring and not helping me in any way, they didnt mention anything about medication either, just referred me to "CHUMS".

Well here I am, present day, 4 years later, spiralling back down into a terrible depression, drinking and all sorts. I just got myself a job and i'm not ready at all, I feel like i'll lose the job within the first week because sleep issues and general anxiousness.

I'm too anxious to get help myself and ask for mediaction to help me and now if I call up my step mum and tell her I lied and that I need help more than ever she will be really disappointed in me.

So i'm considering suicide all over again because I feel as though it just isn't worth it anymore, I have no goals, no aspirations, no motivation. The only thing that has kept me going is my desire to give money to my parents but even that has fucked itself because my step dad is a cunt and I don't want him to gain the benefits of me giving my money to them when he just simply doesn't deserve it.

As of now i'm drinking heavily and really sitting on the fence of killing myself at midnight because I feel like it just won't get better, and even though I have control over going to get help I just ccan't because i'm too anxious.

I guess i'm just looking for suggestions and reassurance, anything to keep me going. I don;t want my little sister to grow up asking what happened to me  because she doesn't deserve that.
