I've been depressed since I was 16, I'm now 22 and nothing has changedIm really starting to think that I'd be better off dead. In this life I'm just a burden and a leech. I have no direction in life. If no one else can help me find the right path and I can't help myself, what can I do? 

You ever see those cute videos where someone sees a stray animal.....hair all messy, fucked up, and starving? Then they take them in and feed them, clean them, give them a nice home and theres a big transformation to a cute fluffy pet? Just kinda made me think you know....If only I had somebody, ANYBODY, willing to take time out of their life to help me like those people helping stray animals. Then again it makes me go back to thinking how pathetic I am for not being able to save myself. Just an endless shit cycle that feeds itself with its own shit. Hate myself, be depressed about it, zap out all energy and motivation to change, Hate myself again. 

I have no friends so they won't stop me....My family is a dysfunctional mess, if I'd kill myself sure they'd be sad but its been 6 years of constant sadness for me.....thinking about how "sad" they would be is not gonna help me step back from the edge. At this point.....I'm really running low on motivation to stay alive. Honestly there is none....Then again I've been dealing with this for years. A depressing fact but also a hopeful one.....fuck...Anyways how are you all doing? ðŸ™ƒ
