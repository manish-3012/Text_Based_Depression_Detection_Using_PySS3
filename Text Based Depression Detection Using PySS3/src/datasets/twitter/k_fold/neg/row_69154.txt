Donâ€™t want to but I know itâ€™ll be soonI canâ€™t do this to my parents I just canâ€™t, I think of my mom and dad at my funeral and theyâ€™d be so broken.  I canâ€™t do this to them but I wrote another suicide note tonight-Iâ€™ve written a lot of them.  Im confused and conflicted...I donâ€™t want to kill my self but I will, if not tonight then soon and I donâ€™t fucking want to commit suicide but I have these incredibly dark and desperate moments where itâ€™s all I want and I know itâ€™ll be an impulsive thing; I wonâ€™t keep a gun in my house.

But Iâ€™m so close.  And then one of these days it just wonâ€™t be enough.  And itâ€™ll be a mistake but I canâ€™t stop it, it hurts so bad...itâ€™s hurt so bad for 15 years now and Iâ€™ve tried so hard to get better but eventually I fell into drinking and drugs and now Iâ€™m a boozehound and a pill head, and I canâ€™t get either my drinking or my bipolar disorder under control and then one day I wonâ€™t have to worry about it anymore, I wonâ€™t have to worry about anything anymore.  My parents will, though. 

I am a constant disappointment.
