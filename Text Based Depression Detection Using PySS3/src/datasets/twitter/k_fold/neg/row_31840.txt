I feel compelled to end itThrowaway for obvious reasons. Fell in love with my best friend, we keep doing things as a couple behind closed doors but he'll never acknowledge it. I've made some terrible mistakes and the worst was trying to set him up with a fantastic girl I was friends with and then unable to go through with it because I loved him too much. It's been over a year since we first started and we haven't slept together although we've done everything else. 
 I don't know why or how I feel inadequate but I do, I feel worthless and not good enough. I go to all these subreddits, I'm active on MMFB and I try and tell myself how good my life really is. But I really don't want to live anymore. It isn't because of him primarily but this hollow void.. I've tried everything possible but I just want to crawl into bed and never wake up. ever. 

 Can someone help?
