It just doesnâ€™t feel like I can make it through this timeI keep trying to tell myself that I have been through major depressive episodes before and have made it through to the other side. It just doesnâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m going to make it out of this one. I feel so lucky to have some incredibly caring people in my life but Iâ€™ve just become such a burden on them in my downward spiral. My work is suffering and that makes me lose my confidence further. Iâ€™ve gotten so deep into this dark place and it truly feels like there is no way out. I genuinely do want to avoid suicide but it no longer feels like an option. I donâ€™t have money or transportation for therapy, and Im at a point where I feel like it would be a waste of resources. I know how much it would help my mother to receive my life insurance pay out. If there is any way I can access some method of convincing myself that life would be worth living, id truly be open to taking it. But itâ€™s so far out of reach. Why work so hard to continue to live in pain.
