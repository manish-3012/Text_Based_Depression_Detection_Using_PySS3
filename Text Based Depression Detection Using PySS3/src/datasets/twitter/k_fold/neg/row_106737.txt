Anyone feel the same?Hi. 

I have dysthymia. To put it lightly, I have chronic mild depression that has lasted for many, many years. I had it diagnosed on my own and didnâ€™t let my very traditional family know. Mix having a chronically low mood compared to your average person, bouts of severe depression on top of that, high emotional intelligence... and youâ€™ve got me: a 26 year old surgical scientist who, despite having taken no medications for the last decade, have powered through the most terrorizing, deafening depression through pure unadulterated escapism (research/videogames/music/art/anime/film etc).

Iâ€™ll give some backstory. 

I am attractive, but have chosen the single life (with no regrets) now for 8 years; going on 9. My mother had mentioned to me: â€œHey, Allis, when are you going to have kids?â€ I promptly replied: â€œNever; I donâ€™t want them.â€ She then said: â€œWhoâ€™s going to take care of you when you get old?â€ My answer? â€œI donâ€™t want to be old.â€

Thatâ€™s the closest Iâ€™ve come to confessing my tendencies to her again. My family firmly believes that I should be spry and happy with the opportunities they have given me. I am grateful, but Iâ€™m not confrontational, and would rather not deal with their aggressive attitude toward something like depression. Anyway...
Thatâ€™s when it hit me, and triggered a very long and terrible bout of severe depression- Iâ€™ve had this episode last the past 3-4 weeks. Now thinking back at how very desperately Iâ€™ve clawed my way out of episodes like this over the years... even in university: my own philosophy on life has developed over a prolonged period of time- years. My dysthymia that I got diagnosed in 2013 (Iâ€™ve had depressive tendencies since I was 14, so it could have started earlier) has shaped the way I look at everything. However, I am too stubborn to let go of it. I firmly believe in it. 

I do not want to get too old. Period. I canâ€™t tell whether or not Iâ€™m truly â€œhappyâ€, as I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve felt a normal form of happiness since 2013 at least. I feel zen in knowing that I can find my end by my own hand at any time. I do think it wonâ€™t be too long from now, as 30 is always the number I have had planned. Iâ€™ve come here an done what I needed to do, and have seen what I have come to see. Iâ€™m not calling for help; Iâ€™m not the type that would throw out a warning before hand. Iâ€™m not afraid of it. 

I wrote this to see if there are any others who are just as apathetic toward living as I am... maybe youâ€™re living a parody of life- mocking it all the time under your breath like I am? Finding fulfillment in work, maintaining a normal sleep schedule, having children, marrying? I do not have/want these things. Perhaps I should just wait until my parents are gone to do it?

In the back of my head, at every moment, I know that Iâ€™ve pushed so hard to make it where I am. I even got through the nightmare of university with full fledged multiple month long bouts of severe depression on top of my chronic mild form... without medication. I suppose I donâ€™t advise being as stubborn as I am; if you have meds, take them.

Donâ€™t let yourself be like me. Iâ€™m not afraid of it; I find zen in having my destiny in my hands. Itâ€™s just a matter of finding the right time to do it.

Anyone feel similar?
Ask away if you please.
