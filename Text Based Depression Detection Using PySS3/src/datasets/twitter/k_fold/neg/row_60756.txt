I just had a "Yep, I'm done here" momentFather has a brain tumor. Mother is dead. Brother is a schizo. Wife doesn't love me. No stable career. Getting older. Unhappy.

I've always wanted to die, came close five years ago. Now I just had an epiphany. I'm just about done. I've been on fumes for five years now. Barely living.

I feel like after you cross that hurdle of mentally killing your self, the act itself is not frightening. 

I sat down and envisioned a gun to my temple and pulled the trigger. It was incredibly easy. 

Anyone else feel that? Like, yea, we're just about done now.
