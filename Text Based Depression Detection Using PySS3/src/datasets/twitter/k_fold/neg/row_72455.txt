I don't know anymoreI used to think someone killing themselves was selfish and cowardly. I still do. I've always had thoughts of suicide, but never wanted to act upon them. I'm 21, divorced, manic depressive, and have anxiety. I know things could be worse, but I'm a burden to everyone. my mood swings... they're insane. I feel like everyone would be sad, but also know that unstable Sam isn't here to bug us anymore. I don't know how, or when, but I wish I'd just die. life has not been beautiful to me for.... a very long time. I cant find anyone to talk to, but I don't want to talk. no one understands my situation. my ex being in my head still, my nightmares, my every action. I just.... I can't hold on.
