Constantly on My MindI don't talk to any of my friends about these sorts of things. And lately i've just been at such a low point in my life where I don't feel the need to live anymore. Throughout my whole life I just continuously lose everybody that's close to me. I've never really had a father figure because he was thrown in prison when I was 7 (I'm currently 18) for reasons that i'm not even sure of to this day. Anytime that my mother asks if I want to know what happened to him it's at a really bad time, I know it isn't anything like murder, but i've been fine without him in my life. My friend who taught me to be who I am today died in a car accident 3 years ago. I have no job, although I am looking, i've come to the conclusion that nobody wants to hire a kid that dropped out of highschool and got his GED. I haven't really been in a relationship since I was in school, as popular as I was in school, I was still depressed all the time throughout my highschool life. I just put on this fake mask hoping everyone wouldn't realize the fact that I just wanted to go home and end it on most days. I used to cut myself until one of my exs told a guidance counselor in school that I was suicidal. I've had previous attempts that just ended up in hospital runs. The whole therapy thing just didn't really seem to help. All they did was make me feel stupid about my little insignificant problems. Most nights I sit in my room just thinking about how life is so beautiful, yet I have this overbearing urge to want to end it. My mother told me that depression runs in the family, but we don't have the money to get me looked at for any possible diseases or mental health problems. I have never been on medication before either due to the low income of our household. I know this is mostly just me ranting about how my life is problem after problem, but I know there's more to life then just sitting in my room most nights pondering my existence.
