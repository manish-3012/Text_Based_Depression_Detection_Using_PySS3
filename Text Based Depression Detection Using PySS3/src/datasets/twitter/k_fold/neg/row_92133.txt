Process of our suicidesDoes anyone realize how extremely difficult it is to kill yourself. Like truly. We all want to die to stop the suffering.  But the process of dying is also suffering. You take pills, you can survive ane suffer. More and slower suffer until you die. You hang yourself your body kicks into flight or fight mode. You cut yourself, if the blade isnt sharp enough the process is much harder and we dont know if you will truly die. Drowing though. Suffocating not being able to breath. U will suffer but i think this is the easiest. Lets say u drink. Go to the beachside. Swim out as far as u can. Even if u wanted to you arent going to come back
