I want to die right now.My ex was abusive and I've lost all my friends because of it, although I'm beginning to think I was the manipulative, abusive one this whole time. I feel like I'm a shitty person. I never mean to do anyone wrong but I always end up fucking everything up. I can't shake this feeling. 

Its 5am right now and I haven't been able to sleep for hours. My boyfriend is sleeping peacefully next to me like everything is fine. He's done helping me. All he ever says now is "I don't understand your anxiety. I can't help you." I feel like everyone is better off without me.
