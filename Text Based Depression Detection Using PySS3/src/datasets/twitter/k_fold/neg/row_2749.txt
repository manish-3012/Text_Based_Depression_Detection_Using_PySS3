Dissapearing before I go homeSchool is ending early and I'm afraid to go home. My dad and I have always had an off and on relationship. I've been suicidal for a couple of years now. I never know when he is gonna lose it and when he does I can't even bare to function properly. I dropped three classes this semester because  I quarantined with my friend and I did not get tested because I already knew I had it. the university did not give me an excuse even though others had received an excuse even without being tested. I hate making excuses but I thought having covid would be valid. I'm not sure how my dad is gonna respond to that. it won't be good either way. I really am concerned he will pull me out of school in my junior year and I'm already disappointed in myself enough. I'm losing the girl I love and I really don't have the strength to keep going. I and my dad haven't talked for a couple of months but he never attempts to call me. I'm too afraid to call him at this point and if I don't I will be virtually homeless but if I won't be homeless if I actually die so that's a plus and I won't have to worry about all the stress anymore. I'm 22 years old (M) and I'm pretty tough in all circumstances until I have to face my dad.
