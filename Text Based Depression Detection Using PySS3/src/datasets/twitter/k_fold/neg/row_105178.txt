really, why not go through with it?I have social problems that has no solution in sight.  I suck with people and I'm lonely.  

So why not actually commit suicide?  There are 3 outcomes to actually doing it 

1. There is an afterlife
2. reincarnation
3. nothing and you merely cease to be conscious 

Why not go through with it?  If there is an afterlife and a god surely he'd understand that it was him who created me and made me think and function the way I do.  If he cannot get over that fact then I'd rather chill in hell with some real interesting free thinkers

2. I come back as someone else.  This would be sweet.  It would be like a re-roll of a game character.  Maybe next time around i wouldn't suck with people and actually have a talent worth pursuing

3. This is what I think happens.  You just die and cease to think.  Like a dreamless sleep that you don't wake up from.  No worries.  No problems.  Nothing but nothingness.  

So why not actually go through with it?  Those 3 options beat the shit out of living this lonely existence.  Living a life that inevitably will hit many bumps in life.
