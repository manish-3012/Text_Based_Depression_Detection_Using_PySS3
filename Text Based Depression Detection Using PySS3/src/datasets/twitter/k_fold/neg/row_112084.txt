My cousin said heâ€™s going to walk around until he diesIâ€™m in Scotland across the world and heâ€™s telling me this. I donâ€™t know what to do, no one is responding to me, and I just want to know what to say to him. Heâ€™s tried to Kill himself multiple times before and i just feel sick in the middle of class right now. 

Edit: additionally we are from Midwest in the US so it is very cold outside there.
