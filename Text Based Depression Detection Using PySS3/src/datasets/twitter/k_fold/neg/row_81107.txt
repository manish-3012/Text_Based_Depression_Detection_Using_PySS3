Deep pression - the midlife crisis augmented my only companion tonight is a 23 year old bottle of rum, god bless rum. I have left my wife a good 16 times in the last 4 or 5 months, the last time was two days ago, when I took the papers to the lawyer to file the divorce. 

The last text i wrote to her yesterday before I smashed my iPhone with beer bottle (yes apparetnly that works quite well) was "if you tried to love me, you failed. I always felt like the other one, even if there was no other one."

But there was another one, another two actually. Even after I violated her privacy and found very convicing emails and facebook messages, she denied it. It was like trying to block the sun with a finger, while she still had no explanation and in her very convincing way tried to explain she did wanted to get back. In the same way I did not believe her, she could not trust i would stay around for long. and the pain got thicker and fights got nastier. I never touched her, i wouldn't even she did once raise her arm. How fucking depressing to find yourself as man being afraid of your wife, not very macho. 

here i am no friends worthy, not being able to be happy with her, but utterly, incredibly sad of not being able with be with her. She has my heart my soul, it feels like i can't even breathe without her. At this point I have stretched things beyond my means. beyond a fix. i'm all alone, im thirty, i don't have a home anymore, i don't a fridge, i have two suitcases, because i'm too fucking nice to split our belongings which i paid for and now i have nothing, nothing, not even a phone. I'm thirty and my life is empty of things, of feelings, of people, of everything. 

how fucking depresing, being in a balcony 10 stories high while she is probably on her merry fucking way moving on to the next poor bastard. 

N.P: Staind - Its Been A While (repeat)
