It isn't getting any better and I don't want to live.Hi Reddit,

Firstly let me apologise to anyone if I offend them or waste there time for posting this. I read some of the other posts here and all the other people have much worse issues than I do. Iâ€™m just so pathetic that I can't deal with the issues I have. I'm sad and donâ€™t know what to do.

Let me explain that I recognise that I have some great things in my life, I do have a few, although not many, close friends at home, I have a loving family, Iâ€™m relatively well off and Iâ€™m at university getting a decent degree.

My main stupid, selfish problem is that I recently lost my girlfriend of six years and she was the absolute world to me. I am young and at university I have few, if any real good friends. I have other problems such as my sister has recently started to self harm, a close family member has just passed away and I canâ€™t keep up with work which is only about to get more difficult. The things that got me through the day were knowing that soon enough we would move in, start a family and live happily ever after (I am a very sentimental person). Now I just sit here every single day crying, reflecting on how much of a terrible person I am for pushing her away and wishing that I had never met her so that I wouldnâ€™t feel this sad. Everyone keeps telling me time heals wounds and it will get better, but instead, itâ€™s getting worse. I put on a brave face in front of my family and friends as I do not wish to burden them, but I donâ€™t think I can do that much longer.

The sad thing is, when I say lost, I mean I was dumped and she wonâ€™t talk to me, not that she died. Iâ€™m just another one of those pitiful, worthless broken hearted men, hoping that sooner or later she might decide to reach out. 

One of the main problems is that I know I have some good things in my life, have been lucky enough to be in love and yet Iâ€™m so selfish and so weak that all I can do is sit here every day wanting to just fall asleep and never wake up again. I should be looking after my sister and trying to be a better person, not wallowing in self pity. So why canâ€™t I do it? I know suicide is selfish, I know that it doesnâ€™t really make sense and yet all that is just overwhelmed by pure, utter sadness. Then I reflect upon that and it creates this spiral where things just get worse and worse and worse. I shouldnâ€™t be sad but I am, therefore Iâ€™m sad because Iâ€™m a selfish, worthless person, hence it would just be better off for everyone if I just disappeared. If itâ€™s better off for everyone else, I hate myself and I hate life, I should just end it right?

I feel like such an idiot for posting this, but I canâ€™t talk to my friends and family, I would hate to make them have to put up with me, they have far more important matters. Besides, Iâ€™m just stupid for feeling like this anyway. In the past I talked to my ex, but obviously this doesnâ€™t matter to her anymore. 

Iâ€™m right at the end of my tether, if I finally decided to say goodbye I could just end it all right now, my mum has insomnia and so sleeping pills are readily available. Iâ€™m just such a huge waste of space.

Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry.
