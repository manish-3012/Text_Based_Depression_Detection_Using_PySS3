I hate being trans I just wish I was fucking normalLife is shit and just I feel lonely and isolated having no one understand how I feel. I can't come out to anyone because of my relatives and general fear of what people would do of they knew.
I was outed to my parents by my last school which was very religious and to sum it up I got pulled out and was told if I tried to come out again I'd get kicked out now I'm at a new school after doing online for a year and losing the majority of my friends. 
I think I just realised I don't have any actual friends at my new school its all fake and everyone percieves me as if I'm a woman. But its just so wrong and I don't know how much longer I can fake this bs for. No one really knows who I am and waiting feels impossible to me I just want it all to be over. I can't even look back on easier times because I never got to be me, when I was little I was constantly told I couldn't do 'boy things' and that I had to be a certain way and I ended up getting in trouble for acting out and trying to be myself. I never got to be me and any 'love' I recieved was conditional. I wasn't supposed to turn out like this.
Dysphoria is shit to say the least it makes me want to rip my body a part until its unrecognisable. My voice lets me down when I'm in public and I just hate it so much I can't stand it. 
Whenever someone says my deadname or refers to me as a woman I just want to punch them and tell them to fuck off. I hate haveting to live a life thats not mine and doesn't belong to me. I hate having no one who actually knows or cares for me. I hate being so fake all of the time.
Even after I die my relatives will put my dead name on my gravestone.
I think about hacking and cutting up my chest and genitals until theres nothing to recognise. I just want to be cis. If I was a cis man I wouldn't have to deal with this bs. 
I can't say everything would be better if I was a cis man but it would solve a lot of my problems.
