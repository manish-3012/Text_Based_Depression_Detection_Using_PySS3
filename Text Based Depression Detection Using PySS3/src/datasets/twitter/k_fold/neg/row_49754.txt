The factsMy depression and suicidal thoughts come in waves. With the seasons changing or from a triggering event

Each new wave of depression has gotten worse and worse since around 2017. In 2017 I started to use elastic bands to hurt myself. In the summer of 2018, I began to use kitchen knives to cut myself. In the winter of 2018, I started to use shaving razors to cut myself deeper and hurt myself more. Now in summer of 2019 I have actually bought razors to hurt myself more, to which I have cut myself worse than any time before.

I strongly believe that I will kill myself before the end of next year due to the fact my self-harming has gotten worse each year.

I cannot escape this constant cycle of depressive and suicidal thoughts. I am not normal. I should die.

I cannot figure out how to properly write a note but will probably attempt to. 

I hate the cycle I live. I am ok then something happens to bring me back down to the suicidal thoughts and urges I breakdown and someone helps me out. Repeat.

The only way to end the cycle is to end myself.
