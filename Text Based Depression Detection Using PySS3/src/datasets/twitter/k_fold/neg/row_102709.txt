i just keep delaying the inevitable. i think iâ€™m just going to do it, get it over withi donâ€™t think iâ€™ll ever be genuinely happy again. my meds donâ€™t work, even doing things i used to love or hanging out with friends wonâ€™t make me genuinely happy. i feel empty. i can laugh and smile but i donâ€™t *feel* it. my support systems arenâ€™t enough and â€œcoping methodsâ€ that suicide text lines give you are absolute shit. itâ€™s like theres always some reason why i canâ€™t do it, like i have something to do tomorrow, which makes it sound stupid like itâ€™s a scheduled plan like normal activities. most of the reason i want to die is because iâ€™m so genuinely ugly. iâ€™m not asking for reassurance. i am disgustingly ugly to look at. i have a fat stomach, ugly face, the works. i am sitting in between my two perfectly gorgeous friends and i cried in the bathroom earlier because we were swimming and in bikinis and i look like a fucking troll in comparison to them. i think after my trip, so in roughly two weeks, iâ€™m going to kill myself. iâ€™ve tried once before, and i failed, i am going to do it this time. im assuming iâ€™ll be home from my trip by the twenty second, so i think thatâ€™ll be the day. august 22. iâ€™ll smash my head into a wall or jump in the street or some shit, all my other means of suicide have been confiscated. but iâ€™m going to seriously do it iâ€™m fucking done with living as this annoying ugly heartless asshole.iâ€™m not asking for pity, or a cliche â€œit all gets betterâ€ i just wanted to rant. i know nobody will reads this but it just feels good to say it.
