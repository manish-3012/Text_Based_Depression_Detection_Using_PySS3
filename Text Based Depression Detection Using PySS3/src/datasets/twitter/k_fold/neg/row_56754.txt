how to stop having these thoughts??i havenâ€™t felt this bad for over a year now, and itâ€™s scary how fast i feel like itâ€™s consuming me. i think about walking into a busy street by my work very very often. i donâ€™t have money or insurance to see a therapist or get on anti depressants, and every time iâ€™ve tried talking to someone about this iâ€™m not taken seriously or i feel like iâ€™m bothering them which makes me feel even worse. i hate myself. i donâ€™t want to be a burden on anyone anymore and iâ€™m feeling more and more helpless. this past month has felt like hell and if iâ€™m going back to how i was, i know iâ€™m not getting out of this any time soon. are there any tips on how to get out of this or am i just a lost cause?
