I graduate high school tomorrowEven though I'm graduating tomorrow, I don't feel happy at all. I've been considering suicide for a few years. I've had undiagnosed mental issues for my entire life, and my parents have no money, so they never took me to see a psychiatrist or anything. Plus, they don't really believe that mental health issues exist, even though I see similar issues in them. The process of leaving high school is making my mental health issues eat me alive. It's a massive change in pace. I don't feel ready to leave high school behind. It gives my life a cycle that makes it seem normal. I'm not ready to leave what few friends I have. Yes, I am admitted to a college, but it will put me in crushing debt. Plus, I don't feel ready for college life either. I'm not ready to start anew. I've already checked out of school, and I'm simply staying alone at home, letting all of this anxiety and stress burn me I've barely slept in 5 days, and I can only sleep with Benadryl. How can I go to college if I can barely take care of myself? I fucking hate it. Graduation is simply going to further push this life that I don't want to live. I don't think I've ever been this close. I'm such a fucking immature mess. Fuck.
