First PostI can't really say I've been suicidal again but I am sinking...

I'm a carer at a covid positive home. We have just had another person pass away and the number of deaths is above 10.

My partner is wallowing in his own misery having no chance of working (due to me working in the isolation zone) and I feel all alone.

I work with those who are covid positive, then shower, go home and have a bath, putting all clothes straight in the washer. 

I haven't seen death as it happens yet, and for that I am lucky. But it doesn't take away from the tragedy that happens every week. 

I've been drinking today to numb the pain, the anxiety. 
I don't normally drink but today I just thought " hey, if everyone else can and its fine, why can't I? I'm not working tonight".

There's a lot more, this isn't even the tip of the iceberg. 

Carers aren't considered in this battle, yet where I live, we have those who are positive come to us to free up hospital beds. I
 do not want to take anything away from nurses/doctors/etc, they are all doing a fantastic job, but we are so isolated, and only have each other to consider/look out for while hospitals get all the respect.

We are all missing out on family time. We are all at risk. Nobody's sacrifice(s) should be ignored and/or in vain. 

I spent so long reprogramming my mental behaviours, always looking on the positive to the point I may come across as "naive" to my partner. It only helps as much as others are able and willing to play into the game.

I don't want to die, but I feel I'm not too far off from wanting to. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. Everyone I work with feels this way and it's just not right.

Sorry for such a downer post, it's just too hard to be honest with anyone I know right now.

Ultimately, I believe there will be an end to this, that we will be successful. But until then, until the tipping point, we just don't know. 

And its the uncertainty that is killing me.
