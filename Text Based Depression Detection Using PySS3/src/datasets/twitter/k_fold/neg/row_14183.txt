My suicidal thoughts are back, and I don't know how to handle itI haven't been dangerously suicidal for over 2 years.... Especially not since my LOVE (21/M) and i (24/F) have been together.
Long story short on that: we had a on and off thing for more than a year....a mutual friend broke us apart and i have trust issues skyrocketing my anxiety, depression and borderline....

And now im thinking of killing myself again or just dying.... Just not wanting to wake up anymore and I don't know how to talk to him about it since he also was suicidal.... It hurts....
And i want to be held, cuddled, taken care of, but I can't ask for it... Hes mentally ill too...

Worst thing... I think im also selfharming again... Whenever i burn myself cooking.. I don't treat my wound... Same with cuts.... 

I seriously don't know what to do....
