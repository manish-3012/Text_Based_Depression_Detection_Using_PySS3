What is life?I've pretty much had it at this point. I'm 27, jobless, thousands in debt and I live with my mum. My mum was the one person I could count on to be by my side and help me but it seems after just a year she can't stand me and has completely switched. I used to look up to her and now she feels like i'm a useless waste of space as does everyone else in my life.

Maybe they're right?

There's got to be a reason people think that right? Maybe I am? I honestly just try and spend as much time by myself as possible and not get in peoples way but they still dislike me....

I thought about killing myself but i'm too much of a pussy tbh. I've looked up legal euthanasia in Switzerland and even tried to buy some potassium cyanide pills but to no avail.

Why is it that I never asked to be born. My life is *supposed* to be my own. We have "freedom" in the UK but I can't decide when things are too painful and I want to stop? A lot of people I have met (probably 80-90%) have viewed suicide as selfish? They look at people contemplating suicide as selfish rather than suffering. Nobody wants you to die but is far from willing to really help you solve your problems? What a selfish irony.

I just don't want to be a part of this anymore. The human race is mainly just selfish, greedy arseholes and those arseholes decide the quality of life of others. I give up.
