I'm out of answers, out of people to turn to, I'm out of hopeI just dont know what to do. I hate waking up. I hate existing. My family says there always here for me but they never reach out. They don't actually care, anytime I talk to them they just tell me to look at things differently, FUCK off. My dad died recently and he was the only one who understood me. I just wanna go be with him, no one appreciates me in this world. Theres not nearly enough good in this world to justify all of the bullshit. I'm fucking addicted to kratom, weed, nicotine. SSRIs have failed me, therapists have failed me (how the hell is 1 hour every 2 weeks going to help anyone?) I dont want to hurt myself but I cant stand the hurt that happens just existing. I'm at the end of my rope and no one takes it seriously, so maybe I should show them how serious I am
