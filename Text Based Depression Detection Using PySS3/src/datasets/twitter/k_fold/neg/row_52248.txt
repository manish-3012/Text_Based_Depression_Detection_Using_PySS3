Sort of grasping at reasons to stay aliveAfter working my ass off my whole life to get into med school and then receiving and offer from one of the top med schools in the country today the government decided that I didnâ€™t deserve an A* and I missed the offer. I donâ€™t really see the point in living when the only thing Iâ€™ve poured myself into has been pointless. I have an insurance uni but it would mean having to stay at home with family who donâ€™t like me and staying in a city where I have to watch every move I make in case someone tells my family. Everyone around me has done okay but it seems nothing really wants to go right for me.
