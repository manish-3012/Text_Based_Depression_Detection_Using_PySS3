I feel like Iâ€™ve just been destroyedSome transphobes started attacking me in another subreddit. I was trying to keep things calm and deescalate the situation but one of them took it too far and said, and I quote â€œyou hate women so much you donâ€™t even want to be one. Well youâ€™ll never be a manâ€

Iâ€™m a trans man and while I have been attacked in the past, this is by far the most hurtful thing Iâ€™ve ever heard. I feel like I should end my life, my dysphoria is just unbearable. I canâ€™t stop crying or shaking. What the fuck is wrong with some people?
