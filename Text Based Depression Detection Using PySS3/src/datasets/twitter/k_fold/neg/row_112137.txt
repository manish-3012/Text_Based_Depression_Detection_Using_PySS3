I'm contemplating suicide and I can't tell anyone. I don't think I'd go through with it. But it feels like the best choiceI went through a bad breakup with a girl I really cared about. She left me and I've been trying to work things out. 

But today I found out she blocked me. I can't contact her. I feel alone and sad and I just feel like I have nowhere to go.
