I feel like a burdenAfter multiple times of moving in and out and going back to my families house fleeing from my abusive narcissistic ex, this time i feel like a burden. Causing stress on everyone. Im still trauma bonded to him and see no way out of this. I feel like fleeing and running away but idk where. Or really taking a lot of pills or buying alcohol. Im so fucked up right now even tho i know i was being abused and i know he is a narc.. i know everything okay.. and i still want to go back. Im so fucking stupid. Even tho i know i cant shake it off of me. I wish i wasnt here at all i dont want to deal with this. If i go back its like suffering a slow death. Ive come to the fact im too far deep in this twisted mind games ill never be normal. I put him on a pedestal for too long and been abused might as well go back and suffer longer. I just cant believe how my mind is wanting someone who is so fucking abusive towards me when i know everything he does is a game and he doesnt even love me. Plus i quit my job bc he works there and everyone is gossiping about it. Hes literally telling everyone im crazy and i cant take this shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK
