I don't understand what is wrong with me.I don't know why I want to die, but it's all I can think about. 

I wouldn't say I have a bad life, but I don't see a prosperous future ahead of me and every day is incredibly draining. 

I started seeing a counselor a few weeks ago, and we are just passing the introductory sessions and now digging into meat of the discussion.

I can express my self-diagnosed anxiety and depression-like symptoms logically, and can acknowledge that they are not healthy, yet a day later I am right back into my pit of longing for death.

I honestly can't remember most of last semester. It's a blur of dread, exhaustion, and begging for death. I can't look my reflection in the eye because I am ashamed of who I am. I want nothing more than to not wake up, but I am too afraid to actually kill myself, for now.

I'm not even sure what I am looking for by posting this. I just feel lost and desperate right now, and I guess I just needed to articulate it.
