I feel like I've hit the endI've struggled with depression since I was 14.  I'm 19 now and thought I was doing better - losing weight, gaining confidence, etc. - but lately I've been haunted by suicidal thoughts.  Today I woke up and missed my therapy appointment, and I don't know.  I feel like my improvements have been worthless and that suicide is the only path left for me.

I just don't know.
