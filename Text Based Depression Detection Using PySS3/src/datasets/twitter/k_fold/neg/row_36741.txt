Happy birthday to me20th birthday, no friends, no one gives a shit. I had my last therapy session yesterday and now I'm all alone, no help, no support. 

I don't know if I have enough pills but enough to do some damage, maybe hospitalise me. But hopefully it will be the end of me. 

I can't see any reason to keep going. I hate life and see no reason to work and sleep just to die anyway. So I just want to go how before I have to suffer any longer

I just want someone to talk to, someone with me for my final evening. I'm sorry
