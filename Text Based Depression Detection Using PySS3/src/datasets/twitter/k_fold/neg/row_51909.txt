What do you think about my perverted reasons why I don't think I'm going to kill myself?The thought of suicide is always going through my head. Life is a cruel joke and I wish I was never born. I have the feelings that I want to say fuck it, I'm out, goodbye everyone, but I think it's unlikely I do kill myself because I have like 2 reasons why I won't do it.

One is a close relationship with my mom. I would ruin the rest of her life if I kill myself. This is not the perverted reason, this is a conclusion I've made with a lot of conversations with my therapist.

My perverted reason? My parents are fairly wealthy and in the distance future I'm going to get a lot of money, trust fund shit when they die. I'm lucky for that since I'm a failure myself. 

Perverted: when I get my trust fund I'm going to ""maybe"" actually enjoy life because I'll have money in this fucked up world where money is like the only thing that ever matters to anyone. 

With this money, I can do a lot of things legally. One of them is becoming a sugar daddy to a very sweet 18+ girl maybe entering college. I want to have a legitimate relationship with her and be kind to her and really help her financially. 

And obv I'll be doing that in exchange for sex.
