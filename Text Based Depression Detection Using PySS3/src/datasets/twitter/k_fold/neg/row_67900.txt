I feel so desperate.My first time posting here, please forgive any mistakes
I'm a 16 year old male person with a relatively normal life. I have autism, I'm addicted to videogames, and about a year ago I was first diagnosed with depression. At the time, I had an amazing girlfriend, and she was the only reason I didn't kill myself, despite desperately wanting to. I decided to get better for her, and after a long time and a lot of therapy, I finally felt better. Life finally made sense again, and it was finally worth it. But now I'm in my 3d year of high school (I live in the Netherlands), and everything is going wrong. My grades are generally good, but mathematics, physics and chemistry are completely impossible for me. My girlfriend broke up with me, I'm probably going to fail class, and these horrible grades are making me feel worthless again. I just spent thirty minutes crying and thinking about how shit my life really is, and I just want to kill myself. I never deserved to live, and I want the pain to just stop. I just don't want my loved ones to be sad. Can anyone help me?
