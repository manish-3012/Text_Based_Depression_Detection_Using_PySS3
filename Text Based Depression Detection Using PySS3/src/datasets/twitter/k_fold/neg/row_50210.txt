I'm getting worse.I'm getting progressively worse. I'm not quite sure what is wrong with me. It used to take a lot to push me over the edge. But now? It's a daily occurrence to go from somewhat okay, to thinking of the best ways to off myself with things around me. 

I've actually been better off lately, well, emotionally at least. I'm not constantly sad. I'm typically pretty chill. But one little thing can just set me off and I don't know why. It wasn't always like this. I'm worried, because my thoughts are getting progressively more creative as time goes on. Before I'd just think of downing a bottle of pain pills, but now I'm having thoughts like climbing up a radio tower or something and jumping off. Or getting a gun and just ca-blamming it. 

I'm scared. I think now and know it's irrational, but in the moment it's all I know. I'm really, really scared.
