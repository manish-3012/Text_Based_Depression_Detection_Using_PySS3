I am so tired of hurtingI see that there are people on here that appear to truly be suicidal.  I would never take my life simply because I would be afraid of what would happen to my soul.  I believe in God but I am tired of waiting for this pain to be gone.  Basically, a man used me and then dumped me.  I was completely in love with him and with his kids.  He made me believe that he loved me, he showed me that he loved me.  He told me to trust him and so I did.  It has been almost 4 months since he ended our relationship and I keep thinking that I am over him but every few weeks it creeps back up on me and I feel hopeless and so incredibly lonely.  He was separated from his wife and she is an obese alcoholic who didn't want to be with him anymore.  She preferred to leave their child at home while bar hopping and driving home drunk.  So he was living alone and we met.  He was very pushy with me and we became seriously involved fast.  We spent almost all of our time together and it was perfect.  We never argued, never disagreed, had so much in common.  He told me he was going to get a divorce and wanted us to move in together so we had plans.  We had plans and I was so so happy.  I love this man and he was always so sweet and loving to me.  He took care of me when I was sick, helped me when I needed help.  He loved me.  Then this woman (his wife) decided that she wanted him back.  He told me that she was trying to get back with him but he promised me that he would never go back with her.  She kept on him for days and he kept me informed of everything that was going on and assured me that I had nothing to worry about.  He said he loved me and wanted to spend his life with me.  Out of the blue, he called me and told me that she begged him for another chance and he felt "obligated" to give it to her.  I almost dropped the phone.  I was so shocked... it just seemed like a nightmare.  He said he didn't want to go back with her but felt obligated to because of the kid (adopted kid).  He already had two other kids with two other women but I let that slide because I loved him and I accepted him with baggage and all.  So, he said he couldn't see me anymore.  My first reaction was "do what you have to do" and I hung up the phone.  A few days went by and I cried a river of tears.  I got sick, depressed, hopeless, I had never felt so abandoned in my life.  Like someone said, he had given me a VIP pass into his life and just like that, I was cut out of his life.  I sent him an email because I just didn't believe what he had done and his reasons for doing it.  He insisted that he missed me and loved me and didn't love her but was doing what he had to do.  We kept emailing back and forth and I wanted him to come back to me.  He said he had to do what he was doing out of guilt and obligation but everyone who knew what was going on said it was B.S.  In all of his emails he insisted that he was in love with me and wished he could be with me.  I told him that I would never betray his trust when he said that he wouldn't blame me if I sought revenge with the emails telling me of his love for me and how he didn't love his wife.  I got really angry at one point and he came to my house unannounced because he was afraid I would send his wife the emails.  Again, I told him that I would never do anything like that.  I'm not a trashy person.  Believe it or not, he is the one who forwarded all of our personal emails and private texts from day one of our relationship to his wife.  So then this woman becomes angry and obsessed with me.  She starts emailing, texting, calling at all hours of the night... drunk!  So the long story short, I received this horrible email from him but he had already told me that his wife was "monitoring" all of his email accounts and texts and phone calls.  So, till this day, I don't even know if he wrote the email or if she did.  I need to know if he really is that horrible of a person.  Don't ask why, I just need to know the truth.  So I contacted him and said I needed to ask a question.  He told his wife that I contacted him and another rain of ugly messages and again, I don't know if they are from him or from her.  So after what he did to me, he not only betrayed my trust but humiliated me on top of it all.  And here I am, still in love with the son of a bitch.  I feel worthless.  I feel like a piece of garbage that he would have an obese alcoholic who chain smokes, oh and she cheated on him too... forgot to mention that.  I am a good woman, never been unfaithful, went through hell in my marriage to an alcoholic but was strong enough to divorce him.  It took me years to get over that and just when I feel like I can take a chance with a man again... this is what I got.  I am not suicidal but I can honestly say that I wouldn't mind if I croaked right now.  I would feel bad for my siblings and my pets but I am just so tired of this.  Can someone please tell me how he could do this to me and still sleep at night?  How can he just forget about me when he was ready to spend his life with me?  How could he just stop loving me like that and cut me out of his life to go back to someone that he is not going to be able to sustain a marriage with?  Is he a bad person?  Was I so incredibly naive that I didn't see the truth?  The truth being that I was used until she wanted him back?  He will not talk to me or answer my questions.  He told me to leave him alone, he told me that he used me and always loved her.  But again, was that message from him or her?  I wish I was as coldhearted as he is so that I could just blow all this to hell.  I am miserable, lonely and I feel hopeless right now.  I might feel different tomorrow but right now, it hurts like a MF!
