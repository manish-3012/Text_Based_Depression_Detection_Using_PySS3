I can't even commit to offing myself.Met the girl of my dreams, rescued me from my darkness. We were in love, it ended. I looked back knowing I was responsible for it, I didn't treat her with the same abundance of love that she showed me. I've been depressed about it since April. It isnt the only thing thats been stressing me, but the most important thing to me and definitely strikes the deepest.

I decided to cut myself, my first time. But i can't even bring myself to making deep enough cuts. I'm thinking of getting rope because hanging myself is easier. I don't  really want to hear the whole "oh no, dont do it!" I just need to post somewhere because I don't like the people in my life and any kind of conversation would be nice right now because I've never felt more alone. I've had these thoughts growing up but I've never done anything other than take a few extra ritalin pills before.
