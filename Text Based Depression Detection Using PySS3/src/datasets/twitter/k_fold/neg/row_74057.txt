Pregnancy is saving meIâ€™m not pregnant but itâ€™s the one thing that is always a constant desire for me. Even when I was a child. Recently I married young so we donâ€™t have much money but the only thing keeping me from suicidal thoughts is thinking about motherhood and pregnancy. And about how it would give me a sense of purpose and bigger meaning to life. 

I know I should never have a child for my own benefit if I canâ€™t support it. And we probably could support a child, just not amazing support. Again we donâ€™t have much money but we have family members who want us to have children and I donâ€™t doubt his family would pitch in. 

But I also.... I really hate these suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™ve never had an attempt or anything but I guess I just need someone to tell me that Even though it might help me a lot, it wouldnâ€™t be whatâ€™s best for the baby to get pregnant at this time. And that it would be better to wait.... 

Any tips from mothers here or people in similar situations?
