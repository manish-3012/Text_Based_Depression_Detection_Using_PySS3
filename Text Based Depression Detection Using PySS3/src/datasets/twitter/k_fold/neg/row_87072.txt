I think I'm suicidal.Maybe.

I want to be dead but I don't have the effort to do it. Maybe I don't want to hurt people who care and maybe I just don't want to be responsible for my own death. But I still want to be dead.

This isn't a throwaway but an old account. People watch my reddit account and I can't post anything without hearing about it later. I can't talk to anyone who understands what I've been through either. The people who know and can help me with my past are actually toxic. Those who know now have never been in that position... they don't understand all the regrets and shame I have and feel.

I am surrounded by loving people. Online and in real life. Every day I have the best support. I still feel alone. I still want to be dead.

I don't know if I feel anything anymore. I cried a bit a minute ago but I didn't really feel sad or upset. I go out and hang out with people but I don't really feel joy or happiness. I am a hollowed out shell of what I used to be. The things I've done have taken all of me.

Still I don't want to be the person I was. I don't want to be the person I am. I just want to be dead. I want to be nothing.
