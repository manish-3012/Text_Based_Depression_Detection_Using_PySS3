I think I deserve to dieFirst of all I want to apologize for my english, since it's not my native lenguage it might have some mistakes. That being said here is my story

When I was 12-13 years old I started having panic/anxiety attacks, that lead me to depression, missing school, complete lack of social life etc. Being isolated in my house caused me a pornography addiction, eventually leading me to have a rape fetish.
Now, what sickens me here is that im pretty much 90% sure that some of the content I ended up watching (1 or 2 videos) was actual rape footage uploaded to kinky porn sites, at that age I was ignorant and weren't empathetic enough to really understand how awful that videos actually were

Today I feel completly sick for having enjoyed that, thoughts like I deserve to die or that im a monster are recurrent in my head
