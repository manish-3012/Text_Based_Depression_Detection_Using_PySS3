I would appreciate some advice, if you can - please, take your time. Thank you in advance.In my greatest imagination I'm unable to conceive my life being worth living any longer. I intend to die. Sooner rather than later, obviously.

I'm sure my story isn't much unlike many others, so I'm not going to get into why, or how I feel in any great depth.

As things stand I'm only looking for advice on how to handle my actions from here, and that is this: Should I tell those few people I care about that I intend to kill myself, and offer them time with me before I go? 

I feel as though I'd be setting myself up for an intervention, which I don't want, but would accept. On one hand, I feel that I'd only be causing them more pain than if I were to just disappear. On the other, I feel as though I owe them this.

They understand that I'm depressed.

I have been for over 12 years and contemplated suicide for a great portion of my life.

I've sought and received professional help from a psychiatrist.

I've taken anti depressants.

I intend to use nitrogen asphyxiation - if you can think of a better way, I'm all ears.

I am, of course, willing to listen to all of your suggestions, and answer any questions. I imagine many of you will have ethical problems with giving me the answers to these questions. I don't want to drag you into a sordid affair, but would ask for your pity and kindness in this matter.

I apologize to all of you for adding another issue onto the pile, and thank all of you so much for all you've done for all the people here.

Please help me.

(This took longer to punch out than I had imagined, and I'll be going to bed as I submit this. As I mentioned, there is no rush)
