I'm going through a lot of shit right now and I don't think I can pull through.I don't know where to start.
I think I've always considered suicide an option. And that's part of the reason I'm still alive. If killing myself is an option. Then facing what's put infront of me is also an option. And I'm doing it by my own will and I am not forced to face anything.

By my own will I've lived thus far and reached this much.

Well. Today I think that I'm finally there. At the point where I think I've had enough. That I can't take it anymore.
For years I've been depressed. Social alienation. An unstable and unsafe living environment and being raised by a dysfunctional family left me with all kinds of shit and baggage to carry with me. I've never been in a successful friendship. I've only been in an emotionally draining romantic relationship. And the only feelings I still have are at someone who would never view me the same way.

My parents are finally having a divorce. However. It's not the way I ever imagined a divorce would go down.
I always imagined my parents just solving their issues on a table with their lawyers. Sign a contract or some shit and then get on with their lives.
But apparently not. Divorces are much more childish and stupid. By both parties.
Both my parents are being manipulative to me and my brother who is outside the country right now.

And to top it all off. In less than 5 days. I have finals. And those finals in this specific year will dictate how my entire life will go because of my country's shitty educational system.
I am honestly just too tired.
I don't want to deal with anything anymore.
At most people will miss me for a month. That is if anyone would truly miss me other than my mom.
