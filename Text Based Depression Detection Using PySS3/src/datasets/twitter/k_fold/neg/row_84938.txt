HelpI am miserable.. and I'm exhausted.

I am thinking about taking a lot of my anxiety pills, not enough to kill me, but maybe I won't be awake for some days or idk. 

Idc anymore. 

I don't want someone to find my body and telling my family and friends. Imagining my funeral is not pretty... but I just want to stop hurting... 

Please, I need someone that is not a hot line or a therapist to talk to...
