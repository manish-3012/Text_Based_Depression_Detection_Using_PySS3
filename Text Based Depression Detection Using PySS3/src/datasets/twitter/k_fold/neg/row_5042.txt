i hate myselfeverything about me is gross. barely hit puberty at 17. im not normal. i sound 11 years old and im about to graduate. i got my nose pierced hoping i would see some difference but now i feel like people think i got it for the attention when attention is the last thing i want. i cant express feelings to a girl im in love with. i dont enjoy the company of others. i prefer to be alone either in bed or playing video games like the fucking loser i am
