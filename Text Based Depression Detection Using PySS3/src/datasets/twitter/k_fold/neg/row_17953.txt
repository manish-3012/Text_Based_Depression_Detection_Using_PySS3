I'm Afraid.I was in an abusive household for 16 years, my dad started abusing me physically and mentally after I turned 10 when my mom died, he'd physically abused me when I was young, slapping me, punching me, pulling my hair and screaming in my face. As I grew older I got taller really fast, I was around 6 feet tall when I was 15, so he stopped physically abusing me and settled for demeaning me and telling me I'd always fail if he wasn't involved in my life.

I stopped living with him after he joined an assisted living facility around 9 months ago and my suicidal thoughts and desires have significantly jumped since then, at least when I was being abused I was stable and I didn't fear homelessness or anything like that, but now due to the fact my father also financially controlled me and stopped me from going to therapy or from working anywhere I'm sitting at 26 years old with no job experience and a heavy burden of psychological issues that I can't afford to get help for. I made a gofundme to try to get help(which I'm not posting due to guidelines and whatnot) and it hasn't worked in the slightest to get any form of stability.

I don't know what to do, a friend is supporting me until the end of the year and I genuinely have no idea what to do or how to handle living, I'm afraid of staying alive but at the same time I have people to live for, friends who care about me, but even though I have those friends it doesn't stop that little voice in my mind, in my heart, telling me that things are going to get too hard to handle at the end of the year, more suffering is incoming, there's no one to support me and no way I can support myself.. I want help but no matter how loud I cry for it there's no one who can help me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to 'want to live for myself'.
