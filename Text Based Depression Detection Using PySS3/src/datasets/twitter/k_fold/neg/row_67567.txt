iâ€™m tiredIâ€™m tired of peoples fake sympathy. Iâ€™m tired of begging for help only for it to fall on deaf ears. Iâ€™m just plain tired. I havenâ€™t slept in a week. I canâ€™t sleep. Iâ€™m tired of being told to go to therapy and get on meds for the third time. They donâ€™t work. Nothing has worked. Thousands of dollars of my own money and several years of my time wasted on useless coping strategies that donâ€™t work and talking about my nonexistent feelings. I donâ€™t remember what it feels like to have genuine emotions. I just want to feel anything. Iâ€™m tired of being numb. Iâ€™ve put up with the nothingness for a long time and I think Iâ€™m about to just call it quits. No warnings, no notes, just me, a bottle of scotch, and a deer slug to my brain stem.
