Help pleaseI have been suicidal and extremely depressed a lot lately. I have started cutting again. This all started when I realized that I still miss, want, and not over the breakup with my ex. He broke up with me in September, not even a month after I had to move to another state. I posted something on fb about how I was feeling and how I was just covering up how Iâ€™m really feeling. Then his best friend started commenting on how I need to stop blaming him and plying the victim. Please help. Iâ€™m in a bad place right now...
