HelpMy mom keep calling me a devil and other names like fat, pig.  My moms boyfriend encourages this behavior and is what starts it all, he is mentally abusing me and my sister .  Yes my parents are divorced but I don't have as much time with my dad as i would like, I'm with my mom most of the time but she leaves at 8am and comes home at 7pm, leaving her boyfriend alone with us.  My moms boyfriend is the one who hates me the most, he insults me when he thinks i'm not listening.  I've currently gotten a recording of  him calling me a devil and my mom agreeing but my dad said he couldn't do anything about it. this happens a lot and I have started to pick up antisocial and self degrading traits.  Honestly I wasn't a very bad kid when my mom and dad were together, they didn't really have any fights, my mom and her boyfriend have, my dad would NEVER tell me that i was fat or cuss me out.  My last therapist quit her job and i've been alone for about 3 years bottling up anger and sadness.  I would have panic attacks whenever hes mentioned and whenever im near him i would get scared and at the verge of tears.  He has made me mentally unstable and alone.  Because of that everyone avoids me and I feel like a huge burden to the world.  I've done s31f h@r\^\^ before but quit a few months ago happy.   I've just started doing it again and have thought about kms.   I just need someone to talk to. most likely a therapist.
