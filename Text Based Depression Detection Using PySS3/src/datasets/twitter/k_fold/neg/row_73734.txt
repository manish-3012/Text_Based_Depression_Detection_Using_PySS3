Unsatisfied with what I've become, what I'm doing, and where I amI'm a 20 year old college student, and nothing seems to be going well for me. It's gotten to the point where I'm starting to care less about everything and even everyone in my life. I'll be laying in my bed on the days I don't have class, and I can never bring myself to get up. Every single time I do something good, something worse seems to come up behind me and take me down. For one, I just took a test that will determine my future, and I think I did really well. However, I just got a  really bad speeding ticket a few hours ago (second ticket in general within 4 months), and it looks like it's going to cost me a lot of money and cause a lot of grief for my parents. I really hate that...causing grief for my parents. It seems to happen all the time, and I can't seem to make it stop. I've considered leaving everyone I know and moving to another country, but I don't want to just disappear and worry everyone because they wouldn't know what happened to me. At least with suicide, people would know what happened and the worry for me would end right there. There'd be some sort of initial closure. On top of all that, I seem to have completely failed at attracting any woman whatsoever for the past five years now, and that has additionally taken a toll on my self-esteem. And please don't tell me I'm too young for that to matter because I cannot be convinced otherwise. All my friends at this point are either dating, good with women, or married. I'm not satisfied with what I have made my life, and I want a way out of this mess.
