i want to disappear without hurting anybodyso ive posted here a couple of times and it has honestly saved me, so i am just going to vent for a little bit, so far itâ€™s been a help. so i just want to vent for a little bit, im not looking for advice, just trying to keep my sanity rn

so before i talked about how i really feel like my friends hated me and they were just keeping me around for laughs, it made me never want to speak to any of my friends again. but because of that situation i discovered that i have 3 friends that genuinely do care about me. they were honestly the main reason i didnâ€™t off myself. 

however when im on the verge of a breakdown they can tell and always ask whatâ€™s wrong, i never want to say anything because im scared to bring them down or make them feel bad. i still want to die all the time but it makes me feel bad that i cant bring myself to tell them that im suffering with all these mental issues. 

thatâ€™s why i wish they didnâ€™t care anymore or that i could disappear without anyone noticing or caring. i donâ€™t want to exist anymore but i donâ€™t want to hurt others with my problems 

im scared to hurt people or be a roadblock to their happiness. my friends are good people and deserve better than someone as negative as me hanging around them. 

i truly wish they would just forget about me one of these days so i could finally kill myself without worrying about them getting hurt, ive heard too many stories of people being traumatized by someone elseâ€™s suicide and i wouldnâ€™t wish that on anyone 

anyways thanks to everyone who keeps helping me, posting on here really helps me from doing dumb shit. sorry if i seem like such an attention whore tho lmao
