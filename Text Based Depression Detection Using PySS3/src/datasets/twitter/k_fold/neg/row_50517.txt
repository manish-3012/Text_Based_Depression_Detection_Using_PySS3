I know when I am going to kill myselfIâ€™m going to kill my self on my 19th birthday. If I have not found happiness and a reason to live by then, then I will take my life. Recently I found out that the girl I like got a boyfriend and I feel like shit, my grades are terrible, parents hate me, and my friends donâ€™t care about me. Iâ€™ve tried to take my life twice already and both times I somehow found a reason to keep going, but at this point I just want to give up. Iâ€™ve never felt love and I can barely feel anything any more.
