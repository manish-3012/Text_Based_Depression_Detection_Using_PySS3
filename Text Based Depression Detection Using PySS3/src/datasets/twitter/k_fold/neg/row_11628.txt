At the end of my ropeI have had many issues in my life. Nothing like I am facing right now. I feel like the world is against me and that this is a fight I just can not win. For the past week I have thought about nothing but how to end my life. I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore. Or feel the pain. I know I have a loving family and some of the best kids I could ever have. At to that point they are why I am still here. But that only goes so far. I know I am a crappy person for that and it makes me feel even worse. 

The fear of living is what is getting to me. I donâ€™t want to anymore. But every time I think of something good I go right back to how crappy my life is and will remain to be. 

Thank you for reading this and any responses
