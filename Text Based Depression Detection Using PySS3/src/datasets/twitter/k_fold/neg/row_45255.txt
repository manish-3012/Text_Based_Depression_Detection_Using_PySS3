Iâ€™m so close to being done with life.It all started in 2017 when i was in a relationship with one of my exes, it was so bad she she verbally, mentally, emotionally and physically abused me, kicked me, punched me, slapped me, throw things at me. That relationship almost killed me, 11th November 2017 was the first time i tried to kill myself, i rode my dads bike 150 mph head on against a metal container, i flew 9 meters, i merely had a cerebral contusion and broken right leg and a broken right arm, fast forward a few years to 2019 she broke up with me I was happy because i couldnt live like that anymore, last year september i met my current girlfriend, love of my life, started out well but she looked at stuff from the past, it was also my bad as my ex was obssessive and had my facebook and posted stuff on it and i forgot about those, so she got pissed that it was still there, time passed and it was good she moved to australia 2 weeks ago and if i dont kill myself ill be there in late June, she said that sheâ€™s bad at making girl friends, i understood it but i asked her if sheâ€™s okay with not bringing guys over to her house to chill with her, (she got stuck on her balcony with a guy and i only found out about it after 2 days) sheâ€™s been drinking with dudes and hanging out with them, her house and their house too, she said this topic isnâ€™t good to talk about she says i ruin her vibes when i ask to talk about this and now i just feel like such a burden, i only cause her stress because of it, everytime we talk i ask about it but she just gets mad at me, and asked for a break, i see IG stories of her with guys, post a pic of her on her boxers underwear on snapchat with the caption â€œwhat up?â€ I canâ€™t take this pain, she said the o ly thing i did to her was cause her stress and pain, never done anything good in my life, I just want to kill myself, i cant take it much longer, i miss her so much. I love her and im willing to kill myself to make her happy. If it means her being happy iâ€™ll do anything, iâ€™ll just die.
