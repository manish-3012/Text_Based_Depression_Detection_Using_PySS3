Life has shit on me since the day I was born.My family is shit, the Third World country I live in is shit, my health is shot to pieces. Everything I touch crumbles to dust, Nothing ever works out, No romance. No friends. Unable to work full-time due to fucked-up health. 

My toxic family has always hated me and they're blaming me for my declining health. My psycho dad always threatened to kill me since I was a toddler. My mother doesn't give two fucks about me and never has. Instead she worships the abusive cunt she married.

When I was younger I was full of hope that my life would change. It did but not in the way I expected. IT GOT MUCH WORSE. My fucking disease is killing me. No cure. The universe has been mocking me and shitting on me since the day I was born. 

I realise now as I sit in agony that this world isn't meant for people like me. This cunty life will be ended this summer. I'm going to go on a nice holiday and then end it all. I just don't know how yet. Hanging seems like a good option. 

I can't wait to end this constant trauma-fest that has been my fucking life. My parents will be relieved that I'm gone. I've been the family Scapegoat forever so they'll get their wish when I disappear. Fuck those cunt parents who ruin their children's lives.
