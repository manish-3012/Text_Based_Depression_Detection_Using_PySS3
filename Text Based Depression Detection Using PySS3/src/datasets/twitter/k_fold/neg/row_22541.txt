I just don't know what to do....Feeling low.  Feeling sick to my stomach.  Feeling like a lock without a key. Well, no.  Feeling like a lock with a key held by all the people who have ever turned their back to me.  By all of my failures.  

It's funny how badly I can want to live and die at the same time.  How the future I desperately want seems so damn out of reach.  I feel like I've reached a wall and nothing I do will get me over it.

Medicine? on it.  I'm even in a formal treatment program.  

I'm sitting next to the person I most desperately want to hold and comfort me and feel no love or support.  I just feel empty and numb and alone and don't know what to do.

It's not even the depression that hurts the most.  It's the apathy.
