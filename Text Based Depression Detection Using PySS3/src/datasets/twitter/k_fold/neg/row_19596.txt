What to say to someone suicidalHi, i hope i'm in the right place to get advice on this situation.

My long time online friend has been struggling with a bunch of problems such as depression. They recently texted me a very long message saying how much i mean to them but also how bad they have been feeling. 

They said they don't no how much longer they can live on and they probably only have months left. They're lost in life, no passions &amp; no motivation to keep going anymore. It is very alarming to me. They seem to seriously think they won't be of this world anymore in the next few months.

 I don't know what to say. I want to help them so bad but i'm scared there's nothing much i can do except listening to them, as we're just online friends. And i fear it might not be enough this time.
