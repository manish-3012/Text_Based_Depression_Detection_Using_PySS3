Physician Assisted Suicide for DepressionI live in NH and recently began thinking that Iâ€™d like to advocate for physician assisted suicide for depression. I feel mine has gotten so bad that I have to resort to all these messy methods when my time comes. 
I feel like we ( or anyone really) who is of a legal age should be able to meet with their doctor and have their life extinguished in a respectable and non messy and dignified way. 

I feel like politics and control prevents this from being a reality. 
I havenâ€™t fully fleshed out this idea. Any thoughts on this
