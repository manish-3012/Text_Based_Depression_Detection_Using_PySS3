Thanks BrexitMy boss informed me today they'll be moving their operations to the Netherlands next month. 100+ people have now lost their job including mine all because a bunch of old beetroot looking cunts hate brown people. 

I used to love my country but it doesn't even feel like home anymore, the absolute worst government we've had in a long time who insists on self-harming the country. It's only going to get worse.

I'm going to walk down outside parliament and top myself.

Fuck bigots.

Fuck Theresa May.

Fuck the Tories.
