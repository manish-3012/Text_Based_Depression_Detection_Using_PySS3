I live to lieI wake up everyday and tell myself I'm fine. I go to work, pour into my kids, and say I'm loving life. My darling first graders ask how my weekend was, I say it was the best even when it wasn't.

I go home everyday to work on school until I sleep. I rarely have the mental fortitude to force myself to eat. The weekends are no better for I am trapped alone. The friends who I once thought I had don't even answer their phones.

My partner is oblivious and even when he's not, he blames himself for the horrid feelings and thoughts. He gets upset when I can't explain, so I leave all the misery inside my stupid brain.

I love my life I tell myself and sometimes it is true. But I think about my brain remanense on the walls more than you knew. I mentioned it once in a song of mine, on the edge looking down, but I didn't pull the trigger cause you needed me around.

I beg for peace. I beg for sleep. All I want is rest. I hate to lie to the lights of my life so I push you all away instead. Once I'm dead there's no need for words and you won't miss me long. I don't matter that much, I can't wait until I'm gone.
