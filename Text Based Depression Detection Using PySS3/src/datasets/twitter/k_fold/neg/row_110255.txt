I have struggled with suicidal ideations all my lifeThe earliest I remember I was probably somewhere around 8, a string of things had happened, divorced parents, school sucking, things like that, and I just broke down crying to my mother saying that there was no point in living.

Over the whole course of growing up, I would just be sitting there and out of the blue the thought would come " Hey, you could kill yourself right now.". It still happens. 

Now, 14 years later, I am married ( no kids though) and she is probably the only thing stopping me.

 I am currently deployed with the Army and don't get home for a few more months. It would be super easy to do here, and some things have happened that make those thoughts surface more.

Why am I the way I am? Does anyone have any advice to help these thoughts go away and not come back?
