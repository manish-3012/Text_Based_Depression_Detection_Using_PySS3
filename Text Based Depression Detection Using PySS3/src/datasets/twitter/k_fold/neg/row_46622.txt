i hate this feeling and idk what to do anymorei feel so empty and numb. i genuinely canâ€™t deal with it anymore. i donâ€™t have anyone to talk to and when iâ€™ve tried nothing has actually helped. i have nothing to look forward to, i feel like everyday now is just me waiting until i can actually kill myself, I stop myself every time and i donâ€™t know why.
