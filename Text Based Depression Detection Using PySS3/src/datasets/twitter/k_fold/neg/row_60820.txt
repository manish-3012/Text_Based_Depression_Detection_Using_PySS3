I honestly donâ€™t want anything anymore. I just want to sleep for a very long timeI literally do everything Iâ€™m â€œsupposedâ€ to do. I work, exercise, and have a semblance social life and I still feel so fucking exhausted. Like what else could I possibly need? Just let me rest. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
