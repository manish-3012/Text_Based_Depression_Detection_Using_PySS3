i am nothingunderneath it all, i am nothing. it's weird. i'm so much but then i'm nothing. everything is so intense with me and i find distraction after distraction, no matter how harmful but when i'm reduced down to my actual self, i am nothing. if i died it wouldn't be a loss. i don't know who i am. i don't know if i'm real. i'm not sure.

and i watch everyone else receive sympathy and love and i feel so estranged from it all. nobody cares about me like that. i have friends and family but they don't care. i need help more than anyone but it. goes unnoticed and i should just die . what do i have to do for somebody to fucking give me sympathy???? 

i'm worthless. i'm not worth it. i should just die. i'm not worth being alive. i'm nothing. everything's boring. everything's boring because i have no interests, i have no personality, it's all just stolen from whatever person i'm obsessed with.

i wan t to mdi eim nothing i m alreayd dead
