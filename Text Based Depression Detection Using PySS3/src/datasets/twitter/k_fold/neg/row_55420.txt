Hello Iâ€™m just not sure what I should doWell I guess you probably heard it before but how should I call the hotline but Iâ€™m afraid my mom is gonna flip out and think I need to be brought in the mental ward Iâ€™m 17 so I canâ€™t legally say no to the forms despite the fact they donâ€™t know what I really need to feel better all I really need is the sweet release of death but I understand that the number is there for people who need it but my mother is constantly in the same room so I canâ€™t have a private phone call no matter whoâ€™s calling because she doesnâ€™t understand that I donâ€™t want to give her a panic attack and tell her Iâ€™m gonna kill myself she canâ€™t do anything and honestly Iâ€™ve been depressed for a week Iâ€™ve already planned 3 way on how Iâ€™m going to do it
