I feel like everyone is telling me to just roll over and die!There is nothing good about me.

 1) I am bangladeshi and still live in bangladesh.

 2) I am autistic.

 3) I am 19 which means almost 1/3 of my life is already over (because bangladeshi men usually live 60 years and women 70 years).

 4) I am a male and I am inferior to females.

 5) I am only 5'4''.

 6) I am fugly and brown.

 7) My parents are fucking poor, make only about 20k a year.

 8) I have no skills because I am autistic and thus I have no job and no money.

 9) I am the stupidest human to have ever existed.

 10) My head is super small. only 9 inch long and 21 inch circumference. No wonder I am autistic and super stupid. I doubt that I even have a brain inside my super tiny head. I am so dumb I can't even solve rubik's cube.

 11) I have an iq under 50.

 12) I have no friends. Everyone hates me.

 13) I am extremely socially awkward.

 14) Never even got the chance to talk to a girl. got called a pervert for just looking at girls several times.

 15) Life doesn't get better no matter how hard I try. 

 16) I have no future.

 17) Most likely no one will reply to this post.

WAAAAH! WAAAAH! (cries like a baby) T _ T Why the fuck was I even born if I can't even live happily? screw this fucked up world! FUCK YOU STUPID WORLD! FUCK YOU MONEY! FUCK YOU INTELLIGENCE! FUCK YOU LUCK!
