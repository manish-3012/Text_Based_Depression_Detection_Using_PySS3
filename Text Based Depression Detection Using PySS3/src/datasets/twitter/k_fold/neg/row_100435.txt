My life is a messI'm in a lot of pain. I feel like my life is a failure. I'm almost 18 years old, and I'm two years behind in school because my depression made me miss two years. I'll graduate high school when I'm 20. In my class of 15-16 year Olds at school, I'm the only one who's never been kissed, had a romantic partner, or had sex. I recently took an IQ test and found out that I'm below average. I'm very overweight from stress eating. I'm the ugliest person in my school. Everyone else in my school has lives just like the movies, and it hurts that I'm so abnormal. I try to find solace online, but I see that it's the same here too. All the teenager forums I've seen have people with happiness, partners, friends, drama, sex, fights, etc. When I look at meme pages, they all have memes making fun of fat people and dumb people and "the quiet kid". All my dreams are crushed. When I imagined high school, I imagine that my life would become normal and my issues would be fixed. I always dreamed of finding somebody who would love me. Now I know that can never happen. Everyone I know is better than me. I don't even have an identity. I can't keep walking forward, it's like a treadmill with spikes. I want the earth to pause so I can catch my breath because living like this is exhausting.
