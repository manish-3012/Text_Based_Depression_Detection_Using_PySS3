I'm alone foreverI'm drunk and sad and I feel alone. Things are just bad. I just want things to be better or to be at least okay. I cancel my shift every morning when I wake up (I'm a substitute teacher and you can cancel up to 45 mins before your shift starts) and I can tell my parents are disappointed in me. I just wish that I were different. I wish I were valuable and worthwhile. I just want to be loved.

And now my best friend hates me. There's no repentance, there's no reparation. Forgiveness doesn't exist. It's just me. Alone. Forever. 

I have to stop it. Soon. Now.
