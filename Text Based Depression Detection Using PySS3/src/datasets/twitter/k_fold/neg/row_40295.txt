I dunno wtf happened, OMG!So I was looking  fr smokes when some woman got mad 2 X. The second time, I lost my cool and told her that I was going to kill myself.

Went up after to my room and was 1 sec away from calling Paratransit to go to some hotel to jump off. Just as I was about to hit the PARATRANSIT number, I froze and called 911

I thought omg, Had I a fucking close call to doing myself in by now. I KNEW and KNOW I am not well, mentally, and I happened to remember I had a doc's appointment on the 7th of June.

I went out and talked to my parents and felt so bad about being so sick, and it catching me again. I felt so f\-ed up I don't know exactly what to do if the whole mess happened again. I am now scared of things mucking up\[ like this again. I could be ok soon tonight for now.
