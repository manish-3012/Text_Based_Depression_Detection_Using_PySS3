Iâ€™m doneIm a 19 year old male and donâ€™t want to live anymore, i once tried to kill myself but I failed at that, later I quit my job to follow a dream of joining the army, but i broke my shoulder and my other hand so that plan failed, shortly after my girlfriend with who I was together for 3 years left me and then they told me that i have to get surgery on both arms, so I got it and then the goverment started giving me some shit about a previous job, had a court case about it and now im going to lose my apartment too, I have to get regular treatment of the wounds but i dont even have enough money to do so, so now im also risking infection because i have no money, and the best part is that all this shit happened last month, i cant think of a single thing that has not gone wrong in my life
