you know, people donâ€™t really care that youâ€™re suicidal.people say â€œi hope you get better,â€ â€œyou need to take care of yourself,â€ whenever they talk about mental health. the minute that i open up they say that i should call a hotline and stop talking to them. i am truly alone. if i go to the doctor and nothing changes i am going to end it.
