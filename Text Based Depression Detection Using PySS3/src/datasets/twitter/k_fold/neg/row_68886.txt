I'll try to kill myself tommorow nightI'm a 16 year old from a India, my friend gifted me a video game two year back called counter strike global offensive, back then I was new to gaming and suddenly got hooked, whenever I felt sad or depressed it helped me cope, then flash forward few days back on my birthday my parents agreed to let me spend 7700 ruppes ($100) on an in-game item which can be cashed out for real money later so it wasn't an issue and I got scammed just a week later losing it, I felt so sad that my parents hard earned money is wasted this way and had waiting so long to get that item. I feel like killing myself not over the money but because of how much it hurts
