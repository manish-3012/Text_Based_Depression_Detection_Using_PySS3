Don't know what else to do.So my wife told me she's filing divorce papers as soon as she has the money. We have been separated for 2 months now and we were working on our marriage. Things were really looking up last week and we were doing great. Then I screwed up my dosage and missed a few doses of my Zoloft... I had severe anxiety over the weekend that lead to us fighting and me becoming very insecure. I accused her of cheating and hiding conversations in the secret messages on FB. Today she walked out on marriage counciling after I got upset when she said she didn't want to go any more. I just think I'm done with life. I just fuck up everything I touch. I can't make friends. I'm already screwing my kids up because I'm a shit father. I'm just so.tired of feeling this way. I thought I could be better. I thought I could fix things. But I can't, I never could and now I never will.
