Depressed and suicidal because of my appearanceI am very insecure about my appearance to the point where I self-harm and have attempted suicide. I know this must seem vain, but I barely even feel human when I look in the mirror. I hate my face so much that I avoid going out, or wear hats and sunglasses in public to cover it up. I spend hours in front of mirrors and looking at pictures of me to sort of judge my appearance and try to fix myself I guess. My big problem areas are my nose and face shape. I feel so out of place in this world. I just feel so worthless when I see pictures of beautiful people, and I canâ€™t help but feel a sharp pang of jealously. I havenâ€™t been diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder if anyone is wondering, although I never talk to anyone about how I feel on this topic, besides my significant other. Iâ€™m sorry for the rant and giant paragraph (Iâ€™m on mobile), Iâ€™m just not sure what to do anymore; Iâ€™m just sitting in my bathroom wondering if having scars on my face will be worth it. (Also, please do not pm me asking for pictures of me. Thank you)
