I was supposed to die today.At age 17, I promised myself I would kill myself before or on my 25th birthday. The clock struck midnight a while ago. Iâ€™m furious with myself for not doing it. I donâ€™t know how. Iâ€™m terrified of failing and being brain dead. If I had the tools to do it quickly and error-free, Iâ€™d do it in a heartbeat.

Life has only gotten more unbearable in the 8 years Iâ€™ve made myself this promise. Now, Iâ€™ve just gotten older and more hopeless â€” and Iâ€™ve realized that my death wouldnâ€™t make a difference to the people around me anyway. Thatâ€™s not depression talking â€” nobody depends on me. Nobody loves me. Iâ€™m treated at work, at home, and in the world like I donâ€™t exist. And honestly, I truly wish I just didnâ€™t exist.

The only reason Iâ€™m still alive is because thereâ€™s nobody to take care of my dog, whom I love with every fiber of my being. But even so, heâ€™s a sweet, lovable boy who would do well somewhere else.

TL;DR: promised myself at 17 Iâ€™d be dead by today. Iâ€™m still here, and I deeply regret it and am furious with myself.
