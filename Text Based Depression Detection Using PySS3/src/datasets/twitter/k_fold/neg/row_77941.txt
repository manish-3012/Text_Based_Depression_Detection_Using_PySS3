Need advice Hey everyone. I feel im at an inpass. I've been plagued with suicidal thoughts, Derealization, and other symptoms since the suicide of my cousin. I had an empathetic response to it by thinking about my own suicide, ultimately. I am extremely disconnected and isolated now. I'm at my boiling point and so lost. I can't get the balls to tell my parents, or any of my friends. I also just got put on wellbutrin and risperdal which have made this worse. What can I do?
