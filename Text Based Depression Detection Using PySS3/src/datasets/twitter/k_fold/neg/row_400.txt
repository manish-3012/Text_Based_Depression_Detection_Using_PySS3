Suicidal, but my life is fine.My life is actually kinda going pretty great now. But, for some reason, I still feel the desire to end my own life. Youâ€™d expect it to be scary or whatever, but itâ€™s not. Iâ€™m doing a lot of stuff that Iâ€™ve wanted to for a while as of late and my birthday is coming up. But, for whatever reason, my brain is telling me that I want to die. Itâ€™s weird and hard to explain. Sorry for bad explanation.
