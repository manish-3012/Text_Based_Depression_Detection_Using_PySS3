I just want to leave everything behindIt's not worth anymore. It isn't,it isn't.

Nothing matters anymore,nothing. Not the least

* All the things I knew
* All that I had any attraction for or loved
* All the texts I am planning to transcribe
* All the things I wanted to read

I just want to cease existing. Completely. I want to just experience no joy,no sorrow,no feeling,just completely stop existing. It'd be merciful if someone killed me and made that come to fruit

Sorry if I'm incoherent.
