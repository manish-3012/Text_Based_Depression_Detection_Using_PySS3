I just don't know what to doI'm not thinking of committing suicide, I just really need to vent and get some advice or something cause I feel like the shittiest shit that's ever been shat. I feel like teenagers aren't supposed to go through this, yet I am. Why? Because I'm so fuckin socially awkward and I look like a fucking train wreck and I'm beginning to feel like I have this vibe to me that screams to people "stay away!" even though thats the complete opposite of what I want. I do nothing with people on weekends and after school, nobody ever asks me if I want to do shit with them. I feel like most of this all sort of started when for the first goddamn time in my life I had a girlfriend, she made me feel loved, then we broke up 2 fucking weeks later and things kinda went to shit for me. As for being antisocial, basically through grade 8 and 9 I was really weird and i was kind of just in my own world and was detached from everybody, yes I still talked to people, but well, I dunno. I want to try and change this but I never ask people to do stuff because there's always this fear i have of hearing no, because that's always been the outcome

Thanks
