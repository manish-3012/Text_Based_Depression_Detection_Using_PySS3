Why can't I be one of the normal, pretty girls? :(I'm not one of the girls who can afford cute Hollister clothes, has a beautiful smile and hair, and has hundreds of followers on social media. I can't for the life of me come up with clever captions for photos, and the photos I do upload are all boring. I don't have an exciting life. 

I am so ugly and worthless. Nothing I do is good enough, no matter how hard I try. I suck as a writer and as a human being. The world doesn't need me, and I don't need it. I'm a mentally fucked up freak who has no business being here; I don't belong. Not only am I ugly and talentless, I also struggle with age dysphoria issues that nobody even tries to understand. Nothing excites me anymore. I have nothing to live for. 

I know how badly it would hurt my family if I killed myself, but they'd get over it. I would have to live with my horrible self FOREVER. I'm sorry, I just can't love myself. Trust me, I've been trying for years. All I see is an ugly, fat, stupid monster who will never be one of the normal, cute, popular girls you see on Instagram and around campus. 

If I could take a pill that would kill me instantly without any pain, I think I would be very tempted. I'm just in so much pain, I have no idea how to deal with it anymore. I'm exhausted and ready to leave this hellhole of a world. :(
