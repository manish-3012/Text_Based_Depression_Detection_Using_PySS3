pressure to diethis might sound insane but i donâ€™t really know. iâ€™ve been through a lot of shit lately. iâ€™m also now an alcoholic. iâ€™m very fucking young to be an alcoholic so i feel this weird pressure to die young. iâ€™ve always been suicidal, but never have i felt a need to die like this. iâ€™ve felt a want to die, sure, but never a need. i feel like i need to die young in order for people to understand what is really happening to me, and not hate me and what iâ€™ve become. iâ€™m so fucking miserable. every day is a waking hell. i need alcohol to be alive if that makes sense. but lately itâ€™s not working and i just really really want to drink some good vodka and take some pills and call it a life. so fucking sick of this. being used for my body, not that i donâ€™t let that happen. been taken advantage of so many fucking times. raped and assaulted. iâ€™m sure itâ€™s my fault but why me? sick of it. would rather just die now and maybe people will know what not to do with their life.
