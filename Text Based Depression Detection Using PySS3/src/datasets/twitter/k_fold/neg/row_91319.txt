Just want to be done with this whole life business.I don't necessarily want to die, but I'm not prempting it either. The whole issue really pivots on me feeling fundamentally incapable of some sort of 'normal' existence. Either I am right in what I think and feel. In which case the world is completely absurd and anything I do is simply feeding into a host of systems and ideologies that I completely opose by nature of existing inside them. Or I am wrong in what I think and feel in which case I am baseline incompatible with life in its current form, and the only thing that remains is another 40 odd years of misery and then dying anyway. 

I've probably been on the phone for all of five or six hours with all of my friend (haha I'm so fucking clever -_- ) Just trying to check my perspective because I know that depression can warp the hell out of how you see the world and I try my best to, though I am probably only marginally successful, remain rational. 

However, I tend to believe it's not a strict matter of current perception as this is a line of thinking that is present even on my better days. Where I am at mentally is just an exaggeration of a state that is ever present. 

Leaving anything open from there as it's the core conflict. 

TLDR: I'm worn out because I feel like I cannot belong, and that I'm not sure I would want to if I could.
