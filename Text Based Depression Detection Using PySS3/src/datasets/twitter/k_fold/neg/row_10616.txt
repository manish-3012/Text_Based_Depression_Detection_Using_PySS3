This is pointlessEverything feels pointless. They put me on Prozac but who knows if it even works for me I have to wait so long to even feel its effect whatâ€™s the point in waiting i donâ€™t want to be alone but I donâ€™t want to be with people I donâ€™t know what to do I donâ€™t want anything but I donâ€™t want to not do nothing
