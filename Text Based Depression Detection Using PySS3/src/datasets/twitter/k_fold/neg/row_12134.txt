:( Watched some educational content...I don't know why I am posting this, but I was just watching an educational video on Borderline Personality Disorder and it really got to me. I finally have a name for what I am feeling and thinking, and why I feel and think that way. It is such a relief to finally have a name for this horrible pain I have to live with every lousy day of my life. I have known that this is what is "wrong" with me for a little while now, but to see it being put into words like this video had was emotionally cathartic for me. I cried. I really did...especially when it talked about self-harming and how that is how some people with BPD express the pain that is inside of them because they can't express it any other way. 

I sit here with big ugly scratches on my arms and fading scars of past cutting behaviors and I cry. I cry because I am still misunderstood and mistreated, though not always on purpose...I still hurt too much and care too much...and my emotions are always all over the place. I love too hard and fall too hard and my life is a constant cycle of loving the world, hating the world, and hating myself for being so broken.

This is why I am often OK one moment, but then some little thing will happen--something that a "normal" person might not even notice--and it sends me into a tailspin...into my darkness and self-hating behavior, and I end up trying to commit suicide to rid myself of this torment that I feel constantly. I am not trying to hurt my family...I love them. I just want my pain to stop. I want to NOT feel anything anymore so I can't get hurt anymore.

That is me.

FML Borderline Personality Disorder.There, but for the grace of God, there go I.

I want to die. Please let me die. I can't stand the pain.

I am numb... 

Yet...
 
I am crying.
