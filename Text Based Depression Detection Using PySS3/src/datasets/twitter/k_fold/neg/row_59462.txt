I think I made a mistake in telling a friend I've been considering suicideI was at work this weekend and couldn't stop crying before our shift on Friday night.  One of my coworkers who is a friend too asked what was going on.  I told her how I've tried every treatment out there with no success.  I told her I've been thinking more about suicide than usual.  One of our other coworkers was nearby but didn't appear to be listening.

Today I got a voicemail from the employee assistance people saying "It's rather urgent, please call us back."  Of course I wasn't thinking and deleted the voicemail so now I don't have their phone number to even call back if I wanted to.  But I hope I didn't screw up my job.  I WILL be taking my life in a matter of weeks but I am counting on the life insurance provided through my employer to make sure my family can keep our house since they can't afford it without my income.  And yes, I checked, the life insurance covers any form of death.

Anyway, I don't know if it was my friend, the other coworker, or if someone told the supervisor that got EAP calling me.  Either way it sucks.  I have a psychiatrist I work with.  I told him the time is coming and he didn't freak out on me.  I don't need to talk to some stranger through EAP when I have my own doctor who knows what's going on.  Ok, maybe he doesn't know details like the date and the method but he knows I have a date and a method chosen. 

Should've kept my mouth shut.  Shouldn't be such an idiot.  I guess I am pretty good at hiding it and convincing people I'm ok.  I'll just have to do that with the EAP people too.
