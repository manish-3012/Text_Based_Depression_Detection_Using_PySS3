I made a motivational/inspirational podcast. Looking for feedback!Hey Guys. I have been depressed for a long part of my life and still am quite frequently. But in that depression, I have started recording my thoughts to help me through. After a while, I realized that I should make it public so that other people like me also get some help or at, the very least, feel a bit better. 

I have put up a few episodes on Podbean as a test to see if you guys like it or not. If you enjoy and support me, then I would go on making such audios. 

Kindly note all the episodes that I have recorded until now have been recorded from my cell phone as I have no professional mic at the moment. Secondly, there may be pauses in between, but I wanted to make it as raw and real as possible. Nothing is, edited, or removed. Everything is a live recording. Thirdly, everything is, recorded impromptu. I don't prepare or read materials in advance. I just have a brainwave and start recording. So, take it as an experiment rather, than a super polished professional podcast. 

I would be really glad if you guys let me know if you enjoy it, if it is of any help and if you would appreciate me making more of it?
