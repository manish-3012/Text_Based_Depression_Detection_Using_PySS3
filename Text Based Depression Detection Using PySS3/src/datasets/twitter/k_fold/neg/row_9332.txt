Today I feel like dying

Dear Reddit, 

I am a fuck up.

I feel haunted.. 

Got in to three car accidents within a 2 month span. Totaled my car on Mischieve Night... Lost my job on the same night. Don't understand how or why I survived such a horrific accident. I don't understand why god wants me live and I'm pissed he didn't let me die.

My friends don't support me or understand how I feel. My family isn't there for me either nor do they care or understand what I am going through. I'm afraid to talk to the guy I'm dating about my issues because I don't want him to worry about me, but more accurately I'm afraid of him finding out how screwed up I actually am and then stop talking to me. 
I'm in such a financial hole I started to have sex with older men for money. I can't remember the last time I felt loved. I can't remember the last time I felt genuinely supported. I feel like I've never felt joy. I'm 22 and I can't remember what it was like to be a child. I can't feel joy. I think sex is the closest thing to happiness I'll ever achieve. I'm sure I'll end up addicted to hard drugs if I continue this lifestyle, but I don't know how to stop nor have a good reason to. I'm considering donating all my stuff to Goodwill and planning out my last days. I turn 23 next month, may commit suicide before then.
