Im not living, just existing, and those who stole my life from me want me humiliated and deadI posted the other day about having been hacked, badly as revenge in r/depression, and people are so cold, someone gave me a wholesome award when I said they have me trapped, will not stop, and when i said something about making fun of my pain, he wanted to make a meme out of it at first.

I have had my identity stolen,every email and major account and cloud violated, and pics stolen and they keep hacking and rooting every phone i get and my laptop is fucked. I have no way to contact the few friends and family i have left, and i only have my older mom, who's getting worse by the day mentally. 

We have no cable, they know our bank, cable, and lots of other personal info, and I feel no matter what, I must give up. 

I am already a mentally ill fucked up person who was just about to get more help, and this is a nightmare. I take responsibility for being wrong and having behaved badly towards some, but they have torn my life apart and ripped my mind to shreds. Im going to have to leave my mom alone and afraid in a place and im so scared, but i gotta kill myself. And they will probably make me look like i was the worst person ever, due to things i said or did while literally not myself and either under the influence of chemicals or having a psychotic break with reality bevause of the main person who is in charge of my downfall.

He thinks im horrible and i dont care, when in truth, i always cared too much. Thats why life hurt so much to begin with. I dont see how he can watch me suffer so terribly and be happy about it and think he is in the right, or a good person. 

Ty for murdering me ahead of time. 

And, i thank any cold bastard in advance who gets off on peoples pain and suffering. 

You will know it one day too.
