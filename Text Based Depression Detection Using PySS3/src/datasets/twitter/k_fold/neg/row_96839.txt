Why is this so much work?I don't want to do it anymore. Every day is a struggle. I'm so, so tired. It feels like it's constantly one struggle to the next. "Everything will be better once /this/ happens" or "it will be okay once I get through /this/"... but there's always another obstacle. 
Honestly, the only thing that has really kept me from opting out of life is the obligation I feel to my mother. She has had a harder life than I have, and suffers from depression, as well. Growing up, my family always struggled financially. I always told myself that I would one day make enough money to make her life easier for whatever remaining years she has. Then, once she was comfortable and eventually passed away (she has always had awful health problems), I could finally let go. I've had this thought since I was probably around 10 years old. I'm 24 now. It always gave me a feeling of comfort - another "once /this/ happens, it will be okay". 
I always feel like I'm just going through the motions, like a zombie. The silly thing is, I have excelled through school, I've had great loves (while they lasted), and I'm considered rather attractive and talented. I have a lot going for me now, after digging myself out of the hole I was born into. But I'm SO TIRED. It's harder and harder for me to get out of bed. All I want to do is sleep, and when I'm awake, I have no motivation for life. I feel so pathetic after working so, so hard in life and yet I still feel empty.
I don't really have anyone to talk to about it. I'm not really looking for a solution or sympathy. I just need to vent, I guess.
I'm sick of working so hard with nothing to show for it - on the inside. On the outside, I'm doing great. On the inside, I feel dead.
