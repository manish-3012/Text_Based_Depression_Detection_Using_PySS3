I don't want to keep doing this.I told myself that I would make a final decision about commiting suicide on my thirtieth birthday, but I don't want to wait that long anymore. I am just tried. I've accepted that my life will not change. Not due to that lack of wonders in life or opportunities around me, but due to my nature and unwillingness to put effort into changing. I don't think I can take a lifetime of my current routine. 

I make comfortable money at a nine to five job I hate and my entire life revolves around it. I used to have a hobby to keep me occupied most evenings, but the virus closed that place down for good. Even before then I wanted to end it. 

I come from a big Mormon homeschool family, so I have a difficult time relating to people. In my friend groups I feel like I'm just tagging along. 

I won't go to college because I don't want debt and don't have the energy after work. I live in a coworkers basement and whenever I'm there I can hear them yelling at their kids. I try not to be there much.

I know it will hurt a lot of people, but I've started putting plans into action and preparing. The only thing I still need to do is figure out how to minimize the impact on the people around me.
