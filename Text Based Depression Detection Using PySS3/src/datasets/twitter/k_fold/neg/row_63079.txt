I can't do it anymoreI don't want to feel like this. I can't take it. I'm constantly miserable. It just hurts. And in addition to all the other things wrong with my life, to top it off I got in a fight with my SO and made him feel so awful he left the house. I'm worthless. I hate this. Nothing relieves the pain and pressure and agony and dread. I don't have friends or family, nothing makes me happy.
