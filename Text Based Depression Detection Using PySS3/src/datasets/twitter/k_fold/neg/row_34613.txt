I lost the opportunity of my life and lost my bestfriend all at the same time.Today, an hour ago, 2 things happened, 2 things that made me sure that I really want to end my life. I just lost a friendship of over 12 years because I'm egoistical and a trash human being, i made the person cry and i felt nothing. Also I've lost the biggest opportunity of my life financially talking, i was working with a guy for over a month and he was gonna invest a lot of money on my brand together with my friends, i had everything planned, i thought i was going to change my life and also change the life of my friends who was involved with it but i fucked up and now its over, he said my work ethic was trash and everything and said it was over.I've cried for the past hour, a lot, I now realize how egoistical i am, i dont find reasons to stay alive, i'll not have the motivation to wake up in the morning anymore, to do something. I've hurt so many people, i've always had mental breakdowns, i had depression years ago, i got hurt a lot, but it was just that, now im 100% sure i want to end my life, i have the courage to do it, i just need to get the money probably next month and i'll overdose on drugs, far away from where i live.
