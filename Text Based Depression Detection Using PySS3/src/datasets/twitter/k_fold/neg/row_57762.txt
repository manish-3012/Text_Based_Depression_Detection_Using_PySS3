First post. Bear with me please.(14 F)

So I've had bad suicidal thoughts for a while. I've self harmed almost 2 years now. I wrote a suicide note and I really thought I was gonna kill myself that night. My brother (older ofc) was home on his game, my mom was at work. I could just shut my door so the dogs don't get in. Easy. I could overdose. Or use my blade and slit my wrists. Fuck it. But I didn't. I just cried. That's all I ever seemed to do for the longest time. Cry. I cried for so long and talked to some people and held normal conversation just so I knew they had my back. I talked to my best friend and my girlfriend and listened to music. (P!atd - Vices &amp; Virtues) I've always had that lurking feeling. It's been better now, but I feel like today it just got worse. I'm writing here because I know people give support and maybe that's what I need. Support from strangers. Thanks for reading.
