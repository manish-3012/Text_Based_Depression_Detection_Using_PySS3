Someone to listen...I have several things that are leading me to suicide. And I need to put this out there and know that there are people out there that want to help.

I am a 38 yo self-loathing gay man. I have tried to be someone I am not for so long that I have lost track of who I am and who I wanted to be. If I ever really knew. I am in the grips of depression and am suicidal. I just need to know that it does in fact, "Get better."

I don't feel I have friends because I am not honest with people about who I am. Who would want to be friends with a liar?

I do not know how to make my life better. That's BS, I know I just can bring myself to do it. Accept who I am and move on. Sound easy right? It's not.

I plan on going to work in the morning, but this is a source of pain for me. I work in a small factory filled with Men. Men who are not comfortable with homosexuality.

There is one friend there, a sweetheart of a man who is straight, but was raised primarily by women so we get along well. He is 'slow' but one hell of a human being.  

There is a lot more but this is all I can do right now. I have to put my mask back on and go to work.

&lt;B&gt;TLDR:&lt;/B&gt; I'm gay and I hate myself for it. This self hate is killing me. I want there to be a group of mentally healthy gay people to swoop down and save my life. But I know healthy people do not want to be around sick people.

&lt;B&gt;TLDR: waas too long&lt;/B&gt; I just need someone to tell me things are going to be OK.
