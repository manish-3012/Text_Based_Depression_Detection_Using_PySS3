Goodbye friendMy friend was taken off life support a couple days ago. OD on some synthetic opiates. Ever since then I've felt sick to my stomach seeing his family on facebook. I don't have any energy and just wanna quit my job and quit school. The last few years of my life have already been just real dull. The only thing keeping me going is a new girl at work who seems interested in me, but to her I'm just some normal guy she has no idea how depressed I am and I'm scared to get close to her. Imagining her finding out makes me even more scared. Imagining that there's a good chance she won't be around to cheer me up in the future because I'll inevitably ruin things is the worst of all. Without her I really don't know what would motivate me. But she is all I look forward to. Just getting to go to work, see her, and laugh together. I'm not good with relationships and don't know how to progress things without ruining the one thing that makes me happy.

I got off topic a bit I guess. These past few nights it's been especially hard to fall asleep. I keep thinking of my friend dying especially since we're so young. I keep thinking how he must have felt when it was happening. I wonder if he knew he was dying. I wonder if he knew he was in a coma on life support. I wonder if he's in a better place now.


I'm sorry I'm ranting i have no one to talk too about any of this. I really just don't know what to do with myself anymore.
