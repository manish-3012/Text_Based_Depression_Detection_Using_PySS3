i want to kill myself but i'm too scared to do it or tell anyoneeveryday i think about killing myself. whenever i'm under too much pressure, i'm sad, i'm angry, i'm annoyed, or anything, i want to die. i daydream about suicide all the time. it's gotten to a point where i'm genuinely considering going upstairs and grabbing a bottle of tylenol and taking them all. i don't want to feel like this but i don't know how to stop. i feel like such a burden on everyone and nothing i do is right and i'll never be successful so what's the point of staying alive. i'm just existing. i wake up and roll out of bed to go to online school. i finish and do my homework. i eat and then i go to bed. it's the same thing every single day and i can't take it anymore. i want to tell my mom but she'll be so disappointed. she'll wonder where she went wrong with me and why i'm like this. please help me. i'm in so much pain. sorry this post is all over the place my mind is racing right now i'm freaking out and my face and hands are numb
