How long does it take to die from carbon monoxide poisoning?After living with depression for 3 years, and being suicidal on and off, I have decided to finally end it for real this time. There is nothing and nobody in this world that can save me, or would even want to. The only thing now is to find out how long it will take to die from the old Hose-in-exhaust method. Is it painful? Other than that. I, I have everything planned. I'm only 17 so I dont have much, except for some possessions that I'm going to bring to goodwill. Hopefully they will have more of a use than I do. Any advice is welcome
