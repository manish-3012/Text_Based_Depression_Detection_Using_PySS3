Its too much effort. but people care abut meA lot of people seem to be suicidal because they don't think/don't know people care about them. I am also busy looking at ways to kill myself, but they all seem to painful and in Australia its almost impossible to get access to a gun. Not sure what to do, ever time I hear about everything that I will need to do for my future and in the future seems like its way to much effort to even bother. I don't want to worry about mortgage and insurance, and fucking money, and crap I need but couldn't give a crap about. But I also don't want to go on the doll because I don't want to be a burden and a disappointment. so many conflicting things I just don't know what to do anymore. The only reason I live is because others need me, but living is becoming too much effort, but every time I even think about it all i can think of is my best friend in tears.
