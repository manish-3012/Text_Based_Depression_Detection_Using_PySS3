Goodbye, peace is comingI miss you 
I miss you every single day
I don't know why 
All you've done is hate me 
But still I loved you with all I had
You broke my trust once 
I forgave you once 
I forgave you twice 
You broke my trust every single time 
You left me at my lowest point 
To rot in my darkness 
You didn't care if I lived or I died
So guess what 
Tonight I will 
Hope you have a great life
