Just. why.Why did my ugly parents think it would be a good idea to have an ugly kid. Especially in todays society, where basically everything worthwhile in life revolves around how you look, how cool you are, and how much money that you have. Why do I have to walk through this actual hell while everyone around me lives in ignorant bliss. Getting to do and be what ever that they want. Did I do something horrible in a past life to deserve this?
All I wanted was to fit in...
Be the person that I wish I was in my mind.
As i've grown up, i've realized that it's impossible for me.
This hatred and depression has taken away every good thing about my personality and life. I literally can't look at my stupid face anymore.
I'll never be the person that I wanted to be or have the life that I wanted to have. I push people away because I feel I don't deserve them in my life, or to protect them..only few do i selfishly cling to, and i've just let them go because they deserve better than me and my problems.
I'm a loser.
I just want it to end...
I want to hold on. 
But I can't. I've been waiting all my life, and it doesn't get better for me.
I know people in my life try to be nice....but i'm not enough...and it just gets worse with time. I've tried the therapy, i've tried most of everything i can think of, and nothing helps. Every day is exactly the same...empty, depressing, meaningless...
I'm so very sorry to anyone I had to drag along in my shitshow of a life. You won't have to deal with me anymore. Don't even remember me, because I'm not worth it, and i probably hate myself more than you hate me. Go back to your normal routines.
I never felt this close to the edge. 
I hate typing this. I feel like such a waste of space, just a burden. I wish there was just a way to die without hurting the few people that care about you.
I don't want anyone to care anymore. I just want them to be happy, and i know they would be so much happier and successful without me. Everyone says suicide is a bad thing..but i mean...we're all going to die someday anyway.... in my case..it's kind of like I rented a movie, started watching it, it was really horrible, and I'd rather just turn it off then have to sit through the rest of it.
I guess I could hold on until I pass of old age...but it's with the knowledge that I'll be forever alone...with nothing worthwhile going on. Just a vegetable of a person with basic hobbies. I wouldn't want anyone in my life anyway....
dude just fuckkkk my life. I hate myself. I have no future. that's all.
