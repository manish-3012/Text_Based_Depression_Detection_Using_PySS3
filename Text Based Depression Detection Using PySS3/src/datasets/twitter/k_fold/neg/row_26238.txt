How to make that last â€˜pushâ€™ and just get it over with?I just turned 18 and I lost my family because of the hate my half sister and stepdad have toward me. I am planning to just â€˜disappearâ€™ because I really donâ€™t want to be here anymore, Iâ€™m just done already. How can I get over my small fears and just give the last final push and get it over with?
