Wish I had drugsI'm not one to have collected my thought beforehand, but I'm so depressed atm.  I wish I could afford some drugs to distract me from the rut I feel I'm in.  Already took more then my prescribed dose of my medications...  I'm poor and broke, always broke.  Always feeling looked down on because I can't stand grinding everyday of my life delivering food just to pay rent and afford a little drugs...  I'm fed up.  I'm about to find a heroin dealer and just overdose already...  My life is garbage and everyday is just waiting for better days...  So tired of this...  Wish I just had enough for one more good time but nah, not In my life....  For me, only suffering and the ability to make others happy...  Wish I wasn't such a coward and could just die already...  I already don't exist to most of you so what would it matter
