Strange thing about suicideI started seeing a psychologist to address with my tendencies that have grown since I found out that I am a subject of a serious police investigation that can ruin my life at age 36. My psychologist knows a part of me wants to die.

It's funny because I feel like a million bucks after talking to him but will not hesitate to off myself should I find out that I am going to go to jail. 

Weird, ain't it?
