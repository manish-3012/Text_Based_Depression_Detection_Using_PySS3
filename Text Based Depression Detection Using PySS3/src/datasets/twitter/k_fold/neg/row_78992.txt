IsolatedI am just so tired of feeling isolated. I have been this way for over half my life... Feeling like I live behind glass unless someone needs me for something. I thought this year would improve... I got a new job that turns out to be making things worse and my relationships with everyone in my life seem to be getting more distant. I am not allowed to express feelings at any point in my daily life. At work I have to look like I take everything in stride so that I can move to a different department in a few months that will be less abrasive. At home no one wants to deal with being inconvenienced by my feelings... but still expects me to be there fully for them. I keep trying to just shut down, put my feelings aside, and function on autopilot... it is just getting harder and harder to force.  The best I can manage is crying when I am alone so I don't bother anyone with it. I feel like I am blindly speeding toward a brick wall and I have no idea when or what will happen when I finally hit it.
