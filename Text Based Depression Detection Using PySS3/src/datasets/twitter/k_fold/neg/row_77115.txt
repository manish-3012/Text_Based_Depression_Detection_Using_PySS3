I'm just not feeling it anymore.I'm a 15 year old male who has been struggling with what seems like everything. I have a terrible time talking about it because it seems to me that I am complaining. I bottle up most or all of my stress inside myself and just can't get over my numerous shortcomings. As time passes, the girl whom I adore is slowly being courted by a friend, and all I can do is sit by and watch. I consider it daily but never found the courage to do it. But at the end of the day, what really pushes me is that so many people I know are counting on me for some support for their problems and they themselves are feeling it. I am not special because of who I am and probably never will be. Thank you for listening.
