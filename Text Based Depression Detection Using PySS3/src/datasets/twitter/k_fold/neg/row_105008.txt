I don't know what to do.I lost the only person I've ever loved a few months back. I was forced to move.  My utilities about to be turned off. I have no food. No one can help me. Negative bank account. Credits cards over a month late. I don't get paid till next Wednesday. I'm screwed. I'm so over it. I have a full time job that I with really hard but it's not enough to keep me a float.
