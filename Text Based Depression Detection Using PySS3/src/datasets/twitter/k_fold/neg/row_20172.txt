Someone talk to meI tried hanging myself and the length from the rope to the ground was close but it still caused me to choke for a sec and I almost got stuck and freaked out. I was trying to hang myself at the park tying the rope on a tree and I can't adjust the rope because it's too high now. I'm considering drinking a shit ton of alcohol, and get really drunk, like black out drunk and try to jump in deep water and kill myself that way by drowning. It's gotta be less terrifying and probably wouldn't be as painful compared to hanging. But obvious still pretty painful, just a little less. Help
