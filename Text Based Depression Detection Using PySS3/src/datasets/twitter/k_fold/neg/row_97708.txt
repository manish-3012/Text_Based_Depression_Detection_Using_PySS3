It has to be tonight, in under 6 hoursI think I'm going to have to end it tonight.
I don't want to live to tomorrow, as that means I'll have to go to my appointment with a psychiatrist for a diagnosis. I'm scared I've been faking all this the whole time, and they're just going to ridicule me.

I've had a loose plan in place for ages, and was hospitalised earlier this week for trying to go through with it, but this time I don't think I have a choice.
