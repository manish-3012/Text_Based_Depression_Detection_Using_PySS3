I don`t know how to deal with this anymoreIn advance, sorry for my bad english, itâ€™s not my first language.
24 male. 
My whole life i was "not good", barely kept above "iâ€™m comepletely fucked everything up" level. In school, in university and now at work.
For 5 years i am trying to deal with my anxiety problems.
This year hit me harder then any previous, and i think i got to my threshold.
Iâ€™m afraid to wake up in the morning, iâ€™m afraid to fall asleep, this constant feeling of fear is driving me crazy. 
Iâ€™m afraid i can lose my job, wich i really like. 
Recently i met this beautiful girl, but it feels like i will not be able to give her the life she deserves.
There is a chance that i can lose my home because of some stupid bank shit. 
Everywhere i look i see this images of people who found out how to live their lives. 
Everybody with whom i tried to talk,  said nothing but "Man up!", "Stop being a pussy" and "You just have nothing better to do didnâ€™t you?".
I feel pathetic, and donâ€™t believe that somebody can love such a mess of a guy as me. I was thinking about hanging myself for a month now, this is the longest period in which this thoughts are not leaving me for a moment. I tried to find some hotline phone number, but didn't manage to do so, since apperently my country doesnâ€™t have any. The only reason why i didnâ€™t yet did anything to myself is my mother, i love her very much and i understand that if i do what i want, this will completely destroy her life too. But seeing how everything is going for now, i`m afraid that i can lose control over myself.
