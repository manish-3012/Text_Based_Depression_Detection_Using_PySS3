I'm sick of being stuck in a rutI fucked up my first year of college, so now I can't get accepted anywhere. I work 3rd shift McDonalds. My dad's an asshole and is taking so much money from my mom that our house is being foreclosed on. I've been stuck in this channel for 3 years now. I'm not poor enough to get government help but no one in my family has enough money to help. I've had a really supportive girlfriend for the last 15 months, but she left me today, randomly, and is treating the ordeal like it's my problem. 

I'm sick of being stuck here. I can't find a nice enough job to get out, unless I go to college. I can't go to college because I fucked up my first year out of high school. I'm just costing my mom money she doesn't have, and now I have no one to lean on. My girlfriend was one of the last things keeping me grounded, but without that crutch, I just don't see the point. I can't imagine being here much longer. All I'm doing is sucking resources. It'd be easier on my family to have a one time cost of a funeral than support me without the guarantee of anything for I don't know how many more years.
