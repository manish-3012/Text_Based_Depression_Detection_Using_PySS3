Tonight, or maybe tomorrowI have wanted it to be over for ages. Food tastes like dust. The concern of others is irritating. The instence of the doc that "it gets better" reads like so much bullshit. I have no more little lies to tell myself to get myself out of bed in the weekend. I dont have it in me to go on and get "better", whatever that means. If its anything like losing weight I no longer have the capacity for that mental effort.

The train lines below are dark and quiet at night. A few more hours and I may go and lie down on one. Will be interesting what if anything comes next, if it isn't nothing
