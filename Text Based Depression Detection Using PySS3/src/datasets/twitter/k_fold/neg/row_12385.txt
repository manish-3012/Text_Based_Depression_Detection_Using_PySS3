Fucking broken man, I just couldn't do this anymore.This isn't a cry for help because ive already taken enough opiates to kill myself 3 times over. This is it man, this is what I've come to. Goodbye everyone. Keep your loved ones close. Take your mental health seriously, as well as others . Please, don't comment or try to stop me. What's done is done. Take care people.
