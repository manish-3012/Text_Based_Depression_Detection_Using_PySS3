I hate having aspergersI hate being different, I hate being misunderstood, I hate being considered "non-human" because I don't have the best social skills, I just want my tragic life to end, I'm sorry I was born with a form of autism, I didn't choose it, but I'll solve it if I can kill myself sometime next year, I hate feeling like a monster for having a defect.
