CuriosityIâ€™ve recently read that you donâ€™t have to be hopeful about the future, just curious, and thatâ€™s enough. Iâ€™ve felt that way for a long time.  However, Iâ€™ve come to realize that Iâ€™m no longer curious. My thirst for knowledge and whatâ€™s to come has almost completely dissipated. The only reason why Iâ€™m still here is much like others, I just donâ€™t want to hurt my family. But Iâ€™ve already found myself to be slowly cutting off friends from my life. I think it will happen this year, I just donâ€™t have a set date yet. As disheartened as I feel now, Iâ€™d still like to read something good. So, what has made you happy as of late?  Proud? Calm? Etc.

Thanks for reading.
