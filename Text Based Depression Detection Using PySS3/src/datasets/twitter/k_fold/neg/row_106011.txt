Life is Fine? So, I was doing some homework today and I had to annotate this poem for my literature class and I completely forgot about the poem. I read it over and it was a poem about suicide. It was written by Langston Hughes and he describes of how he tried to drown himself and tried to jump off a high building but he kept resisting the will to die.

I thought at first it was because of the biological point of view, where all beings are registered for survival and perseverance. However, I looked at the literal meaning more closely and he wanted to live all along. He thought about his child before taking the swim or drown. He was about kill himself over love. However, he stated in the last two stanzas that since he's born anyway, he's going to continue living no matter how hard life gets. 

His message is that everyone has problems, but there is always an alternative solution to face and solve these problems. Now, I'm a very depressed and suicidal person myself, but, is this really an accurate message and coping mechanism to resist depression and suicide? Realistically, just "living" doesn't really solve anything. The author also says "Life is fine as wine!", but what if life is the most bitter and gloomy thing you've ever tasted and experienced?

Eh, just pondering right now.
