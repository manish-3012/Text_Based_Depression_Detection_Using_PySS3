Miss the feeling of relief I got from contemplating suicide.I've got kids, and that truly keeps me from killing myself. But I used to have a sick sense of comfort knowing that I had the option to kill myself if things got too much to handle. I used to tell myself, I can kill myself anytime, so why not try this or do that and see if it gets better. It got better for a min, I slipped and got my now ex GF preggo(she did it on purpose) and now shit got bad but I don't have an exit strategy.
