I just got released from the psych ward for 3 days from being suicidal and now Iâ€™m suicidal again. Wtf do I do?I just got released 2 days ago. And now Iâ€™m feeling suicidal. Iâ€™m having this strong urge to do some heavy drugs to overdose on but I donâ€™t have access to it. So Iâ€™m just crying the pain out. 

Wtf do I do? I dont have the motivation for anything. It feels like my brain isnt releasing those feel good chemicals. I feel so apathetic.
