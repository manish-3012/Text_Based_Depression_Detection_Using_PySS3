Iâ€™m so tired of thisI have totally lost the energy to fight this anymore. Since my last attempt I have tried my best for a decade to push these feelings back behind personal goals and flimsy reasons to carry on, but for what. Iâ€™m just so tired of fighting myself in this zero sum game.

If anyone would like to share legitimate reasons to continue in this dreadful simulation Iâ€™d love to hear them, cause my reason jar is empty.
