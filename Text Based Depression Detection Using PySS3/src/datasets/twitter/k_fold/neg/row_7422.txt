I just want him to care.tw, talk about self harm

My boyfriend and I have been arguing recently and I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself. Iâ€™m trying my hardest in this relationship but we just keep fighting and I know the answer is to just break up but I donâ€™t have the strength to go through a breakup. If we broke up I feel like I would just end it. He has a history of self harm but he stopped years ago. I hurt myself sometimes and I do it out of sadness and because I feel like I need to, not for attention, but sometimes I want attention for them. I want him to see them and hold me and tell me to stop but he doesnâ€™t. He sees them and ignores them. It makes me so sad. I need him to hold me and tell me everythingâ€™s okay. He wonâ€™t give me that. Sometimes weâ€™ll argue and itâ€™ll get so bad that Iâ€™m crying and just sobbing that I want to die, help me I want to die. He thinks itâ€™s for attention. Maybe it is. I do want to die, but if I didnâ€™t want the attention I guess Iâ€™d just do it without saying anything. I didnâ€™t just say I wanted to die during a fight for no reason though. Weâ€™ve sat down and Iâ€™ve told him that I was planning to kill myself. I wasnt threatening him with killing myself, I wasnâ€™t guilting him. I just told him and he didnâ€™t seem to care. No one cares. I showed all the signs; I gave some of my stuff away, I suddenly seemed happier (by this I mean that people who are going to commit suicide seem happier because all their problems will go away soon). No one noticed. I just want him to hold me and say that everythingâ€™s okay and that I shouldnâ€™t kill myself because he needs me, why canâ€™t he do this for me? Itâ€™s all I want.
