It gets better (fo' real).I was 17 when i attempted suicide. I believed that my life was meaningless, that there was no point in going on living. I had dealt with suicidal ideation and self-harm for quite a while at that point.

I know it sucks to hear people say 'it gets better' over and over and over. Hell, I'm pretty sick of that myself. Life continues to be hard; there will always be challenges and there will always be times when you feel like there's no way out. But they get fewer and further between with every day that goes by. I really, really, really hate to say it, but it does get better.

How it starts to get better:

It gets better when you talk to someone. When you post here, you open yourself up to people who really, really want to help you. So it seems to me like you've already taken one step towards things getting better.

It gets better when you seek professional help. This isn't easy. Seeing a counsellor is tough; when I first started going, it was to a lady named Mrs. Peacock (for real. Peacock. What the fuck.). I told her I was feeling suicidal, and somehow she landed on me suffering from light sensitivity syndrome. not very helpful. The next guy I went to was after my suicide attempt, and he was amazing. He was this old dude that I could talk to about anything, regardless of whether it was related to my recovery or not. We talked about music, about sports, about whatever the fuck we wanted to. That's the kind of professional help that is the most beneficial, in my opinion. The kind where you can go in, work on what you feel you need to work on, vent about what you need to vent about, or just talk about Eddie Vedder for an hour. What I'm trying to say is shop around.

It gets better when you feel awake when you wake up. When I was at my lowest point, I would refuse to get of bed. When I did, it was like walking through this hazy shit. I would go to school only to skip to play games on the computers or smoke. After seeing a (good) counsellor for a while, I wouldn't refuse to get out of bed. I would still skip class though. After even longer, I wouldn't refuse to get out of bed, and would actually go to class. I would occasionally dip out for a smoke, though. Cigrits are tricky little fuckers.

It gets better when you start to smile. not that fake ass shit we all have to do when we say hi to our cousins or friends. The kind of smile that comes out of nowhere. The kind which is like FUCK YOU BRAIN I'M SMILING! SEE THESE TEETH? SEE THESE FUCKING TEETH YOU DEPRESSED GREY MATTER MOTHERFUCKER? FUCK YEAH!

It gets better when you stop caring about how you look, who you hang out with, what your parents think of you, and what people at school think of you.

It gets better when you feel like you make progress with your counsellor.

It gets better when you can listen to depressing music and feel happy, because you know that you were able to kick the SHIT out of depression and anxiety.


ALSO: In case you were wondering, you've already done some pretty awesome stuff. 

- You wiped your own ass at one point. That's shit is bad ass. Do you have any idea how close your hands are to your shit when you wipe?

- You learned how to ride a bike. You were all like 'fuck this shit, I'm using wheels, not feet. Feet are for pussies.'

- Remember that time you jacked off and your parents didn't catch you? That was some stealthy shit.

- You learned how to tie your shoes. Those laces were all tangled and shit but you were like NOT IN THIS BITCH. BAM! RABBIT EARS!

- You lost some teeth. Pieces of your head fell off, man. PIECES OF YOUR HEAD.

- Most importantly, you came to this subreddit, which means that you are in a safe, loving community full of people who've been there and want to help you.

**tl;dr:** I don't know you, but you are amazing and I love each and every single thing about you.
