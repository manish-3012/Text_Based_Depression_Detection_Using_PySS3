I'm not certain why but I want to dieI would not say that I've been dealt a poor hand in life. I'm an upper middle class American with very good health and loving family members. I have a good social life with multiple people who support me and care deeply for me. I have a girlfriend, and though she can be a bit distant and we've had our rough years, I love her incredibly much. My brain works fine, and I have plenty of potential for a successful career in my future.

In spite of all this, I'd much rather be dead than alive.

It all just feels meaningless. Everything I do on this earth will wither away. The physical world offers no consolation. Only short, vain ventures that grant me pleasure which always fades. And no matter who I am or what I do, it always seems like the sadness outweighs the joy. I'm terrified for when my loved ones will die. I don't want to lose the physical pleasures that I have. Where is the happiness that is not fleeting? Where can I find life?

I don't know what anyone else can say to me at this point that will keep me going.

Everything is nothing, and I want to give up.
