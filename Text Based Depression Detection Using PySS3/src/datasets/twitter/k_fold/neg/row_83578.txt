I feel like I'm always living for other people.First it was for my parents. Then my girlfriend. Then my next girlfriend. Now my boyfriend. If I were to die, he'd struggle. He'd be sad and beat himself up for it. He loves me so much.

But it's never for myself. I'm not living for myself. I'm so selfish. I should be dead. I waste resources. I'm a waste of time, effort, money, love. People don't get back what they put in me. I'm like a malfunctioning vending machine. That's kinda funny.
