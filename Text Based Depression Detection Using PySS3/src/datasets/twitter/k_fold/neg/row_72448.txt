I'm glad my d day is approaching. I feel a huge relief.I set myself a challenge 3 years ago to get out of my stupid situation and positively change my life, or end it. I failed. I am glad I now have some clarity and I feel comfortable considering death. I don't feel sad. A few more months to clear my financial obligations and my biggest problem will be how to die the less messier way. I don't think that Assisted Dying in Canada offer their help for mental illness, I'll have to check. I think that societies should head out of their asses and stop selling life(tm) already. More than 3/4 of the people living in developing countries, many of them ruthless and ignorant theocracies, are fed the BS that killing yourself will lead you to hell, given the choice, will happily die, saving precious resources for those who can afford financially and emotionally to live. Probably 10% to 15% same story in developed countries. Life is insulting for those who can't. Just to keep the life entertainement going. Realizing this make me so sad. I would have killed myself at 16 and I stupidly believed the hype. my next 35 years was a slow and steady journey in hell. I know I will have some peace soon, and this makes me feel...good. But still, no easy way to get out. so stupid.
