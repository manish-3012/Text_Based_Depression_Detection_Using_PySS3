AMA I tried to commit suicide and am living a "good" life now...I tried to take my life one year ago and am now living a "normal" life with no pills and no therapy.  I have come a good way on learning how to deal with depression and all the other bullshit life has thrown at me figured if anyone here has any questions on how to cope with it i might be able to help before you take the plunge and hurt yourself. It's not worth it.  http://imgur.com/a/RAxjq
