Here we go againI've been depressed all my life and I'm only 14 and it's only getting worse I've tried every therapy in the book and I'm on anti depressants that make me a condescending jerk to everyone and I hate all the people in my school who make fun of me because of the way I dress. I have a girlfriend but shes also going through issues probably worse than mine I'm a disappointment I dont even deserve to be called a man I dont deserve anything im just some flesh with a brain really.
