This world wasnâ€™t designed for someone like meIâ€™ve decided Iâ€™m ready to go after two failed hanging attempts over the last decade. Iâ€™ll be purchasing a gun and blowing my brains out in the woods near the New River Gorge where nature can reclaim my remains.

Iâ€™m a pregnant trans male who is on the spectrum, chronically suicidal, C-PTSD, and going through a divorce from someone with antisocial personality disorder (he cheated and ran off with a real woman when I stopped being a trophy wife). Iâ€™ve been formally disowned by my narcissist mother and Iâ€™m considered a family secret by almost everyone else. There are few jobs in the state which I live and little hope of escaping the economic depression. 

To put it simply Iâ€™m exhausted and will set a date for my suicide once my child is born and safe. It will provide enough time to put affairs in order and make sure the funeral is planned out. Knowing my kid will never know me or know pain when I pass helps. I wish I could be there for them, but they deserve better.

I canâ€™t continue fighting in a world that just doesnâ€™t want people such as myself in it. Nor do I want my child to be exposed to suffering, my depression, or face intense prejudice by proxy and end up resenting me.

The revolver Iâ€™m picking out is strangely comforting. Thereâ€™s literally no other way out of this and Iâ€™m ready to accept death on my own terms late this fall. Sometimes it is okay to give up and rest.
