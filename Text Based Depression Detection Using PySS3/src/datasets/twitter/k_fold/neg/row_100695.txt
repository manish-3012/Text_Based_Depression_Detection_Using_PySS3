i relapsed, and i'm scaredover the past few years, i've made strides in therapy and personal growth and learning how to cope with my depression/anxiety. i even worked up the courage to estrange from my narcissistic mother.

i went from thinking about killing myself multiple times a day to thinking of it maybe once a week.. and lately, all of those thoughts have just flooded back in.

because this year is the fucking worst. america is the fucking worst. i was supposed to graduate college, move out of this hellhole state, and experience some ounce of freedom for once in my life. and now i just feel fucking stuck. i don't think i have the motivation or the strength to fight this anymore. i sense my expiration date is nearing soon.
