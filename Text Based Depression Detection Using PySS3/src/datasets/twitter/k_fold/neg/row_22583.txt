Just spoke to a suicidal friendI don't know if this is the right place to go, but I'm not too sure where to turn. I just spoke to one of my best friends who has just split up with his girlfriend after roughly 4 years (the first serious one of his life). We're both pretty young (17 y/os) so not only does he have little experience with this sort of pain, but I have little experience with dealing with helping him out in this case.
He's considering committing suicide (I know he considered committing suicide before he had this girlfriend). He also told me that his grandmother (who he is very close to) may have lung cancer, which is also causing further distress to him. He told me he wanted to get out of the country and just get away from everything. I tried to assure him that life would look better in the future, but I'm really not sure what to do. This is where you come in. Advice would be very welcome.
