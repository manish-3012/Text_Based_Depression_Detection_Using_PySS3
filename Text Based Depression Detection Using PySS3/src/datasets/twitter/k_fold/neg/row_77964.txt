Been fantasizing suicide attemptsI keep on fantasizing different suicide attempt scenarios. The main one is cutting deep vertically in my wrist. I think of the suicide attempt failing and how people would react to the news. Would people go silent when I walked near them? Would they whisper about me and tell me to try again? Would everybody act like nothing happened? Another suicide attempt Iâ€™ve fantasized is attempting to hang myself, but once again, failing. Then the same questions from last time. But the cutting suicide attempt is the one I fantasize about the most. I try to stay away from thinking about what would happen if I was successful since I wouldnâ€™t be alive to see how people reacted. I donâ€™t know, I highly doubt Iâ€™d kill myself in those ways. The way I plan to off myself is by overdosing.
