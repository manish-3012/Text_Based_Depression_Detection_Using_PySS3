I woke up this morning and just started crying.Not the kind of casual crying that I do a lot where there are silent tears that start and stop on and off for a few hours. The loud, painful sobs where it's hard to breathe because everything is too much. 

Nothing even happened to cause this. I just woke up. And suddenly I just felt the crushing pain of having to be alive, to exist, to be awake and conscious of my loneliness and worthlessness. I feel sick to my stomach. 

I just want to die so badly. All of the little things that have kept me alive thus far are either evidently impossible or else people who clearly don't care about me. My plan is to try to make it until the end of the year to see if I can get anything to change but I'm starting to feel I won't even be able to make it until then. 

I knew this week long break where I would be sitting around and doing nothing would be awful, but it's somehow even worse than I thought it would be. I just needed to vent I guess.
