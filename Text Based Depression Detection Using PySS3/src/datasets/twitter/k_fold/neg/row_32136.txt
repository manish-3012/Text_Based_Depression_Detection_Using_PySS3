QuestionI suffer from crohn's disease, bipolar, and ankylosing spondylitis. Went through a divorce a year ago. Since then I've lost my job and child support has emptied my bank account a number of times. About to lose my house and everything else I own. My utilities get shut off almost daily, I'm actually tethering from my phone to post this.  I have a 3 year old daughter which as so far prevented me from taking my life. But I suffer all day, everyday.

I was lucky enough to buy a 12 gage shotgun online and picked it up today, along with some shells before child support had garnished the money. I've given up on life, honestly nothing sounds fun or interesting anymore and hasn't for a years. I'm actually ok with giving up. I thought picking up the shotgun today would be hard and emotional, but I felt a huge sense of relief and was calm.

How can I tell my daughter why I'm doing what I'm doing? I don't want her to hate me forever.
