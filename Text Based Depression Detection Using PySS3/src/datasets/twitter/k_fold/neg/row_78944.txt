Family courts failed me. Suicide is the answer.I told my daughters mother today I give up. You win. You wanted to keep Anastasia away from me and you accomplished it for eight years. Shes eleven years old now. With no idea who I am. The courts refuse to do anything citing no jurisdiction in Pennsylvania. She wasn't supposed to leave without my consent. But they don't care. Nobody cares. I sway in front of the oncoming train. When you hear my name on the evening news tell my daughter I was thinking about her in my final moments.
