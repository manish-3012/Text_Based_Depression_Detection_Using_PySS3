Dear future wife...Hey... How are you doing right now? Are you feeling as lonely as I am? Or are you happy in the arms of another man? I hope it's the latter...

I'm sorry I couldn't stay for you. I'm sorry that I have to go before ever even meeting you. I'm not really sure what you would've looked like, sounded like... Felt like... But it's ok. I know I would've loved you till my last breath. And I will. My last breath will be in this car, but I doubt suicide by exhaust works... I have my pistol still...

Maybe fate wanted us to be together. But it's that same fate that gave me such a miserable, lonely, crippling sad life.

I know I would've done anything to see you smile. To make you happy. I truly hope that the guy that's in your fate once I'm gone will love like I should've. I hope to God that he loves you unconditionally, forever and that your happiness matters more to him than it does to me. I will make God make your life the happiest it can be, and I'm willing to put my pistol to the lord's own head if need be.

I want you to be happy. Because I couldn't be. I'm sorry darling. 

I hope you'll be happy without me.

A
