Does your mindset when you dream depict reality?I just had this dream where I was taken a hostage and had a gun pointed directly to my head. I thought I would be afraid but when I thought back to all the pain that I am going through, I was actually relieved and smiling? I was happy that things were going to end. Then I woke up back into the harsh reality of life and I was sad that it was just a dream. 

Why can't any of this happen to me in real life? Why do accidents happen to every one but me?
