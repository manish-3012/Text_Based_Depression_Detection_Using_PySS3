PTSD Anyone?Im 26, married and just medically retired from the USAF for combat related injurys. Im  not sure if this is the correct reddit board to post on or not, but i was wondering if there are any other veterans on here with PTSD. Its hard sometimes, and i get really angry and worry about alot of things, littlestuff like money and such when i know i have enough right now, or going to fairs and such because of how many people. Even in my own home i keep a loaded gun and constantly wake up in the middleof the night to the slightest sound. The only real sleep i have been getting is when i know my wife is awake and walking around the house.
