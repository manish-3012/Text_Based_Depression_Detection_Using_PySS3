I canâ€™t stop thinking about my friends deathmy best friend passed away from a heroin overdose back in June, but the funeral was 3 days before my birthday in July... the only thing i have left from him is his sweatshirt and till this day I havenâ€™t stopped wearing it. iâ€™ve had countless dreams of experiencing the overdose although i wasnâ€™t physically there to see it (he was a state away from me at college). and iâ€™ve had dreams about walking by him but in the dream iâ€™ve complained he never visits me spiritually. iâ€™ve seen counselors about my troubles but, i feel hopeless and no longer trust them since i found out they just wanted my money. he was so close to me and i regret the times we fought and stopped being friends for a while. i also regret not talking to him a week before he died.
