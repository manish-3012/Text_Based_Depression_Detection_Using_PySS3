i wish my past attempts had workediâ€™ve been suicidal ever since i was 15, and iâ€™ve made 2 â€œofficialâ€ attempts, and have had countless close calls. dying now would be so complicated... i have an apartment under my name, 2 cats, and my boyfriend who live with me. i truly wish i had died in my past attempts because it would have been much easier. i know iâ€™m loved by my family, my boyfriend, and my friends, but i absolutely despise myself. i was homeschooled my entire life, but my parents didnâ€™t put any effort into our education, so iâ€™m very far behind my peers. i have zero motivation to put in the hard work to actually change my life. i have experienced so much trauma, i donâ€™t know how to heal. i donâ€™t want to necessarily die, i just want the never ending pain to stop. i wish my brain would allow me to feel happy. i wish my brain didnâ€™t constantly try to sabotage me. iâ€™m a delivery driver, and each time i get into my car, i pray i get into a fatal accident. dying in an accident would be much easier on my loved ones than knowing it was by my own hand. i attempted suicide last year (before i had my cats, and before i met my boyfriend) and i genuinely felt like i looked death in the face, but survived anyways. i was so close. i donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, and i know dying at this point in life would destroy those who i love.... if only it had happened a few years ago, you know? i try and make the best of being alive, and i try to do well for myself, and my lil family, but i feel like a fraud.
