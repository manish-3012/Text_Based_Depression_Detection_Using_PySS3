Ready to die.I was too sad to get drunk. So my friend, who was supposed to comfort me tonight, left to get drunk with her aunt and left me alone. Nobody wants to fucking be around me. Why should I even stay? I'm just a fucking crazy. Nobody needs me. And nobody wants me. I don't fucking care anymore. Tomorrow I'm killing myself.
