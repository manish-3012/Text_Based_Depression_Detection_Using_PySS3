i miss having someone to cry withi used to have someone in my life who would cry just because they saw me crying and i miss that so much ha. now i just cry alone in the dark and it makes me cry even more. i just want somebody to care about me that much again but no one does and sometimes i feel like no one ever will again but maybe that'd be for the best i mean at least nobody would have to waste their time with a paranoid idiot like me. I'm still pretty young though so maybe I'll be fine. i never feel like i will though.
