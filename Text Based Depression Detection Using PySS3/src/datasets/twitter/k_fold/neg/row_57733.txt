How do I know if I'm suffering from depression?So, how do I know if I'm suffering from depression? I really want to know because I'm:
1) Crying everyday (2 times).
2) I don't feel good anymore.
3) I don't want to do anything (even with my family).
4) I think I'm a ducking loser.
5) And I just want to commit suicide to end my ducking horrible life...
