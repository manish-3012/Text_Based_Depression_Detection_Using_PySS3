The only thing keeping me alive is musicI just can't go to school, lie in my bed and listen to music whilst crying. Then repeat and repeat. An endless cycle of boredom and meaninglessness. My depression has caused me to be a jerk to those close to me, so my family hates me, I don't have to worry about them missing me. Suicide seems like the only rational option
