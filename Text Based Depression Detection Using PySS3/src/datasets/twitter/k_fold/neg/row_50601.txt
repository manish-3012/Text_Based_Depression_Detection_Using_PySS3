I want someone to accept my decision.So I'm in an interesting position. I'm not depressed, I'm not even sad. I'm sure most people would be quite content in my current position. Hower I am not, I spent my entire life looking for meaning and trying to understand how the world worked. I aked every philosophical question I could think and used logic to come to a specific conclusion. Well about 3 months ago I ran out of questions to ask. I discovered and more importantly understood the meaning to life. There is no objective meaning to life which is kinda depressing. We have to create our own artificial meaning and be happy. I can't accept this, the world has let me down and I see no reason to go on. I would like to just die by natural causes but I know that's not going to happen any time soon. So I'm strongly considering just ending it now and possibly answering the last true question. The reason I haven't so far is because of a girl and the affect she has on me. That affect is coming to end though and I'm coming closer to the end now. I want people to understand my thoughts for whatever reason and I guess I'd like to hear your thoughts on why I shouldn't commit suicide. But I should tell you a lot of the things that are normally said wont work. I need to a real factual reason to live.
