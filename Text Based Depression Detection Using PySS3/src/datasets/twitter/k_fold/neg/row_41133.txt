24/7 feeling like I'm about to collapseBeen dealing with depression and suicide thoughts for about a year. And honestly i don't know what to do anymore. I am useless, I'm not good at doing anything. I lost my interest in all my hobbies, they don't bring me joy anymore. Also how fucked up can my brain be if i used to be fascinated by science, math and ultimately dreamt of becoming a scientist or researcher, when i got learning disabilities and i can barely understand such things. Also I just wan't to move the fuck out of here alone to a place where nobody knows me and can't judge me.
