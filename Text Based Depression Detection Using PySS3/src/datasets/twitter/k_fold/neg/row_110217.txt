For those who don't feel lovedFor those of you who do not feel loved. For those of you who have been hurt by every single person in your life who have never even possibly had a taste of what unconditional love feels like. I want to tell you that it does exist. I have only tasted it, I was drowned by it. Unfortunately I cannot carry it with me as a human as I walk through this journey called life. I cannot even and do not have a reservoir for it for myself. However, I want you all to know and I love you all there are moments in which I embrace all of you I feel your pain I feel your excitement and I feel you and I love you so deeply and I wish you all could have the greatest most wonderful experiences possible for all eternity. That continues to be my wish and then made it from deepest parts of my self.  I do not claim to know but I Ponder and I wonder. I think to myself if any of you do kill yourselves don't feel guilt. Don't worry, don't hate yourself don't feel bad. Love yourself and understand that your pain is real and you did not deserve it. No matter what you've done I don't care how many horrible acts you've committed you deserve complete and total unconditional love and I truly believe you will receive it. If it were in my power if I had it, if I had an unlimited supply of unconditional love I would spread it to all of you. Without question. You would not have to explain yourself you would not have to come and shed a tear or tell me your sins or your regrets it would merely be given to you because you deserve it because I wish for you to experience seamless and unconditional love that I felt that moment and time in my life. No matter what you've done no matter what gruesome crimes you have committed or not committed. No matter what faults you may have had that you find unacceptable or horrific.  I forgive you. And this for sandwich I felt more powerful beyond anything I could even describe or contemplate or even conceptualize loves you absolutely unconditionally. This coming from Human however a human that is felt something greater than what can be translated through this vessel. And those of you that are suicidal I am too. I feel your pain I understand you.  I know how you feel.  I want you to know that I believe that you are unconditionally loved and will always be for all eternity.   Of course I know this for a fact absolutely nothing you do is your fault. And you will be and are already forgiven. Love yourself, try to.  I know it's the hardest thing to do but try. And loving yourself, expressing love to yourself... It comes in various forms sometimes unfamiliar.  But whatever form that takes, you'll know in your heart.
