My Contribution to HumanityJust hear me out please


Life on earth has been around for (at least) 3.9 billion years. Let that sink in. 

Every single individual in my ancestral lineage has managed to reproduce and pass on genetic information to their progeny, allowing each generation to be more suitable than the last. Against all odds, each of my ancestorsâ€”no matter their form of lifeâ€”has done their single, most basic, fundamental duty: procreate. 

But then there is me, the terminus.

I will be the first individual in my direct ancestral lineage who will fail to do what all those before me have done. I will not give rise to the next generation. I will usher in the end of 4 billion years of continuity.

So because of this and after much thought, I have realized there is only one remaining way for me to contribute to humanity... I will need to remove my unsuitable genes from the gene pool so that I donâ€™t compromise the viability of future generations. 

My genes are a threat to the welfare of our species. I did not choose for things to be this way. Unfortunately, I have failed by convention but I do hope to make it up to all of you by taking one for the team. Please just know Iâ€™m trying to help you all and I just want to do my part in the grand play that is Life. 

Note: I am really not interested in hearing anyone tell me that reproduction is not all important or that Iâ€™m thinking about biology too much. I really donâ€™t think anything Iâ€™ve said is necessarily incorrect.
