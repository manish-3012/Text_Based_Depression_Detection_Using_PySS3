I will try the charcoal method today.I'm tired of this. I just need to vent, to tell someone that I'm doing it and it will happen.
I had enough of this world, of my "family" and all the s**t that is everywhere in this world.
All I wanted was to be happy, to lead my own life, and take care of myself. I studied nursing for years, then did the course for free, graduated, and only sent fucking rÃ©sumÃ©s, and never even got a response! (TWO YEARS DOING THIS! EVERYONE THAT STUDIED WITH ME GOT A JOB BY SENDING RESUMEES TO THE SAME ADRESSES AS ME, BUT GIVING ME A CHANCE? NOOOOO, HE HAS TO SUFFER!)
ENOUGH! 
I just wanted to help myself, help people, help them heal, improve, and by consequence, help myself too.
But I've had enough. This crap of a world doesn't want me? Great, I don't want to live in it too. 
(I also have autism, bpd and anxiety)
Enough.
