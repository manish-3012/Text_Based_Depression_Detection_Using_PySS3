This is itHey all. Just gonna post here because I can't keep my thoughts bottled up anymore. I'm giving up. I was originally giving myself until the end of the year to fix myself but I've now realized I'm beyond fixing. I had one person left in my life that was keeping me alive. And for months my stupid brain has been telling me to push them away so that I can finally kill myself but I had always tried to fight it. Well last night my stupid brain/anxiety won. I'm done going to the psychologist. I'm done taking my meds. I thought they were helping but I came to realization that they are not. I've finally admitted to myself that everyone in my life would be better off with me dead. My mom, my sister, and pretty much anyone I've ever gotten close to. I denied it for months but I can't deny it anymore. All I've ever wanted was to make other people happy but all I can do is hurt people. So I think it's time to call it quits. I don't have a plan or anything for how I'm going to end it, but hopefully I can figure that out soon. Hopefully with me off my meds I can just go for it without much thought. So yeah you might see me around for a bit after this but hopefully not for too long. Oh and please, please, please don't try and stop me. I can't get better. I can only make others worse. This is the best option for everyone.
